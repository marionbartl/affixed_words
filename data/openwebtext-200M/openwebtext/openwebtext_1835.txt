I 'm delighted to announce the release of pyjamas 0.1 .
Pyjamas is a toolkit and library designed to enable writing AJAX applications in Python .
It is based on Google 's GWT which does the same thing for Java .
The pyjamas home page is at http://pyjamas.pyworks.org/
The goal for 0.1 was to get the GWT examples all mostly working on Firefox .
Thanks to Willie Gollino and Vicente J. Ruiz Jurado for making that possible .
UC Berkeley Press Release
Researchers convert heat to electricity using organic molecules , could lead to new energy source
– Researchers at the University of California , Berkeley , have successfully generated electricity from heat by trapping organic molecules between metal nanoparticles , an achievement that could pave the way toward the development of a new source for energy .
The discovery , described in a study published today ( Thursday , Feb. 15 ) in Science Express , an electronic publication of the journal Science , is a milestone in the quest for efficient ways to directly convert heat into electricity .
Currently , the dominant method of power generation involves burning fossil fuels to create heat , often in the form of steam , to spin a turbine that , in turn , drives a generator that produces electricity .

An estimated 90 percent of the world 's electricity - from power plants to car engines - is created through this indirect conversion of heat .
In the process , a great deal of heat is wasted and released .
Anyone who has ever had a car engine fail because of a malfunctioning radiator has experienced firsthand this excess heat .
" Generating 1 watt of power requires about 3 watts of heat input and involves dumping into the environment the equivalent of about 2 watts of power in the form of heat , " said Arun Majumdar , UC Berkeley professor of mechanical engineering and principal investigator of the study .
" If even a fraction of the lost heat can be converted into electricity in a cost - effective manner , the impact it would have on energy can be enormous , amounting to massive savings of fuel and reductions in carbon dioxide emissions . "
Unfortunately , the temperature at which the heat is released is too low to be effectively used by traditional heat engines .
For the past 50 years , utilizing this wasted heat has been a major focus of research into thermoelectric converters , which employ a simpler , more direct method of generating electricity .
Such converters rely upon the Seebeck effect , a phenomenon in which a voltage is created when the junctions of two different metals are kept at different temperatures .
However , such thermoelectric generators operate at a paltry 7 percent efficiency , compared with the 20 percent efficiency rate for traditional heat engines .
Moreover , such converters are made up of exotic , expensive metal alloys , such as bismuth and tellurium , making them too costly and impractical for widespread use .
The new UC Berkeley study marks the first time the Seebeck effect has been measured in an organic molecule , laying the groundwork for the development of more cost - effective thermoelectric converters .
" The goal is to make things out of materials that are more abundant and more easily processed , " said study co-author Rachel Segalman , UC Berkeley assistant professor of chemical engineering .
" Organics are cheap and can be processed easily . "
The researchers coated two gold electrodes with molecules of benzenedithiol , dibezenedithiol or tribenzenedithiol , then heated one side to create a temperature differential .
For each degree Celsius of difference , the researchers measured 8.7 microvolts of electricity for benzenedithiol , 12.9 microvolts for dibezenedithiol , and 14.2 microvolts for tribenzenedithiol .
The maximum temperature differential tested was 30 degrees Celsius ( 54 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
" The effect may seem quite small now , but this is a significant proof of concept , and the first step in organic molecular thermoelectricity , " said Pramod Reddy , a graduate student in UC Berkeley 's Applied Science and Technology Program and co-lead author of the paper .
" We are going down the road of cheap thermoelectric materials . "
The next step for the researchers includes testing different organic molecules and metals , as well as fine tuning the assembly of the structure .
Majumdar said the field of organic thermoelectricity could open doors to a new , inexpensive source of energy .
" The use of inexpensive organic molecules and metal nanoparticles offers the promise of low - cost , plastic - like power generators and refrigerators , " he said .
Majumdar and Segalman both hold faculty scientist positions at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory .
Majumdar is also a faculty affiliate in the California Institute for Quantitative Biomedical Research ( QB3 ) and the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society ( CITRIS ) .
The other co-lead author of the paper is Sung - Yeon Jang , who did the research while he was a UC Berkeley post - doctoral researcher in chemical engineering .
This research was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy , the National Science Foundation and the Berkeley - ITRI Research Center .
The Industrial Technology Research Institute , or ITRI , is a large research organization in Taiwan that is collaborating with UC Berkeley on nano - energy innovation .
The good news is that we know more about the economics of health care than we did when Clinton tried and failed to remake the system .
There ’s now a large body of evidence on what works and what does n’t work in health care , and it ’s not hard to see how to make dramatic improvements in US practice .
As we ’ll see , the evidence clearly shows that the key problem with the US health care system is its fragmentation .
A history of failed attempts to introduce universal health insurance has left us with a system in which the government pays directly or indirectly for more than half of the nation ’s health care , but the actual delivery both of insurance and of care is undertaken by a crazy quilt of private insurers , for - profit hospitals , and other players who add cost without adding value .
A Canadian - style single - payer system , in which the government directly provides insurance , would almost surely be both cheaper and more effective than what we now have .
And we could do even better if we learned from “ integrated ” systems , like the Veterans Administration , that directly provide some health care as well as medical insurance .
The bad news is that Washington currently seems incapable of accepting what the evidence on health care says .
In particular , the Bush administration is under the influence of both industry lobbyists , especially those representing the drug companies , and a free - market ideology that is wholly inappropriate to health care issues .
As a result , it seems determined to pursue policies that will increase the fragmentation of our system and swell the ranks of the uninsured .
Before we talk about reform , however , let ’s talk about the current state of the US health care system .
Let us begin by asking a seemingly naive question :
What ’s wrong with spending ever more on health care ?
1 .
Is health care spending a problem ?
In 1960 the United States spent only 5.2 percent of GDP on health care .
By 2004 that number had risen to 16 percent .
At this point America spends more on health care than it does on food .
But what ’s wrong with that ?
The starting point for any discussion of rising health care costs has to be the realization that these rising costs are , in an important sense , a sign of progress .
Here ’s how the Congressional Budget Office puts it , in the latest edition of its annual publication The Long - Term Budget Outlook :
Growth in health care spending has outstripped economic growth regardless of the source of its funding ….
The major factor associated with that growth has been the development and increasing use of new medical technology … .
In the health care field , unlike in many sectors of the economy , technological advances have generally raised costs rather than lowered them .
Notice the three points in that quote .
First , health care spending is rising rapidly “ regardless of the source of its funding . ”
Translation : although much health care is paid for by the government , this is n’t a simple case of runaway government spending , because private …
Yesterday 's comScore Media Metrix report , exclaiming that estimates of page views for social networking site MySpace at 38.7 million for the month of November topped those for Yahoo by 600,000 , came with some small print that should have generated at least an asterisk beside today 's headlines :
Yahoo has recently moved to an AJAX - driven page model , which probably reduced the number of complete page refreshes per user .
Web analytics software used by comScore and other services treat " page views " as complete refreshes of an entire page .
But Web sites that use more modern approaches to layout have recently adopted Asynchronous JavaScript to enable browsers to refresh select portions of the page when necessary , reducing bandwidth and improving layout .
Yahoo is one of the more recent inductees to the roll of sites embracing this technology .
Along with those efficiency gains comes the headache of what kind of a page view counts as an " impression " for the sake of advertisers , for whom Yahoo's page view numbers have the biggest impact .
ComScore 's estimate is that Yahoo's page views declined by 3.5 million in a one month period alone , even though experts in the field of Web design have been arguing since last spring that deploying AJAX reduces the efficiency of analytics software .

That did n't stop Fox Interactive , the parent of MySpace , from touting what it calls 200 % year - over - year growth , as evidenced mainly by page view estimates from comScore Media Metrix and Nielsen / NetRatings .
Experts point out that MySpace does not use AJAX .
In a May 2006 article for Clickz.com , managing editor Pamela Parker openly predicted that Yahoo's AJAX - enabled home page rollout - which was in beta at that time - would directly lead to reductions in page view count , though not necessarily in real traffic .
One example of an AJAX control Parker noted was a " personal assistant , " which works like a mini- browser , serving up different small batches of content from throughout Yahoo's mix of services .
Yahoo officials told Parker for that article that , while they planned to attach a fix advertising space to that AJAX control , which would remain in place while users continued to browse , they had no model in mind for how they would count advertising impressions for that control .
" I 'm certainly not suggesting we halt progress in the interest of simplicity , " Parker concluded in May .
" I 'm just saying things are getting more complex every day , and it 's time to start asking about more than just page views , about more than just impressions . "
Last September , the Internet Advertising Bureau urged both major Web analytics companies to consider reforming its analytics measurement processes to account for partial refreshes , or to introduce new means for measuring advertising impressions .
IAB cited real - world stories from major sites such as MSNBC.com , which noted strangely instantaneous drops in its own recorded page views by as much as 40 % , after new layout measures were adopted there .
The following month , a BusinessWeek article told the story of instant messaging service provider Meebo , Inc. , whose recorded page views omitted huge classes of extra traffic , including referrals back to its home page from a link embedded in its IM device .
The company 's proprietor invited comScore officials to look over the data first - hand , and while they obliged , they could n't come to any conclusions .
The possibility that analytics measurement schemes could be months , if not years , behind the times could actually be good news for sites such as CNET , whose stock value and even corporate status have come under fire recently in the face of page view numbers that appeared to decline by 55 % just between September 2005 and September 2006 .
During that period , CNET instituted a radical simplification of its
Web page structure that includes the use of tools such as Asynchronous JavaScript .
CNET 's analytics service is comScore .
In an open letter last September , comScore President and CEO Dr. Magid Abraham responded to criticisms posted in MediaWeek and AdWeek magazines , that its page view figures were n't matching up with Web servers ' own logs .
" When you scrutinize the details , " Dr. Abraham wrote , " the answer to the question about why Web log and panel - based data do n't always match up is ...' it depends . '
" In fact , the reasons for discrepancies depend on a number of factors : the panel data could be wrong , the Web log data could be wrong - or more often - they are both right given the exact definition of what they measure , " Dr. Abraham continued .
" But , those definitions could be vastly different . "
Later , in a section of the letter entitled , " Are We Even in the Same Universe ? " he added , " Technologies like AJAX are making it increasingly challenging to even define a page view and will increasingly become a potential source of discrepancy . "
For his personal blog , Steve Rubel , the senior vice president of public relations firm Edelman - one of the world 's largest - predicts the page view as we know it has four years to live , tops .
" This is a dirty little secret in the advertising business that no one wants to talk about , " Rubel writes .
" Media companies love to promote how many page views their properties get .
They 've used the data to build equity .
They will fight it tooth and nail to protect it , perhaps by not embracing interactive technologies as quickly as they should .
But that 's not going to stop the revolution from coming . "
It 's a booming business but even some " respectable " bailiffs are conning people , lying and ripping them off .
BBC reporter Jim
Wheble went undercover for nine months to expose how some debt collectors cheat the public .
Their job is to collect unpaid fines which are issued by magistrates ' courts , local authorities and landlords .
Sometimes they work directly for companies seeking to recover everything from council tax and parking fines to unpaid bills .
They are supposed to be Officers of the Court enforcing the law on behalf of the public .
Instead I saw bailiffs cheat , lie and dissemble .
I saw them illegally breaking and entering and I saw them fraudulently conning members of the public out of hundreds of pounds .
I 'm not saying people should n't pay their debts and I 'm certainly not criticising the companies who are owed money , but I saw bailiffs make people pay debts they did n't even owe and illegally inflate existing fines to more than they were supposed to be .
Undercover , I was employed as a bailiff by two companies - Drakes Group and CCS Enforcement Services Limited .
To my new colleagues I was an ex-salesman who fancied a change of direction .
Humanity
The first company I worked for was the Drakes Group , one of the largest bailiff companies in the country .
They have just won the lion 's share of contracts issued to bailiff companies to collect magistrates ' courts fines .
They are seen as a market leader and possibly the most image conscious .
Another company I also worked for was CCS Enforcement Services Limited , a smaller business whose focus is on collecting unpaid parking fines .
Their head office is in Bromsgrove , Worcestershire , but I was based at a regional office in Croydon , south London .
They seemed a lot less glossy than Drakes , almost having a family feel about them .
But like all the best families , they definitely had a few well kept secrets .
You are a legal thief
One bailiff describes his job
How to get out of debt
On my first day of training at Drakes the course tutor told us : " You are going to see things and hear things that are going to take you to the core of your humanity .
The core of your idea of what society out there really is like . "
He was right but it was n't the behaviour of society that shocked me , it was the behaviour of the bailiffs .
To be fair , most of the training stressed our responsibilities .
I almost began to believe them .
But then I started on the job , and one of my fellow bailiffs immediately told me in the bluntest language what he thought of the training .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The business should be tightly regulated and entry to it strictly controlled
Andrew , London
Send us your comments
" The shit they tell you at the school , it 's a load of bollocks - trust me , " one of the my fellow bailiffs told me as soon as I started .
And so it was .
My very first job with Drakes set the tone .
I was sent with another more experienced bailiff to recover a £ 400 driving fine owed by a young man .
When we knocked on the door his mum explained he did n't live there .
The law is quite clear , if he does n't live at the address there is nothing we can do .
I know that , I 've been trained .
But my bailiff colleague has different ideas .
Panic
" See the problem is at the moment madam , the court has issued a warrant against him at this address , " he tells her .
He goes on to explain to the terrified woman that we are " court enforcement officers " .
He adds : " Unless we can gain £ 400 this morning ... we do have a warrant to remove goods . "
I know this is simply not true - and so does my colleague .
We have no right to remove this woman 's possessions and no right to pressurise her into paying her son 's debts .
But that does n't stop my colleague .
He begins to walk round the woman 's home , deliberately listing her possessions as though preparing to take them .
He stops by her washing machine and carefully notes down its make .
Wheble went undercover " I have n't done anything , " pleads the woman , adding that she is a retired pensioner .
But what my fellow bailiff is doing has nothing to do with the law either , as he freely admits to me while the woman is out of hearing .
" We 're not allowed to take washing machines any more either but I list them anyway cos it pisses people off , " he says .
" The washing machine is the main thing in their household , especially a lady 's household .
Their washing machine is like the business . "
It works .
The mother panics and phones her daughter .
My colleague takes the phone .
" Right what I will do , " he says .
" I will do your mum a favour .
We will leave this morning , but if it 's not paid by ... this afternoon we will come back with a locksmith if necessary to remove the property . "
Again that is completely untrue , he can do no such thing .
But it works .
The fine gets paid .
I had expected to find rogue bailiffs .
I had been told by one whistleblower - a bailiff for 20 years - that the business was riddled with illegal practices .
What I found was more pervasive , more systematic , than I could ever have imagined .
Fear is the key weapon in the bailiff 's armoury .
But that does n't mean that all bailiffs are shaven - headed hard men .
At CCS Enforcement Services Limited I was sent out to work with another bailiff who looks like a gentleman .
He wears a tweed jacket and has a polite deferential manner .
I am little prepared for what happens next .
Unnecessary fear
We 've been sent to visit the home of debtor 's former wife .
We know he 's probably not living there , but it 's decided we should pay her and her children a visit anyway .
Instead of making for her front door , this " gentleman bailiff " decides on another approach .
As I look on in astonishment he takes a ladder from the back of the van .
" I 've done this many times actually , " he says as he climbs up to a first floor window where he comes face to face with the debtor 's former wife .
I can see no conceivable justification for terrifying this entirely innocent woman , alone at home with her two small children .
The poor woman screams hysterically at what she believes is an intruder .
Absurdly , what he 's doing is n't illegal - an ancient bailiff law means he can actually do this .
It achieves absolutely nothing apart from causing unnecessary fear and alarm .
Rising debt means more work for bailiffs
He tells me about another little trick he had up his sleeve - bumping up charges .
It 's completely illegal but , as I discovered , it happens all the time .
Although the original debt a bailiff may be trying to recover might only be £ 100 the bailiff can significantly increase the money the debtor has to pay by adding extra fees for every visit he has to make .
Only one visit can take the bill to £ 300 .
Add three visits and the bill can go up to £ 700 .
He explained to me that these " extra visits " may not be quite what they appear .
What he does is collect thousands of pounds in extra fees by charging debtors for visits he never made .
They 're called " phantom visits " in the trade .
I watched him do it .
We call on a man whose parking fine has gone up to £ 300 .
The man is anxious not to be clamped and offered to pay right away .
But my colleague says the fine is now £ 700 when our current visit is added on .
Complaints
That was much more than the amount the man really owed , but I could n't say anything .
I was undercover and I just had to remain in frustrated silence .
The bailiff offers to take the cost of today 's visit off and drops £ 100 from the bill .
The man paid up the £ 600 remaining .
This was not a lone occurrence , the practice appears to me to be endemic in the industry .
Many of the bailiffs at Drakes were no exception .
While I was working for them I got a call from head office .
They 'd received a cheque from a debtor but I still had to go round and enforce a warrant .
I could n't understand this , so I brought it up at the morning meeting .
" Technically , we can't remove any goods or remove his car because he 's paid the fine , " I say .
But one of the more experienced bailiffs at Drakes did n't seem worried about that .
Parking tickets can be costly if unpaid " Has the office cashed the cheque yet ? " he asks .
I tell him that they had n't .
" Oh you can enforce the warrant then , " he said .
That is precisely what we did .
The couple who owned the car had sent in a cheque to cover the £ 175 fine , but we went round and demanded £ 381.75 .
And the couple - with two burly bailiffs standing at their door - paid up .
It was n't only a few rogue bailiffs who did this .
My manager at Drakes , appeared to make it clear that this was to be general practice .
" Every trip you 've got at the moment , you just have to add the second and third visits straight away , so that 's your extra hundred pounds added on already , " he says .
There is little , I discovered , that can stand in the way of a determined bailiff - certainly not the law .
Another bailiff there put it succinctly : " You are a legal thief , " he says .
Ruthless
And like thieves , many bailiffs quickly learn a basic skill - breaking and entering .
After all , checking out the goods - even if they are not the debtors - is a lot easier when no - one is in .
The best I met was an ex-cop , now working for Drakes .
He showed me how to break into a house in a few seconds , using a special gadget that left not a trace .
Another bailiff explained to me , they have no real fear of being caught breaking the law .
After all it is usually simply the bailiff 's word against the debtors .
" I'm a court officer , " he says .
" Why should n't they believe me . "
The fact is that most people do n't complain .
Most people have no idea what a bailiff can and can't do .
All too often it is that ignorance which the ruthless bailiff will exploit .
Councils use bailiffs
But the end of the road came for me when I saw real damage being done .
At Drakes , I was shadowing a bailiff known for going to any lengths to get paid .
We were pursuing a fine that had been issued by the courts for an unpaid TV licence .
The debtor was n't in and nobody else at the house spoke English apart from the debtor 's kids .
The bailiff told the young girls that when people do n't pay fines they can go to prison , and that was what could happen to their mother .
The crying girls got the message .
This was more than I could take .
In a statement Drakes Group told us it had taken the lead in improving enforcement standards across the industry and did not condone , or knowingly allow , any of the alleged offences .
It pledged to investigate any allegation of impropriety or poor practice and take appropriate action as necessary .
CCS Enforcement Services Limited said it had launched a full internal investigation and would take disciplinary action against any person found to have acted inappropriately .
It also announced an independent review of CCS Enforcement Services Limited policies and procedures , to ensure that all employees operate at the very highest ethical and professional standards .

This did n't even make the front page of the local paper .
What War on Terror are we fighting ?
Um ... Mainsteam media ?
Is it only important to cover if the terrorist in question has a " foreign " name ?
Orcinus : ( h/t Gregory )
Imagine , for a moment , what would have happened if a Muslim extremist with an apparent hatred of the American government had been apprehended in , say , Tennessee , and charged with plotting to blow up Congress with a briefcase bomb .
Do you suppose that the case would then be relegated to the back pages of the local papers ?
Do you suppose it would go unmentioned by the 101st Keyboard Kommandos in their ever - vigilant search for proof that the War on Terror is right here in our midst ?
Of course not .
You can be certain Fox News would have splashed the case across its broadcasts , and Michelle Malkin and Little Green Footballs would have been all over it .
Now consider the case of Demetrius " Van " Crocker , who just happens to be a white right - wing extremist :
One - Pot Cooking Methods
The three methods described below have one thing in common : substitutions .
You can vary the ingredients to suit your taste or to use up the leftovers .
The possibilities are endless , yet the procedure is pretty much the same for each meal .
Youngsters and people new to cooking will enjoy the simple instructions and flexibility to make any portion size meal with whatever ingredients are available .
They ’ll also appreciate the simple clean - up !
Method 1 : Rice - Based Meals
Put 3 cups cold water and a pinch of salt in a 2qt saucepan .
Bring to a boil .
Add 1 1/2 cups brown rice , let water return to a boil , then lower heat to lowest setting and cover .
Leave lid on and cook for 30 minutes .
Lift the lid and quickly set cauliflower or broccoli on top of the bed of rice .
Sprinkle 1 tsp thyme or rosemary .
You can also add thin strips of cooked meat , tofu or shrimp – just set on top of the vegetables .
Cover immediately and keep cooking for 10 – 12 minutes .
Add grated cheese with thinly sliced almonds .
Sprinkle bread crumbs as an option .
Cover and remove from heat .
Let stand 5 minutes and serve .
Serves 3 hearty portions .
For substitutions , you can use white , brown or basmati rice .
A bouillon cube , chicken or beef flavor , can be added to the water if you plan to use strips of chicken or beef with the dish .
Any quick - cooking fresh vegetable can be used .
Avoid using frozen vegetables .
Slower - cooking vegetables like carrots should be thinly sliced .
The grated cheese topping can be replaced with tomato or mushroom sauce .
If you ’re cooking for more people , use a larger saucepan .
The pan needs to be large enough so that the rice , when cooked , occupies no more than 2/3 the volume of the pan .
Method 2 : Potato - Based Meals
Put 2 inches of water and a pinch of salt into a 2qt saucepan , and set a steamer basket or pan on top .
Peel 3 or 4 large potatoes , cubed into fairly large pieces and place in steamer .
The potatoes should only fill the pan halfway , or a little more .
Cover and cook on med - hi for 12 minutes .
Add large pieces of fresh broccoli , zucchini or cauliflower , and thinner slices of carrot and onion .
Add seasonings such as thyme , rosemary and garlic powder .
Set thin strips of ham , cooked chicken or tofu on top of the vegetables .
Cover and cook for 10 minutes .
Test for doneness by piercing a potato with a fork – the fork should slip out without lifting the potato .
Add topping of grated cheese , mushroom sauce or just thin slivers of butter .
Sprinkle with parsley .
Serves 3 .
Substitutions can include carrots cut in larger pieces and started with the potatoes .
String beans can be added after the potatoes have had 5 to 10 minutes head start .
Mushrooms can be added after about 10 – 12 minutes .
Cooked fish , shrimp or tofu can be used as meat substitutions .
Method 3 : Pasta - Based Meals
In a large , deep skillet add 1 tbsp olive oil and a pound of meat , cubed or ground .
Brown the meat over med - hi heat .
Add equal parts of pasta sauce , water and bite - sized pasta .
( A cup per person should do . )
Cover , bring to a boil and simmer for 20 minutes .
Add sliced mushrooms , onion , pepper and broccoli , and cook under cover for 5 min. more .
Stir in one cup of grated mozzarella cheese , let stand for a few minutes .
Sprinkle with parmesan and serve .
Serves 4 .
Substitutions include any kind of bite - sized pasta .
Chicken strips or diced ham can also be used for meat dishes , or tofu for meatless .
Corn , peas , olives or sliced peppers can also be used for vegetables .

Has the war
in Iraq increased jihadist terrorism ?
The Bush administration has offered
two responses : First , the moths - to - aflame argument , which says that Iraq
draws terrorists who would otherwise “ be plotting and killing Americans
across the world and within our own borders , ” as President Bush put it
in 2005 .
Second , the hard - to - say position : “ Are more terrorists being
created in the world ? ” then - Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld asked
at a press conference in September 2006 .
“ We do n’t know .
The world does n’t
know .
There are not good metrics to determine how many people are being
trained in a radical madrasa school in some country . ”
In fact ,
as Rumsfeld knew well , there are plenty of publicly available figures
on the incidence and gravity of jihadist attacks .
But until now , no one
has done a serious statistical analysis of whether an “ Iraq effect ” does
exist .
We have undertaken such a study , drawing on data in the mipt- rand
Terrorism database ( terrorismknowledgebase .org ) , widely considered the
best unclassified database on terrorism incidents .
Our study
yields one resounding finding :
The rate of fatal terrorist attacks around
the world by jihadist groups , and the number of people killed in those
attacks , increased dramatically after the invasion of Iraq .
Globally there
was a 607 percent rise in the average yearly incidence of attacks ( 28.3
attacks per year before and 199.8 after ) and a 237 percent rise in the
fatality rate ( from 501 to 1,689 deaths per year ) .
A large part of this
rise occurred in Iraq , the scene of almost half the global total of jihadist
terrorist attacks .
But even excluding Iraq and Afghanistan — the other current
jihadist hot spot — there has been a 35 percent rise in the number of attacks ,
with a 12 percent rise in fatalities .
Contrary
to Bush ’s assertion , jihadists have not let the Iraq War distract them
from targeting the United States and its allies .
The rate of attacks on
Western interests and citizens has risen by almost 25 percent , while the
yearly fatality rate has increased by 4 percent , a figure that would have
been higher had planned attacks , such as the London airline plot , not
been prevented .
The globalization
of jihad and martyrdom has disquieting implications for American security
in the future .
Jihadists are already leaving Iraq to operate elsewhere ,
a “ blowback ” trend that will greatly increase when the war eventually
winds down .
Terrorist groups in Iraq , which have learned to raise millions
through kidnapping and oil theft , may be in a position to help fund their
jihadist brethren elsewhere .
Finally , Iraq has increased the popularity
of a hardcore takfiri ideology so intolerant that , unlikely as it seems ,
it makes Osama bin Laden appear relatively moderate .
Though few
American civilians have been killed by jihadist terrorists in the past
three years , it is naive to assume that this will continue to be the case .
We will be living with the consequences of the Iraq debacle for many years .

Jones ’ “ Iraq Effect ” study was led by Peter Bergen and Paul
Cruickshank , research fellows at the Center on Law and Security

プログラミングでモナド機構を使うと、関数、値、計算などの概念を一気に拡張することができます。うーん、ステキ。でも、モナドを採り入れているプログラミング言語の例をHaskell以外は知りません（たぶん他にもあるでしょうが）。そもそも、モナドが少しだけポピュラーになったのもHaskellの影響でしょう。
と、モナドがプログラミングの世界に入ってきたのは比較的最近ですが、理論としては古くて、ソッチ方面（どっち方面かは気にしない）で有名なJ.Beckの論文は1967年です（40年前）。プログラミングへの応用を明確に意識したE.Moggiの論文でさえ、1989年に出てます。
●こんな課題を考えてみよう：副作用付き計算
モナド概念は非常に普遍的なので、モナドの実例はとんでもなくイッパイあります。モナドの実例をいくつか出されると（例えば、リストと状態遷移と例外と入出力）、それらがモナドという単一の概念でくくれること、共通性を持つことが信じがたいでしょう。
そこで、モナドの実例を1つだけ選んで、その特定事例をシッカリ説明することにします。その実例とは副作用付き計算です。副作用とは、関数、メソッド、手続きなど（計算／処理の単位）が、外部（環境）に影響を及ぼすことです。例えば、ローカル変数以外の変数への値のセット、ファイル入出力、画面への描画などは副作用です。
副作用がなくて、純粋に計算だけを行う処理単位を純関数と呼びましょう。純関数の値（計算結果、戻り値）は、その引数値だけで決定されます。同じ引数を渡すなら、いつでもどこでも何度でも同じ値を返します。それが純関数ってもんです。
さて、次の問題を考えましょう：
副作用付き計算を、純関数で表現せよ。
「 副作用 」 と「純関数」の意味を考えると、この問題自体が矛盾した要求で、解決不可能に思えます。にもかかわらず、モナドはみごとな解決策を与えるのです。
●カウントアップする関数達
以下、説明用コードにはJavaScriptを使います。とはいえ、見ればわかるコードなので、JavaScriptの知識もたいして要りません。現状のJavaScriptは型宣言ができないので、コメント内に型を書くことにします。
まずは、大域変数countから：
// count : Number
var count = 0 ;
count : Number
ここで、コメント内のは、変数countがNumber型であることを示します。
この変数countをカウンターと呼ぶことにして、カウンターに加算する関数の例を挙げます。
// sum_countup5 : Number , Number →Number 副作用あ り
function sum_countup5 ( x , y ) {
count += 5 ;
return x + y ;
}
関数sum_countup5は、2つの引数を足し算する関数ですが、なぜかついでにカウンターを5だけ上げます。コメント内の
Number , Number →Number は、2つのNumber型引数を取り、Number型の値を戻すことを示していますが、計算する以外に副作用を持ちます。
js > count
0
js > sum_countup5 ( 1 , 3 )
4
js > count
5
もう少し例を ：
// length_countup : String →Number 副作用あり
function length_countup(s ) {
var len = s.length ;
count += len ;
return len ;
} // countup : Number →Void 副作用あ り
function countup(n ) {
count += n ;
return undefined ;
}
関数length_countupが何をするかは見ればわかりますね。関数countupは純関数の対局的存在で副作用だけの処理です。countupの戻り値の型はVoidですが、Void型とは、undefinedという値だけを持つ型だと思ってください。戻り値がない（あるいは不要）なときに使うダミー値がundefinedです。
length_countupとcountupを実行するとこんな感じ：
js > count
5
js > length_countup ( " Hello , world ! " )
13
js > count
18
js > countup( 3 )
js > count
21
js > countup(1 )
js > count
22
●カウントアップしたい意志を戻り値で伝える
我々の課題を思い出してください：「副作用付き計算を、純関数で表現せよ」でした。カウンター（大域変数count）に触ることは副作用ですから、これをやめましょう。んじゃ、カウントアップできないじゃないか！ って？ はい、そのとおり。でも、「カウントアップしたい」という意志を伝えることはできます。計算の結果以外に、カウントアップしたい値（カウンターの増分）も戻り値にします（一種の
“ 多値” ですね） 。
さっそくやってみましょう。
function sum_countup5 ( x , y ) {
return [ x + y , 5 ] ;
}
まー、これでもいいのですが、単なるペア（[3 , 5 ]とか）では一番目の値と二番目の値の役割がハッキリしないので、次にしましょう。
function sum_countup5 ( x , y ) {
return {value : x + y , countup : 5} ;
}
これで、 sum_countup5 ( 1 , 2 ) ; とすると、 {value : 3 , countup : 5} というオブジェクト（構造体と呼ぼうが、マップと呼ぼうが、お好きにどうぞ）が返ってきます。
いま使った {value : なんかの値 , countup : 整数値} という形をしたオブジェクトの型 をCountup ( T ) と記すことにします 。Tは、 「 なんかの値の型」が入る場所で、実際には、Countup( Number ) 型、Countup ( String ) 型、Countup ( Void ) 型のようになります。この書き方だと、sum_countup5の型は次のように記述されます。
// sum_countup5 : Number , Number →Countup( Number ) 副作用な し
さてと、他の関数もこの方法で書き換えてみましょう。
// length_countup: String →Countup( Number ) 副作用な し
function length_countup(s ) {
var len = s.length ;
return {value : len , countup : len} ;
} // countup : Number →Countup ( Void ) 副作用な し
function countup(n ) {
return {value : undefined , countup : n} ;
}
●それでは、いったい誰がカウントアップをするのだ
これで、副作用を取り除くことができました。定義し直したsum_countup5、length_countup、countupはいずれも純関数です。めでたし、めでたし。オーイ、チョット待て、副作用がなくなったって、それで済ませるなよ！
えーとですね、絶対に誰も大域変数countに触らないって規則だと、さすがに無理なんですよ -- カウントアップできねーよ、それじゃ。それで、一連のカウントアップ要求を最後にホントに実行する処理を書いておきます。
// CountupMain : Countup ( T ) →T 副作用あ り
function CountupMain( countupRequest ) {
count += countupRequest.countup ;
return countupRequest.value ;
}
このCountupMainは次のように使います。
js > count = 0
0
js > CountupMain( sum_countup5 ( 1 , 2 ) )
3
js > count
5
js > CountupMain ( countup ( 10 ) )
js > count
15
「 なんだ、インチキやんけ」って？ ウーン、まー少しインチキかもしれない。でもね、インチキ行為はCountupMainが一手に引き受けているわけで、他の関数はすべて純関数として書けるんですよ。つまりだね、CountupMainは、この世の汚辱の一切をただ一人で受け止めている、それにより、民衆はみな天使のようにピュアにすごせる、という、そういう美しい物語なんですよ（プチ感動 …？）。
●関数の引数の型 をCountup型にまで拡張する
sum_countup5、length_countup、countupを副作用方式で定義する（最初のほうでやった）場合は、次のような組み合わせ（関数の合成）ができました。
countup ( sum_countup5 ( 1 , length_countup ( " Hello , world ! " ) )
この組み合わせは、とっても正統な組み合わせです。というのも、型チェックを厳密にしても“まったく問題なし”なんです。それを確認するために、関数の型宣言を次のように書いてみます。
Void countup( Number )
Number sum_countup5 ( Number , Number )
Number length_countup ( String )
式 countup ( sum_countup5 ( 1 , length_countup ( " Hello , world ! " ) )
は、次（下の図）のように分解できるので、戻り値の型と引数の型がきれいに一致していますね。
Void
↑
countup( Number )
↑
sum_countup5 ( Number , Number )
↑ ↑
1 , length_countup ( String )
↑
" Hello , world ! "
ところが、副作用を取り除いたほうはうまくいきません。関数の型が変わってしまいましたからね。
Countup ( Void ) countup( Number )
Countup ( Number ) sum_countup5 ( Number , Number )
Countup ( Number ) length_countup ( String )
もし、次のような型を持つ関数があれば、うまく合成（関数結合）できます。
Countup ( Void ) countup_ex ( Countup( Number ) )
Countup ( Number ) sum_countup5_ex ( Countup ( Number ) , Countup ( Number ) )
関数名のお尻に「 _ex」と付けたのは、extension（拡張）のつもりです。そんな拡張関数を具体的に書いてみれば：
// countup_ex : Countup( Number ) →Countup ( Void )
function countup_ex ( countup_n ) {
return {value : undefined , countup : countup_n.countup + countup_n.value} ;
} // sum_countup5_ex:Countup( Number ) , Countup ( Number ) → Countup ( Number )
function sum_countup5_ex( countup_x , countup_y ) {
return {value : countup_x.value + countup_y.value ,
countup : countup_x.countup + countup_y.countup + 5} ;
}
countup_ex ( sum_countup5_ex ( 1 , length_countup ( " Hello , world ! " ) )
// noeffect : Number →Countup( Number )
function noeffect (n ) {
return {value :n , countup:0} ;
}
これで、がバッチリ定義できる。あっ、ちょっと待て。定数1が困った。sum_countup5_ex（お尻に_exが付いてるぞ！）の第一引数の型はNumberじゃなくて、Countup( Number)なんだよな。しょうがない、整数値からCountup( Number)型のデータを作る関数を作っておこう。
オーシ、やっと目的が達せられるぞ。 countup_ex(sum_countup5_ex(noeffect ( 1 ) , length_countup ( " Hello , world ! " ) )
って式は、型がちゃんと整合している。下の図を見てよーく確認してね！
Countup ( Void )
↑
countup_ex ( Countup( Number ) )
↑
sum_countup5_ex( Countup( Number ) , // 第一引数
↑
noeffect ( Number )
↑
1
Countup ( Number ) ) // 第二引数
↑
length_countup( String )
↑
" Hello , world ! "
それでは、いくつかの式をCountupMainに渡してみましょう。あっ、そうだ、見やすさを改善するためにCountupTestって作って、それを使おう。
// CountupTest : Countup( T ) →Void
function CountupTest( countupRequest ) {
print ( " value : " + countupRequest.value ) ;
print ( " countup : " + countupRequest.countup ) ;
count += countupRequest.countup ;
return undefined ;
}
カウントアップ要求がちゃんと累積されています。一番最後の例だと、length_countupが増分13 , sum_countup5_exが増分5を要求し、合計で18。一方countup_exに入る値は(1 + 13 ) = 14なので、countup_ex自体は増分14を要求し、全体で増分32を要求することになります。
●そして、これがモナドだ
ここらで今までの経緯をまとめて、モナド概念を正式に導入しておきます。
振り返れば我々は ； 関数から副作用を取り除き（汚れ作業 はCountupMainに押しつけ）、代わりに戻り値に副作用の意図を詰め込み、それによって失われた関数結合の自由さを関数の拡張により取り戻しました。これらの背後には、次のような約束事／手順があります。
型 Tのデータか らCountup ( T ) 型のデータを作り出す約束事／手順 fun : T→Countup ( S ) という関数funを、fun_ex : Countup ( T ) →Countup ( S ) に拡張する約束事／手順（funに複数の引数を許すなら、それなりの対応が必要）。
型 Tの値（例えば整数 値1）を 、Countup ( T ) 型のデータとみなす約束事／手順
今回、一番目の約束事／手順は、{value : T型 , countup : 整数型} の形式を使うことにしました。三番目は関数noeffectが処理してますが、その原則は {value :
T型 , countup : 0 に固定} を作るという決まり事です。2番目の関数拡張はそのつど手作業でやってましたが、次のような関数extにより自動化できます。
// ext :( T→Countup ( S ) ) →( Countup ( T ) →Countup ( S ) )
function ext ( fun ) {
return function ( /* 可変引数 */) {
var valueArgs = new Array ( ) ;
var countupTotal = 0 ;
for ( var i = 0 ; i < arguments.length ; i++ ) {
var arg = arguments [ i ] ;
valueArgs [ i ] = arg.value ;
countupTotal += arg.countup ;
}
var result = fun.apply ( null , valueArgs ) ;
result.countup = result.countup + countupTotal ;
return result ;
} ;
}
関数extを使うと、いちいち手書きしなくても拡張関数を作ってくれます。例えば：
js > var sum_countup5_ex = ext( sum_countup5 )
js > var r = sum_countup5 _ex ( {value : 5 , countup: 1} , {value : 10 , countup:3} )
js > r.value
15
js > r.countup
9
以上で出そろった ：
これらの3 つ 組( Countup , noeffct , ext ) をCountupモナドと呼びます。もちろん、Countupモナドはモナドの一例ですが、一般的なモナドも同様で、次の3つで定義されます。
最後の関数の名前をnoeffctからunitに変えたのは、モナド一般の文脈ではnoeffct（作用なし）という名前が不適切だからです。
モナド( M , unit , ext ) は、3つ組なら何でもいいわけではなくて、モナド法則という法則を満たす必要があります（今は触れません）。Countupモナドに十分に慣れたなら、他のモナドも学習できるでしょう。そしていずれ、モナドの例が驚くほど多いことや、まったく異なった領域にモナドが出現すること、…などなど、その不思議さ／魅力に触れてみてください。
[ 追記 ] このエントリーの補足がコチラにあります。[/追記]
One morning a few weeks ago I sat in a car talking to Rami , a thick - necked former Republican Guard commando who now procures arms for his fellow Sunni insurgents .
Rami was explaining how the insurgency had changed since the first heady days after the US invasion .
" I used to attack the Americans when that was the jihad .
Now there is no jihad .
Go around and see in Adhamiya [ the notorious Sunni insurgent area ] - all the commanders are sitting sipping coffee ; it 's only the young kids that are fighting now , and they are not fighting Americans any more , they are just killing Shia .
There are kids carrying two guns each and they roam the streets looking for their prey .
They will kill for anything , for a gun , for a car and all can be dressed up as jihad . "
Rami was no longer involved in fighting , he said , but made a tidy profit selling weapons and ammunition to men in his north Baghdad neighbourhood .
Until the last few months , the insurgency got by with weapons and ammunition looted from former Iraqi army depots .
But now that Sunnis were besieged in their neighbourhoods and fighting daily clashes with the better - equipped Shia ministry of interior forces , they needed new sources of weapons and money .
He told me that one of his main suppliers had been an interpreter working for the US army in Baghdad .
" He had a deal with an American officer .
We bought brand new AKs and ammunition from them . "
He claimed the American officer , whom he had never met but he believed was a captain serving at Baghdad airport , had even helped to divert a truckload of weapons as soon as it was driven over the border from Jordan .
These days Rami gets most of his supplies from the new American - equipped Iraqi army .
" We buy ammunition from officers in charge of warehouses , a small box of AK - 47 bullets is $ 450 ( £ 230 ) .
If the guy sells a thousand boxes he can become rich and leave the country . "
But as the security situation deteriorates , Rami finds it increasingly difficult to travel across Baghdad .
" Now I have to pay a Shia taxi driver to bring the ammo to me .
He gets $ 50 for each shipment . "
The box of 700 bullets that Rami buys for $ 450 today would have cost between $ 150 and $ 175 a year ago .
The price of a Kalashnikov has risen from $ 300 to $ 400 in the same period .
The inflation in arms prices reflects Iraq 's plunge toward civil war but , largely unnoticed by the outside world , the Sunni insurgency has also changed .
The conflict into which 20,000 more American troops will be catapulted over the next few weeks is very different to the one their comrades experienced even a year ago .
In Baghdad in late October I called a Sunni insurgent I had known for more than a year .
He was the mid-level commander of a small cell , active against the Americans in Sunni villages north of Baghdad .
Sectarian frontlines had been hardening in the city for months - it took us 45 minutes of haggling to agree on a meeting place which we could both get to safely .
We met in a rundown workers ' cafe .
Kidnapped
" Its not a good time to be a Sunni in Baghdad , " Abu Omar told me in a low voice .
He had been on the Americans ' wanted list for three years but I had never seen him so anxious ; he had trimmed his beard in the close - cropped Shia style and kept looking towards the door .
His brother had been kidnapped a few days before , he told me , and he believed he was next on a Shia militia 's list .
He had fled his home in the north of the city and was staying with relatives in a Sunni stronghold in west Baghdad .
He was more despondent than angry .
" We Sunni are to blame , " he said .
" In my area some ignorant al - Qaida guys have been kidnapping poor Shia farmers , killing them and throwing their bodies in the river .
I told them : ' This is not jihad .
You can't kill all the Shia !
This is wrong !
The Shia militias are like rabid dogs - why provoke them ? ' "
Then he said : " I am trying to talk to the Americans .
I want to give them assurances that no one will attack them in our area if they stop the Shia militias from coming . "
This man who had spent the last three years fighting the Americans was now willing to talk to them , not because he wanted to make peace but because he saw the Americans as the lesser of two evils .
He was wrestling with the same dilemma as many Sunni insurgent leaders , beginning to doubt the wisdom of their alliance with al - Qaida extremists .
Another insurgent commander told me : " At the beginning al - Qaida had the money and the organisation , and we had nothing . "
But this alliance soon dragged the insurgents and then the whole Sunni community into confrontation with the Shia militias as al - Qaida and other extremists massacred thousands of Shia civilians .
Insurgent commanders such as Abu Omar soon found themselves outnumbered and outgunned , fighting organised militias backed by the Shia - dominated security forces .
A week after our conversation , Abu Omar invited me to a meeting with insurgent commanders .
I was asked to wait in the reception room of a certain Sunni political party .
A taxi driver took me to a house in a Sunni neighbourhood that had recently been abandoned by a Shia family .
The driver came in with me - he was also a commander .
The house had been abandoned in a hurry , cardboard boxes were stacked by the door , some of the furniture was covered with white cloths and a few cheap paintings were piled against a wall .
The property had been expropriated by the local Sunni mujahideen and we sat on sofas in a dusty reception room .
Abu Omar had been meeting commanders of groups with names like the Fury Brigade , the Battalions of the 1920 Revolution , the Islamic Army and the Mujahideen Army , to discuss options they had for fighting both an insurgency against the Americans and an escalating civil war with the Shia .
Abu Omar had proposed encouraging young Sunni men to enlist in the army and the police to redress the sectarian balance .
He suggested giving the Americans a ceasefire , in an attempt to stop ministry of interior commandos ' raids on his area .
Al - Qaida had said no to all these measures ; now he wanted other Iraqi insurgent commanders to support him .
' Do politics '
A heated discussion was raging .
One of the men , with a very thin moustache , a huge belly and a red kuffiya wrapped around his shoulder , held a copy of the Qur'an in one hand and a mobile phone in the other .
I asked him what his objectives were .
" We are fighting to liberate our country from the occupations of the Americans and their Iranian - Shia stooges . "
" My brother , I disagree , " said Abu Omar .
" Look , the Americans are trying to talk to us Sunnis and we need to show them that we can do politics .
We need to use the Americans to fight the Shia . "
He looked nervously at them : suggestions of talking to the Americans could easily have him labelled as traitor .
" Where is the jihad and the mujahideen ? " he continued .
" Baghdad has become a Shia town .
Our brothers are being slaughtered every day !
Where are these al - Qaida heroes ?
One neighbourhood after another will be lost if we do n't work on a strategy . "
The taxi driver commander , who sat cross-legged on a sofa , joined in : " If the Americans leave we will be slaughtered . "
A big - bellied man waved his hands dismissively : " We will massacre the Shia and show them who are the Sunnis !
They could n't have done anything without the Americans ' support . "
When the meeting was over the taxi driver went out to check the road , then the rest followed .
" Do n't look up , we could be monitored , Shia spies are everywhere , " said the big man .
The next day the taxi driver was arrested .
By December Abu Omar 's worst fears were being realised .
The Sunnis had become squeezed into a corner fighting two sides at the same time .
But by then he had disappeared ; his body was never found .
Baghdad was now divided : frontlines partitioned neighbourhoods into Shia and Sunni , thousands of families had been forced out of their homes .
After each large - scale bomb attack on Shia civilians , scores of mutilated bodies of Sunnis were found in the streets .
Patrolling militias and checkpoints meant that men with Sunni names dared not venture far outside their neighbourhoods , while certain Sunni areas came under the complete control of insurgent groups the Shura Council of the Mujahideen and the Islamic Army .
The Sunni vigilante self - defence groups took shape as reserve units under the control of these insurgent groups .
Like Abu Omar before him , Abu Aisha , a mid-level Sunni commander , had come to understand that the threat from the Shia was perhaps greater than his need to fight the occupying Americans .
Abu Aisha fought in Baghdad 's western Sunni suburbs , he was a former NCO in the Iraqi army and followed an extreme form of Islam known as Salafism .
Jamming
Deep lines criss - crossed his narrow forehead and his eyes half closed when he tried to answer a question
He seemed to evaluate every answer before he spoke .
He claimed involvement in dozens of attacks on US and Iraqi troops , mostly IEDs ( bombs ) but also ambushes and execution of alleged Shia spies .
" We have stopped using remote controls to detonate IEDs , " he volunteered halfway through our conversation .
" Only wires work now because the Americans are jamming the signals . "
On his mobile phone he proudly showed me grainy images of dead bodies lying in the street , their hands tied behind their backs .
He claimed they were Shia agents and that he had killed them .
" There is a new jihad now , " he said , echoing Abu Omar 's warning .
" The jihad now is against the Shia , not the Americans . "
In Ramadi there was still jihad against the Americans because there were no Shia to fight , but in Baghdad his group only attacked the Americans if they were with Shia army forces or were coming to arrest someone .
" We have been deceived by the jihadi Arabs , " he admitted , in reference to al - Qaida and foreign fighters .
" They had an international agenda and we implemented it .
But now all the leadership of the jihad in Iraq are Iraqis . "
Abu Aisha went on to describe how the Sunnis were reorganising .
After Sunni families had been expelled from mixed areas throughout Baghdad , his area in the western suburbs was prepared to defend itself against any militia attack .
" Ameriya , Jihad , Ghazaliyah , " he listed , " all these areas are becoming part of the new Islamic state of Iraq , each with an emir in charge . "
Increasingly the Iraqi insurgency is moving away from its cellular structure and becoming organised according to neighbourhood .
Local defence committees have intertwined into the insurgent movement .
" Each group is in charge of a specific street , " Abu Aisha said .
" We have defence lines , trenches and booby traps .
When the Americans arrive we let them go through , but if they show up with Iraqi troops , then it 's a fight . "
A few days later Rami was telling me about the Sunni insurgents in his north Baghdad area .
A network of barricades and small berms blocked the streets around the car in which we sat talking .
A convoy of two cars with four men inside whizzed past .
" Ah , they are brothers on a mission , " Rami said .
Like every man of fighting age , Rami was required to take part in his local vigilante group , guarding the neighbourhood at night or conducting raids or mortar attacks on neighbouring Shia areas .
But he paid $ 30 a week to a local commander and was exempted .
According to Rami and other commanders , funding for the insurgents comes from three sources .
Each family in the street pays a levy , around $ 8 , to the local group .
" And when they go through lots of ammunition because of clashes , " Rami said , " they pay an extra $ 5 . "
Then there are donations from rich Sunni businessmen , financiers and wealthier insurgent groups .
A third source of funding was " ghaniama " , loot which is rapidly becoming the main fuel of the sectarian war
' A business '
" Every time they arrest a Shia , we take their car , we sell it and use the money to fund the fighters , and jihad , " said Abu Aisha .
The mosque sheik or the local commander collects the money and it is distributed among the fighters ; some get fixed salaries , others are paid by " operations " , and the money left is used for ammunition .
" It has become a business , they give you money to kill Shia , we take their houses and sell their cars , " said Rami .
" The Shia are doing the same .
" Last week on the main highway in our area , they killed a Shia army officer .
He had a brand new Toyota sedan .
The idiots burned the car .
I offered them $ 40,000 for it , they said no .
Imagine how many jihads they could have done with 40k . "
· Names have been changed in this report .
I received 2 emails today yesterday telling me that the official websites of the Spanish hotel chain AC Hotels had been banned from Google !
Well , this wo n’t be the first time it happens to a big company , in fact depending on the changes of Google ’s algorithm during the so - called Google Dance , many websites can be left behind for usually two main reasons : Poorly designed websites ( from a SEO perspective ) and / or abuses of SEO techniques ..
A lot of companies do not have a clue why they have been banned or penalized from Google index .
That ’s why I will approach the case of “ AC HOTELS ” from different angles that respect the following assumption : “ Banned from Google= Not Spidered , Not Ranked , Not Indexed ”
Are they still present in Google index ?
Let ’s see if AC HOTELS website is still indexed in google database with the simple command site : www.ac-hotels.com ( same thing for the second website site : www.ac-hoteles.com)
As you can see ( click the link for a bigger image ) the response from Google is negative .
Google does not have information about those sites besides ( part of ) their backlinks .
Are still present in Yahoo and Msn ?
Having a look at ( the highly recommended ) Yahoo “ Site Explorer “ , the same type of query reveals that their two official websites are indexed and it also gives us a list of all their backlinks ( =inlinks ) .
Yahoo Site Explorer says :
AC - Hotels.com : Pages indexed : 26 / Inlinks for this url only ( except from this domain ) : 2,576
/ Inlinks for this url only ( except from this domain ) : 2,576 AC - Hoteles.com : Pages indexed : 9 / Inlinks for this url only ( except from this domain ) : 2,001
Msn Search says :
AC - Hotels.com : 16 pages / 4,533 Inlinks
/ 4,533 Inlinks AC - Hoteles.com : 20 pages / 1,176 Inlinks
This screenshot shows us that there are very few pages of AC Hotels indexed in Yahoo and MSN ( some of them do not exist anymore ) .
The good is that Yahoo gives us more information about the backlinks network of the site ; this information is helpful in order to understand the “ banning issue ” .
It really seems that Google , for its part , has decided not to index those 2 domains anymore for some reasons .
Why AC Hotels website has been banned by Google ?
First of all let ’s have a look at the 2 websites carefully .
It does n’t take long to understand that the 2 sites are not “ SEO friendly “ !
Indeed there are both developed with the exact same structure using Flash !
This is a basic mistake of websites that totally rely on flash .
Flash may look good for the visitors , but unfortunately Search Engine Spiders ( automated crawlers like googlebot ) are still not able to read precisely ( or browse easily )
Flash content .
In this case googlebot does not see anything , not a single link or word .
Note : Google is able to read flash BUT it needs advanced SEO techniques to be able to position well a flash site in search engines .
Most of the time webmasters reproduce the entire website in pure html “ behind ” the flash content just for the love of spider bots .
If Google missed the Flash content , it did not miss the Meta Keywords and Meta tags proposed by the page that loads the flash ; keywords and meta descriptions are shown below :
Note :
Those are the exact same keywords and meta descriptions for the two sites that also have the exact same title : “ AC Hotels : Hoteles AC en España , Italia y Portugal ”
Note2 : It seems that AC Hotels is currently making changes to their sites , the Meta Description has been reduced as shown below :
So guess what : Google sees all those keywords in the meta tags but unfortunately the spider is not able to locate any occurrence of those keywords in the content of the website ( it ’s a big no no ! ) .
People who put keywords into the meta tag that had nothing to do with the content of their site are severely penalized by Google .
The same applies for the following subdomains that redirect the visitors to the same flash frame with different keywords but still with no content for the spiders :
hoteles.barcelona.ac-hotels.com
hoteles.granada.ac-hotels.com
hoteles.madrid.ac-hotels.com
hoteles.sevilla.ac-hotels.com
A quick look at Alexa tells us that 4 % of the traffic comes from directorio.ac - hotels.com .
This subdomain does not use any flash file ; it is a basic directory of hotels that spiders will sure understand and indexed .
The use of the directory is obvious !
There is no browsable sitemap on the rest of the site , thus there was a real need to optimize and help users ( and spiders ) to find the right path to the content .
Interlinking webpages is not an abuse if it is done properly ; according to Google it can be done if it really helps to guide the visitors to navigate the website ..
Now let ’s have a look at the IP who hosts those 2 main websites of AC Hotels .
A reverse IP lookup gives us the full list of domain names hosted by the same IP ; a total of 92 domain names all owned by AC Hotels .
A quick overview of those websites brought to my attention the fact that they all have the exact same structure , with a flash integrated into a frame and a background that are both hosted on www.Ac-hotels.com
Same approach , same results !
Spiders can’t crawl the content of the sites thus almost none of those sites is indexed in Google .
I said “ almost ” because hotelcuzco .
net is the only site from the 92 that is still indexed by google …
Is there any duplicated content ?
Indeed and it is a major SEO error ; Ac- hotels.com , org , biz , info Ac- hoteles.com , net , org , biz , info and ac10hotels.com have the exact same content ( meta keywords , description , content ) !
Ac - hotels.com has been penalized for not being able to determine a central main site inside a network of domain names to the eyes of search engines .
For google it is duplicated content as Google think people intends to position as many webpages as possible in the pages of results to get better visibility .
Also , the website of each hotel from the chain get the exact same structure and link back to Ac- hotels.com .
That explains why every single hotel website has been penalized too .
Solutions ? :
Using the permanent 301 redirections on those 10 sites to the main site ; and providing a different readable structure of each website , so Googlebot can notice they are indeed all different .
As a matter of fact Google intensively struggle against duplicated content since the beginning of 2006 and those 10 websites are no exception in Googlebot ’s eyes .
Page rank ?
Even if google does not indexed anymore AC - Hotels.com , the domain name still has a Page Rank of 6/10 and a page rank of 4/10 for the asp page that run the Flash content .
Usually Page Rank updates take a lot of time , so we can easily predicts that next update will show a 0/10 .
AC - Hotels.com ’s websites still have backlinks and still have a PR ( as of 19/3/07 ) ; however we saw a lot of indicators that explain why Google algorithm has taken the decision to ban or penalize AC Hotels ’ websites ( duplicated content between domains , keywords stuffing , no spider friendly content , excessive inbounds linking from the same IP etc ) .
I would advise AC - Hotels to correct every single problems as fast as they can so they can then quickly file a reinclusion request to Google to be able to enjoy again traffic from a organic results .
In my opinion there were no intention from AC Hotels to misbehave abusing SEO techniques but one may ask :
Where is the boundary between optimization and SEO abuses ?
That ’s a question SEO companies keep on asking themselves , and that ’s why we pay them for .
PS : AC - Hotels can still count on other domain names to drive traffic from Google .
Those domain names have a different design and are registered under a different IP .
They are indexed by Google .

There ’s a saying in Silicon Valley : “ The geeks shall inherit the earth . ”

That ’s a sign , if you needed one , that we have permanently entered a new economy .
Once a term of derision , the label “ geek ” has become a badge of honor , a mark of distinction .
Anyone in any business in any industry with any hope of thriving knows that he or she is utterly dependent on geeks — those technical wizards who create great software and the powerful hardware that runs it .
The geeks know it too — a fact that is reflected in the rich salaries and hefty stock options that they now command .
But how do you manage these geek gods ?
Perhaps no one knows better than Eric Schmidt , CEO of Novell Inc. Schmidt , 44 , is a card - carrying geek himself :
His resume boasts a computer - science PhD and a stint at Sun Microsystems , where he was the chief technology officer and a key developer of the Java software language .
And , as if his technical skills were n’t enough to prove the point , Schmidt even looks the part , with his boy - genius face , his wire - rim spectacles , and his coder ’s pallid complexion .
Two years ago , Schmidt left Sun and took charge at Novell , where he has engineered an impressive turnaround .
After years of gross mismanagement , the $ 1 billion networking - software company , headquartered in Provo , Utah , had been written off by competitors and industry observers alike .
Since Schmidt ’s arrival , however , the company has become steadily profitable , its stock price has more than doubled , and , within its field , Novell has again come to be seen as a worthy competitor to Microsoft .
A good deal of the credit for Novell ’s turnaround must go to Schmidt , who excels at getting the best out of his geeks .
He has used his tech savvy to bring focus to Novell ’s product line and his geek - cred to reenergize a workforce of highly skilled but ( until recently ) deeply dispirited technologists .
In general , Schmidt speaks of his geeks in complimentary terms , while acknowledging their vulnerabilities and shortcomings .
“ One of the main characteristics of geeks is that they are very truthful , ” says Schmidt ( who , in fact , uses the term “ geek ” only occassionally ) .
“ They are taught to think logically .
If you ask engineers a precise question , they will give you a precisely truthful answer .
That also tends to mean that they ’ll only answer the question that you asked them .
If you do n’t ask them exactly the right question , sometimes they ’ll evade you — not because they ’re lying but because they ’re being so scrupulously truthful . ”
With that rule of geek behavior in mind , Fast Company went to Novell headquarters to ask Schmidt a series of precise , carefully worded questions .
His answers add up to a short course in how to bring out the best in your geeks .
You ’ve got to have your own geeks Today innovation drives any business .
And since you do n’t want to outsource your innovation , you need to have your own geeks .
Look at trends in e-commerce :
Who would have thought that all of these “ old ” companies would have to face huge new distribution - channel issues , all of which are driven by technology ?
The truth is , you need to have a stable of technologists around — not just to run your systems but also to help you figure out which strategies to pursue , which innovations to invest in , and which partnerships to form .
advertisement
The geeks control the limits of your business .
It ’s a fact of life :
If the technologists in your company invent something ahead of everybody else , then all of a sudden your business will get bigger .
Otherwise , it will get smaller .
You simply have to recognize and accept the critical role that technologists play .
All new - economy businesses share that property .
Get to know your geek community According to the traditional stereotype , geeks are people who are primarily fascinated by technology and its uses .
The negative part of that stereotype is the assumption that they have poor social skills .
Like most stereotypes , it ’s true in general — but false at the level of specifics .
By society ’s definition , they are antisocial .
But within their own community , they are actually quite social .
You ’ll find that they break themselves into tribes : mainframe - era graybeards , Unix people who started out 20 years ago , the new PC - plus - Web generation .
They ’re tribal in the way that they subdivide their own community , but the tribes do n’t fight each other .
In fact , those tribes get along very well — because all of them fight management .
Perhaps the least - becoming aspect of the geek community is its institutional arrogance .
Remember , just because geeks have underdeveloped social skills does n’t mean that they do n’t have egos .
Tech people are uppity by definition : A lot of them would like to have been astronauts .
They enjoy the limelight .
In a power relationship with management , they have more in common with pro basketball players than they do with average workers .
Think of your techies as free agents in a highly specialized sports draft .
And the more specialized they are , the more you need to be concerned about what each of them needs as an individual .
Learn what your geeks are looking for
This is a golden era for geeks — it does n’t get any better than this .
In the early 1970s , an engineering recession hit , and we reached a low point in engineering and technical salaries .
Ever since then , salaries have been going way up .
Geeks have figured out that increasing their compensation through stock options is only fair :
They expect to share in the wealth that they help to create through technology .
Today technology salaries are at least twice the national average .
In fact , tech salaries are going through the roof , and non-tech salaries are not — which presents a serious problem for many companies .
But , as important as money is to tech people , it ’s not the most important thing .
Fundamentally , geeks are interested in having an impact .
They believe in their ideas , and they like to win .
They care about getting credit for their accomplishments .
In that sense , they ’re no different from a scientist who wants credit for work that leads to a Nobel Prize .
They may not be operating at that exalted level , but the same principle applies .
Create new ways to promote your geeks
If you do n’t want to lose your geeks , you have to find a way to give them promotions without turning them into managers .
Most of them are not going to make very good executives — and , in fact , most of them would probably turn out to be terrible managers .
But you need to give them a forward career path , you need to give them recognition , and you need to give them more money .
advertisement
Twenty years ago , we developed the notion of a dual career ladder , with an executive career track on one side and a technical career track on the other .
Creating a technical ladder is a big first step .
But it ’s also important to have other kinds of incentives , such as awards , pools of stock , and nonfinancial kinds of compensation .
At Novell , we just added a new title : distinguished engineer .
To become a distinguished engineer , you have to get elected by your peers .
That requirement is a much tougher standard than being chosen by a group of executives .
It ’s also a standard that encourages tech people to be good members of the tech community .
It acts to reinforce good behavior on everyone ’s part .
Either Geeks are part of the solution — or they ’re the problem
Here ’s another thing you need to know about the geek mind - set :
Because tech people are scientists or engineers by training , they love to solve really hard problems .
They love to tackle a challenge .
The more you can get them to feel that they ’re helping to come up with a solution to a tough problem , the more likely they are to perform in a way that works for you .
When you talk with them , your real goal should be to engage them in a dialogue about what you and they are trying to do .
If you can get your engineering team to agree with what you ’re trying to accomplish , then you ’ll see them self - organize to achieve that outcome .
You ’ll also need to figure out what they ’re trying to accomplish — because , no matter what you want , that ’s probably what they ’re going to do .
The next thing you need to remember is that you can tell them what to do , but you ca n’t tell them how to do it .
You might as well say to a great artist , “ I ’ll describe to you what a beautiful painting is .
Then I ’ll give you an idea for a particular painting .
I ’ll tell you which colors to use .
I ’ll tell you which angle to use .
Now you just paint that painting . ”
You ’d never get a great painting out of any artist that way — and you ’ll never get great work out of your geeks if you try to talk to them like that .
You need to give them a problem or a set of objectives , provide them with a large amount of hardware , and then ask them to solve the problem .
The best judges of geeks are other geeks
Make sure that there is always peer - group pressure within your project teams .
For example , if you want to motivate your project leaders , just require them to make presentations to each other .
They care a great deal about how they are perceived within their own web of friends and by the professional community that they belong to .
They ’re very good at judging their own .
And they ’re often very harsh :
They end up marginalizing the people who are terrible — for reasons that you as a manager may not quite understand .
It sounds like I ’m touting tech people as gods , but there are plenty of bad projects , and there is plenty of bad engineering and bad technology .
You ’re always going to encounter techies who are arrogant and who are n’t as good as they think they are .
A team approach is the best way to deal with that problem .
Tech people know how to deal with the wild ducks in their group — on their own and with the right kind of peer pressure .
advertisement
Look for the natural leaders among your geeks
In a high - tech company that is run by engineers , what matters most is being right .
And what ’s “ right ” is determined by outcomes .
You can listen to lots of exceptionally bright people talk about their brilliant vision .
I ’ve done it for the past 25 years .
But what matters is , Which ones deliver on their vision ?
When a project is on the line , who actually gets the job done ?
Every team has a natural leader — and often that leader is not a team ’s official manager .
Your job is to get the team motivated .
Once you do that , the natural leaders will emerge very quickly .
If you keep an eye on the team , you can figure out who those natural leaders are — and then make sure that they ’re happy and that they have everything they need to do their job .
For instance , natural leaders need to feel that they have access to the company ’s senior managers .
Do n’t forget :
They feel like they ’re changing the world — so you need to make them feel like you ’re helping them do that .
There are easy ways that you can help them out .
For example , encourage them to bypass layers of middle management and to send you email directly .
Sure , that will piss off the people in middle management , but it ’s better to piss off those people than to piss off your key project leaders .
Be prepared for when the geeks hit the fan
You can divide project teams into two categories .
First , there is the preferred variety :
You get an engineering team that ’s absolutely brilliant , that executes well , and that ’s exactly right in its assumptions .
Second , there is the more usual variety :
You get an engineering team that has a very strong opinion about what it ’s trying to do — but that ’s on the wrong track , because some of its assumptions are wrong .
That second kind of team is what you have to focus your attention on .
But often you ca n’t intervene from the top down .
You have to find a way to come at the problem from the side .
At Novell , we have a series of checkpoints at which our teams get lateral feedback — feedback that comes from outside of the management hierarchy .
Every six weeks , we have three days of product reviews .
But it ’s not just management conducting those reviews .
We also bring in smart technologists with good memories :
They remind us of what everybody committed to .
In most technology companies , there are always a few people who , everyone agrees , have better taste than anyone else .
Those are the people whom everyone goes to ; they serve as reviewers or advisers .
At Sun Microsystems , for instance , it ’s Bill Joy .
At Novell , it ’s Drew Major , the founder and chief scientist .
Everyone knows that when Drew gets involved in a project , he ’ll size up quickly what needs to get done , and people will listen to him .
advertisement
In general , as long as you consider everyone ’s ideas , most teams react well to management decisions .
If you have to make a business decision that conflicts with what your engineers want to do , they ’ll accept it — as long as it is truly a business decision .
On the other hand , if the decision is based on a technology analysis by someone whom the engineers do not respect professionally , then they ’ll never agree to it .
So , if you ’re facing a decision that you know will affect a team negatively , you must vet that decision through a technologist who has that team ’s respect .
Too many geeks spoil the soup
If you want your geeks to be productive , keep your teams small .
The productivity of any project is inversely proportional to the size of the project team .
In the software business , most problems draw on the efforts of large numbers of people .
Typically , companies deal with a problem by putting together a large team and then giving that team a mission .
But in this industry , that approach almost never works .
The results are almost invariably disappointing .
Still , people keep doing it that way — presumably because that ’s the way they did it last year .
The question is , How do you break out of that mode ?
It seems to be a cancer on the industry .
On a large team , the contributions of the best people are always smaller , and overall productivity is always lower .
As a general rule , you can count on each new software project doubling in team size and in the amount of code involved — and taking twice as long — as the preceding project .
In other words , the average duration of your projects will go from 2 years to 4 years to 8 years to 16 years , and so on .
You can see that cycle with almost any technology .
Two or three people invent a brilliant piece of software , and then , five years later , 1,000 people do a bad job of following up on their idea .
History is littered with projects that follow this pattern : Windows , Unix , Java , Netscape Navigator .
The smaller the team , the faster the team members work .
When you make the team smaller , you make the schedule shorter .
That may sound counterintuitive , but it ’s been true for the past 20 years in this industry , and it will be true for another 20 years .
The only method that I ’ve found that works is to restrict the size of teams arbitrarily and painfully .
Here ’s a simple rule of thumb for techie teams :
No team should ever be larger than the largest conference room that ’s available for them to meet in .
At Novell , that means a limit of about 50 people .
We separate extremely large projects into what we call “ Virtual CDs . ”
Think of each project as creating a CD - ROM of software that you can ship .
It ’s an easy concept : Each team has to ship a CD of software in final form to someone else — perhaps to another team , perhaps to an end user .
When you treat each project as a CD , you enable one group to say to another , “ Show me the schedule for your CD .
When is this deliverable coming ? ”
It ’s the kind of down - to - earth approach that everyone can understand , that techies can respect and respond to , and that makes almost any kind of project manageable .

Wabi -Sabi ’s simplicity Matt 12 comments Latest by Klemensowski
Wabi-sabi is the Japanese philosophy that embraces a beauty of things imperfect , impermanent , and incomplete .
It is a beauty of things modest and humble .
“ Pare down to the essence , but do n’t remove the poetry .
Keep things clean and unencumbered but do n’t sterilize , ” says Leonard Koren , author of Wabi - Sabi : for Artists , Designers , Poets & Philosophers .
For a good summary , check out A Culture of Simplicity , a brief article by Koren .
It ’s interesting to see how much this ancient Japanese philosphy relates to the world of interface design and programming .
“ Things wabi-sabi are unstudied and inevitable looking … unpretentious … Their craftsmanship may be impossible to discern . ”
Inevitable looking … that ’s a great way to describe smart interfaces .
Other tenets of Wabi -Sabi that resonate :
The emphasis on subtle details , even if noticed only by vigilant viewers .
The importance of looking closely .
The effectiveness of small doses .
Having quiet authority without having to be the center of attention .
Simplicity .
Working with a limited palette and keeping features to a minimum .
Realizing something ’s “ interestingness ” has nothing to do with how complex it is .
More Wabi-Sabi ideas from A Culture of Simplicity — relating to design , programming , and the importance of less — after the jump .

Enough already with the megapixels
Originally published 2005 in Atomic : Maximum Power Computing
Last modified 28 - Feb -2012 .
Generally speaking , the march of technological progress gives consumers what they expect .
More stuff for less money , all the time .
Hurrah .
Sometimes , though , some segment of the high - tech industry gets caught in an unprogressive eddy for a while .
And it 's usually the fault of oversimplification .
As Albert Einstein said , everything should be made as simple as possible , but not simpler .
Boiling complex concepts down to simple numbers always makes it easier for people to think they understand them , but they often actually do n't .
Take IQ , for instance .
The Intelligence Quotient was n't intended by its inventors ( a century ago ) to be an actual measurement of " general intelligence " ; it 's pretty obvious to anybody who thinks about the issue for a moment that general intelligence , as a simple quantifiable thing , does n't exist - you can't describe this or this with just one number .
IQ was meant to be a technical tool to identify schoolchildren who needed extra help .
But try telling the average person that today , especially if the last Web IQ test they took gave them a score of 145 .
In computing , there 's clock speed .
Nobody judges the worth of a car based on its engine RPM redline , but megahertz provide an easy way to decide which computer 's fastest .
The fact that this way does n't actually work does not weigh heavily on the minds of those who use it .
Lots of people are confident that their 3GHz P4 must be much faster than their neighbour 's stupid 2.4GHz Athlon 64 X2 - or that they 've been ripped off , when WCPUID tells them their " 4800 + " X2 only runs at 2.4GHz .
And so it is with digital cameras .
Lots of people assume that a camera with more megapixels must take better pictures than one with fewer .
The truth can actually , quite often , be exactly the opposite .
And it 's getting worse .
Consumer digital cameras always have teeny tiny little sensor chips in them .
Sony 's popular DSC - F828 , for instance , is an " eight megapixel " camera with what 's known as a " 2/3 inch " sensor .
That sounds reasonably large , but the chip is actually only 8.8 by 6.6 millimetres - smaller than my little fingernail .
The sensor size specification goes back to the old vacuum - tube TV camera days , and comes from measurements of the outside of the tube 's glass envelope , not from the actual size of the imaging portion at the end .
Eight million pixels on something the size of a Rice Bubble means , of course , that the pixels are very small .
So small , in fact that the " micron " - one millionth of a metre - is a suitable unit for measuring them .
The F828's " photosites " - the actual physical sensors , covered with coloured filters , from which the image is built up - are 2.7 microns across .
For comparison , the Canon EOS - 5D , the cheapest DSLR with a full 35 mm - frame - sized sensor , has a 12.7MP sensor , but 8.2 - micron photosites .
The eight - megapixel Canon EOS - 20D and its successor have only 6.4 - micron photosites , versus 7.4 microns for the older six - megapixel cameras with the same sensor size .
The DALSA 33 - megapixel chip that powers the Leaf Aptus 75 medium / large format back - yours for only $ US30,000 ! - has 7.2 - micron photosites .
So what , I hear you say .
The F828 takes good pictures , does n't it ?
And yes , actually it does .
Lots of professional photographers have an F828 in their photographic arsenal along with lots of bigger , heavier , more expensive gear , because small " prosumer " cameras like this genuinely can take top - flight pictures , and are far more manageable in strange and / or " candid " situations than the heavy artillery toted by those who hunt nude celebrities .
But there are now plenty of rather cheaper consumer cameras out there that have 8 MP sensors , because every manufacturer knows it 's hard to sell a five or six megapixel camera when your competitor 's shiny new 8 MP model 's on the shelf for not much more money .
Consumers do n't know much about lens specs or autofocus speed , but they can do basic megapixel arithmetic real good .
8 MP consumer cameras do n't take pictures as technically good as those from the F828 , and the F828 is n't , in turn , as good in some respects as the more expensive , larger - sensored digital SLRs with the same pixel count .
That 's partly because it 's more difficult to get a lens to focus an image perfectly on a smaller sensor .
As sensor size falls , the precision of the internal focussing becomes more and more critical for a given pixel count .
But bigger photosites can also hold more charge than little ones , while having similar inherent noise - which , to date , nobody 's figured out a way to avoid without the use of stacked Peltier devices at least and liquid nitrogen at most .
What this means is that the signal - to - noise ratio of bigger photosites is better .
All other things being equal , bigger photosites give a less noisy , " grainy " image .
Lower noise , in turn , means you can get more sensitivity out of the sensor for the same amount of image grain .
Cheap consumer cameras today often deliver noticeably noisy , " fast film " - looking images at ISO 400 ( the same sensitivity as the fastest film you 'll find at the supermarket ) .
Big - sensored DSLRs today commonly make cleaner images than this at ISO 1600 ( the fastest rating for any colour film ) , or even 3200 .
So , why the little sensors ?
Well , they 're cheaper to make .
Much cheaper .
Image sensors are made with technology closely related to that used to make ordinary silicon chips , and a full frame 35 mm sensor has almost eight times the area of a Prescott P4 die .
A " 2/3 inch " sensor has seven per cent of a full frame sensor 's area - and virtually all consumer cameras have considerably smaller sensors than that !
Noise is n't a direct function of photosite size .
As you 'd expect , modern high - res sensors have far lower noise levels than do lower pixel count sensors from several years ago .
But the sensor makers seldom make great strides in just one or two generations of sensor , and right now they 're definitely not keeping up with the camera companies ' demand for ever higher sensor resolution .
Sony are a good example to choose , here , because they clearly know this is a problem .
Their 10 MP DSC - R1 is an integrated - lens " point and shoot " camera , but it has an APS - sized sensor , the same as most DSLRs ( more expensive DSLRs have a sensor as big as a full 35 mm film frame ) .
Sony proudly claim the R1 sensor has five times the sensitivity and 2.5 times the dynamic range of the sensor in the F828 .
The R1 also has a very good lens ; despite its 5X zoom , it gives the camera overall resolution slightly better than that from Canon 's 8MP EOS 350D DSLR with a sharp prime lens on it .
So , OK , the R1 pretty much uses all of its sensor resolution .
It probably never manages to capture an actual ten million pixels worth of image detail , but it 's better to have a few more pixels than you need than a few , um , fewer .
Fair enough .
But , despite its sensor size , the R1 loses handily to the 350D for high sensitivity use , no matter what lens you put on the DSLR - and the R1 is far better for high sensitivity use than the zillions of tiny - sensor cameras out there .
We 're already seeing cameras like the Konica Minolta DiMAGE X1 .
It 's one of those super - subcompact flat cameras with a folded lens system - lens window in the corner , no protruding barrel - and has an eight megapixel " 1/1.8 inch " ( 7.18 by 5.32 mm ) sensor .
This is madness .
Folded lenses are great - they let you have a camera with considerable zoom capability with the form factor of a rather skinny cigarette packet .
But they have a hard time delivering even 1600 by 1200 pixels worth of detail .
This one 's being used to make files with four times that number of pixels .
And every small 8 MP sensor , up to and including the one in the F828 , has serious noise issues .
They 're fine for short exposures at low ISO settings , but if you want long exposures or high sensitivity , you just can't have them without a snowstorm of noise .
The X1's got an anti-shake system , which is good , but its sensitivity only goes up to ISO 200 , to keep noise levels below the " dreadful " threshold .
It responds slowly ( as it tries to push all that data around without killing its tiny battery ) , and it wastes card space with big image files full of fuzzy pixels .
Konica Minolta could have made the X1 better by putting a ( much ) lower resolution and lower noise sensor in it , and leaving the anti-shake out .
More pictures per memory card , cheaper camera , faster response ( the X1's got a very retro monster shutter lag ... ) - all gone , because of megapixel fever .
The three megapixel DiMAGE Xt goes to ISO 400 with lower noise than the X1 at ISO 200 .
It is , in every important department , just a better camera , despite being two years older .
Digicam nuts have a tendency to obsess over noise , when film photographers came to terms with it rather a while ago ( and , in many cases , have now switched to digital if low noise is important to them ) .
But that does n't mean that paying more money for a camera with the same real resolution and more noise makes sense .
You can overcome the time - and - space - wasting problem if you just use your over - resolutioned camera in medium - res mode all the time .
Nothing nasty should happen to the image quality as a result ( it 's been some time since anyone 's been dumb enough to release a digicam that uses nearest neighbour image scaling ... ) , but you 're unlikely to see better high sensitivity performance , either .
So what 's the take - home message ?
Well , if you 're shopping for an ordinary digicam , bear in mind that money spent on higher resolution may actually be buying you less than nothing .
A lower resolution camera can actually be a better product in every respect .
Of course , the camera companies just can't sell lower res cameras any more .
Even entry level models are averaging 5MP as I write this - real resolution has n't , of course , improved much since the 2MP days .
If you want a decent range of lower resolution , lower priced cameras , you therefore need to consider buying old stock , or second hand .
This leads to the same problems you face when buying any used gadget - apart from the obvious wear and tear issues , you 're likely to find that lithium ion batteries for gadgets a few years old may be dead as stones , and replacements that are n't also dead may be hard to find .
So you 'll probably be wanting a camera that runs from AAs and has n't been used much , which can require a bit of shopping around .
It still leaves you with quite a lot of model options , though .
I hope you and your $ 200 Coolpix 990 or DiMAGE 7 Hi ( or somewhat cheaper C - 2500 L ... ) are very happy together .
No matter how you spun it , a lawsuit was waiting to pounce on YouTube .
And when the lawsuit came , it would be from multi-billion dollar media conglomerates .
Worst of all , people feared it would trigger a landslide of more lawsuits .
Even still , Google bought YouTube .
And now the billion dollar war has begun .
I wondered : Maybe Google actually wanted to be sued .
Backroom Discussions
First of all , in a perfect world , no , Google would n’t want this .
And Google , hoping that the world is close enough to perfect , did buy YouTube .
But somewhere during discussions , someone must have asked , “ How is this different from Morpheus and Kazaa ?
Wo n’t we be sued into oblivion ? ”
The smart lawyers at Google probably mentioned something about the DMCA , but honestly , would you want to buy a company that would be hated , constantly , by the very people who own the content that keeps you afloat ?
Or better , how will such a site remain # 1 if there is a ( Edit : added link ) unified effort by content owners to either displace or destroy you ?
Most of all , media companies , who have significant clout and money , would n’t let YouTube host their content for free without a fight .
There was more to this purchase than meets the eye .
No matter how you look at it , the purchase came with a lot of legal risk .
I believe nobody at Google is surprised that Viacom is suing and wants $ 1 billion , A.K.A. most of the sum Google paid for YouTube .
This is all part of the expected road map in owning YouTube .
So plan A was to hope people would be nice and look the other way .
That worked for a year so far , and Google hoped it would continue .
Plan B was to get sued .
This is n’t any ordinary “ get sued and win ” plan .
Waiting to get sued so you can win in court is a defensive move for most companies .
But for Google , this is preemptive .
This is about Google defending YouTube , instead of YouTube defending YouTube .
Why Getting Sued is a Preemptive Strategy
Let ’s pretend that YouTube was not bought out because talks got delayed .
Then realize that it would have probably been sued a lot sooner by a lot more people .
Investors would flee and nobody would want the company now .
If YouTube goes broke , that would have likely pushed Myspace Video to # 1 , giving News Corp a huge edge since it happens to own Fox Entertainment .
Myspace Video would become whatever was in the best interest of Big Media .
Probably a DRM infested piece of crap that sued its users for uploading copyrighted material .
( Edit : )
If you do n’t think Myspace would have hopped into the throne , you may want to see this recent report that shows how Myspace video is # 2 in the video market .
And as the trend goes , Myspace is actually losing share in the video market ( 3 % between December 2006 and January 2007 ) .
Seeing as how 16 % of all YouTube traffic comes from Myspace , you ca n’t say YouTube is n’t causing serious harm to Myspace videos , keeping it from becoming # 1 .
On the other hand , if YouTube did n’t go broke and fought the lawsuits , imagine if they had lost .
Myspace Video gets to keep whatever edge it has , but virtually every other video site on the Internet becomes illegal overnight .
Thousands of user records and IP addresses would get subpoenaed , and video sharing dies in one fell swoop .
Why Does Video Sharing Matter to Google ?
What ’s the next big thing on the net ?
Video .
Google cares what happens in video sharing because it wants a slice of the video ad market .
It does n’t want to just be in the market , it wants to own it like it owns text ads .
But that ’s not the whole answer .
Google bought YouTube because it wanted to make sure of three things :
Google has first dibs for video ads on the biggest video site on the Internet YouTube remains legal Expand and protect current fair use related provisions involving copying intellectual property
The first point is obvious , and the second point feeds into point # 1 .
But the third point is the most important for Google .
If YouTube were to lose a lawsuit for hosting intellectual property , it would severely weaken Google ’s position in a variety of current and future endeavors .
Any aspirations Google has of someday crawling and indexing video content ( nope , they do n’t have this technology yet ) would now be in legal limbo .
It would also potentially re-introduce new arguments against their Google Image Search .
And their book search program might suffer a similar fate once the YouTube precedent settles in .
Google , being a company that spiders and indexes ( stores ) massive amounts of copyrighted information , would now be in serious legal jeopardy .
YouTube is Google ’s Future
Thus , Google not only threw money at YouTube : it threw its lawyers at YouTube too .
Google ’s lawyers are some of the most well - versed copyright lawyers in the world since so many of their lawsuits deal with that issue .
The goal here is simple .
Google wants to own the # 1 video sharing site ( completely legal ) , own 100 % of the ads on that site , and clarify many currently - ambiguous copyright issues in their favor .
If all of that goes as planned , the $ 1.5 billion paid to YouTube was a small price to pay .
But if they had never gotten involved , the potential losses were far greater than a billion or two .
Since Google has a market capitalization of over $ 130 billion , even a dip of 1 % means losses of over $ 1 billion .
But if entire sections of their business model became legally uncertain , you can bet they ’d lose a lot more than 1 % , especially with their insanely high P/E ratio ( the ratio between what their stock is worth and how much they make ) .
By fighting a lawsuit , Google gets to prove the legitimacy of Internet video distribution – something that will probably never flourish under the “ old media ” regime .
Unfortunately for them , the DMCA protects site owners from liability of what its users do — or at least that ’s the general interpretation .
Letting YouTube fight this battle alone with their own lawyers might have resulted in a very public and unnecessary loss that would have crippled Google ’s video ambitions and possibly caused collateral damage to a bunch of related industries ( especially search ) .
This would have forced everybody to play by the conglomerates ’ rules , and taken anyway any guarantee of Google getting any cut of the video ad pie .
Video sharing needs this clarification before it can move forward .
And if Google legitimizes it , they will have the biggest video site on the web for their video ads to play .
So let ’s ask ourselves again : would Google pay $ 1.5 billion so it can fight the lawsuit on behalf of YouTube ?
Now that I think about it , it seems like a wise long term move .

This will most likely cause second glances and inquiries aplenty .
Pretty clever .

The note was written during UN summit talks
Enlarge Image
But when you are the US president , at a gathering of more than 150 world leaders , it is even more tricky .
While talk at the UN world summit was focused on terrorism and internal reform , George W Bush appeared to have been caught short .
And , he is said to have turned to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice for advice .
" I think I may need a bathroom break ?
Is this possible ? " a Reuters news agency photographer caught him writing in a note to Ms Rice .
The photograph , and Mr Bush 's apparent request for permission to pee , has been the subject of discussion on a number of satirical websites .
President Bush was among monarchs , presidents and prime ministers for the opening of the three - day summit , marking the 60th anniversary of the UN .
In a speech , he urged the UN to pursue meaningful reforms to allow it to meet modern challenges and said the US was committed to helping overcome poverty .
Hundreds of the angry iTunes customers are convening on the company 's support forms , demanding to know why they did not receive their Ticketmaster pre-sale code Monday evening as Apple had led them to believe .
In an April press release advocating the promotion , Apple said : " Red Hot Chili Peppers fans who pre-order the album on iTunes will also receive an email with a code that they can use at Ticketmaster.com starting May 9 to purchase concert tickets before they go on sale to the general public on May 13 .
" A large majority of the customers still had not received their codes by Tuesday afternoon , despite the fact that pre-sales for many of the band 's shows had already begun .
Some of these customers reported receiving blank emails or emails about the promotion that lacked the special code , while others say they received no correspondence from Apple whatsoever .
One customer looking to purchase tickets for the Chili Peppers ' Toronto , Canada show had not received his ticket code on Tuesday when he was informed that floor seats for the show had already sold out .
" I do n't have my code yet either .
This is the whole reason I pre-ordered Stadium Arcadium in the first place , " said another disgruntled customer who plunked down $ 20 to participate in the promo .
" Will someone at Apple please give us a shout ?
" Apple has made no official comment on the issue , though several customers who contacted the company 's various telephone hotlines were informed " Apple is aware of the problem " and that it is " working to get the emails [ with the codes ] out as soon as possible . "
The campaign began a push yesterday to deal with its Iraq challenge .
Besides her remarks in New Hampshire , Mrs. Clinton submitted a bill in the Senate to block sending more troops to Iraq , though she would not cut off financing .
In a new video on her Web site , she called for starting to redeploy troops within 90 days — or else , she threatened , Congress should revoke authorization for the war .
“ She is in a box now on her Iraq vote , but she does n’t want to be in a different , even worse box — the vacillating , flip - flopping Democratic candidate that went to defeat in 2000 and ‘ 04 , ” said one adviser to Mrs. Clinton .
“ She wants to maintain a firmness , and I think a lot of people around her hope she maintains a firmness .
That ’s what people will want in 2008 . ”
Indeed , Mrs. Clinton believes that reversing course on her vote would invite the charge of flip - flopping that damaged Mr. Kerry or provoke the kind of accusations of political expediency that hung over Al Gore in 2000 and her and her husband , President Bill Clinton , in the 1990s , several advisers said .
She has argued to associates in private discussions that Mr. Gore and Mr. Kerry lost , in part , because they could not convince enough Americans that they were resolute on national security , the associates said .
Mrs. Clinton ’s image as a strong leader , in turn , is critical to her hopes of becoming the nation ’s first female president .
According to one adviser , her internal polling indicates that a high proportion of Democrats see her as strong and tough , both assets particularly valuable to a female candidate who is seeking to become commander in chief .
Apologizing might hurt that image , this adviser said .
Mrs. Clinton ’s belief in executive power and authority is another factor weighing against an apology , advisers said .
As a candidate , Mrs. Clinton likes to think and formulate ideas as if she were president — her “ responsibility gene , ” she has called it .
In that vein , she believes that a president usually deserves the benefit of the doubt from Congress on matters of executive authority .
Yet some Democrats are surprised that the Clinton campaign , which is widely regarded as a ferocious political operation , has not lanced this issue .
After all , they said , a majority of Democrats tell pollsters they are against the war , and many Americans want a firm deadline to leave Iraq .
Mrs. Clinton has called for capping the troop level , but has opposed a deadline .
“ For the life of me I do n’t understand why she ca n’t say , ‘ I made a mistake , I was misled , the country was misled , the intelligence was manipulated , ’ ” said Robert M. Shrum , a senior adviser to Mr. Kerry in 2004 .
“ I think there ’s this tremendous desire in her campaign not to get into a position where you ’re identified with traditional Democratic views .
But this is now a party that is strongly antiwar , and is desperate for change on big issues like Iraq and health care . ”

Mathemagician ( Original title : Impressions of Conway )
" Have I done this to you yet ? "
He grabbed my hand and held it out in front of him , palm down .
Before I could react , he pulled a rubber stamp out of his pocket , and my hand suddenly was emblazoned with big red letters .
" John H. Conway 's Seal of Grudging Approval . "
Within seconds , it had smeared to three red lines that would n't wash off for several days .
Still grasping my hand , he pulled me toward his office .
Brightly colored polyhedra hung in disarray from a network of strings dangling from the ceiling .
The dim outline of a computer terminal was visible through a pile of Rubik 's cubes and wooden toroids .
" We 'll be better off in the undergraduate lounge .
The doctor says I should rest , and I can lie down over there . "
He pulled me across the hall , into a room where tinkertoys buried the shelves and tables but did n't cover the chairs .
He lay down on a sofa , crossed his legs , and put his hands behind his head .
" You did n't comment on my shirt , " he said .
It depicted a boldly colored Escher print , where fishes transformed into birds , then boats , back to fish again , and finally into horses before disappearing under his belt .
He did n't wait for a reply .
" Well , off we go !
I was born in Liverpool , England .
Do you want to know how old I am ? "
" If you do n't mind , " I said , desperately trying to keep up .
" I was born on December the twenty - sixth , 1937 .
No , I do n't mind .
I actually did mind once ... I 'll tell you about it some time if you like . "
" O.K . Do you ... "
" When I was first married , my first wife was seven years older than I was , " he continued .
" She was very , very much worried by this .
I 'm afraid I was n't particularly sympathetic .
Every time she passed a decade , she would be terribly , terribly depressed .
And then a few years ago when I turned fifty - oh , my God , it was absolutely awful ! "
He grinned , slightly embarrassed .
" I suddenly had a wave of sympathy for her . "
As Conway stroked his bushy beard , he resembled the unemployed younger brother of Santa Claus .
His hair and clothing were in disarray , yet he looked distinguished .
It was an odd combination , yet perfectly suited to a mathematician .
" Anyhow , I enjoyed living in England , but it was really hard growing up during wartime .
I remember I saw a banana , once . "
It was a really small one , and it was n't yet ripe .
Every day , Conway would check to see whether it was ready to be eaten .
" And then the great day came .
My mother divided it , and I got a piece - and I did n't like it very much , after all that fuss . "
Once , when he was five or six , he went to a birthday party , and each guest received a balloon .
" Of course I had seen one , but I had never actually owned one . "
Conway frowned .
" When it burst two days later , I was absolutely inconsolable . "
His parents talked to the family who gave him the balloon , but they did n't have any more .
There were none to be found anywhere , due to the wartime shortage of materials .
" Times were hard .
My father was almost a teacher of Chemistry , he was actually a laboratory assistant officially .
Mathematics was n't his specialty , but he certainly knew about it . "
Conway reached into his pocket and pulled out a well - worn box of cards .
" Have I shown you this one ? "
He took the pack out of the box and started pulling cards off of the top and putting them at the bottom .
" A , C , E , " he said , pulling off one card per letter .
He then flipped over the next card , which happened to be the ace .
" T , W , O , " he continued , then flipped over the two .
" Would you like to try ? "
He handed the deck to me .
" T , H , R , E , E , " I said , then flipped over the next card .
The joker .
" No , silly , " he cried .
" Here 's how you do it : T , H , R , E , E . "
He flipped over the three .
" Try again . " " F , O , U , R . " Joker .
The deck was passed back and forth - I always got jokers while he got the correct card .
At last , he finished .
Carefully rearranging the deck into the necessary order for the trick , he put it back in his pocket , ready for the next victim .
" Math was always there for me , " Conway said , settling back on the sofa .
" My mother said that when I was three or four , I knew the powers of two .
When I was about eleven , I changed schools , as do all English children .
I remember that at an interview for my new school , I told the interviewer that I wanted to be a mathematician at Cambridge .
I do n't remember what could have sparked such interest . "
Conway was at the top of the class in almost everything , until he reached high school , when it ceased .
However , he was always the best student in math .
" I liked math above all other subjects , but I used to go through phases .
I still do .
I was very , very interested in fossils for a time , then I liked spiders .
But most of all , I loved astronomy . "
Suddenly , he sat up and leaned toward me .
" Do you know that two years ago I became interested in astronomy again ?
I learned the names of all the visible stars in the northern hemisphere .
Here 's Orion . "
Jabbing his finger in the air to denote the location of each star , he recited all of their names .
" ... Betelgeuse , Mintaka , and Saiph .
I like knowing things .
When a constellation is covered up by a cloud , I predict where the stars will be when the cloud moves away .
I really get a feeling of power - knowing what will happen is almost like making it happen . "
A graduate student wandered into the lounge .
" Nice shirt ! "
Conway looked at his belly .
" Do you really like it ? "
He leaped off of the couch .
" I 'll be back in a moment . "
He stepped outside with the student , rummaged around in his hopelessly cluttered office , and finally handed over a pile of papers .
" That 's going to my book , you see , " he said , grinning .
" Well , not really mine .
This person decided to write up some of my lectures , and I 've finally gotten around to approving his writeups .
That 's what this silly stamp is for , " he said , pulling it from his pocket and waving it .
I hid my hands behind my back .
" The book will be called ' The Sensual Form , ' as I describe how to ' see ' a quadratic form - a second - degree polynomial - and ' hear ' and ' feel ' it , after a fashion .
Now , where were we ... oh , yes , astronomy .
Oh !
Have I shown you this yet ?
Name a day . "
" Tomorrow . "
" Waning gibbous .
Now give me a harder one . "
I chose another day , and within five seconds , he told me the phase of the moon on that day .
" It 's a very simple formula , actually , but it looks really impressive .
I just like knowing these things , and showing off .
I like to impress people . "
He smiled .
" You know , Cambridge had these lovely , lovely gardens .
That 's one of the things I miss most about England .
And I used to walk through the gardens and look at the flowers - and I knew why the petals of the daffodil were arranged the way they were . "
Conway stroked his beard as he thought .
" When I was a student at Cambridge , I used to go to a small coffee shop and do anagram crosswords .
One day a procession came in , and one woman was carrying a fake daffodil - and it only had five petals .
There have to be six !
It made me rather annoyed ; I guess that it should n't have . "
He smiled .
" You know , there is a beauty in nature that is too subtle for man .
It really bothers me that when artists paint a pineapple , they always make the lines symmetric .
They are n't symmetric , and that 's the real beauty of the thing .
The asymmetry is related to the Fibonacci sequence - there might be eight grooves in one direction , and thirteen in the other , so the lines do n't meet symmetrically .
And artists ignore this .
Another thing that nobody notices is a brick wall . "
Six months ago , he had gone through a ' brick wall ' phase , which culminated in his giving a lecture called ' How to stare at a brick wall . '
He described , in detail , the enormous variety of intricate patterns that can be found in brick walls .
" And nobody looks at these damn things ! "
With no warning , Conway leaned forward and whipped out his pack of cards again .
" Numbers or suits , " he asked me .
" Suits , " I replied .
After shuffling the deck a few times , he flipped four cards off of the top .
One was from each suit .
He went through the deck , flipping over the cards , in groups of four , and each time , one was from each suit .
He gathered up the cards , carefully preserving the order .
" Now , numbers . "
He counted off twelve cards .
" Stop !
What 's missing ? "
He looked at the flipped cards , and noticed that ace through queen were all there .
" This one must be the king . "
He turned over the next card from the deck ; " Behold !
The king . "
Putting the cards back in his pocket , Conway sank back into the sofa .
" Game theory was n't my first specialty , you know .
In Cambridge , I got started in number theory . "
His advisor , Harold Davenport , was an eminent number theorist .
" He gave me a very difficult problem - proving a conjecture that said every integer can be written as the sum of thirty seven numbers , each raised to the fifth power .
When I told him that I had solved it , he did n't believe me . "
But the proof was correct .
After carefully going through Conway 's solution , and finding no major flaws , Davenport said , " Well , now , Mr. Conway , what we have here is a poor Ph.D. thesis . "
Though the comment annoyed Conway at first , he realized that it meant that he was free to do whatever he liked .
He went on to study set theory , especially transfinite numbers .
If you ask most people about infinity , they will probably respond something like , " Well , you can count one , two , three - just keep going forever , and that 's infinity . "
In the realm of transfinite numbers , that is only the lowest level of infinity , dubbed w ( the Greek letter omega . )
Conway explained , " Omega is a transfinite number .
These numbers have some very bizarre properties .
For instance , w + 1 does not equal 1 + w ; in fact , 1 + w equals w .
In the same way , 2úw also equals w , while wú2 does not .
So you can see that adding and multiplying transfinite numbers together can give you some very odd results - but they are consistent , and they are very , very interesting . "
The mathematics of adding and multiplying numbers greater than infinity is very strange , but there is a beauty to it .
Instead of counting one , two , three ... and finally getting stuck at infinity , you can keep going -- w + 1 , w + 2 , up to wú2 , wú3 , then go to w2 , w3 , and keep going .
There is no reason to stop - you can go to omega to the omega power , omega to the omega to the omega power , and so on .
When you have done that omega times , just add one , and you have a new creature .
There are infinite infinities in the realm of transfinite numbers .
Conway stared at the ceiling .
" I did n't stay in set theory , however . "
Upon graduation , Conway got a job at Cambridge as a mathematical logician .
" In my late twenties , I became very depressed .
I felt that I was n't doing real mathematics ; I had n't published , and I was feeling very guilty because of that . "
He was studying the symmetries of a certain lattice , and all of a sudden Conway stumbled upon a very large group which nobody had seen before .
A group is a set ( like the integers ) associated with an operation ( like addition ) , which follows certain very restrictive rules .
Finding a new group was so rare and important that Conway was made a Fellow of the Royal Society for his discovery .
" You know , when they make you a Fellow , you get to sign a book which has the signatures of all members of the Royal Society - since 1660 , when it was founded .
It was a great thrill to flip through the pages and see the signatures of I . Newton , C. Wren , and A. Einstein .
And I got to sign J. Conway in that same book .
It gave me a warm feeling . "
" Now what was I going to say ? " he asked abruptly , stroking his beard .
" I have a very odd sort of memory .
I can remember the most useless , obscure details , but when it comes to things that other people think are important , I can't recall them for the life of me .
When I was at Cambridge , I never learned the names of some of my colleagues - and I worked with them for twenty years ! "
Conway smiled a bit , embarrassed .
" But I must have good memory .
I know pi to one thousand places . "
He started rattling off digits as fast as he could catch his breath .
" 3.1415 92653 58979 32384 62643 38327 95028 ... "
I joined in . " ... 84197 16939 93751 05820 ... "
He stopped abruptly .
" How many digits do you know ? " he asked , surprised .
" Oh , only about seventy - five .
I had nothing else to do in computer science class , so I tried to memorize pi . "
Conway nodded .
" I had a similar experience .
When I was an undergraduate , I had a summer job at a biscuit factory .
I had to clean the ceiling of the oven room - and it was completely black with soot .
We worked on a scaffolding which was fifty feet high , and we scrubbed the ceiling .
It soon became apparent that it was futile ; after an hour of hard work , the ceiling changed color from a black matte to a black matte with a sheen . "
Conway and his friends would play poker on the scaffolding , and every so often , climb down , move the scaffolding a few feet , climb up , and resume their game .
Soon he tired of poker , so Conway decided to memorize pi .
" I learned it to seven hundred and seven places - which was the extent to which it was known back then .
A few years later , I learned it up to one thousand . "
He sat up on the couch , and fluffed up the pillow behind his head .
" I convinced my wife to learn it , too .
In fact , every Sunday , we took a romantic little walk to Grantchester , a lovely , lovely little town near Cambridge , and we ate lunch at a pub there .
We would stroll along the road , reciting pi to each other ; she would do twenty places , then I would do twenty , and so forth . "
Conway paused for a moment , and his bushy eyebrows furrowed .
" Yes , I must really have a tremendous memory .
As you know , I crossed the Atlantic in 1985 or 1986 , and became a professor at Princeton .
Several years later , when what 's - his - name ... Harold Shapiro became President of the university , he invited some of the faculty to a dinner party each week .
There were about eight or ten guests , and Shapiro asked each of us to say a few words about ourselves .
I did n't like that one bit .
It reminded me of the recitations of poetry we had to do in elementary school .
So I recited a little poem about elves and goblins that I learned when I was , oh , about six years old .
I had n't thought about since then , and I was able to recall it at an instant .
Well , I was n't invited to a dinner party again .
But I do n't worry about that ; I guess it looks as if I have an irresponsible attitude .
However , to do good work in math , you have to be somewhat irresponsible .
I only started doing real mathematics after I found the Conway group .
I got a much - needed ego boost - obviously I do n't need one anymore .
Anyhow , after I made my name , I could do what I like , even if it was totally trivial .
When I want to play backgammon instead of doing math , I play backgammon .
If the people at Princeton do n't feel that they 're getting their money 's worth out of me , that 's their problem .
They bought me ! "
After finding his group , Conway continued his work in group theory and published an " atlas " of groups .
In fifteen years , Conway and his colleagues collected all the " interesting " groups , classified them , described their properties , and put them into one volume .
" The work of producing the book was quite heavy , especially in the last year .
It turned me off of group theory and algebra in general .
At about the same time I started the atlas , I was trying to come up with a mathematical understanding of the game of Go .
There were two very strong players at Cambridge , one of whom was the British champion .
I noticed that near the end of a match , the whole game looked like a sum of a lot of little games .
And , to my great surprise , I discovered that certain games behaved like numbers . "
By analyzing the properties of these games , Conway discovered a whole new set of numbers ; they were soon dubbed " surreal . "
" The theory was a real big shock to me .
It was bizarre ... crazy , but it was true !
It was like climbing to the top of the beanstalk , and there was the enchanted castle .
I had no idea what to expect .
The rules have all changed , like magic .
It 's like a new world .
Exploring that world took me some time . "
Soon it was a fully - fledged theory .
" You can view it as an extension of the real numbers , but it also has a surreal quality .
New numbers were appearing - and nobody had seen them before .
But they exist .
Old numbers fell straight out of the definition - all the reals , and even the transfinite ordinals like w .
By the way , I did n't coin the term ' surreal numbers . '
Donald Knuth did , in his book which should be around here . "
Conway jumped off of the sofa .
After steadying himself for a moment , he shuffled toward his office .
He looked through the cluttered bookshelves for his copy .
He found a trashy - looking novel , Soho Madonna , which sported a scantily clad woman on its cover .
" I do n't remember buying this . "
He tossed it aside .
" Oh , well .
In any case , Knuth 's book was in the form of a novel .
I was God .
There were two main characters , Alice and Bill , and a third character named C speaks from the sky .
In the beginning , they find a stone inscribed ' And Conway created numbers . ' "
After a frantic search , Conway gave up looking for the book , and trundled back to the lounge .
" I daydreamed for weeks about these wonderful numbers .
I often do that .
I have what I call a ' white hot period ' which lasts for a few days .
I can't sleep , and I am completely absorbed with a problem .
This used to get my wife terribly , terribly upset .
After the white hot phase , I enter a daydreaming phase for a few weeks . "
He frowned slightly .
" These phases are becoming less and less frequent . "
Conway led me back to the lounge .
" I discovered surreal numbers a long time ago .
I guess that it was around 1970 .
At about the same time I invented the game of Life . "
The roots of the idea originated with the famous mathematician Von Neumann .
He wanted to create a model of a " universal constructor , " a machine that could build any other machine if correctly programmed ; it would even be able to make a copy of itself .
He imagined an infinite board ruled into squares , and assigned one of twenty - nine values , or states , to each square .
There were a complex set of rules to determine how each square 's state affected its neighbors ' states .
He succeeded in creating a universal constructor , but his system was so complicated that it was very unappealing .
Conway changed the rules so that each square had only two states - living or dead .
He had only three rules .
The first , the " birth rule , " was that a dead cell becomes alive if it has three neighbors which are alive .
The second , the " isolation rule , " was that a live cell dies if fewer than two of its neighbors are alive .
The third was the " crowding rule " ; a live cell dies if it has four or more live neighbors .
" I decided to observe this simple system , rather than build in the universal constructor property like Von Neumann did . "
Almost anyone who owns a computer is familiar with the game of Life - it has become a popular screen saver , because of the unpredictable and interesting patterns that flicker across the screen as cells are born and die .
" You can embed any mathematical question into the game of Life - for instance , with a tremendous amount of effort , you can plug in Fermat 's last theorem and see whether the program terminates . "
He stroked his beard and smiled .
" You know , I occupy the John von Neumann chair at Princeton .
He was interested in transfinite numbers and game theory .
I think it was just a coincidence ; I would n't have been interested in building bombs .
I do n't think I would even have liked the man .
But our interests do have a great deal of overlap . "
Conway propped up the pillow behind his head and grinned .
" I like showing off .
When I make a new discovery , and I really like telling people about it .
I guess I 'm not so much a mathematician as a teacher .
In America , kids are n't supposed to like mathematics .
It 's so sad . "
Conway sat up suddenly .
" Most people think that mathematics is cold .
But it 's not at all !
For me , the whole damn thing is sensual and exciting .
I like what it looks like , and I get a hell of a lot more pleasure out of math than most people do out of art ! "
He relaxed slightly , and he lowered his voice .
" I feel like an artist .
I like beautiful things - they 're there already ; man does n't have to create it .
I do n't believe in God , but I believe that nature is unbelievably subtle and clever .
In physics , for instance , the real answer to a problem is usually so subtle and surprising that it was n't even considered in the first place .
That the speed of light is a constant - impossible !
Nobody even thought about it .
And quantum mechanics is even worse , but it 's so beautiful , and it works ! "
Conway grinned .
" I really do enjoy the beauty of nature - and math is natural .
Nobody could have invented the mathematical universe .
It was there , waiting to be discovered , and it 's crazy , it 's bizarre .
Math explains why the petals of the daffodil are arranged the way they are , and I think that I get more pleasure by looking at the daffodil than others do because I understand this .
I guess I 'm a Sybarite .
I like beauty , and I like to eat and drink . "
He patted his belly .
" I used to anyway .
My heart attack changed that somewhat . "
There was an awkward pause .
Conway stood up and walked toward his office .
He pointed to the polyhedra that hung from the ceiling .
" I 'm getting interested in group theory again .
Each of these represents a different type of symmetry , and group theory is really the study of symmetries .
Unfortunately , all my groupy friends dispersed , and Princeton is a wasteland for group theory .
I 'm somewhat interested in two and three dimensional stuff .
It 's not very serious , I 'm afraid . "
I looked around the office , and noticed seven long sheets of paper with footprints on them .
" They represent the different types of symmetry in two dimensions , " he explained .
" One day , I was walking along , trying to think of an example of translation linked with reflection .
All of a sudden , I realized that walking was just what I was looking for !
I xeroxed my feet , and made up these pictures .
Each one represented a type of symmetry .
And each symmetry has a polyhedron associated with it . "
Conway sank down into a chair .
" I 'm not really doing mathematics right now . "
He looked at the ceiling .
" I guess you can say that I 'm expanding it .
Instead of trying to prove new theorems , I 'm trying to fill in the holes that other people have left behind .
I want to have a better understanding of what we already know .
I want a more visual , more intuitive feel for math , like my book on the quadratic form . "
He stopped short , and looked a little stunned .
" I guess you can say that I 've almost ceased being a mathematician .
All of a sudden , his eyes lit up .
" Oh , I have n't shown you this !
Do you have any pennies ? "
I fumbled through my pockets and came up empty .
A graduate student walked by .
Conway leapt up and grabbed his arm .
" Pennies ? " he cried , and the startled student looked through his jacket and came up with six .
" I guess that it will have to do .
I am going to change your luck forever , for the better . "
He pulled me toward a table that was only mildly cluttered .
" Heads or tails . "
" Uh ... heads . "
" Good .
Now help me . "
He began balancing the pennies on their edges .
By the time that I had finally gotten one to stay standing , he had done four .
" Come on , come on . "
He took the last one out of my hands , and with a swift , well practiced motion , he had it balanced on its edge .
He made sure that no two were facing in the same direction .
" Heads , you said ? " I nodded .
" Well , here goes ! "
He knocked the bottom of the table gently , and all six pennies fell .
All heads .
" Want to see it again ? "
Without waiting for my answer , he quickly set up the pennies again .
" You try it . "
I tapped the bottom of the table , and they fell .
Heads .
He smiled .
" It 's really much more impressive when you have twenty pennies or so .
Now , heads or tails ? "
" Tails .
But what ... "
" Wait . "
He held his finger up .
" Help me spin these . "
In a flash , he had four pennies skittering along the table .
" Tails , heads , tails , tails .
Come on ! "
I was finally able to get one up to speed .
Heads .
He spun four more .
" Heads , tails , tails , tails .
You know , if you spin pennies this way , roughly two out of three are tails . "
" Why ? "
" It 's very simple , really .
Balance the penny on the table and look at it very closely .
You will notice that it does n't stand up exactly straight . "
I did n't notice , but I nodded anyhow .
" That 's because the sides are n't flat like the edges of a disc .
They 're angled like a slice of a cone - and the tails side is narrower than the heads side .
That 's a result of the minting process .
So , if you balance them on their edges , they will lean toward the tails side , so when you disturb them gently , they will fall heads up . "
" But when you spin them ... "
" The center of mass likes to be above the point of contact .
If you think about it for a little , you will see that when the penny spins , the tails side is facing up . "
Conway grinned as he shuffled back to his office .
I was impressed .

The document outlines US military and commercial ambitions in space
The document - signed by President Bush - also says " freedom of action in space is as important to the United States as air power and sea power " .
The document rejects any proposals to ban space weapons .
But the White House has said the policy does not call for the development or deployment of weapons in space .
The United States will preserve its rights , capabilities , and freedom of action in space ... and deny , if necessary , adversaries the use of space capabilities hostile to US national interests

The 10 - page strategic document states that the US national security " is critically dependent upon space capabilities , and this dependence will grow " .
" The United States will preserve its rights , capabilities , and freedom of action in space ... and deny , if necessary , adversaries the use of space capabilities hostile to US national interests , " it says .
Satellite fears
The document also sets out US commercial ambitions , saying it is committed to encouraging and facilitating a growing entrepreneurial space sector .
The Bush administration says there is no shift in its policy
It addresses concerns voiced in a 2001 Pentagon report that said technological advances would enable potential enemies to disrupt orbiting US satellites , our correspondent says .
Unclassified details of the policy published on the internet say space capabilities , including spy and other communication satellites , are essential for national security .
But the White House said the policy was not a prelude to putting weapons in orbit and that there was no shift in US policy .
" The notion that you would do defence from space is different from that of weaponisation of space .
We 're comfortable with the policy " , White House spokesman Tony Snow said .
President Bush authorised the policy in August but it was not released until October .
During the Cold War , President Ronald Reagan proposed a defence shield using laser or particle beam technology to " intercept and destroy " incoming nuclear missiles .
The Strategic Defence Initiative , or " Star Wars " programme as it came to be known , was abandoned in 1993 .

Mathematicians have mapped the inner workings of one of the most complicated structures ever studied : the object known as the exceptional Lie group E 8 .
This achievement is significant both as an advance in basic knowledge and because of the many connections between E 8 and other areas , including string theory and geometry .
The magnitude of the calculation is staggering : the answer , if written out in tiny print , would cover an area the size of Manhattan .
Mathematicians are known for their solitary work style , but the assault on E 8 is part of a large project bringing together 18 mathematicians from the U.S. and Europe for an intensive four - year collaboration .
" This is exciting , " said Peter Sarnak , Eugene Higgins Professor of Mathematics at Princeton University ( not affiliated with the project ) .
" Understanding and classifying the representations of Lie Groups has been critical to understanding phenomena in many different areas of mathematics and science including algebra , geometry , number theory , Physics and Chemistry .
This project will be valuable for future mathematicians and scientists . "
Bigger than the Human Genome
The magnitude of the E 8 calculation invites comparison with the Human Genome Project .
The human genome , which contains all the genetic information of a cell , is less than a gigabyte in size .
The result of the E 8 calculation , which contains all the information about E 8 and its representations , is 60 gigabytes in size .
That is enough space to store 45 days of continuous music in MP3 format .
While many scientific projects involve processing large amounts of data , the E 8 calculation is very different : the size of the input is comparatively small , but the answer itself is enormous , and very dense .
Like the Human Genome Project , these results are just the beginning .
According to project leader Jeffrey Adams , " This is basic research which will have many implications , most of which we do n't understand yet .
Just as the human genome does not instantly give you a new miracle drug , our results are a basic tool which people will use to advance research in other areas . "
This could have unforeseen implications in mathematics and physics which do not appear for years .
According to Hermann Nicolai , Director of the Albert Einstein Institute in Bonn , Germany ( not affiliated with the project ) , " This is an impressive achievement .
While mathematicians have known for a long time about the beauty and the uniqueness of E 8 , we physicists have come to appreciate its exceptional role only more recently --- yet , in our attempts to unify gravity with the other fundamental forces into a consistent theory of quantum gravity , we now encounter it at almost every corner !
Thus , understanding the inner workings of E 8 is not only a great advance for pure mathematics , but may also help physicists in their quest for a unified theory . "

The E 8 Calculation
The team that produced the E 8 calculation began work four years ago .
They meet together at the American Institute of Mathematics every summer , and in smaller groups throughout the year .
Their work requires a mix of theoretical mathematics and intricate computer programming .
According to team member David Vogan from MIT , " The literature on this subject is very dense and very difficult to understand .
Even after we understood the underlying mathematics it still took more than two years to implement it on a computer . "
And then there came the problem of finding a computer large enough to do the calculation .
For another year , the team worked to make the calculation more efficient , so that it might fit on existing supercomputers , but it remained just beyond the capacity of the hardware available to them .
The team was contemplating the prospect of waiting for a larger computer when Noam Elkies of Harvard pointed out an ingenious way to perform several small versions of the calculation , each producing an incomplete version of the answer .
These incomplete answers could be assembled to give the final solution .
The cost was having to run the calculation four times , plus the time to combine the answers .
In the end the calculation took about 77 hours on the supercomputer Sage .
Beautiful Symmetry
At the most basic level , the E 8 calculation is an investigation of symmetry .
Mathematicians invented the Lie groups to capture the essence of symmetry : underlying any symmetrical object , such as a sphere , is a Lie group .
advertisement
Lie groups come in families .
The classical groups A 1 , A 2 , A 3 , ... B 1 , B 2 , B 3 , ... C 1 , C 2 , C 3 , ... and D 1 , D 2 , D 3 , ... rise like gentle rolling hills towards the horizon .
Jutting out of this mathematical landscape are the jagged peaks of the exceptional groups G 2 , F 4 , E 6 , E 7 and , towering above them all , E 8 .
E 8 is an extraordinarily complicated group : it is the symmetries of a particular 57 - dimensional object , and E 8 itself is 248 - dimensional !
To describe the new result requires one more level of abstraction .
The ways that E 8 manifests itself as a symmetry group are called representations .
The goal is to describe all the possible representations of E 8 .
These representations are extremely complicated , but mathematicians describe them in terms of basic building blocks .
The new result is a complete list of these building blocks for the representations of E 8 , and a precise description of the relations between them , all encoded in a matrix with 205,263,363,600 entries .
The Atlas of Lie Groups Project
The E 8 calculation is part of an ambitious project known as the Atlas of Lie Groups and Representations .
The goal of the Atlas project is to determine the unitary representations of all the Lie groups .
This is one of the great unsolved problems of mathematics , dating from the early 20th century .
The success of the E 8 calculation leaves little doubt that the Atlas team will complete their task .
The Atlas team consists of about 20 researchers from the United States and Europe .
The core group consists of Jeffrey Adams ( University of Maryland ) , Dan Barbasch ( Cornell ) , John Stembridge ( University of Michigan ) , Peter Trapa ( University of Utah ) , Marc van Leeuwen ( Poitiers ) , David Vogan ( MIT ) , and ( until his death in 2006 ) Fokko du Cloux ( Lyon ) .
The Atlas project is funded by the National Science Foundation through the American Institute of Mathematics .
His mother , Stacey Selden , is a New York City judge , and his father , Jeff Liebenson , is an entertainment lawyer .
They are of an age and culture to remember when musicians like Robert Plant ( or even Kurt Cobain ) were the heroes of teenage boys .
And they bemusedly admire Peter ’s company , which he started last summer .
“ How did he know how ? ” his mother wondered .
“ I thought maybe he ’d do an internship , ” Mr. Liebenson said , “ but Peter had this very clear idea . ”
He took a two - day course in Web design at the School of Visual Arts , where he learned all sorts of nifty things ( like how to make a photo of a caramel wiggle on a Web page ) , sent a batch of caramels to his favorite candy blog , candyaddict.com , garnering a glowing testimonial ( “ I predict sweet success for you ! ” ) as well as a link to his site — and a business was born .
With an ear for buzz phrases like “ no trans fats , ” Peter promises customers a product that is both healthy and delicious .
Delivery may take up to a month ( homework and college applications come first ) , but you can request samples for $ 1 and pay online through PayPal .
If you send Peter a testimonial , he will refund your dollar .
With an Internet storefront , reviews on blogs and testimonials from customers , Peter has more orders than he can keep up with ( from 22 states and as far away as the Netherlands , he said ) .
Expenses are low ( he pays $ 4 a month for Web hosting and his advertising came free ) .
He estimates a total profit to date of about $ 45 , after allowing for operating costs ( a domain name , postage , packaging ) and supplies ( a candy thermometer , butter , cream , sugar and mixing spoons ) , a figure that took some time to arrive at ( he sifted through receipts the other night ) , suggesting that Peter ’s impulses are more creative than acquisitive .
Not all teenage entrepreneurs are so process - oriented .
For many , the profit is the turn - on .
Even parents can be tickled , if slightly abashed , by their child ’s moneymaking skills .
One Palm Beach mother of a student at a New England boarding school reported buying cases of Red Bull at a Costco one parents ’ weekend , which her son sold for triple the cost to his dorm mates .
“ They like to ski on the stuff , ” she said , begging anonymity .
“ I also sent him 20 or so used movies which he rents from his room . ”
Boarding schools , of course , are fertile environments for under - age business types ; the market is quite literally captive and therefore hungry for all manner of goods .
In decades past you could spot the future captains of industry by their triple beam scales and twitching fingers .
Now the drug dealers have been trumped by more legal monopolists .
Two years ago Matt Swift was a junior at the Salisbury School for boys in Salisbury , Conn .

Mr. Swift , now a freshman at Georgetown University , described his business plan :
“ We were in the middle of nowhere and the food was terrible and we thought , what ’s the best market for a boys ’ school ? ”
Sara created a MySpace using an email address that she made specifically for that purpose .
After vacation , she could n’t remember her MySpace password ( or her email password ) .
She created a new MySpace page using a new throwaway email address .
When i asked her if she was irritated that she had to do this after investing time in the previous profile , she said , “ nah ..
I had too many Friends that I did n’t know anyways . ”
This snippet from my fieldnotes depicts an attitude that i keep hearing from teens that completely contradicts adult norms .
Many teens are content ( if not happy ) to start over with most of their accounts in most places .
Forgot your IM password ?
Sign up again .
Forgot your email address ?
Create a new one .
Forgot your login ?
Time for a change .
While adult bloggers talk about building an identity through extended blogging , i keep finding teens who got locked out of Xanga and responded by making another Xanga ( or a Blogger or a LiveJournal ) .
They have expressions scattered across numerous services with numerous handles .
Some teens chew through IM handles like candy ; their nicks are things like “ o - so - funny ” rather than the first name , last name standard that seems to pervade professional worlds .
It ’s not seen as something to build an extensive identity around , but something to use to talk to friends in the moment .
Teens are not dreaming of portability ( like so many adults i meet ) .
They are happy to make new accounts on new sites ; they enjoy building out profiles .
( Part of this could be that they have a lot more time on their hands . )
The idea of taking MySpace material to Facebook when they transition is completely foreign .
They ’re going to a new site , they want to start over .
While this feeling of ephemerality is not universal amongst teens , it ’s far more prevalent than you ’d ever see in adult culture and it has some significant implications for design :
Focusing on “ lock - in ” will fail with these teens – they do n’t care if they lose track of something they put hours into building .
Teens are not looking for universal anything ; that ’s far too much of a burden if losing track of things is the norm .
Paying for an account can help truly engaged teens remember their accounts ( i have n’t found any teen who permanently lost their MMO login ) but it can also be a strong deterrent for those accustomed to starting over .
The numbers that people cite concerning accounts created are astoundingly inaccurate and are worthless for talking about usage or unique participants .
( added tx to a comment by Rich )
I should note that i do n’t think that the answer is “ help teens remember passwords . ”
I actually think that this tendency to shed is advantageous in the way that we shed clothes every year because the “ old me ” is no longer relevant .
Technology is a bit too obsessed with remembering ; there ’s a lot of value in forgetting .
Of course , i do expect everything to change with the mobile .
While i do n’t expect teens to care about number portability ( like their parents ) , losing a phone is a far more expensive proposition than losing a login ( although it seems to be just as common amongst teens ) .
I expect there to be a lot less turnover when accounts are tied to a phone .
It ’ll be interesting to see if strong identity is loved or hated .
Clarification :
This post is not intended to negate or devalue my previous work on how people use different nicks to represent different facets of their identity .
This latter practice is common to people of all ages and has great value for impression management .
How you represent yourself on LinkedIn is very different from how you represent yourself on Friendster and you do n’t want these collapsed .
This post is meant simply to highlight another aspect of shifting handles amongst teens that is not common amongst adults ; it is not intended to say that this is the only reason for new handles .
( While losing passwords is common amongst adults as well , starting over happily is n’t . )
When I first started using Seaside , it took me a while to shake out a few misconceptions that were holding me back .
Many of the things I 'd learned to do in .
Net were no longer necessary , Seaside was different , and I had to shake some old habits before I finally grokked it .
I 'll use this blog to try to explain a few of them , as time permits .
First thing ; State . .
Net pages are stateful , but in a different manner than Seaside .
.
Net , in an effort to emulate desktop development , created the concept of viewstate , which was in essence nothing more than a hash table that was automatically serialized and deserialized into a hidden form element , something developers used to do by hand .
Server controls , stateful UI widgets , were then able to save and restore their state into this hidden field on each postback , giving the illusion that a page maintains its state between postback , and removing from the programmer , the hassle of thinking about request .
form and repopulating form fields on each postback .
This was often done by hand in classic ASP by having the value of a field be equal to its request .
form value , which is where the concept of a post back originated .
The viewstate abstraction , while useful , leaked , as all abstractions do .
.
Net pages are classes , and like any class , can have member variables .
However , only " server controls " remembered their state , and only because their authors utilized viewstate to do so .
One cannot simply assign a member variable and expect it to still be there after the next request .
For value objects , one could simply store the object directly in the viewstate hash , but for reference objects , developers got in the habit of storing id's to the objects they needed , in the viewstate , and then on each postback , an accessor would fetch the object using the id , allowing the illusion of a stateful page .
Storing id's and passing id 's around in query strings and cookies , is n't very object oriented .
Problem is , the developer had to wire this plumbing up manually , each time he needed it , it was more of a design pattern than a framework .
. Net , like Seaside , has sessions , and can store objects in that session , but unlike Seaside , each time a page is viewed in .
Net , a new instance of it is created , and its state is restored from the previous instances viewstate .
Pages never lived longer than the current request .
All of these issues , and hacks , are a symptom of a core problem , pages are n't stateful .
No matter how much you want to pretend the web is stateless , it really is n't .
If pages are n't stateful , you have to manually fake it .
This is where Seaside 's first big conceptual difference lies , Seaside components , the equivalent of .
Net pages , are not only stateful , but can have a lifetime equal to that of the current session .
Each time you view a page from Seaside , you 're viewing the exact same instance that was initially created when you first entered that page .
This has quite a few advantages .
Instance variables are not lost between postbacks .
For example , if you set an instance variable equal to a customer object , that customer object will stay there throughout the entire user session , you need not ever fetch it again , or hold onto its id , or even think about state .
This is exactly how you 'd program a standard WinForm application .
Seaside components are also objects themselves , when you create a component , you create it , not the framework .
This means you can use constructors , and pass any necessary state directly to the component .
In .
Net , this is n't the case , the framework creates the page for you , and you read in necessary state from the query string .
Let 's say your going to edit a customer object , and you 're on the search page , in .
Net , you 'd write something like the following in a databinding method for a link server control to setup a url to link to the detail page ...
aLink .
Url += customer .
Id ;
or a more older style redirect to the detail page ...
Response .Redirect( " CustomerDetail.aspx?id= " + customer .
Id ) ;
and on the detail page on each postback of that page , you 'd have to re-fetch the customer with something like this ...
Customer customer = Customer.Find( Request.QueryString [ " id " ] ) ;
But you only have to do this , because pages are n't real objects , and can't remember their own state .
In Seaside , you do n't redirect to a new page with an id in the query string ( you could , but it'd be stupid ) , rather you write the link like this ...
html anchor callback : [ self call : ( CustomerDetail for : customer ) ] ; text : ' edit ' .
When the link is pressed , a detail control is created , and simply handed the customer object directly via its constructor .
The called component simply replaces the calling component in the UI .
The calling component , though not visible , stays alive waiting for the called component to return .
Simple , elegant , and exactly what you 'd do if you were writing a WinForm application for the desktop .
What Seaside does for you , is take the code in the callback block , and create a continuation , a unique link pointing to it , and writes the URL to the anchor tag for you .
It simply automates what you have to do by hand in a .
Net web application .
Understand this one thing , will help you tremendously when attempting to write a web application in Seaside .
I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out how to set and read query strings and form posts and assign urls to anchors , because that 's what I was accustomed to doing .
If you want to try Seaside , you 've got to drink the cool - aid deeply , accept its idioms , and get on with getting the job done .
Seaside is " truly " object oriented , .
Net simply pretends to be , and then punishes you when you actually try and program in an OO fashion .
At nine o’clock on July 28th last year , Wendy Nissley carried her two - year - old daughter , Lacy , into O.R. 12 at Johns Hopkins Hospital to have half of her brain removed .
Lacy suffers from a rare malformation of the brain , known as hemimegalencephaly , in which one hemisphere grows larger than the other .
The condition causes seizures , and Lacy was having so many — up to forty in a day — that , at an age when other toddlers were trying out sentences , she could produce only a few language - like sounds .
As long as Lacy ’s malformed right hemisphere was attached to the rest of her brain , it would prevent her left hemisphere from functioning normally .
So Lacy ’s parents had brought her to Johns Hopkins for a hemispherectomy , which is probably the most radical procedure in neurosurgery .
Wendy laid her daughter on the operating table .
Because Lacy was so small , it took the anesthesiologist almost ninety minutes to insert her intravenous lines .
George Jallo , the attending neurosurgeon , spent a long time arranging her head on gel padding and then drew “ Cut here ” markings on her shaved scalp .
The rest of Lacy ’s head , including her face , was covered with a sterile drape .
Jallo made one long cut across the top of her head from the front to the back , and another at right angles to the first , which started midway along it and stopped just in front of her right ear .
He folded back the scalp and made small holes in her skull with a power drill , outlining a rough semicircle .
Then he used the drill to connect the dots and removed a portion of the skull .
He cut another T in the dura , a thin , leathery membrane covering the brain .
Gently , he peeled back two large flaps .
By half past one , Jallo and a resident had already removed the right frontal lobe .
David Lieberman , the pediatric neurologist who had examined Lacy when she first came to Johns Hopkins , looked on , shaking his head in wonderment .
“ It ’s so open , ” he said , turning to me .
“ Normally , with brain surgery , you make a hole about this big ” — he curled his thumb and index finger into a circle .
After removing the frontal lobe , Jallo embarked on the parietal lobe .
In case complications put a sudden stop to the surgery , it was important to take out the seizure hot spots first , gradually working through the hemisphere in descending order of priority : after the parietal lobe would come a small section of the occipital lobe , then the temporal lobe , then the rest of the occipital .
Finally , Jallo would cut the corpus callosum , the bundle of fibres that connect the two hemispheres of the brain .
The surgeons slowly worked around each side of the parietal lobe , making tiny pinches in the brain with electric cauterizing forceps .
There was a slight smell of burning in the bright , noisy operating room .
As the cut became deeper and wider , the tissue on either side browned and blackened , and the lobe started to move back and forth .
At the bottom of the parietal wedge , the clean white of nerve fibres was visible ; as the lobe was severed , they came apart like string cheese .
A surgical technician bent toward Jallo with a small plastic bowl in his hands .
Jallo picked the lobe out of the skull — it was the size of an infant ’s fist — and dropped it into the container .
As she led me out of the O.R. , Eileen Vining , the attending neurologist , said , “ Did you see how rigid it was ?
Normal brain sags in your hands . ”
Vining talked quickly , moving from one complicated idea to the next , punctuating each with “ O.K. ? ” and an expectant nod .
She had been in and out of the operating room all morning , and now she was off to find the Nissleys and tell them how Lacy was doing .
Four hours later , Vining took me back into the O.R.
Lacy ’s right hemisphere was gone , and her cranium looked like a wide , uneven bowl .
I could see the deep cavity where the frontal and parietal lobes had been , and the white - pink color inside the base of the skull .
In the middle of the remaining brain was a shallow mound where Jallo had left a layer of nerve fibres to protect the ventricle , a fluid - filled pocket that cushions the brain and the spinal cord .
The white matter there was now gray - black .
Jallo and his resident lightly touched their forceps to it , and the cauterizers fizzed , sealing the brain to prevent microhemorrhages .
Hemorrhaging is a constant concern in brain surgery , and at one point in the operation Jallo decided to leave in a small piece of the right occipital lobe which threatened to bleed dangerously .
Jallo glanced at Vining and Lieberman , and the doctors stretched forward to look at the severed corpus callosum .
Over and over , the surgical technician poured in saline , and Jallo and his resident drew it out again with a loud suction pump .
When he had finished removing brain tissue , Jallo tipped in small packets of Surgicel , a feathery white substance that helps blood to clot .
It melted onto the surface of the brain .
“ That was good .
There was not a lot of bleeding , ” Vining said .
“ You never know what you are going to get until you open it up .
Sometimes you just go in there and you hold your breath and pray . ”
In the final hour , Jallo sutured Lacy ’s dura , which had shrunk slightly from dehydration , and filled the right side of her head with saline .
The technician then brought the missing section of the skull back to Jallo , carrying it in a wide right angle over surgical carts rather than risk moving it over the floor .
Jallo reattached it , using four tiny dissolvable plates made of a sugarlike substance .
He then closed the scalp incision with a staple gun , leaving seventy - eight aluminum staples in Lacy ’s skin .
The hemispherectomy had taken nine hours .
The resident bandaged Lacy ’s head , gently turned her onto her right side , and stuck a piece of tape on her head that said “ This side up . ”
I first met the Nissleys three months before Lacy ’s surgery , at their home in Palmyra , Pennsylvania .
As I drove up , I could see Lacy ’s father , Mike , dangling a leg over the edge of the front porch .
He looked like a surfer , with a goatee beard and gold - lens Oakleys pushed back on his head .
Wendy sat on a chair near the front door , and Lacy ’s four - year - old sister , Lily , flitted around the adults .
Lacy , blond like her mother , lay across Wendy ’s lap .
“ She had a seizure just before you got here , so she ’s sleeping now , ” Wendy said .
They invited me inside .
Lacy had her first seizure on October 13 , 2003 , when she was four and a half months old .
Wendy had been doing laundry , and when she turned around she saw that Lacy ’s lips were blue and that she was shaking .
She called 911 , but by the time the ambulance arrived the seizures had ended .
In the following month , the family went to the hospital many times , but , on each occasion , by the time they got there the spell had ended and there did n’t seem to be anything wrong .
The doctors took an MRI but saw nothing unexpected , and they suggested that Lacy might have acid reflux or sleep apnea , or could even be doing it on purpose , out of anger .
“ But she was n’t angry , ” Mike said .
“ She was sitting there happy , and all of a sudden it hit her like a train . ”
One doctor put her on phenobarbital , increasing the dose each time there was another seizure .
“ It made her lethargic , like she was drunk , ” Wendy said .
That November , Lacy had a terrible attack .
“ Her arm went up in the air , ” Mike said , throwing his left arm straight up , stiff .
“ Her lips went blue .
She was having them in a row . ”
By the time the ambulance came , the seizures had subsided , but the attendants advised the Nissleys to get in their car and take Lacy to Johns Hopkins anyway .
The drive took two hours , and , just as Mike and Wendy walked over to the triage nurse , Lacy began another cluster of seizures .
The nurse said , “ We ’ve got to get you a room . ”
In a nutshell , and I mean a true nutshell , for those of you not familiar , the case involves five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor who have been wrongfully charged for allegedly infecting children with HIV .
They were tortured and forced to sign " confessions " written in Arabic they did not understand now they are awaiting execution by firing squad in Libya .
In fact , the poor hygiene , dirty needles and bad practices in the hospital are to blame .
If there was ever a human rights issue which highlights the abject lunacy of torture the case of the Tripoli Six should become the world template against the use of torture .
Torture begets " confessions " because it is common knowledge that people will say anything to make their depraved interrogators cease inflicting heinous , barbaric and deeply grievous assaults .
There is a lot here that is universal and also a great deal that is very relevant to the US situation , such as extraction of confession under torture , ignoring scientific evidence and turning a blind eye to human rights abuses when you want to suck up to a government .
I suppose in the world we inhabit , it takes courage to acknowledge that non-American lives are worth less than American lives .
But it seems fitting to draw such a sad conclusion since the United States decided to reestablish diplomatic relations with Libya in May , without the medics case being resolved as part of the deal .
And then at the end of August , the Libyan prosecutor called again for the death penalty .
And forgive my cynicism but Libya has lots of oil .
After we take out Iran , we 're going to need that Libyan oil and we want a happy Libyan dictator .

You may be wondering why has nyceve become involved in this .
Mostly because it's about take - your - breath - away injustice which many of us hope will soon get on the radar of the world 's media .
Secondarily because our own much admired and loved Gina Cooper brought it to my attention .
She put me in touch with two remarkable individuals , a health and science blogger named revere and the senior correspondent of Nature , Declan Butler .
Here 's the background .
I came home last week to an email from Gina .
Hi !
I was wondering if you heard about this .
I do n't have the voice you have for promoting things , but this comes from a real source .
What do you think of this ?
thanks !
- gina
I was initially a little confused but after a ton of emails , and my own research I sorted out the players and the urgency of the matter .
Declan Butler is a senior correspondent at Nature .
As you may know , Nature is the world 's premier science journal .
The fact that they have weighed in on this is highly unusual and extremely significant .
As Declan himself said in an email to me , " I was very pleased , but not at all suprized , that Nature 's editorial and news team took up the challenge , and in particular the determination of Philip Campbell , Nature progressive Editor - in - Chief , that the issue merited a tough stand . "
Gina 's email to me also contained a forwarded message from a highly regarded science blogger who goes by the name of revere .
revere blogs at the science and public health blog Effect Measure which you can read here :
http://scienceblogs.com/....
In his email to Gina , revere described the reality of the case .
I apologize for the length of this email .
I rarely post here , as my
main interest , public health , comes up only occasionally ( OK ; I also
comment sometimes on the mid east ) .
However this is something a bit
different which I am hoping the progressive blogosphere will take up .
It 's not about the mid terms but it is about using the power of the
internet to save some lives .
There are interesting US foreign policy
aspects to it , too , which some may wish to follow - up .
A few hours ago I received an urgent message from Declan Butler ,
senior correspondent at Nature .
As you may know , Nature is the world 's
premier science journal .
The fact that they have weighed in on this is
highly significant .
Declan has been a supporter and enabler of science
blogging at Nature , and Nature has been showing real leadership on
some important progressive issues .
Today Nature has a news article from Declan accompanied by a very
strongly worded Editorial about six medics ( 5 nurses and a doctor ) on
trial for their lives in Libya .
They are accused of infecting many
children with HIV .
The scientific evidence for this has been examined
by Luc Montagnier ( co- discoverer of HIV ) and he has adduced evidence
the children were infected prior to the workers getting to the
country .
Other evidence implicates bad hospital hygiene as the cause ,
but the important point is that Montagnier 's evidence has been
excluded by the Libyan judge and it now appears likely they will be
condemned to death by firing squad .
The parents are outraged at the
deaths of their children and are demanding revenge .
The medics are a
convenient target .
Admitting the children died by the malfeasance of
the Libyan hospital system is n't .
Diplomatic efforts to force Libya to convene an independent scientific
panel to consider the genetic analyses of the HIV isolates has been
unsuccessful .
There are more details in my post , below , which went up
this evening and the Nature pieces ( which are short ; links at Declan's
blog , http://declanbutler.info/....
Gina ,
God bless her , put me in touch with revere and Declan Butler and we began to correspond .
revere wrote to me as follows .
Hi Gina suggested I get in touch with you regarding the Tripoli Six
issue .
Do you want me to email Declan and have him call you ?
You could
try emailing him yourself , as that would be quicker , and say Revere
suggested it .
He knows me .
Or do you want me to make an intro ?
This is an interesting blogging issue because of US policy ( make nice
to Ghaddafi without mentioning the plight of the 6 ) and the role that
science blogs ( and also now dKos , TNH , FDL , Alterpeek , Majikthise ) are
playing instigated by print media , in this case Nature , the world 's
premier science journal .
Often the other way around .
Nature is
embracing the blogosphere , a significant development .
They put
themselves out there on this issue and we are supporting them and
standing by their side in our own way .
Let me know if you want further info .

Then Decland Butler wrote :
Dear Eve
This has been a long - running story , with many intrigues .
The six are currently on retrial in Tripoli .
The attached articles describe the current situation , but do n't give a great deal of background , because of space limitations .
Let me know what else you would like to have .
I appreciate that there are many human rights abuses .
Perhaps I 'm an optimist , but I think that with some pressure in the right places , a renewed diplomatic effort could quickly resolve this case .
I also think that at a time when the US and EU have restablished diplomatic relations with Libya , this case raises several fundamental questions about respect for some fundamental democratic principles in international relations .
I wo n't be available this evening , but let me know more by email and I 'll respond by tomorrow morning at the latest .
Best regards

Declan Butler has taken the lead in bringing this travesty to the attention of the world community .

Lawyers call for science to clear AIDS nurses in Libya
International pressure needed to save health workers from death penalty .
Lawyers defending six medical workers who risk execution by firing squad in Libya have called for the international scientific community to support a bid to prove the medics ' innocence .
The six are charged with deliberately infecting more than 400 children with HIV at the al - Fateh Hospital in Benghazi in 1998 , so far causing the deaths of at least 40 of them .
On 28 August , when the prosecution was scheduled to close its case , the Libyan prosecutor called for the five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor to be sentenced to death .
Attorneys from Lawyers Without Borders , who are handling the defence of the six , have responded by calling for the international community to request that the court order an independent scientific assessment , by international AIDS experts , of how the children became infected .
. . . During the first trial , the Libyan government did ask Luc Montagnier , whose group at the Pasteur Institute in Paris discovered HIV , and Vittorio Colizzi , an AIDS researcher at Rome 's Tor Vergata University , to examine the scientific evidence .
The researchers carried out a genetic analysis of viruses from the infected children , and concluded that many of them were infected long before the medics set foot in Libya in March 1998 .
Many of the children were also infected with hepatitis B and C , suggesting that the infections were spread by poor hospital hygiene .
The infections were caused by subtypes of A/G HIV - 1 -- a recombinant strain common in central and west Africa , known to be highly infectious .
But the court threw out the report , arguing that an investigation by Libyan doctors had reached the opposite conclusion .
Montagnier believes the judgement was based at least partly on mistranslation from English to Arabic of the term ' recombinant ' -- instead of referring to natural recombination of wild viruses , as intended , it was interpreted to mean genetically modified , implying human manipulation .

I 'll leave you with two things .
First , a link to a chilling film called INJECTION .
INJECTION explores how over 15 million Africans will get HIV during the next 5 years through unsafe health care as clinics across Africa often re-use syringes .
http://www.creativehat.com/....
Second , some of you may know that I attended the Clinton Global Inititive which was held last week in New York City .
In 2005 , in its first year , one of the largest commitments involved $ 18 million from the Pan African Health Foundation for the construction of an auto - disposable syringe factory in Port Harcourt , Nigeria .
Healthcare is a disaster in the United States , it is far , far worse and much more dangerous in the developing world .
Building a thriving internet community can be tough .
Converting a community into paying customers is considerably harder .
On cockeyed .com , I count on merchandise , click - thru ads and monthly advertising schemes .
Fark.com sells a fortified version of itself ( Totalfark ) and Something Awful sells access to its comments section .
Dating sites use a different scheme .
Many of these sites allow any visitor to post a free profile , but only allow contact information to be exchanged between paying customers .
You can look , but you can not talk .
I have to admit , this is an ingenious scheme .
New visitors will often devote hours crafting a worthy profile , uploading a complimentary set of photos and composing a personal description which touts an exaggerated appreciation for classical literature .
Once their profile is online , they may start getting some attention , such as " winks " and mail , but may only be able to read that mail once they have paid a monthly membership fee .
I empathize with single people in this situation .
These sites dangle a carrot so close that it is poking you in the eye .
This is like a bank slipping $ 700 into your checking account , only to charge you a fee when you pull it out of the ATM .
This restriction on contact information invites subversion .
Sneaking Contact Information into your Profile
If you can somehow sneak your email address into your profile , " I hope SallyBird3433 gets to say " Gee! Male ! " in the near future " , " Iceflakequeen vacations near at aye oh well .
" or " Atlanta Ballerina , Yeah , who ?
" You can avoid paying , and you can attract the people who are really scouring your profile .
It could save you both money , and even inject a little corporation - busting intrigue into your relationship .
The trick is to hide the email address from the dating site 's administrator .
He will definitely be filtering all profiles for the word " email " , " .com " or the " @ " symbol .
" Yahoo " is probably forbidden , as well as " pacbell.net " .
I 'm going to put myself into the email encoding business by simply starting a reference table to dumb two - word codes , like this : Code Email address orange faucet
mink carafe
gravel sweater jerry95859@hotmail.com
trooper10@att.net
dale.evans21@freemail.net
The codes can be ANYTHING .
They will only need to be strange enough for people to realize a hidden message is there .
Anyone who hangs out online for long enough will know that cockeyed .com is the place to decode these nonsense phrases .
Ideally , even a novice profile - viewer will approach a nonsense phrase such as " zinc typewriter " with a Google search .
" Hmm , she sounds nice , but what the hell is a " zinc typewriter " ?
Zinc Typewriter will only have a couple of results , and hopefully , one of them will be the cockeyed .com email decoder page !
Your email address will be there for the taking !
Victory !
MINNEAPOLIS —
The federal government wants your Internet provider to keep track of every Web site you visit .
For more than a year , the U.S. Justice Department has been in discussions with Internet companies and privacy rights advocates , trying to come up with a plan that would make it easier for investigators to check records of Web traffic .
The idea is to help law enforcement track down child pornographers .
But some see it as another step toward total surveillance of citizens , joining warrantless wiretapping , secret scrutiny of library records and unfettered access to e-mail as another power that could be abused .
" I do n't think it 's realistic to think that we would create this enormous honeypot of information and then say to the FBI , ' You can only use it for this narrow purpose , ' " said Leslie Harris , executive director of the Center for Democracy & Technology , a Washington , D.C. - based group that promotes free speech and privacy in communication .
" We have an environment in which we 're collecting more and more information on the personal lives of Americans , and our laws are completely inadequate to protect us . "
So far , no concrete proposal has emerged , but U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has made it clear that he'd like to see quick action .
In September testimony before a Senate committee , Gonzales painted a graphic and disturbing picture of child pornography on the Web , which he called an urgent threat to children .
The production and consumption of child pornography has exploded as the Internet makes it easier to exchange images , Gonzales said .
But federal agents and prosecutors are hampered in their investigations because Internet companies do n't routinely keep records of their traffic , he told the committee .
Gonzales also pushed for Internet records tracking in an April speech at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children .
" Privacy rights must always be accommodated and protected as we conduct our investigations , " he said .
" ( But ) the investigation and prosecution of child predators depends critically on the availability of evidence that is often in the hands of Internet service providers .
" This evidence will be available for us to use only if the providers retain the records for a reasonable amount of time , " he said .
" Unfortunately , the failure of some Internet service providers to keep records has hampered our ability to conduct investigations in this area . "
Internet service providers typically keep records of Web traffic only for short periods , usually 30 to 90 days , as a way to trace technical glitches .
Many ISPs , along with privacy advocates , say that it 's already easy for government agents to get the information they need to investigate crimes .
The FBI , without a court order , can send a letter to any Internet provider ordering it to maintain records for an investigation , said Kevin Bankston , an attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation , a San Francisco - based group that promotes free speech and privacy on the Web .
" There 's been no showing that mass surveillance of all Internet users , mandated by the government , is necessary for law enforcement , " Bankston said .
" If this passes , there would be a chilling effect on free speech if everyone knew that everything they did on the Internet could be tracked back to them . "
The government has offered differing rationales for its data- retention plan , said Harris , the privacy advocate .
" I 've been in discussions at the Department of Justice where someone would say , ' We want this for child protection .
And someone else would say ' National security , ' and someone else would say , ' Computer crimes , ' " Harris said .
" We 're operating in the wild , wild West here . "
Passion lives here ... sometimes
It has not been hard to find a seat at some events ...
RELATED SPECIAL REPORT  Quiz : Torino 2006 Quiz Medal Tracker  Special : Winter Olympics 2006 YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Winter Olympics Italy Winter Sports Soccer or or Create Your Own TORINO , Italy ( CNN ) --
The atmosphere was so electric , the din so overwhelming as Canada took on Switzerland in the women 's curling that players found themselves unable to hear each other at opposite ends of the ice .
" It was a really noisy crowd and hard to concentrate , " Canadian lead Christine Keshen said after the Swiss edged their way to a 6 - 5 win .
" You could n't hear yourself think .
We could n't yell so we had to adjust .
" We were using hand signals , making up our own sign language . "
Such a story paints a picture of the usual carnival feel of an Olympic Games , where venues are packed to the rafters with spectators cheering wildly for all competitors , from the gold medal winner to the rank outsider struggling merely to finish .
At some venues in and around Torino that is exactly what is happening .
But at others , athletes are battling it out in front of row upon row of empty seating .
At the women 's 10 km individual cross-country race at Pragelato , competitors voiced frustration at the sparse attendance .
" You do n't feel it 's the Olympic Games because there are not a lot of people , " said Norway 's Marit Bjorgen , the World Cup leader , after winning the silver medal .
" You want to feel a lot of people on the last climb to help you .
It 's a little disappointing there are n't a lot of people here . "
Crowds at the speedskating have also been a mixed bag , particularly compared to the burgeoning following the sport has been developing at recent Games .
" It 's very disappointing to walk in and it's half empty , " said U.S. skater Jennifer Rodriguez .
" I can't believe this is the Olympics .
It almost felt like a World Cup meet .
The Olympics should be sold out . "
The atmosphere picked up after Italy 's surprise win in the final of the team pursuit event , when the stadium resounded to a booming chant of " Italia ! Italia ! " .
Similarly vocal support has been present at ice hockey matches and at the Alpine skiing , where Scandanavian fans in colorful dress have helped boost the enthusiasm levels .
But elsewhere -- even at potentially crowd - pleasing , popular sports such as luge and figure skating -- large numbers of seats are remaining vacant .
Strong sales
It is not that the tickets are going begging .
Organizers say they have sold 815,000 tickets , having set a pre-Games target of 830,000 .
The ticketing revenue target of $ 74 million has already come and gone .
" It 's true at some events there has not been much public , " organizing committee spokesman Giuseppe Gattino told AP .
" We are aware of it , but we 're not particularly worried . "
He attributed some of the empty seats to " no- shows " by corporate sponsors and Olympic officials .
Other factors are also being blamed , including the suggestion that strict security measures are causing massive queues that some would - be spectators demur from joining in freezing temperatures .
Another problem is that winter sports often have trouble tearing the attention of soccer - mad Italy away from their beloved national sport .
This is made even more difficult as national and European competitions reach their business ends and as fans become ever more firmly focused on the World Cup this summer .
The Summer Games , by contrast , are always scheduled for when there are no domestic sports seasons under way , to avoid the potential for distractions or clashes of spectators ' sporting loyalties .
And the Summer Games take place in , of course , summer , when many people are on vacation .
In February , most Europeans are still at work all week and unable to be cheering in Torino no matter how much they may want to .
But those at the speedskating when Italy stormed home to gold may feel they saw the moment passion really did take up residence in Torino .
" The fans gave me the most overwhelming feeling .
I have never , ever seen that many people in a stadium for our sport , " a jubilant Ippolito Sanfratello said after the win .

Microsoft And Google In Race For Online Maps
Microsoft's Virtual Earth site includes satellite photos of buildings and streets
In the hotel business , location matters nearly as much as in real estate .
On its busiest E - commerce days , when travelers book more than $ 7 million worth of rooms at the Holiday Inn and other Intercontinental Hotels Group plc properties , more than two - thirds consult an online map , says Del Ross , VP of global E - commerce .
" When deciding on what hotel to stay in , there are two hugely important questions that come before price :
Where 's the hotel in relation to where I need to go ?
And what 's surrounding the hotel ? "
Ross says .
Maps have become " a critical component to being able to sell effectively on the Internet . "
Factor in the fast growth of online ads that run alongside local searches , and it's no wonder Microsoft , Google Inc. , and others with big Web properties are racing to release the best maps .
Microsoft will launch this week Virtual Earth , a Web site that lets users scroll around an interactive map of the United States that includes satellite photos of buildings , streets , and landmarks .
Virtual Earth uses Windows ' ability to sniff out Wi -Fi access points to log users on to a Web page that starts with the city they 're in .
Microsoft plans to license Virtual Earth to businesses hoping to jazz up their online cartography and will tap into the 500 - company installed base of its less visually lush MapPoint Web service .
Since chairman Bill Gates gave Virtual Earth the green light five months ago , Microsoft has built the site , folded its MapPoint software group and several researchers into a new group inside MSN , and gone on a hiring spree that will see the team grow to maybe 70 people .
Microsoft plans to integrate Virtual Earth with its MSN travel and auto sites and wants to negotiate deals with companies to put their logos on the satellite images , which come from TerraServer , a Microsoft site that was one of the first to make satellite photography accessible to large numbers of online users .
Microsoft plans to update Virtual Earth this fall with close - up cityscape photos and more - detailed satellite images .
Microsoft plans to license the interactive Virtual Earth to companies hoping to jazz up their online cartography .
While Microsoft has been crunching to build Virtual Earth , rival Google has released a spate of online - mapping software that has Web users abuzz .
In February , Google Maps changed the way people interact with geographic software online by using novel programming techniques to let users zoom around a map of North America without refreshing their browsers .
Google Earth debuted last month , letting Web surfers move around a 3 - D globe and drop down to view their local Starbucks or their house .
In the past few weeks , Google has launched a Japanese version of Maps and flipped the switch on Google Moon , based on NASA images .
Microsoft and Google are competing for a share of ads tied to searches users perform on their sites and revenue from licensing their technologies to companies wanting to improve their own sites .
" They 're playing a game of leapfrog , which is great for us , " says Ross at Intercontinental , which uses Microsoft MapPoint at its site .
Intercontinental is talking to both Microsoft and Google about buying ads pegged to site searches , Ross says .
Marriott International Inc. licenses Microsoft 's MapPoint software for its site and is experimenting with more interactive maps on the Web site for its Marriott Marquis hotel in New York 's Times Square , says Mike Keppler , VP of sales and marketing .
It 's also working on deals that would let it show customers online maps with the local weather before they arrive at a Marriott .

Of all the steps that China has taken away from its Communist past since reforms began nearly 30 years ago , few have boasted the symbolic power of the law that parliament is due to pass next Friday .
The Property Law , for the first time since the 1949 Chinese revolution , offers comprehensive legal protection to private property .
Quite a move from a ruling party whose name literally means " The China Collective Property Party . "
It couches that protection , though , in language that often seems more solicitous of state property – a sign of the subject 's sensitivity .
" This is a very loaded text politically , " says one Western diplomat .
" It says a lot about the current balance and trends of the regime . "
It has taken 14 years of controversy and seven readings to bring the draft law to Friday 's vote in the National People 's Congress ( NPC ) .
Those are measures of the caution that the government has felt obliged to show in the face of vocal opposition from critics who call the law a betrayal of China 's socialist principles .
" It is incompatible with the founding principles of the New China , " complains Gong Xiantian , a law professor at Peking University who wrote an open letter of protest against the law .
" We had eliminated exploitation and established collective ownership , and after 50 years now we are going back .
This is an ideological struggle . "
It is a struggle Professor Gong and his sympathizers appear to have lost .
Introducing the new law last Thursday , NPC Vice Chairman Wang Zhaoguo went so far as to describe " effective protection of private property " as " what the ( Communist ) Party stands for . "
In doing so , he aligned his party squarely with the burgeoning ranks of urban , middle - class consumers who own their apartments , often a car , and perhaps a small business .
" This law means that an ordinary home buyer can be sure that his children and grandchildren will still be able to live in the apartment he buys , " says Li Datong , an enthusiastically reformist political analyst .
" Before , he could not be certain . "
" People 's living standards have improved in general , and they urgently require effective protection of their own lawful property accumulated through hard work , " argued Mr. Wang as he presented the Property Law to the NPC .
Such protection , he added , is " the general aspiration and urgent demand of the people . "
By casting the law in this light Wang was seeking to counter criticism from opponents that it benefits only China 's super - rich by legalizing the dubious deals through which many of them got their start in business – buying state property at rock - bottom prices .
Pressured by that sort of argument , the legislation 's drafters introduced several amendments " of tremendous practical significance , " Wang insisted , to " strengthen protection of socialist public property " and defend it from questionable privatization .
But the law is clearly not limited to the houses and cars that Chinese city - dwellers regard as necessities , in the same light as their parents once viewed wristwatches , bicycles , and sewing machines .
Protection of private property extends to the " means of production " – a recognition of reality in a country where private enterprise now accounts for nearly two - thirds of GDP .
It does not , however , extend to agricultural land , which remains collectively owned by peasant villages and not immune to seizures by developers , which have provoked thousands of sometimes violent protests in recent years .
Denying farmers the right to own their land , argues one European diplomat , " is a great missed opportunity and a demonstration of [ President ]
Hu Jintao 's lack of courage . "
The law leaves the current system , whereby farmers rent their land for 30 - year periods , untouched .
Peasants can sublet their assigned land to neighbors , but may not sell it nor borrow against it on a mortgage so as to invest in machinery or other equipment .
Reforming that system was clearly too radical a prospect for a cautious government that had enough trouble with the law as it was .
In putting their free - market reformist right foot forward , the authorities had to dress their move up in a good deal of leftist language about " improving the Chinese - style socialist property system " and how " the State - owned economic sector is the leading force " so as to placate opponents of the Property Law .
In its careful shuffle along the reformist path , the government is also putting its left foot forward at this NPC , promising more spending on education and healthcare , and major legislation in the coming months to strengthen labor rights and social - security protection .
Brandishing his goal of a " harmonious society " beset by less of the envy and social conflict that scars today 's China , President
Hu seems guided more than anything else by the search for " the proper balance between the need for further and deeper economic reforms and at the same time the need to go much further in terms of social protection " says the Western diplomat .
Even though he does not agree with them , Mr. Li welcomes the law 's opponents as " an important counterbalance to power in China .
" The result of their opposition could be seen as a warning to the government that in the future it should pay more attention to social fairness and less to economic efficiency , " he says .
While the law 's drafters say in private they were disappointed to have been obliged to amend their original proposals for political reasons , and critics say they regret not having been able to block the law , " improvements always come step by step , " Li adds .
" It was a compromise " he says .
" But history advances by compromise . "
In a major speech , he said the " war on terror " may last a generation but to retreat would be a " catastrophe " .
He also admitted the Army was doing more than planned and that there were " real problems " with military housing .
The Tories said Mr Blair 's legacy would be an " overstretched " army .
The Lib Dems said his foreign policy had " severely " harmed Britain 's reputation .
Speaking aboard HMS Albion in Plymouth , the prime minister said Britain and the world faced a " new and different " security challenge following 11 September 2001 .
And Britain had to choose whether it wanted to be in the front line of the global fight against terrorism , or retreat to a peacekeeping role .
" My choice is for armed forces that are prepared to engage in this difficult , tough , challenging campaign , to be war fighters as well as peacekeepers , " he told an audience of servicemen .
He said he wanted to keep a strong American alliance and " for us as a nation to be as willing to fight terrorism and pay the cost of that fight wherever it may be " .
But he acknowledged that Britain 's armed forces were under strain fighting twin campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan .
' Unnerved '
" It is true that operational commitments are at a higher level than originally planned .
Service personnel are working harder and for longer than intended , " he said .

And although he believed the condition of service accommodation had been " exaggerated , " resentment over it was more " raw " among the military , because of what was being asked of them .
" The extraordinary job that servicemen do needs to be reflected in the quality of accommodation provided for them and their families , at home or abroad , " said Mr Blair .
Mr Blair admitted public opinion was divided over Britain 's military campaigns and " unnerved by the absence of victory " in its traditional form .
' Too late '
But he argued against political disengagement and said that Britain must be prepared to fight for its values and that defence spending would have to increase .
" Terrorism can not be defeated by military means alone , but it can't be defeated without it , " said Mr Blair .
But shadow foreign secretary William Hague said soldiers wanted to know what Mr Blair was going to do now , about their accommodation , allowances , medical care and equipment .
Mr Blair acknowledged troops were under strain
" After a decade in power , his legacy will be an overstretched army , navy and air force .
It 's too late to have a ' debate ' , " he said .
And Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell said military action in Iraq , undertaken without UN authority , had " severely damaged Britain 's reputation " .
" Britain has to learn that we will only be at our most effective in tackling terrorism when we operate within the rules and with allies of the same mind , " he said .
Left - wing MP John McDonnell , who intends to stand for the Labour leadership once Mr Blair resigns , said Mr Blair had made " catastrophic foreign policy mistakes " .
Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond said Mr Blair had made the world " a more dangerous place " and was " clearly trying to foist that legacy onto his successor " .

It was from Baikonur that the first satellite to orbit the Earth was launched , and that Yuri Gagarin , the first man to orbit the Earth , was launched into space in 1961 .
Since the collapse of the USSR , many areas of the Baikonur site have simply been abandoned , because the Russian government cannot afford to maintain them .
Those areas which are not in use are not guarded , and this continues to result in the robbery of equipment and materials .
Besides , the surroundings of the Cosmodrome have become a kind of “ spaceship junkyard " , as many fuel tanks and booster stages fell back to earth before reaching orbit .

According to
Built in 1955 , when Kazakhstan was part of the Soviet Union , Baikonur covers 6717 square kilometres and extends 75 kilometres from north to south and 90 kilometres from east to west .
The base contains dozens of launch pads , five tracking - control centres , nine tracking stations and a 1500 - kilometre rocket test range .
As you can see , spacecrafts and rockets are usually transported by train from the final assembly hangar to the Baikonur Cosmodrome .
The name Baikonur was chosen to intentionally mislead the West as to the actual location of the site by suggesting that the site was near Baikonur , a mining town about 320 kilometers northeast of the space centre in the desert area near Dzhezkazgan .
Nowadays , Russia pays $ 115 million annually for the use of Baikonur under an agreement that will remain in effect until 2050 .

It is located in the middle of the vast Kazakh desert , where temperature ranges from - 40 ºC to 45 °C and some peaceful camels watch the spaceships passing by .

We 've broken the " L word " barrier :
Leahy : Bush Aides Lying About E- Mails By LAURIE KELLMAN
Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON ( AP ) -- President Bush 's aides are lying about White House e-mails sent on a Republican account that might have been lost , a powerful Senate chairman said Thursday , vowing to subpoena those documents if the administration fails to cough them up .
" They say they have not been preserved .
I do n't believe that ! "
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy shouted from the Senate floor .
" You can't erase e-mails , not today .
They 've gone through too many servers , " said Leahy , D - Vt .
" Those e-mails are there , they just do n't want to produce them .
We 'll subpoena them if necessary . "
Leahy also drew one key parallel to Watergate :
" Like the famous 18 - minute gap in the Nixon White House tapes , it appears likely that key documentation has been erased or misplaced .
This sounds like the Administration 's version of ' the dog ate my homework . ' "
Media note : Suggested scandal nickname , DogAte .
So yes , we now have our 18 - minute gap .
But keep in mind that the statutory remedy available to Congress here is contempt charges , and that the unfortunate reality about contempt of Congress is ... it gets prosecuted at the discretion of the U.S. Attorney 's office .
Would the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia -- appointed by Gonzales under the infamous and now - repealed provision of the PATRIOT Act -- refuse to prosecute the White House and the Department of Justice for failing to produce the subpoenaed e-mails , or for destroying them ?
Well , it 's happened before .
Back in the 80s , the Reagan DoJ refused to prosecute EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch Burford for her contempt of Congress charges , and even filed suit against the House of Representatives to block the enforcement of their subpoenas .
So what we have here is not just an 18 - minute gap , but a case where Archibald Cox has already been fired .
We 've already had our Saturday Night Massacre .
The question is , what is Congress prepared to do about it ?
Will they utilize the other methods and remedies available to them ?
Or will they throw their hands up and hope the courts will do their work for them ?
And if they decide to rely on the courts -- a dicey proposition , at best -- will that just effectively run out the clock , as the " administration " is doubtless hoping to do ?
Even if Congress should manage to prevail in court , will we find out too late in the game , only to be told that yes , they were right all along , but the 2008 election season fast approaching , it 's time to " focus our energy " ... again ?
The last time around , the word was that the most important thing about winning back the majority in Congress was subpoena power .
Well , either Congress has that power or it does n't .
Right now , for all the outrage the Bush White House is producing , Congress still does n't have the e-mails .
Before we 're asked again to " focus our energy " on the elections , let 's hear a little bit from Congress about how they 'll be focusing their energy right now .
To wait for the judicial branch to do the legislative branch 's work is only to ensure the eventual Iran-Contrafication of the current spate of scandals .

需要ゆえに不足傾向にあ るJavaエンジニア
Javaエンジニアは 、Java言語を使用しながらのプログラミングを行うことが仕事である。JavaとはC言語ベースで簡易化されたプログラミング言語のために、比較的誰もが習得しやすい言語となっていて、Java言語を扱えるエンジニアやプログラマー人口はとても多いのが現状だ。
しかし、最近のスマートフォンやWeb組み込みのプログラムなどはほとんどがJava言語が使用されていて、Javaのエンジニア、プログラマーは不足の傾向といえる。
プログラムの設計仕様はディレクターなどから依頼が来る形が多いので、どのようなプログラムを作るべきなのかを考える必要はない。与えられた仕様を満たすようにひたすらプログラミング作業に徹するのみである。もちろん、Java言語も日々進化しているため、プログラミングを行う上で、ゲームの仕様に対してさらに画期的なアイディアを組み込めるようであれば、速やかにディレクターに提案するのが良いだろう。
また、ディレクターから与えられた納期は絶対である。Javaエンジニアにとっては、納期との戦いとなるであろう。
最近 、Javaエンジニアの仕事としてよくあるのは、他言語で設計されたプログラムをJavaに移行する作業である。たとえば、パソコンなどで流行したアプリケーションをスマートフォン向けに再開発しようという時に行うのだ。その作業は、比較的楽な作業ではあるが、元となるC言語などについて学んでおく必要もあるだろう。プログラマーにとっては、他言語など勉強をしなければならない毎日が続くことになる。
こう書いてしまう とJavaエンジニアは大変な仕事だと尻込みするかもしれないが、需要の高さは間違いなく、Java言語自体の汎用性の高さもあって、未経験者にも門戸は開いている。先を見据えても、まだまだJavaエンジニアが求められる現状が続くと予想されるので、その需要を満たす人物になって活躍することを一考する価値はあると言えるだろう。

He argues anti-Americanism is often a cover for hatreds with little justification in fact .
His three part series takes him to Cairo , Caracas and Washington but it begins where anti-Americanism began - in Paris .
Protests against nuclear weapons often focus on American weapons
My dear mother Gloria Webb , who died last year , was one of the protesters .
In her day , she was an energetic duffle - coated figure who wanted to ban the bomb , stop wars of all kinds and suffering anywhere .
She was a wonderful person , my mum , and so were her friends .
Yet it always struck me , when she told me about these protests ( and when , I freely confess , I attended them with enthusiasm as a youngster ) that there was an odd one - sidedness to the game .
The protests against nuclear weapons , for instance , concentrated on American weapons .
The anti-war rallies were against American - led wars .
The anti death penalty campaign focused on Texas .
A pattern was emerging and has never seriously been altered .
A pattern of willingness to condemn America for the tiniest indiscretion - or to magnify those indiscretions - while leaving the murderers , dictators , and thieves who run other nations oddly untouched .
In the beginning
And if anti-Americanism is alive and well among surprisingly mild - mannered people in Britain - how much more virulent must it be in tougher parts of the world ?
Criticism of American power and American life lives on in Paris
And Paris .
Paris ?
Yes Paris - where it all began .
Anti-Americanism was born in France .
And here 's a fascinating fact : it was born well before the United States existed .
It was not caused by Coca - Cola , or McDonald 's , or Hollywood or George W Bush .
The prevailing view among French academics throughout the 18th Century was that the New World was ghastly .
It stank , it was too humid for life to prosper .
And , as one European biologist put it : " Everything found there is degenerate or monstrous . "
In their heart of hearts , many French people still believe that to be true .
A French intellectual once compared the United States with Belgium .
Wounding .
But you see what he meant : the French capital has a grandeur about it that demands attention on the world stage .
Belgium does not , nor does most of America .
Washington is grand but Washington was designed by a Frenchman and his vision did n't fit the rest of the nation .
America is ordinary .
Go on say it out loud on the streets of Paris : " America is ordinary " .
It celebrates the pursuit of small - scale happiness - in families and communities - and that is what the anti-Americans can't stand .
Dislike
In the heart of Paris , there is the Avenue Franklin Roosevelt .
Roosevelt , the man who helped defeat Nazi Germany and liberate Parisian streets , is celebrated here .
And the point many French people make is that they would celebrate George W Bush , too , if they agreed with him .
The source of anti-Americanism is plain they say .
As one interviewee told us : " It 's the policies , Stupid . "
Bernard - Henri
Levy says more balance is needed in the French debate on America
The kind of anti-Americanism fostered by French intellectuals down the centuries revolves around intense dislike of what America is - not what it does .
Sitting in the Cafe de Flore , in the very seat where Jean - Paul Sartre once held sway , the self - described writer and philosopher Bernard - Henri Levy puts it like this : America became the nightmare that French right - wing intellectuals long feared , a nation built not on respectable ties of blood and tradition but on the self - conscious desire to create something new .
Antagonism
Levy is sympathetic to the US , and a book he wrote on his travels there , American Vertigo , is a balanced and thoughtful piece of work .
But such balance is , according to Levy , missing in the French political debate on American power and American life .
He describes a process whereby this antagonism to the fundamentals of the USA - to the kind of democracy that celebrates and encourages ordinariness - migrates hither and thither in the French body politic .
It began on the right but now in the shape of Jose Bove ( the anti-McDonald 's campaigner , and presidential candidate ) and other luminaries of the left , it lives on .
And this is not a recent migration brought on by Mr Bush .
In May 1944 ( just weeks before American GIs landed on the beaches of Normandy ) , Hubert Beuve - Mery , the founder of Le Monde newspaper - certainly no mouthpiece of the right - wrote this : " The Americans represent a real danger for France , different from the one posed by Germany or the one with which the Russians may - in time - threaten us .
The Americans may have preserved a cult of Liberty but they do not feel the need to liberate themselves from the servitude which their capitalism has created . "
It is time that we understood that this attitude , this contempt for what democracy can do , is at the heart of at least some of the anti-Americanism we see in the world today .
" Death to America " : Anti-Americanism examined will be broadcast on Radio 4 over three weeks starting on 16 April at 2000 BST .

Meanwhile , a new picture is emerging in which the “ diseases of civilization &rdquo — heart disease , diabetes , overweight , tooth decay , and perhaps even Alzheimer 's disease and many cancers — are symptoms of a metabolic dysfunction caused by both the wrong foods and deficiencies of the right ones .
The most likely culprits appear to be metabolism - disrupting lectins in grains ( especially wheat , other gluten grains , and soy ) ; fructose ( often in the form of high fructose corn syrup , from grain ) ; omega - 6 fats and lectins in vegetable seed oils ( also from grain ) ; iron ; and deficiencies of Vitamin D 3 , Vitamin K 2 MK - 4 , copper , omega - 3 fats , magnesium , and niacin .
It is not yet clear whether carbohydrates in large amounts are inherently harmful , though they are clearly harmful to many people who have broken their metabolisms with grain products .
( If there is a safe carbohydrate source , it is probably root vegetables . )
Consumption of grains , vegetable seed oils , fructose , and carbohydrates has risen sharply , and intake of Vitamin K 2 MK - 4 has dropped , in response to official demonization of dietary saturated fat , causing increases of type 2 diabetes and obesity .
The American Medical Association , the American Heart Association , the American Diabetes Association , and many other authorities have blood on their hands , and they will continue to lead us lambs into the slaughterhouse of grain poisoning until the culture of nutritional research is reformed .
While I 've been aware of these facts for some time , I now have a rigorous account to direct people to .
Gary Taubes , in Good Calories , Bad Calories — his new exposé of what the scientific data really reveal — writes , “ The institutionalized vigilance , ‘ this unending exchange of critical judgment , ’ is nowhere to be found in the study of nutrition , chronic disease , and obesity , and it has n't been for decades .
For this reason , it is difficult to use the term ‘ scientist ’ to describe those individuals who work in these disciplines . …
The result is an enormous enterprise dedicated in theory to determining the relationship between diet , obesity , and disease , while dedicated in practice to convincing everyone involved , and the lay public , most of all , that the answers are already known and always have been — an enterprise , in other words , that purports to be a science and yet functions like a religion . ”
Harsh words , but words entirely justified by the data in the research literature — though the papers that present those data often go through great contortions to explain them away and defend the dogma .
I call upon the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) to fund large randomized controlled trials that test the hypothesis that grain - derived carbohydrates are central in the etiology of coronary heart disease , diabetes , and obesity .
Over the past two decades , the NIH has dedicated its largest nutritional grants to unsuccessfully confirming the “ fat is bad ” hypothesis , while neglecting all competing hypotheses .
We are all suffering for this misallocation of resources .
“ In my psychedelic , hazy - vision state , where I reach the ultimate heightened awareness of the beer - buzz , I realise the true meaning of exams : that professors are evil , torture - loving beings , and that we cannot blame them for their shortcomings . ”

Nation Document shows Romney 's strategies Plan addresses faith , rivals , shift on issues
Here are some views of Mitt Romney causing concern inside his campaign :
His hair looks too perfect , he's not a tough war time leader , and he has earned a reputation as " Slick Dancing Mitt " or " Flip - Flop Mitt . "
Romney and his advisers have identified those perceptions as threats to his bid for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination , according to an exhaustive internal campaign document obtained by the Globe .
The 77 - slide PowerPoint presentation offers a revealing look at Romney 's pursuit of the White House , outlining a plan for branding himself , framing his competitors , and allaying voter concerns about his record , his Mormon faith , and his shifts on key issues like abortion .
Dated Dec. 11 , the blueprint is wide - ranging and analyzes in detail the strengths and weaknesses of Romney and his two main Republican rivals , Senator John McCain of Arizona and Rudolph W. Giuliani , former mayor of New York .
The plan , which top Romney strategist Alex Castellanos helped to draft , charts a course for Romney to emerge as the nominee , but acknowledges that the " electorate is not where it needs to be for us to succeed . "
It is unclear how the campaign is using the document .
However , its expansiveness , level of detail and the involvement of Castellanos suggest that it is a significant strategic blueprint .
On the campaign trail , Romney is sounding some of the themes outlined in it .
Romney spokesman Kevin Madden would not confirm or deny the plan 's authenticity , saying only that the former governor has received an " overly abundant " amount of input on how to run his campaign .
Asked specifically about the contents , Madden said : " If anything , it 's a compilation of political conventional wisdom . "
" We 're obviously very , very focused on introducing Mitt Romney and his vision for leading the country into the future , " Madden said .
" And everybody recognizes that he 's somebody with a lot of energy and a lot of ideas . "
Campaign blueprints analyzing a candidate and the competition are not unusual ; earlier this year , the New York Daily News obtained and wrote about a similar dossier from Giuliani 's campaign .
And the Romney presentation lacks any big bombshells .
Still , it provides a window into the challenges and opportunities Romney and his advisors envision as he tries to win the Republican primary .
The plan , for instance , indicates that Romney will define himself in part by focusing on and highlighting enemies and adversaries , such common political targets as " jihadism , " the " Washington establishment , " and taxes , but also Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton , " European - style socialism , " and , specifically , France .
Even Massachusetts , where Romney has lived for almost 40 years , is listed as one of those " bogeymen , " alongside liberalism and Hollywood values .
Indeed , a page titled " Primal Code for Brand Romney " said that Romney should define himself as a foil to Bay State Democrats such as Senators Edward M. Kennedy and John Kerry and former governor Michael Dukakis .
Romney should position himself as " the anti-Kerry , " the presentation says .
But elsewhere in the plan , it 's clear that Romney and his aides are aware he 's open to the same charge that helped derail Kerry 's presidential campaign in 2004 : that he is a flip - flopper who has changed positions out of political expediency .
Because he is attempting to capture the conservative vote , Romney is facing persistent questions about his relatively recent shifts to more conservative positions on issues such as abortion , gay rights , and gun control .
One page of the plan cites Kerry and says Romney does n't want to spend 2007 facing skepticism about his conservative message .
The blueprint also describes political assets and vulnerabilities of McCain and Giuliani , who lead Romney in the polls .
McCain is described as a war hero and maverick with a compelling narrative and a reputation for wit , authenticity , and straight talk .
But he 's also seen as " too Washington , " " too close to [ Democratic ] Left , " an " uncertain , erratic , unreliable leader in uncertain times . "
" Does he fit The Big Chair ? " the document asks .
The plan calls McCain , 70 , a " mature brand " and raises questions about whether he could handle the rigors of leading the free world .
Giuliani is called an outside - the - Beltway rock star and truth teller who earned the nation 's trust for his leadership of New York City 's response to the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
But he is described as a one - dimensional Lone Ranger whose social views -- he supports abortion rights and civil unions for gay couples -- could destroy the " GOP brand . "
" We ca n't disqualify Dems like Hillary on social issues ever again " if Giuliani is the nominee , the document states .
The plan also touches on what it calls Giuliani 's ethical issues , including his relationship with Bernard Kerik , former New York police commissioner who withdrew from consideration to become US homeland security secretary amid allegations of improprieties .
It raises Giuliani's " personal political liabilities , " an apparent reference to his three marriages and bitter public divorce from his second wife , Donna Hanover .
It is clear that Romney 's campaign operatives plan to make sure that voters are familiar with the perceived weaknesses of McCain and Giuliani and conduct opposition research on the candidates .
But the campaign , according to the blueprint , also wants to avoid attacking either man too directly or harshly , in part because Romney wants their supporters to ultimately shift to him .
At a campaign stop in New Hampshire last week , he called McCain and Giuliani friends and national heroes .
The plan concedes that , with McCain and Giuliani in the race , Romney is unlikely to be the top pick for those voters looking for a " war / strong leader . "
His goal appears to be establishing himself as a credible second choice for those voters , but the first pick for voters looking for an energetic , optimistic , and innovative chief executive .
( A page titled " Own the future " dubs McCain the past , Giuliani the present , and Romney the future . )
The case for Romney , according to the plan , is this : " Mitt Romney , tested , intelligent , get - it - done , turnaround CEO Governor and strong leader from outside Washington , is a better candidate than McCain & Giuliani to ensure that America 's strength is maintained so we can meet a new generation of global challenges . "
The document underscores Romney 's aim to become the " only electable choice " for socially conservative voters .
But the plan anticipates that Romney could face a serious threat if Newt Gingrich , the former House speaker who is considered one of the GOP 's leading conservative intellectuals , decides to enter the race .
Romney 's sensitivity to his Mormon faith as a campaign issue is apparent throughout the plan .
It acknowledges that some view Mormonism as weird and lists ways Romney should defend his faith , from highlighting the way he has lived his life , rather than which church he attends , to acknowledging theological differences with mainline Christian denominations while refusing to be drawn into an extensive discussion of Mormon doctrine and practices .
It also suggests Romney might soon need to address the issue head - on , perhaps as John F. Kennedy did in a 1960 speech amid concerns about his relationship to the Catholic Church .
The document appears to raise the possibility of Romney delivering such an address at George H.W. Bush 's presidential library outside Houston , the same city where Kennedy gave his .
Enmity toward France , where Romney did his Mormon mission during college , is a recurring theme of the document .
The European Union , it says at one point , wants to " drag America down to Europe 's standards , " adding : " That 's where Hillary and Dems would take us .
Hillary = France . "
The plan even envisions " First , not France " bumper stickers .
In addition , the document provides a Romney roadmap for the early primaries , suggesting that he hopes to emerge as a credible " alternative to frontrunner " in Iowa , win New Hampshire , show strength in South Carolina , and be dominant in states , such as Michigan , that are eyeing early primary dates .
The plan suggests Romney make full use of new media to reach voters , from feeding videos to YouTube to perhaps creating his own radio programming .
Like every Republican in the race , Romney faces the delicate task of how to talk about President Bush , whom the country gives low job - approval ratings .
But the plan lists two ways Romney can set himself apart from Bush .
The first says , simply , " Intelligence . "

Randy Morin says
Google has not been acting on his diligent spam reporting , with SpamSense accounts and Splogger sites still active .
I 'm not surprised .
I 've long suspected that two years ago , Google replaced all their employees with algorithms .
How else do you explain the lack of mutiny over the months - long search for a new chef ?
Clearly the robots do n't care , since they do n't need food .
But , in all seriousness , its one thing for Google to not be developing systems to track and remove spam , but the least that can be done is to listen to users that have done the work for them .
Spam sites are easy to recognize at a glance , so once Google has the URL , it is just lazy to not take action .

Walking a mile in another person 's shoes may be the best way to understand the emotions , perceptions , and motivations of an individual ; however , in a recent study appearing in the December 2006 issue of Psychological Science , it is reported that those in power are often unable to take such a journey .
In the article , Power and Perspectives Not Taken , Adam Galinsky of Northwestern University , Joe Magee of the Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at NYU , and colleagues at Stanford University found that possessing power itself serves as an impediment to understanding the perspectives of others .
Through several studies , the researchers assessed the effect of power on perspective taking , adjusting to another 's perspective , and interpreting the emotions of others .
To study the link between power and perspective taking , Galinsky and colleagues used a unique method in which the participants were told to draw the letter E on their forehead .
If the subject wrote the E in a self - oriented direction , backwards to others , this indicated a lack of perspective taking .
On the other hand , when the E was written legible to others , this indicated that the person had thought about how others might perceive the letter .
The results showed that those who had previously been randomly assigned to a high power group were almost three times more likely to draw a self - oriented E than those who were assigned to the low power condition .
Galinsky and colleagues also found that power leads individuals to anchor too heavily on their own vantage point , thus leaving them unable to adjust to another person 's perspective and decreases one 's ability to correctly interpret emotion .
Galinsky says that this research has " wide - ranging implications , from business to politics . "
For example , " Presidents who preside over a divided government ( and thus have reduced power ) might be psychologically predisposed to consider alternative viewpoints more readily than those that preside over unified governments . "
Galinsky also adds that a key is to somehow make perspective - taking part and parcel of power , " The springboard of power combined with perspective - taking may be a particularly constructive force . "
I was raised in a bilingual family in New Orleans -- we spoke both English and New Orleans - ese .
French did n't really enter into it , although I 'm sure some families were trilingual and included that language as well .
The local language is well - suited to the local person .
You may now be wondering ...
What 's a Yat ?
" Yat " is a term for the quintessential neighborhood New Orleanian .
It 's derived from the local greeting , " Where y'at ! " , although it tends not to be used by locals in the way it 's used by outsiders .
I never really heard the term while growing up , and neither did many of my fellow New Orleanians .
It 's come into casual acceptance , although the acknowledged expert on local speech , Bunny Matthews , hates the word and considers it a pejorative .
Bunny told me he though that it's " the kind of thing that a Tulane student from the Northeast would come up with . "
Personally , I do n't think Tulane students from the Northeast were that clever , but I respect Bunny 's thoughts on the matter .
Many if not most New Orleanians will use a few , some or all of the terms below , but not all New Orleanians employ the truly hardcore local pronunciations .
A brief explanation of what constitutes the true essence of local speech and its users is offered here , excerpted from Tim Lyman 's introduction to Bunny Matthews ' wonderful first book of comic strips featuring New Orleans dialogue , F'Sure ! : Actual Dialogue Heard on the Streets of New Orleans , now sadly out of print .
In a bit of double irony , not only is Tim not a local ( Bunny describes him as a " Yankee " ) , but Bunny himself refuses to use the word " Yat " to describe either locals or their speech .
Still , it 's one of the best descriptions of localness I 've ever read :
For those of you unfamiliar with New Orleans culture , a good place to start is that there are basically only two kinds of people in New Orleans .
The first is those folks that live , as one [ of Bunny 's ] cartoon characters puts it , in Gatorland -- " Yeah , you know ... ova dere across Magazine where dey all wear dem shoits wid lil ' gators on 'em . "
Otherwise knows as Uptown , you can tell folks from Gatorland in the cartoons because they speak English .
Another clue is that all skinny people are from Gatorland , although not all people from Gatorland are skinny .
And they often have 59 rows of teeth .
The other kind of New Orleanian is Everyone Else , dose folks dat talk normal .
Be they Black , White or Creole , whether they live right in the backyards of Uptown or way out in da Ninth Ward , Chalmette , or even across da River , they are united in the fact that their homes and lives have not been renovated , that life is the same as it's always been , only worse .
The best generic term for Everyone Else is " Yat " , a word too often limited by its etymology so that it refers merely to those who greet you with " Where y'at ? " most often .
Yat is actually much broader than this ; it is a state of mind .
Unlike the Gatorlander , who is always consumed with the particulars of trying to live the modern life , the Yat is convinced that modernity is a disaster .
Naturally enough then , the Yat feels most alive in the most disastrous of circumstances .
The average New Orleanian housewife , as Bunny once noted , has an internist 's working knowledge of every possible disease that can be caught in these parts .
The man who holds the attention of the barroom is the guy who can top everyone else 's hard luck stories .
The Great Flood of May 3 , 1978 was the most exciting of recent times , at least until another Hurricane comes .
Even Carnival is talked of by the Yat in the most matter - of - fact ways , only the abominations of tradition being noteworthy .
A few words on New Orleansese : in a city whose very name is pronounced in nearly 100 different ways by its citizens , all the way from the filigreed , nearly five - syllable " Nyoo Ahhlyins " to the monosyllabic grunt of " Nawln ' " , it takes a very sensitive ear , not to mention years of practice , to pinpoint the incredible binds the native speaker encounters , those specific words where the slow tongue gives up and makes a leap of faith .
For those who have never heard it , you must begin by imagining Brooklynese on Quaaludes .
The dialect changes , too , within the City , from Schwegmann 's to Schwegmann's .
Each neighborhood has its own input to the living language .
But mostly , the local dialect is one of inflection .
Whether it's a " you " or a " ya " or a " y ' " , whether there is time for a " th " or only a " d " , all depends on the placement of the word in the phrase , where the accents fall .
Some folks wonder aloud why [ Bunny 's cartoon ] characters are often so fat and ugly .
Strange question to ask when a little neutral observation reveals that 99 percent of native New Orleanians are both overweight and unpleasant to look at .
Of course , it 's the diet .
The food in New Orleans is the best in the world , but light it ain't .
Like the character who exclaims , " It ai n't da seafood dat makes ya fat anyway -- it 's da batta ! " ... carefully ignoring the fact that he eats the better part of a whole loaf of French bread with every half - dozen oysters .
Obesity and facial dots seem a small price to pay for such pleasure -- me , I 'll take the food .
-- by Tim Lyman
Now that you 've had a peek into the heart and soul of what makes us locals tick when we talk , I offer you this lexicon of local speech , so when you visit New Orleans you wo n't wonder , " What in the hell is he / she talking about ? "
I hope that this brings back memories for natives , and I also hope that it may enlighten visitors to the Crescent City .
It may help make the difference between a mere tourist and a truly interested visitor , and I think that 's an important distinction .
You do n't want to look like an idiot , saying " Huh ? " , when the lady behind the counter at the po-boy shop asks you , " Ya want dat dressed , dawlin' ? "
My thanks to the oodles of members of the old New Orleans Internet Mailing List , other New Orleanians ( expatriate and still livin ' at home ) on the ' Net , family and friends for their invaluable aid and the contributions they made to this list .
A note on pronunciation
I 've tried to reproduce phonetic spelling of New Orleanian words and places as best as I could , without being able to reproduce the IPA alphabet online .
In my phonetic spelling , the " @ " character will be used to represent the schwa , or neutral vowel sound ( represented in dictionaries and IPA as the upside - down " e " ) .
The syllable of major stress will be capitalized , and the syllable of secondary stress will be preceded by an apostrophe .
Also remember a general rule of thumb : New Orleanians tend to stress the first syllable of most words and place names .
There are also certain standard English words ( other than the articles and pronouns ) which are pronounced in very special ways in New Orleans , and these will also be included below .
One major point of pronunciation with locals is to never pronounce words that end in " er " or " ing " as spelled .
Examples : trailer = trailuh ( or " traila " ) , border = borduh , driver = drivuh , etc . .
The " ing " words are always pronounced without the " g " .
Examples : swimming = swimmin , looking = lookin , walking = walkin , etc .
See the movie !
Award - winning filmakers Louis Alvarez and Andrew Kolker of the Center for New American Media have made an absolutely marvelous half - hour documentary film entitled " Yeah You Rite " , which is a lively look at the at the unique language of New Orleans .
Not only is it a lot of fun , and very enjoyable for both native and visitor alike , but it's also a tremendous and serious study and perfect example and portrayal of a unique regional dialect .
A very good friend of mine is a linguist , and has taught this film to his Intro to Linguistics students .
It 's available for a fairly high institutional price through the above link ; you might ask them if they have a home video version available .
If enough people ask , they might make it happen .

Another good one was contributed by Gumbo Pages reader Larry Beron : " A friend of mine went to the Rally 's at Vets and Bonnabel in Metairie and overheard the driver of the car ahead of him ask the drive - up clerk , ' Say bra ... how many meats y'all put on them double - cheeseburgers ? ' " )
BRAKE TAG -
An inspection sticker on your car , proof that you 've passed the required annual safety inspection .
It encompasses several areas of your car ( e.g. , horn , wipers , etc. ) but is primarily concerned with the integrity of your brakes .
Given the fact that New Orleans is surrounded by various lakes , rivers and canals , a bad set of brakes could mean that you might end up at the bottom of one of those bodies of water at the very least .
Throughout New Orleans ( although I 'm not sure about other parts of Louisiana ) , the inspection sticker is called a " brake tag " .
If it 's expired and you get pulled over , you 're guaranteed to get a ticket .
( Believe me , I know . )

Out - of - towners often pronounce it with the hard " ch " sound as in " charge " .
It 's more like < shall - MAY - shen > or < shall - ME - shen > , and the city is pronounced < shall - MET >.
Once occasionally used as an insult ; many New Orleanians had a low opinion of Chalmette .
However , given the horrendous devastation of St. Bernard Parish brought on by MR - GO and the failed levees following Hurricane Katrina , and the outpouring of grief and warm feelings to the people of Da Parish , it is considered gauche to make fun of Chalmations these days .
CHARMER - The quintessential female Yat. Pronounced < CHAW - muh >.
CHIEF , CHEEF - A form of address between men , along the lines of " cap " and " podna " .
COARDNER - Corner .

CUSH -CUSH , KUSH -KUSH , COUCHE -COUCHE - An old French / Cajun breakfast dish my grandmother used to prepare .

DIS - This .
DODO , MAKE DODO - Sleep .
From the Cajun French " fais do do " , or " make sleep " .
In Acadiana , the term " fais do do " is used for a Cajun dance , and is thought to have originated when the parents would tell their kids to hurry up and " fais do do " so that they could go to the dance ; alternately , it 's said that the hosts of the house dances ( bals de maison ) would have a separate room for parents to put their small children , and the lady watching them would keep singing lullabyes and saying " fais do do " so that they could sleep amidst the din of the dancing Cajuns .
DOUBLOON - A coin , approximately the size of a silver dollar , minted on a yearly basis by the various Mardi Gras krewes .
The standard type is made of aluminum and they 're thrown from Mardi Gras floats by the parade riders .
The distinctive sound of a doubloon hitting da cement is enough to start a mad scramble , where you 're likely to trample on an old lady , or alternately be trampled by an old lady .
Doubloons usually come in a variety of colors , and collectors try not only to collect all available colors , but also the exclusive krewe members - only versions made of brushed aluminum , brass or even silver .
Doubloons have traditionally been collected with great fervor and rabidity , but from what I can tell their popularity has fallen off over the years .
Pronounced < d@- BLOON > , and the cries of " Da- BLOOOOON !!!
Da-BLOOOOOOON !!! " can often be heard along parade routes .
Unfortunately , the passion for catching doubloons and for doubloon collecting seems to have waned in recent years .
Seems people want cups , or those stupid long strings of beads , rather than a nice , collectible doubloon .
I think it 's a shame .
DOWN DA ROAD - A staple in the vocabulary of the St. Bernard Parish Yat , along with up da road .
This term is travel directions for someone headed to lower St. Bernard Parish traveling on St. Bernard Highway ( US Highway 46 ) .
You are usually in da parish when you use this phrase with a destination of either Violet or Poydras .
For example : " Let 's go down da road and pass over by the trailah pawk . "

ERNGE , URNGE - An orange - colored citrus fruit .

ESPLANADE - Walkway .

FLYIN ' HORSES - Accented on the first syllable .
A merry - go - round , sometimes specifically describing the merry - go - round in City Park , but also used in general .
I 've never heard this term used outside of New Orleans to describe a merry - go - round or carousel .
FOR - a preposition used by New Orleanians instead of " at " or " by " when referring to time .
E.g. , " Da parade 's for 7:00 , but we betta get dere for 6 if we wanna find pawkin ' . "
This one tends to be particularly confusing to non-natives .
FRONATOWN - ( i.e. , " front of town ) the area from North Claiborne to the No. Broad St. and beyond , up to Bayou St. John , particularly if you walked " northwesterly " on Orleans Ave .
Popularly used in the 6th and 7th Wards ( submitted by caljazz98-at-aol.com )

GAWD - A supernatural deity , worshipped by most New Orleanians .
GO CUP - A paper or plastic cup for consumption of alcoholic beverages out on the street , as open glass containers ( and cans too , I think ) are illegal .
As a Bunny Matthews bartender character once said , " Here , cap -- I gotta give ya dis beer in a cup , ' cos da City Council passed dis law sayin ' I can go ta Angola fa serving ya a beer in a goddamn beer can ... "
Many non-New Orleanians are astonished that we can drink out on the street in go cups .
When I left New Orleans , I was astonished that you can't do it anywhere else ( which nearly got me arrested in Los Angeles ... uncivilized savages . )
GOUT - Pronounced < GOO >.
French for " taste . "
Usually applied to coffee .
As in , " You want a little gout ? "
Mostly old people are the only ones still saying this .
GRIP - A small suitcase , usually not a hard - shell one , more like a schoolbag or an overnight bag .

HOUSE COAT 'N CURLAS - The preferred dress for charmers while shopping at Schwegmann's .
HUCK-A-BUCKS or HUCKLE - BUCKS - Frozen Kool - Aid in a Dixie cup .
A way to keep cool during the summer .
I had never neard this term growing up , but contributor Milton Cloutier from the 7th Ward says they used this term in his neighborhood , and another 7th Warder , Darrel Schexnayder , adds even more :
The term was very common for me growing up in the 7th Ward .
Neighbors would sell the frozen treats for a nickel , along time ago .
Sometimes we 'd make them ourselves .
They were as popular as " snow - balls " are / were to the rest of New Orleans .
There is even proper etiquette for eating huckle - bucks ( as I used to call them ) .
The first thing you have to do after paying your nickel / quarter or whatever the cost :
1 . Warm the sides until the frost is mostly gone 2 .
To loosen the frozen berg from its Dixie cup confines by pushing up on the bottom of the cup .
3 . Carefully flip it over so that tapered - down bottom is up and out .
There are three major advantages to this technique -- ( 1 ) that 's where to best flavor resides ; ( 2 ) easy access to the body of the flavored ice and ( 3 ) some folks would wrap a coin in Saran Wrap and place it at the bottom .
I'LL TAKE ME A ... - May I have a ...
INKPEN - A ball - point pen , or any kind of pen , really .

INSURANCE - Pronounced < IN - sure - ence >.
JAMBALAYA - A rice - based dish containing meat and seafood , prepared in a nearly infinite variety of ways by Louisianians .
The usual out - of - towner mispronunciation has the first syllable rhyming with " jam " , when it should rhyme with " Tom " ... < jom ' - b@ - LIE-@ > , secondary accent on first syllable , primary accent on third .
But one local pronunciation that was brought to my attention ( although nobody in my family said it this way ) is < JUM - b@ - lie ' -@ > , primary accent of first syllable which rhymes with " bum " , secondary accent on third syllable .
JAWN - The most popular boys ' name in English , pronounced this way among Localese - speakers .
Also , a pot ta pee in .
Rhymes with " lawn " .
See TURLET .
K&B , KB , KB's -
A local drug store for decades , beloved by locals , whose trademark color was a deep , violent purple .
Everything in KB was purple , from the price tags to the ink pens ( and their ink ) to the managers ' and cashiers ' vests .
In the old days , K&B used to have lunch counters and soda fountains , but these were all gone by the time I was in high school in the mid- to late 70s .
Also in the old days , there were radio and TV jingles for K&B , the lyrics of which were , " Look on every corner and what do you see ?
A big purple sign that says ' Your Friendly K&B ! ' "
In schoolyards , the lyrics were often changed to have the big purple sign say something uncomplimentary and / or obscene .
" K&B " stands for " Katz and Besthoff " .
Alas , K&B is no more , having been bought out by some vile Northern chain who changed the chain 's name to " Rite Aid " and got rid of the purple .
I will never shop there again under any circumstances for as long as I live .
It 's Walgreen 's or Eckerd for me from now on .
" Streetcar " Mike Strauch has put up a K&B memorial page , with the background a brilliant , beautiful K&B purple ( see below ) .
K&B PURPLE - A particular shade of purple that you 'll know if you know K&B .
Used in phrases like , " He was so mad , his face was K&B purple " , or , " I ca n't believe ya bought dat ugly car !
It 's K&B purple ! "
LAGNIAPPE - Pronounced < LAN - yap >.
A little something extra .
Lagniappe is when your butcher gives you a pound and two ounces of hot sausage but only charges you for a pound , or when the waiter at your favorite restaurant brings you an extra dessert or something , and does n't charge you .
Lagniappe breeds good will , friendship and most importantly , return business .
Also , " Lagniappe " is the name of the entertainment pull - out section of the Friday edition of The New Orleans Times - Picayune .
LOCKA - Where you hang your clothes , analogous to the English word " closet " .
Example : " Mom - MAH !
Where my shoes at ? "
" Looka in ya locka ! " ( See LOOKA ) Occasionally spelled " locker " , as if it was proper English .
Generally always used in place of the word " closet " , but I must confess I have yet to hear this term used in the context of a gay or lesbian person " comin ' outta da locka ... " :^)
LOOKA - The imperative case of the verb " to look " .
Usually accompanied by a pointing gesture .
Often used as a single exclamation : " Looka ! "
LOOKIT DA T.V. - To watch T.V. Locals do n't watch T.V. , they look at it .
Oh , and in proper Localese form , it 's pronounced < TEE - vee > , emphasis on the first syllable .
MAKE GROCERIES , MAKIN ' GROCERIES -
To do grocery shopping .
Thought to have originated with the French expression for grocery shopping , " faire le marché " .
The verb " faire " can mean either " to do " or " to make " , and the idiom may have been mistranslated .
MARDI GRAS -
This grand pre-Lenten celebration for which New Orleans is famous is pronounced < MAW - dee GRAW >.
MARRAINE - Pronounced < MAH-ran >.

Elsewhere the terms " nanny " and " nanan " ( pronounced NAH - nan ) are also used for godmother .
MAW - MAW - Ya grandma .
MIRLITON - A vegetable pear or chayote squash , which grows wild in Louisiana and in backyards throughout New Orleans .
Pronounced < MEL - lee - tawn > , and wonderful when stuffed with shrimp and ham Bayou St. John , particularly if you walked " northwesterly " dressing ... have a look at the recipe .
MUFFULETTA - A quintessential New Orleans Italian sancwich , of ham , Genoa salami , mortadella , Provolone cheese and marinated olive salad on a round seeded Italian loaf .
Invented at Central Grocery on Decatur in da Quarter .
Locals pronounce this < muff - @ - LOT-@ > , and will tend to just abbreviate it as " muff " .
But if you ask a member of the Tusa family ( the proprietors of Central ) , they 'll pronounce it in elegantly proper Italian as < moo - foo - LET - ta > .
MYNEZ - Mayonnaise .
NEUTRAL GROUND -
The grassy or cement strip in the middle of the road .
The terms " median " and / or " island " are NEVER used in New Orleans .
Use of one of those foreign terms instead of " neutral ground " is a dead giveaway that you ain't from around here , or anywhere close .
If you 're lucky , you live on a street with a neutral ground big enough to play football on .
NEW ORLEENS -
The way silly tourists pronounce " New Orleans " .
Natives do not do this .
Exception -- song lyrics , as in " Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans " , for example , and when omitting the " New " , as in " Orleans Parish " , which is always pronounced < or - LEENS > .
Confusing , is n't it ?
More on this below .
NUTTINONIT - A po-boy that is not dressed , which only contains the main ingredient (s ) .
ON DA WES ' BANK , ACROSS DA RIVUH , OVA DA RIVUH - On the West Bank of the Mississippi River , where such places as Algiers , Gretna and Marrero lie .

When used by locals in the phrase " da parish " , it generally means St. Bernard Parish specifically , which is suburban to New Orleans .
PARRAINE - Pronounced < PAH-ran >.

PO - BOY -
The quintessential New Orleans lunch , a sandwich on good , crispy New Orleans French bread .
This definition does n't begin to describe what a po-boy is all about , so if you really do n't know you need to get one soon .
Take a moment to read a little bit about po-boys .
PODNA - A form of address for men , usually for ones with whom one is not acquainted .
Frequently used in the emphatic statement , " I tell you what , podna ... "

The classic version is made with sugar , brown sugar , butter , vanilla and pecans , and is a flat sugary pecan - filled disk .
Yummmmm .
There are also creamy pralines , chocolate pralines , maple pralines , etc .
Pecan pralines are the classic , though .
This is one of THE most mispronounced New Orleans terms of all .
It is *** N O T*** pronounced < PRAY - leen >.
It is pronounced < PRAH - leen > .
Got it ?
Good .
REGULAH COFFEE - Not " Black Coffee " as in the rest of the country .
" Regular " includes lots of sugar and cream .
To drink black coffee in New Orleans will cause people to look at you as though you are from another planet .
As a Café du Monde waiter was quoted in a Bunny Matthews " F' Sure ! " comic strip , admonishing a tourist who had ordered black coffee , " Lissen cap ... I gotta tell ya , nobody drinks dis kinda cawfee black .
So I ai n't responsible if ya have a hawt attack 'r sump ' in ... "
SCHWEGMANN'S BAG - A unit of measurement .

Always pronounced with the emphasis on the first syllable , < SIL - vah dime > , even though they have n't been made of actual silver for over 35 years .
SKEETA HAWK - Or , " mosquito hawk " , the local name for a dragonfly .
I 'm not sure if this is particular to New Orleans only , but since moving away I have never heard anyone else use the term .
SOSSIDGE - A meat preparation , made of various kinds of ground meats , seafood and spices , stuffed into a casing .
Usually spelled " sausage " by English speakers , but pronounced in New Orleans as you see here , always < SAH - sage > and not < SAW - sage >.

The front steps to your house , particularly if it's a shotgun duplex .
What ya go out and sit on to chat wit 'ya neighbas ( an ' ta keep an eye on 'em ) .

" Turn on da A.C. , Victa . "
" Nuh uh , it ai n't hot enough , it 's still May .
Let 's go out and sit on da stoop . "

TURLET - Ya standard flushable porcelain waste disposal unit found in every bat 'troom , referred to by English speakers as a " toilet " .

The traditional New Orleanian greeting , and the source for the term " Yat " , often used ( primarily by non-New Orleanians , it is said ) to describe New Orleanians with the telltale accent .
The proper response is , " Awrite . "
UMBRELLA - A standard English word , but with a special pronunciation .

It 's not pronounced as they would in the south , though -- no twang , no drawl , just " y'all " .
" You guys " is never said and is a dead giveaway that you 're a Tulane student from New Jersey .
YA - You , your .
YA MAMMA - Your mother .
Used in a variety of ways , usually endearing .
Also usable as an insult , specifically as a simple retort when one is insulted first ; simply say , " Ya mamma . "
Be prepared to defend yourself physically at this point .
I once saw my classmate Vince G. beat the crap out of someone ( and someone a year older , at that ) back in high school at Holy Cross for uttering this retort .

A collective term for your immediate family , as in " Hey dawlin ' , how 's yamamma 'n 'em ? "

Where ya wrench off ya dishes or ya hands .
See WRENCH .
A guide to the pronunciation of local place names
For instance , some people will note with delight that we have streets named after the Nine Muses of classical Greek mythology , but would probably have a seizure if they heard how we pronounced them ( " Calliope " still kills me ... ) .
And da French names often ain't what dey seem .
Here 's a list of the ways the natives pronouce some of our our unique place names -- streets , cities and local features .
Some of you may find them baffling , but do n't think to ask why .
We probably do n't know anyway .
Special note :
If you 're a student DJ at WTUL and you 're not a native of New Orleans ...
READ THIS AND LEARN IT !
Next time I hear one of y'all butcher our street names on our local airwaves , I 'll pull your ribs out .
Okay , so ... if you really want to fit in , learn to pronounce things like this :
ALGIERS POINT -
You 're likely to hear this pronounced as < Algiers Pernt >
AUDUBON PARK - Avoid the French pronunciation ( which is a good general rule for most New Orleanian place names ) of < au - dû - boN > with the nasal " N " .
The local will pronounce this < AW - d@- b@n PAWK >.
THE BIG EASY - Avoid uttering this phrase at all costs .
Under almost no circumstances would a native ever refer to the City in this way .
One major ( and baffling ) exception : the local music and entertainment awards are called The Big Easy Awards .
BONNABEL - A major street ( and high school ) in Metairie .
The proper pronunciation is apparently Bon-@ - BELL , not BON - @ - ble ... although most natives will pronounce it the latter way .
I 'm told it 's a mispronunciation , to wit :
Hi , I have a pronunciation for you to add to the lexicon .
I 'm sure that my great - grandfather , Alfred Bonnabel , will appreciate this .
Bonnabel is pronounced Bon-@- BELL , NOT Bon-@ - buhl .
It is always mutilated on a regular basis and it drives us nuts !
At one point , they had even mispelled one of the exit signs on I - 10 to read " Bonnable Blvd . "
An easy ay to rember is by thinking of my mother 's name .
It is Bonnie Belle .
Cute , no ?
Thanks ,
Teri Lippincott , daughter of Bonnie Belle Lacey Lippincott
BURGUNDY STREET - Pronounced < bur - GUN - dee >.
Do n't pronounce it like the wine .
BURTHE STREET - in Uptown New Orleans .
Pronounced < BYOOTH > ... sounds like " youth " with a B in front of it .
Why ?
Beats the hell outta me .
I 'm told the street is named after a person , but I do n't know the details .
I 'm also told it 's a French name , but it surely would n't be pronounced like that in proper French ( as if any New Orleans street name is ) .
The local postmen know this pronunciation ; apparently mail addressed to " Buth " or " Buthe " Street gets delivered just fine .
CADIZ STREET - Pronounced < KAY - diz >.
In New Orleans , Spanish place names are butchered even woise den da French ones ...
CALLIOPE STREET - Pronounced , believe it or not , < CAL - lee - ope > , and not < k@ - LIE - @ - pee > .
No doubt this particular Greek Muse is barfing up her lunch over on Olympus ...
However , the steam organ on the riverboat Natchez that plays music is , in fact , the < k@ - LIE - @ - pee > .
Go figure .
CANAL - Usage is always " da canal " .
The Industrial Canal , one of New Orleans ' main waterways , along with " da lake " and " da river " .
I suppose some Metry - ites may use this term to refer to the 17th Street Canal .
Also , Canal Street is the main thoroughfare of the Central Business District , and borders the French Quarter on the Uptown side .
CARONDELET STREET - Pronounced < k@ -'ron-d@-LET > , not < k@ -'ron-d@ - LAY >.
CHARTRES STREET - Pronounced < CHAW - t@s > or < CHAW - tuhs >.
CHEF MENTEUR HIGHWAY - Pronounced < SHEF m@n-TOUR >.
Most people just say " da Chef " .
And although it 's U.S. 90 , it 's not really much of a highway anymore ... " Da Chef " is actually pretty depressing these days .
When I - 10 was completed through New Orleans in the 60s , da Chef ceased to become a main thoroughfare for travelers , and gradually died .
( And if da Chef is dead now , one can only imagine how scary Old Gentilly Road must be by now ...)
Five miles outside of eastern New Orleans on da Chef is the site of the infamous Jayne Mansfield decapitation .
CLIO STREET - Pronounced < CLI -oh >.
Also sometimes , by some folks in da neighbahood , as " CEE- ELL-TEN " ... I kid you not .
CONTI STREET - Pronounced < CON - tye >.
DA QUARTER - The French Quarter , pronounced < da QUAW - tah > .
DAUPHINE STREET - Pronounced < daw - FEEN >.
Oddly enough , it 's not unlike the actual French .
DECATUR SCREET - Pronounced < d@-KAY - ter > , not <' deck-@- TURE >.
French people have problems with this one .
DERBIGNY STREET - Pronounced < DER - b@ - nee > or < DOY - b@ - nee < if you 're a really hardcore Nint ' Wawduh .
DORGENOIS STREET - Pronounced < DER - zhen - wah '> , secondary accent on third syllable .
DRYADES STREET - Pronounced < DRY-@ds >.
DUFOSSAT STREET - Pronounced < DOO - faucet >.
A contributor writes , " When I was a kid I always interpreted it as having to do with faucets . "
EUTERPE STREET - Pronounced < YOU - terp >.
FONTAINEBLEAU
- Pronounced as if spelled " fountain blue " .
IBERVILLE STREET - Pronounced < IB - ber - ' vil > , not < EYE - ber - 'vil > .
LOYOLA - The hardcore local pronunciation of this is < lye - OH-l@ > .
MARIGNY STREET , FAUBOURG MARIGNY - Pronounced < MA - r@ -nee > , with the " a " sounding like the " a " in " hat " .
MAZANT STREET - Pronounced < MAY - zant >.
Runs through the heart of Bywater in da Lowuh Nint ' Ward .
It 's my family 's old neighborhood ; my grandparents ran a little neighborhood grocery store called Niedermeier 's , which was on the corner of Mazant and Royal ... MAY - zant 'n RERL !
MELPOMENE STREET - Pronounced < MEL - p@-meen >.
METAIRIE - Standard New Orleanian pronunciation : < MET-@-ree >.
Hardcore local pronunciation : < MET - tree > , as if it was spelled ( and sometimes is spelled ) , " Metry " .
Announcers on those mail - order product commercials that are made for local products , but who are not aware of the correct pronunciation , often pronounce it < m@ - TAIR - ee > , much to to the amusement of the locals .
MILAN STREET - Pronounced < MY- lan >
NEW ORLEANS - This is a sticky subject .
As Tim Lyman mentioned above , there are oodles of ways that the locals pronounce the name of their beloved City .
Natives also seem to have an instinctive grasp of what a proper pronunciation is , and can spot it in native speakers outside the City .
First off , < new or - LEENS > is generally a no - no .
It 's like putting a big , red neon sign on your head that says , " I 'm not from around here . "
As also mentioned above , the two main exceptions are when it 's pronounced like that in song lyrics ( easier to rhyme , but contributes to the confusion of non-natives ) and when " Orleans " stands alone without the " New " , as in Orleans Parish .
So of course , there are some exceptions to this rule .
I have on occasion heard some African - American native New Orleanians use the above pronunciation .
I did n't say this was going to be consistent or that it was n't going to be confusing , did I ?
Here are the major standard local pronunciations of the City 's name : < new OR - l@ns > , < new AW - l@ns > , < new OR - lee - '@ns > < new AH - lee-@ns > , < nyoo AH - lee - '@ns > .
The fabled " N'Awlins " , pronounced < NAW - l@ns > , is used by some natives for amusement , and by some non-natives who think they 're being hip , but actually I 've come across very few locals who actually pronounce the name of the City in this way .
Ben Fortson , an Uptown boy , adds , " There are also versions without the final -s , as in Fats Domino 's " walkin ' to Noo Awlin " .
The s-lessness is presumably from the French .
Also , " Noo Awyuns " , with a - y- instead of an - l - , is pretty common in my experience , and kind of interesting from a linguistic point of view .
By the way , the shorter versions like Nawlins and Nawlns that you say are n't used much by locals have in fact been used at least by me all my life , for what that 's worth .
Maybe Uptown is diff 'rint . "
( Yeah , it is , bra ... it's where dey got all dem shoits wid da lil ' gators on 'em , and everyone has 59 rows o' teeth ! )
PLAQUEMINES PARISH - Pronounced < PLACK-@-m@ns >.
PONTCHARTRAIN - Pronounced < PONCH - a- train > locally .
Or you can just say , " Da Lake " .
POYDRAS STREET - Pronounced < PER - dr@s > by truly hardcore locals , < POY - dr@s > by everyone else .
PRYTANIA STREET - Pronounced < pr@-TAN-y@ >.
THE RIGOLETS - Pronounced < da RIG -@ - lees >.
ROYAL STREET - Pronounced < RERL > , to rhyme with " pearl " .
A strong localese pronunciation .
SOCRATES STREET - In Algiers , across da river .
Pronounced < SO crates > , like the word " so " and the word " crates " .
I kid you not .
TCHOUPITOULAS STREET - Pronounced <' chop-@-TOO-l@s >.
It 's easier to pronounce than to spell .
Spelling " Tchoupitoulas " is the true test of a native ; if New Orleans was a country at war , you 'd ask a guy to spell this to make sure he was on your side , just like in all the old WWII movies .
TERPSICHORE STREET - Pronounced < TERP - s@-core >.
THIBODEAUX - Pronounced < TIB - @ - doe >.
TONTI STREET - Pronounced < TON - tee > , with the " o " sound as in " box " .
TOULOUSE STREET - Pronounced < TOO - loose >.
TUJAGUE'S - A venerable French Quarter restaurant , highly recommended .
However , some tourists have expressed reticence to go to a restaurant whose name they can't pronounce .
All such folks will do well to pronounce it < TOO - jacks >.
TULANE - Pronounced < TOO - lane >.
Never , ever pronounce this < tu - LANE > , or you 'll immediately be mistaken for a college student from New Jersey .
Also , you 're liable to have someone get in your face about it , like my brother - in - law Jeff Willmon does when he hears this ...
" No .
If you 're gonna come to my city , and go to my school , you 're gonna pronounce it my way . "
UGLESICH'S -
The best restaurant in the city ?
Some might say so .
Certainly a must for any fan of New Orleans cooking .
Anthony and Gail Uglesich operate this tiny , atmosphere - free ( but rich in local color ) restaurant that 's only open weekdays until 4 ( you do n't wanna be on that part of Baronne Street after dark , no ) .
Pronounced < YOU - g@l - sitch -is > , although I 've heard some natives just call it " Ugly's " .
VETERANS HIGHWAY - Hardcore locals pronounce this with only two syllables ... < VET - tr@ns >.
VIEUX CARRÉ - Pronounced < VOO ka-RAY >.
Literally means " old square " , and it means Da French Quarter , the site of Bienville 's original New Orleans settlement .
New Orleanians !

A Well of Hypocrisy
One man uses gas and oil money to help the poor .
The other uses it to buy guns .
Guess who gets vilified .
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian 16th May 2006
Civilisation has a new enemy .
He is a former coca grower called Evo Morales , who is currently the president of Bolivia .
Yesterday he stood before the European parliament to explain why he had sent troops to regain control of his country ’s gas and oil fields .
Bolivia ’s resources , he says , have been “ looted by foreign companies ” ( 1 ) , and he is reclaiming them for the benefit of his people .
Last week he told the summit of Latin American and European leaders in Vienna that the corporations which have been extracting the country ’s fossil fuels would not be compensated for these seizures .
You can probably guess how this has gone down .
Tony Blair urged him to use his power responsibly ( 2 ) , which is like Mark Oaten lecturing the Pope on sexual continence .
Condoleezza Rice accused him of “ demagoguery ” ( 3 ) .
The Economist announced that Bolivia was “ moving backwards ” ( 4 ) .
The Times , in a marvellously haughty leader , called Morales “ petulant ” , “ xenophobic ” and “ capricious ” and labelled his seizure of the gas fields “ a gesture as childish as it eye - catching ” ( 5 ) .
Never mind that the privatisation of Bolivia ’s gas and oil in the 1990s was almost certainly illegal , as it took place without the consent of Congress ( 6 ) .
Never mind that – until now – its natural wealth has only impoverished its people ( 7 ) .
Never mind that Morales had promised to regain national control of Bolivia ’s natural resources before he became president , and that the policy has massive support among Bolivians .
It ca n’t be long before Donald Rumsfeld calls him the new Hitler and Bush makes another speech about freedom and democracy being threatened by freedom and democracy .
This huffing and puffing is dressed up as concern for the people of Bolivia .
The Financial Times fretted about the potential for “ mismanagement and corruption ” ( 8 ) .
The Economist warned that while the government “ may get richer , its people are likely to grow even poorer .
” ( 9 ) The Times lamented that Morales had “ set back Bolivia ’s development by ten years or so .
… the most vulnerable groups will find that an economic lifeline is soon removed from their reach . ” ( 10 ) All this is humbug .
Four days before Evo Morales seized the gas fields – on May 1st – an even bigger expropriation took place in an even poorer country : the African republic of Chad .
When the Chadian government reasserted control over its oil revenues , not only did it ensure that an intended lifeline for the poor really was removed from their reach , but it also brought the World Bank ’s claims to be using oil as a social welfare programme crashing down in flames .
So how did all those bold critics of Evo Morales respond ?
They did n’t .
The whole hypocritical horde of them looked the other way .
The World Bank decided to fund Chad ’s massive oil scheme in 2000 , after extracting a promise from the government of Idriss Deby – which has a terrible human rights record – that the profits would be used for the benefit of the country ’s people .
Deby ’s administration passed a law allocating 85 % of the government ’s oil revenues to education , health and development and placing 10 % of them “ in trust for future generations ” ( 11 ) .
This , the Bank said , amounted to “ an unprecedented system of safeguards to ensure that these revenues would be used to finance development in Chad . ” ( 12 )
Without the World Bank , the project could not have gone ahead .
It was asked to participate by Exxon , the leading partner in the project , to provide insurance against political risk ( 13 ) .
The Bank ’s different lending arms stumped up a total of $ 333 million ( 14 ) , and the European Investment Bank threw in another $ 120 m ( 15 ) .
The oil companies ( Exxon , Petronas and Chevron ) started drilling 300 wells in the south of the country , and building a pipeline to a port in Cameroon , which opened in 2003 .
Environmentalists predicted that the pipeline would damage the rainforests of Cameroon and displace the indigenous people who lived there ; that the oil companies would consume much of Chad ’s scarce water and that an influx of oil workers would be accompanied by an influx of AIDS ( 16 ) .
They also argued that subsidising oil companies in the name of social welfare was a radical reinterpretation of the Bank ’s mandate .
As long ago as 1997 , the Environmental Defense Fund warned that the government of Chad would not keep its promises to use the money for alleviating poverty ( 17 ) .
In 1999 , researchers from Harvard law school examined the law the government had passed , and predicted that the authorities “ have little intention of allowing it to affect local practice . ” ( 18 )
In 2000 , the oil companies gave the government of Chad a “ signing bonus ” of $ 4.5 m , which it immediately spent on arms ( 19 ) .
Then , at the beginning of 2006 , it simply tore up the law it had passed in 1998 .
It redefined the development budget to include security , seized the fund set aside for future generations , and diverted 30 % of the total revenues into “ general spending ” , which , in Chad , is another term for guns ( 20 ) .
The World Bank , embarrassed by the fulfillment of all the predictions its critics had made , froze the revenues the government had deposited in London and suspended the remainder of its loans .
The Chadian government responded by warning that it would simply shut down the oil wells .
The corporations ran to daddy ( the US government ) ( 21 ) and , on April 27th , the Bank caved in .
Its new agreement with Chad entitles Deby to pretty well everything he has already taken ( 22 ) .
The World Bank ’s attempts to save face are almost funny .
Last year it said that the scheme was “ a pioneering and collaborative effort … to demonstrate that large - scale crude oil projects can significantly improve prospects for sustainable long - term development ” ( 23 ) .
In other words , it was a model for oil - producing countries to follow .
Now it tells us that the project in Chad was “ less a model for all oil - producing countries than a unique solution to a unique challenge ” ( 24 ) .
But however much it wriggles , it cannot disguise the fact that the government ’s reassertion of control is a disaster both for the Bank and for the impoverished people it claimed to be helping .
Since the project began , Chad has fallen from 167th to 173rd on the UN ’s Human Development Index , and life expectancy there has dropped from 44.7 to 43.6 years ( 25 ) .
If , by contrast , Morales does as he has promised and uses the extra revenues from Bolivia ’s gas fields in the same way as Hugo Chavez has used the money from Venezuela ’s oil , the result is likely to be a major improvement in his people ’s welfare .
So on the one hand you have a man who has kept his promises by regaining control over the money from the hydrocarbon industry , in order to use it to help the poor .
On the other you have a man who has broken his promises by regaining control over the money from the hydrocarbon industry , in order to buy guns .
The first man is vilified as irresponsible , childish and capricious .
The second man is left to get on with it .
Why ?
Well Deby ’s actions do n’t hurt the oil companies .
Morales ’s do .
When Blair and Rice and the Times and all the other apologists for undemocratic power say “ the people ” , they mean the corporations .
The reason they hate Morales is that when he says “ the people ” he means the people .

Alternative business models for Europe
Julie Pitt , General Manager , RealArcade
Riccardo Zacconi , CEO MidasPlayer
Eric Bethke , CEO GoPets
Kai Bolik , CEO GameDuell
Mathieu Nouzareth , President Boonty
JP : Try - before - you - buy games really picked up after the crash .
Real Networks had to convince GameHouse to build a downloadable game .
In Asia this model does n't work so well ( perhaps thanks to lack of protection for IP ) .
2 % of games downloaders make a purchase ; so most folks are n't spending money for content .
MN : Advertisers are willing to spend lots of money online .
They need good products to help them do this .
CPM for banners are too low .
Rich Media advertising might be an answer .
In - game advertising might be an answer .
[ Yuck - are we as an industry really fixated on banner advertising - still ?
How do production costs for a rich media advert stack up - presumably they 're much higher ?
In - game ads sound more interesting , and you can see a precedent for it with product placement in films - it 's familiar , perhaps . ]
MN : A 20 mb game with a 2 % conversion rate means you 're shifting 2GB of data for each 2 sales - that cuts into margins .
JP : Most advertising has been around online games .
What about in - game advertising ?
MN : Perhaps this is more acceptable in the US which is more accepting of advertising .
KB : When we founded in 2003 , games were popular .
We wanted to monetise free players and do so by letting them pay small amounts at a time : they place a bet etc .
So they 're not paying for game content at all .
RZ : We have a 2 - step process : at the first step he plays for free , up to 10 times .
After that he 's asked to upgrade to a paid account : £ 10 , $ 10 , 10 zloty .
Once he is paid up , to compete against others he has to take small amounts from his deposit .
[ So it 's either advertising - supported or gambling games , thus far . ]
RZ : Our experience is that many factors are at play here : the maturity of the market ( how old your players are ) , say .
We offer more than 37 payment systems : different ones for different markets .
e.g. in the US credit cards work well , in the UK they 're alright , in Germany they do n't work that well .
EB : We think that advertising is extremely important .
We 're cautious about it .
Gopets have a tool to let you design clothing for your pets so product placement seems quite natural .
This is more exciting for advertisers than banner ads say .
Companies like Massive are acting as a bridge between developers and advertisers .
There is no equivalent of Massive in the UK yet .
[ So ... specialist media buyers for the games industry then .
Seems sensible . ]
JP : Massive focus more on the hardcore traditional gaming .
They 've not really looked at casual gaming much .
[ But this seems to be a theme here : lots of folks from the traditional gaming industry see casual as a new market for them , rather than a new sort of activity .
And given that the models , the content , and the audience are all rather different ... does this hold ? ]
EB : Massive came to us to sign a deal .
But they do n't have any salespeople selling to women .
I could put together Gap Jeans for the pets , but it 's difficult without such a salesforce .
JP : It 's not necessarily about the play , it 's about the things you can add to the play and monetise .
EB : In Korea they had only games with subscription models for some time .
Everything else collapsed - retail etc .
Then came price competition , and free MMOs .
The intention was to build volume then start charging - but users kept switching between games to avoid paying up .
Then the " death model " was tried out : paying for new lives , selling accessories , etc .
This was quite popular because it kept the perception of " freeness " in the games , but still provided for revenue .
Players ended up spending more than they played for the subscription model .
MN : Mixing casual and MMOs is a new idea .
Until recently MMOs are for serious gamers and casual games for everyone else .
EB : Western perception is " oh yeah , Korea are just nuts " .
RZ : We 've launched a sophisticated community .
80 % of our users set up an avatar , 25 % have bought additional items for their avatar .
From surveys , we know that users like this - it's about showing off , it 's not just about money .
EB : There was a phase in Korea when everyone had avatars you dress up .
That lasted about 9 months before players noticed it had no effect on gameplay .
Temporary gameplay - affecting items are the ones which make the most money .
Gopets make $ 30 pcm from their paying users .
RZ : Lipstick , winning modes and losing modes are the biggest sellers .
EB : We have our own virtual currency , which has different exchange rates in different territories depending on friction costs accrued by working with different payment mechanisms .
Our top selling item is a virtual rock for our virtual zen garden .
EB : Games have to be designed from the ground up for a given business model .
Taking a subscription game and moving it over does n't work that well .
In the West we do n't like these models because they seem unfair : but it 's just like real life !
[ Maybe this is because we look to games for escapism ? ]
Q : You 're selling perishable goods .
The rock can be used only once and resold .
Are you looking to enable a marketplace and let players create and sell their own items ?
EB : The initial approach is to make items non-transferable and perishable .
This works for a little bit if you 're the first mover .
CyWorld (? ) in Korea had a model where you rented skins for your site , which worked at first but then started losing players .
Permanent items should be permanent .
If they paid for something from you , they 've bought it , and should be able to sell it .
Do n't be arrogant and insist they buy only from you .
Q : Who are your customers ?
EB : Women in their teens and 25 - 45 .
Most revenue comes from the latter but the user - base is split .
JP : Other than avatars , how can we monetise community ?
MN : Subscriptions ?
With a low price - point , yep .
RZ : We 're monetising what is basically an online community .
We do n't want users to go away ; with our model , we make money from plays so we need to keep them in .
EB : You can make subscriptions work with the item model .
We have a limited - edition item which is only available to premium subscribers .
This item normally has more game value and tends to resell for $ 25 - 35 each time too - so the player sees values .
But the item - selling model came first , not subscriptions .
KB : Subscriptions fit well with any long - term proposition ; anything which players think they 'll need for a long time .
Subscriptions need to have unique or exclusive elements to be successful .
JP : Do you price games lower in Italy and Spain ( where the market demands lower pricing )
MN : On a case - by - case basis , yes . 25 -30 % lower .
EB : We price v differently between different territories ( China , Philippines , etc. ) .
How do players react to this ?
MN : They do n't tend to know .
Players do n't tend to go into price comparison services .
[ All this despite the single currency across Europe !
I wonder how long this blindness to price variations will continue . ]
JP : How likely is it that the model will change completely ?
e.g. ISPs pay for content and bundle with access , as in the RealNetworks / Comcast music product bundle .
MN : This is taking over very quickly in Europe now .
If you buy large quantities of games in advance you can do so very cheaply - e.g. 10 % of retail .
ISPs are fighting hard to acquire and retain customers .
We 've worked with ISPs giving away free music , games and videos .
Games are more effective than music or videos when given away for free .
EB : Some carriers will pay for exclusivity on mobile games .
JP : Where is this going to go in the future ?
MN : We 've not mentioned loyalty schemes ( frequent flyer miles etc. ) .
JP : People could pay for game content via these existing schemes ?
MN : We 're doing this in Korea .
Companies have such an inventory of this virtual currency that they need ways to get it spent !
KB : Skill gaming is a perfect example of this : a points - burner .
[ Is skill - gaming a euphemism for gambling these days ? ]
EB : The item business model is the most efficient I know of : players get to spend what they want to spend .
This will happen to every market .
The idea that you pay a fixed price for your content will die : we do n't do this almost anywhere else in our lives .
[ ?
Aside from mobile tariffs , TV subscriptions , magazine subscriptions , etc. ]
Q : What about in - game advertising vs advergames ?
MN : I 've yet to see a good advergame .
EB : Advertisers want to advertise a product , not develop good games .
If I had a product that women over 30 bought a lot of , I 'd talk to PopCap .
Q : From the gamers POV , buying an item means more involvement .
Is n't this the opposite of casual ?
EB : In Korea they have a term " advanced casual games " .
They have play times of 5 - 20 minutes .
e.g. " freestyle basketball " .

Manufacturing has helped to drive India 's economy
If trends continue , India 's economy may then surpass the US and be second only to China 's by mid-century , the report by investment bank Goldman Sachs says .
The report says India 's programme of reforms has brought increased competition and efficiency .
But there will be a heavy cost as India demands more and more energy .
Boom time
Everywhere you turn in India 's cities are signs of economic boom .
The implications of projections are that India will overtake the G6 economies faster than envisaged
Goldman Sachs report
India 's IT revolution Globalisation shakes world
New cars choking the streets , middle - class housing and shopping malls swallowing up farmland , airports chock - a- block with travellers .
But this is probably only the start of a transformation that will reshape the global economy .
Within a decade India can overtake Italy , France and the UK to become the world 's fifth largest economy if it keeps up its current pace of expansion , according to analysts at Goldman Sachs .
India has shifted into a higher gear , they believe , because a decade of reforms have opened the country to greater competition , and spurred industries to become more efficient .
By 2050 India 's economy could be larger even than America's , only China 's will be bigger , the bank predicts .
The result will be huge demand from this new giant .
Within 15 years Indians should , on average , be four times richer than today , buying five times as many cars , and the country will burn three times as much crude oil to power its growth , putting yet more strain on the world 's resources .
Potential
But India could also be held back .
The country 's poor infrastructure is already struggling to keep up with growth , power cuts are common as there is n't enough electricity to meet current demand , ports are overflowing , many roads pot-holed and crumbling .
And a shortage of skilled workers may undermine the future expansion of India 's much - vaunted IT industry .
However , other nations are increasingly waking up to the potentially vast market India holds .
Last month the largest - ever American trade delegation to India spent two weeks searching out opportunities .
They were followed by a British group 150 - strong led by the finance minister , Gordon Brown .
And the Russian President , Vladimir Putin , is to visit this week where he is pressing for major contracts providing nuclear power and defence equipment .
OS Insecurities and Myths

The core of Mac OS X is BSD Unix , and that OS has been around for two decades in open source form , inspected by all concerned .
That 's why Mac OS X is more secure than Windows , according to InfoWorld .
For a long time , apologists for Windows have been arguing " security through obscurity . "
However , if it has a CPU , hackers will try to attack it , and Mac OS X has been a big target for a long time .
" The difference is n't market share , it 's the foundation of the operating systems .
Given that most virus authors and hackers are in it for the ego , do n't you think that there would be a huge incentive to be the first one to write a widespread OS X , Linux , or FreeBSD virus ? "
Paul Venezia asked .
The key is the foundation of the OS .
If the OS is designed on a shaky foundation , everything on top will suffer .
When Apple moved its customer based from Classic Mac OS 9 to Mac OS X , they did so consciously with the idea that they needed a firm foundation for the future .
But that meant leaving every Classic app behind in the long term .
Microsoft has never been able to make that commitment and retained the backwards compatibility with Win32 apps .
That has put a strain on their whole Windows OS .
" Simply put , Microsoft had the chance to beat Apple to the punch and make a giant leap back in 1997 or so , killing off the existing Win32 platform in favor of an NT - based client and server that did not have to run legacy applications natively .
They did n't , and we are still paying the price for it today .
Even if you 're not running an MS OS , most of the spam in your mailbox came from zombie Windows systems in the control of spammers , " the author noted .
While Microsoft was reaping the rewards of this compatibility , Apple took the time to move its entire customer base to a highly secure BSD Unix OS .
" Microsoft did n't .
They 're faced with massive - scale exploits like the spreading ANI vulnerability , Mr. Venezia concluded .
" That affects every Microsoft OS , server and workstation alike , across the board .
This gives us a glimpse into the code shared between generations of Microsoft OSes , and it 's not a pretty view . "
A quote from Henry Spencer was noted , " Those who do n't understand UNIX are condemned to reinvent it , poorly . "
Pelosi's rules
So this week I heard about this ( Kerry ) and I heard about that ( Haggard ) but somehow I did n't hear a single word about Nancy Pelosi 's proposed new rules for the House , should she become Speaker .
I learned about it from Chester Scoville 's Vanity Press who got it from the weblog of CBC ( Canadian Broadcasting Company )
News :
Here are some of the new rules Pelosi wants :
No House member may accept any gift of any value from lobbyists , or any firm or association that hires lobbyists .
No free travel , which means an end to the corporate jet line every Friday at Reagan National Airport .
No free tickets to Redskins games ; or no meals of any value , even at a McDonalds ; no front - row seats at entertainment venues .
No , no and no .
To reduce temptations to cheat , Pelosi 's bill attacks the usefulness of members to richly endowed lobbyists .
House members will no longer be able to slip in special - interest projects on unrelated legislation .
Such measures will no longer be allowed on a bill once negotiations between the Senate and House are complete .
Further , all bills will be made available to the public a full 24 hours before a final vote ; presumably this gives watchdog groups a chance to flag any skullduggery .
Under the Pelosi rules , lobbyists will no longer be able to use the House gym ( you'd be surprised how much gets negotiated in a sauna ) .
Lobbyists will no longer be allowed onto the House floor or to use the cloakrooms just off the floor , preventing last - minute arm - twisting .
What 's more , no member or staffer will be able to negotiate for employment in the public sector without disclosing such contacts to the House Ethics Committee , and within three days of such contact being made .
Finally , all of this will be audited and investigated by a new Office of Public Integrity , and that office reports , directly and only , to the U.S. Attorneys Office .
That all sound quite right and proper -- a good start .
Let 's see if Speaker Pelosi can get it passed and get enforcement of it with some teeth .

AN EXPLORATION OF
OBJECT ORIENTED DATABASE MANAGEMENT
SYSTEMS
By
Dare Obasanjo
Introduction : Why Object Oriented Database Management Systems ?
In today 's world , Client - Server applications that rely on a database on the server as a data store while servicing requests from multiple clients are quite commonplace .
Most of these applications use a Relational Database Management System ( RDBMS ) as their data store while using an object oriented programming language for development .
This causes a certain inefficency as objects must be mapped to tuples in the database and vice versa instead of the data being stored in a way that is consistent with the programming model .
The " impedance mismatch " caused by having to map objects to tables and vice versa has long been accepted as a necessary performance penalty .
This paper is aimed at seeking out an alternative that avoids this penalty .
The purpose of this paper is to provide answers to the following questions
What is an Object Oriented Database Management System ( OODBMS ) ?
Is an OODBMS a viable alternative to an RDBMS ?
What are the tradeoffs and benefits of using an OODBMS over an RDBMS ?
What does code that interacts with an OODBMS look like ?
Overview of Object Oriented Database Management Systems
An OODBMS is the result of combining object oriented programming principles with database management principles .
Object oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation , polymorphism and inheritance are enforced as well as database management concepts such as the ACID properties ( Atomicity , Consistency , Isolation and Durability ) which lead to system integrity , support for an ad hoc query language and secondary storage management systems which allow for managing very large amounts of data .
The Object Oriented Database Manifesto [ Atk 89 ] specifically lists the following features as mandatory for a system to support before it can be called an OODBMS ; Complex objects , Object identity , Encapsulation , Types and Classes , Class or Type Hierarchies , Overriding , overloading and late binding , Computational completeness , Extensibility , Persistence , Secondary storage management , Concurrency , Recovery and an Ad Hoc Query Facility .
From the aforementioned description , an OODBMS should be able to store objects that are nearly indistinguishable from the kind of objects supported by the target programming language with as little limitation as possible .
Persistent objects should belong to a class and can have one or more atomic types or other objects as attributes .
The normal rules of inheritance should apply with all their benefits including polymorphism , overridding inherited methods and dynamic binding .
Each object has an object identifier ( OID ) which used as a way of uniquely identifying a particuler object .
OIDs are permanent , system generated and not based on any of the member data within the object .
OIDs make storing references to other objects in the database simpler but may cause referential intergrity problems if an object is deleted while other objects still have references to its OID .
An OODBMS is thus a full scale object oriented development environment as well as a database management system .
Features that are common in the RDBMS world such as transactions , the ability to handle large amounts of data , indexes , deadlock detection , backup and restoration features and data recovery mechanisms also exist in the OODBMS world .
A primary feature of an OODBMS is that accessing objects in the database is done in a transparent manner such that interaction with persistent objects is no different from interacting with in - memory objects .
This is very different from using an RDBMSs in that there is no need to interact via a query sub- language like SQL nor is there a reason to use a Call Level Interface such as ODBC , ADO or JDBC .
Database operations typically involve obtaining a database root from the the OODBMS which is usually a data structure like a graph , vector , hash table , or set and traversing it to obtain objects to create , update or delete from the database .
When a client requests an object from the database , the object is transferred from the database into the application 's cache where it can be used either as a transient value that is disconnected from its representation in the database ( updates to the cached object do not affect the object in the database ) or it can be used as a mirror of the version in the database in that updates to the object are reflected in the database and changes to object in the database require that the object is refetched from the OODBMS .
Comparisons of OODBMSs to RDBMSs
There are concepts in the relational database model that are similar to those in the object database model .
A relation or table in a relational database can be considered to be analogous to a class in an object database .
A tuple is similar to an instance of a class but is different in that it has attributes but no behaviors .
A column in a tuple is similar to a class attribute except that a column can hold only primitive data types while a class attribute can hold data of any type .
Finally classes have methods which are computationally complete ( meaning that general purpose control and computational structures are provided [ McF 99 ] ) while relational databases typically do not have computationally complete programming capabilities although some stored procedure languages come close .
Below is a list of advantages and disadvantages of using an OODBMS over an RDBMS with an object oriented programming language .
Advantages
Composite Objects and Relationships : Objects in an OODBMS can store an arbitrary number of atomic types as well as other objects .
It is thus possible to have a large class which holds many medium sized classes which themselves hold many smaller classes , ad infinitum .
In a relational database this has to be done either by having one huge table with lots of null fields or via a number of smaller , normalized tables which are linked via foreign keys .
Having lots of smaller tables is still a problem since a join has to be performed every time one wants to query data based on the " Has - a " relationship between the entities .
Also an object is a better model of the real world entity than the relational tuples with regards to complex objects .
The fact that an OODBMS is better suited to handling complex , interrelated data than an RDBMS means that an OODBMS can outperform an RDBMS by ten to a thousand times depending on the complexity of the data being handled .
Class Hierarchy : Data in the real world is usually has hierarchical characteristics .
The ever popular Employee example used in most RDBMS texts is easier to describe in an OODBMS than in an RDBMS .
An Employee can be a Manager or not , this is usually done in an RDBMS by having a type identifier field or creating another table which uses foreign keys to indicate the relationship between Managers and Employees .
In an OODBMS , the Employee class is simply a parent class of the Manager class .
Circumventing the Need for a Query Language : A query language is not necessary for accessing data from an OODBMS unlike an RDBMS since interaction with the database is done by transparently accessing objects .
It is still possible to use queries in an OODBMS however .
No Impedence Mismatch :
In a typical application that uses an object oriented programming language and an RDBMS , a signifcant amount of time is usually spent mapping tables to objects and back .
There are also various problems that can occur when the atomic types in the database do not map cleanly to the atomic types in the programming language and vice versa .
This " impedance mismatch " is completely avoided when using an OODBMS .
No Primary Keys :
The user of an RDBMS has to worry about uniquely identifying tuples by their values and making sure that no two tuples have the same primary key values to avoid error conditions .
In an OODBMS , the unique identification of objects is done behind the scenes via OIDs and is completely invisible to the user .
Thus there is no limitation on the values that can be stored in an object .
One Data Model : A data model typically should model entities and their relationships , constraints and operations that change the states of the data in the system .
With an RDBMS it is not possible to model the dynamic operations or rules that change the state of the data in the system because this is beyond the scope of the database .
Thus applications that use RDBMS systems usually have an Entity Relationship diagram to model the static parts of the system and a seperate model for the operations and behaviors of entities in the application .
With an OODBMS there is no disconnect between the database model and the application model because the entities are just other objects in the system .
An entire application can thus be comprehensively modelled in one UML diagram .
Disadvantages
Schema Changes :
In an RDBMS modifying the database schema either by creating , updating or deleting tables is typically independent of the actual application .
In an OODBMS based application modifying the schema by creating , updating or modifying a persistent class typically means that changes have to be made to the other classes in the application that interact with instances of that class .
This typically means that all schema changes in an OODBMS will involve a system wide recompile .
Also updating all the instance objects within the database can take an extended period of time depending on the size of the database .
Language Dependence : An OODBMS is typically tied to a specific language via a specific API .
This means that data in an OODBMS is typically only accessible from a specific language using a specific API , which is typically not the case with an RDBMS .
Lack of Ad- Hoc Queries :
In an RDBMS , the relational nature of the data allows one to construct ad - hoc queries where new tables are created from joining existing tables then querying them .
Since it is currently not possible to duplicate the semantics of joining two tables by " joining " two classes then there is a loss of flexibility with an OODBMS .
Thus the queries that can be performed on the data in an OODBMS is highly dependent on the design of the system .
Who is currently using an OODBMS to handle mission critical data ?
The Chicago Stock Exchange manages stock trades via a Versant ODBMS .
Radio Computing Services is the world 's largest radio software company .
Its product , Selector , automates the needs of the entire radio station -- from the music library , to the newsroom , to the sales department .
RCS uses the POET ODBMS because it enabled RCS to integrate and organize various elements , regardless of data types , in a single program environment .
The Objectivity / DB ODBMS is used as a data repository for system component naming , satellite mission planning data , and orbital management data deployed by Motorola in The Iridium System .
The ObjectStore ODBMS is used in SouthWest Airline 's Home Gate to provide self service to travelers through the Internet .
Ajou University Medical Center in South Korea uses InterSystems ' Cach¡§¡§ ODBMS to support all hospital functions including mission - critical departments such as pathology , laboratory , blood bank , pharmacy , and X -ray .
The Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland uses an Objectivity DB .
The database is currently being tested in the hundreds of terabytes at data rates up to 35 MB / second .
As of November , 2000 , the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center ( SLAC ) stored 169 terabytes of production data using Objectivity / DB .
The production data is distributed across several hundred processing nodes and over 30 on - line servers .
Interacting With An OODBMS
Below are Java code samples for accessing a relational database and accessing an object database .
Compare the size of the code in both examples .
The examples are for an instant messaging application .
Java code accessing an ObjectStore™ database import COM.odi.* ; import COM.odi.util.query .*; import COM.odi.util.* ; import java.util .* ; try { // start database session Session session = Session.create ( null , null ) ; session .join ( ) ; // open database and start transaction Database db = Database.open ( " IMdatabase " , ObjectStore .
UPDATE ) ; Transaction tr = Transaction.begin( ObjectStore.READONLY ) ; //get hashtable of user objects from DB OSHashMap users = ( OSHashMap ) db.getRoot ( " IMusers " ) ; // get password and username from user String username = getUserNameFromUser ( ) ; String passwd = getPasswordFromUser ( ) ; // get user object from database and see if it exists and whether password is correct UserObject user = ( UserObject ) users.get ( username ) ; if ( user == null ) System.out.println ( " Non-existent user " ) ; else if(user.getPassword().equals ( passwd ) ) System.out.println ( " Successful login " ) ; else System.out.println ( " Invalid Password " ) ; // end transaction , close database and retain terminate session tr.commit ( ) ; db.close ( ) ; session.termnate ( ) ; } //exception handling would go here ...
Java JDBC code accessing an IBM's DB2 Database™ import java.sql . * ; import sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver ; import java.util . * ; try { // Launch instance of database driver .
Class.forName( " COM.ibm.db2.jdbc.app.DB2Driver " ).newInstance ( ) ; // create database connection Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection ( " jdbc:db2:IMdatabase " ) ; // get password and username from user String username = getUserNameFromUser ( ) ; String passwd = getPasswordFromUser ( ) ; //perform SQL query Statement sqlQry = conn.createStatement ( ) ; ResultSet rset = sqlQry.executeQuery ( " SELECT password from user_table WHERE username= ' " + username + " ' " ) ; if ( rset.next ( ) ) { if ( rset.getString(1).equals ( passwd ) ) System.out.println ( " Successful login " ) ; else System.out.println ( " Invalid Password " ) ; }else { System.out.println ( " Non-existent user " ) ; } //close database connection sqlQry.close ( ) ; conn.close ( ) ; } //exception handling would go here ...
There is n't much difference in the above examples although it does seem a lot clearer to perform operations on a UserObject instead of a ResultSet when validating the user .
Getting the user 's contact list .
Java code accessing an ObjectStore™ database import COM.odi.* ; import COM.odi.util.query .*; import COM.odi.util.* ; import java.util .* ; try { /* start session and open DB , same as in section 1a */ // get hashmap of users from the DB OSHashMap users = ( OSHashMap ) db.getRoot ( " IMusers " ) ; // get user object from database UserObject c4l = ( UserObject ) users.get ( " Carnage4Life " ) ; UserObject [ ] contactList = c4l.getContactList ( ) ; System.out.println
( " This are the people on Carnage4 Life 's contact list " ) ; for ( int i=0 ; i < contactList.length ; i++) System.out.println(contactList[i].toString ( ) ) ; //toString ( ) prints fullname , username , online status and webpage URL /* close session and close DB , same as in section 1a */ }//exception handling code Java JDBC code accessing an IBM's DB2 Database™ import java.sql . * ; import sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver ; import java.util . * ; try { /* open DB connection , same as in section 1 b */ // perform SQL query Statement sqlQry = conn.createStatement ( ) ; ResultSet rset = sqlQry.executeQuery ( " SELECT
fname , lname , user_name , online_status , webpage FROM contact_list , user_table " + " WHERE contact_list.owner_name='Carnage4Life ' and contact_list.buddy_name=user_table.user_name " ) ; System.out.println
( " This are the people on Carnage4 Life 's contact list " ) ; while ( rset.next ( ) ) System.out.println ( " Full Name : " + rset.getString
(1 ) + " " + rset.getString
( 2 ) + " User Name : " + rset.getString(3 ) + " OnlineStatus : " + rset.getString(4 ) + " HomePage URL : " + rset.getString ( 5 ) ) ; /* close DB connection , same as in section 1 b */ }//exception handling code
The benefits of using an OODBMS over an RDBMS in Java slowly become obvious .
Consider also that if the data from the select needs to be returned to another method then all the data from the result set has to be mapped to another object ( UserObject ) .
Get all the users that are online .
Java code accessing an ObjectStore™ database import COM.odi.* ; import COM.odi.util.query .*; import COM.odi.util.* ; import java.util .* ; try{ /* same as above */ //use a OODBMS query to locate all the users whose status is ' online ' Query q = new Query = ( UserObject.class , " onlineStatus.equals ( \" online \ " " ) ; Collection users = db.getRoot ( " IMusers " ) ; Set onlineUsers = q.select( users ) ; Iterator iter = onlineUsers.iterator ( ) ; // iterate over the results while ( iter.hasNext ( ) ) { UserObject user = ( UserObject ) iter.next ( ) ; // send each person some announcement sendAnnouncement ( user ) ; } /* same as above */ }//exception handling goes here Java JDBC code accessing an IBM's DB2 Database™ import java.sql . * ; import sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver ; import java.util . * ; try{ /* same as above */ // perform SQL query Statement sqlQry = conn.createStatement ( ) ; ResultSet rset = sqlQry.executeQuery ( " SELECT
fname , lname , user_name , online_status , webpage FROM user_table WHERE online_status='online ' " ) ; while ( rset.next ( ) ) {
UserObject user = new UserObject( rset.getString(1) , rset.getString(2) ,rset.getString(3) ,rset.getString(4) , rset.getString ( 5 ) ) ; sendAnnouncement ( user ) ; } /* same as above */ }//exception handling goes here

Description of the MultiEdit Application
MultiEdit allows multiple users , potentially on different machines to edit a file simultaneously .
Each user has his or her own view of the file , and each view includes its own cursor .
Users may enter text into ( the same or different points of ) the file simultaneously .
It is an essential requirement of the application that the contents of the file must always be kept consistent with the actions of users .
This project uses a Client / Server architecture to handle the difficulty of maintaining consistency between multiple clients trying to edit the same document at once .
Each document is an object of class ShareableDocument stored in an Object Oriented Database which is remotely accessible via a DocumentManager which sits on the server and handles client requests .
Whenever a user needs to access a document it is loaded from the database by the DocumentManager and sent to them over the network .
From then on whenever an edit is performed by the user the actual key stroke and the position of the cursor is sent to the server which updates an in memory copy of the object before broadcasting the event to all users who are currently accessing the document including the user that originally performed the edit .
The main drawback of the above method is that the user who is typing the document will most likely experience a lag between when a character is typed and when it shows up on the GUI which is dependent on the speed of the network .
Also if there is a network outage or similar error then the user cannot edit the document .
Saves are simply requests to the server to persist its in memory copy of the document which is more efficient than sending the whole document to the server .
ShareableDocuments are not saved unless explicitly specified by a user or when a user closes a document .
The application also allows the user to lock entire ShareableDocuments which prevents others from modifying the documents but they can still see the edits being made by the owner of the lock in real - time
User
This is a representation of a user of the system which is stored in the ObjectStore™ database .
PersistableRemoteObject
This is an interface that describes operations that can be performed on a remote object that is shared by multiple users .
Owner
An interface that describes any entity that owns ( i.e. created ) a PersistableRemoteObject .
ShareableDocument
This is a representation of a document that can be editted by multiple users at once or locked by a single user .
It also is stored in the ObjectStore™ database and implements the PersistableRemoteObject interface .
RemoteObjectFactory
This is an interface that describes the minimum amount of services that a server that manages PersistableRemoteObjects must provide .
DocumentManager
This is an interface describing the methods that are remotely accessible on an object that manages ShareableDocuments .
It is a subclass of the RemoteObject Factory interface .
DocumentManagerImpl
This is the actual class that handles managing access to ShareableDocuments by multiple users .
It implements the DocumentManager interface and is a subclass of Java.rmi.
UnicastRemoteObject which allows it to be accessed remotely .
DocumentContext
This maintains information on a ShareableDocument that is currently being accessed by one or more users .
A table of these is kept in the DocumentManager Impl class to keep track of all the ShareableDocuments that are being shared at once .
ClientView
This is the GUI that the user interacts with .
ClientControl
This does event handling for the ClientView .
ClientModel
This is the underlying model for the ClientView that contains data structures , maintains state and communicates with the server .
It implements the ClientListener interface .
ClientListener
This is an interface that describes the methods that are remotely accessible on the ClientModel .
The method that allows the client receive keystroke events from server is in this interface .
ClientState
This is an object that represents the current state of the ClientView .
LoginDialog GUI used for logging on to the server .
AddUserDialog GUI used for adding a new user to the system .
DocumentSelectionDialog GUI used to select which document to edit .

No one could possibly have been more devoted than Charlotte Kiszko , who campaigned tirelessly for 16 years to prove the innocence of her son , Stefan , convicted , after a bungled police investigation , of the murder of 11 - year - old Lesley Molseed in 1975 .
This week , many years after both she and her son were buried in the vast old cemetery , a man has been charged with the murder .
It is 30 years since Stefan Kiszko , an Inland Revenue clerk with the mental and emotional age of a 12 - year - old , was found guilty , and 13 since he died after a brief taste of freedom .
His mother died a few months later .
Could a case as shocking happen today ?
The man who helped to prove Kiszko's innocence , and who acted as his mother 's ally , believes we are now just as much in danger of ignoring equally egregious miscarriages of justice .
" In the current climate more miscarriages will take place , " said Campbell Malone , the solicitor who took over the case and saw it through its successful appeal .
" It is nonsense to suggest miscarriages of justice are less likely to happen now .
We are more at risk - the climate is just as bad as it was in the 1970s when you had all the Irish cases .
I am profoundly gloomy about the situation . "
Mr Malone accepted that changes in the law through the Police and Criminal Evidence Act ( Pace ) had removed some of the dangers .
Kiszko was , for instance , initially questioned without a lawyer and made his confession after being told that , if he did so , he would be allowed to go home .
In recognition of the large number of potential wrongful convictions , the Criminal Cases Review Commission ( CCRC ) was established by law in 1995 .
The commission , which has a staff of around 110 , receives more than 900 applications annually and refers about 40 cases to the appeals courts .
" The CCRC are under pressure and have had their resources cut back , " said Mr Malone .
He cited the government 's many attempts to reduce compensation paid to victims of miscarriage of justice .
" In the early 1990s there was a willingness to investigate .
That is no longer the case . "
Two highly regarded television series , the BBC's Rough Justice and Channel 4 's Trial and Error , also used to put the resources into researching such miscarriages .
" Trial and Error is just a memory and the Rough Justice programmes are as rare as hen 's teeth , " said Mr Malone .
" It 's getting harder and harder to have cases reopened .
It 's scary . "
Few new lawyers were entering the field , as such cases were time - consuming and may have been worked pro bono .
Michael Mansfield QC , who has acted in many of the best known miscarriage of justice cases , agreed that there were now serious risks of the wrong people being convicted , although the reasons may have changed .
" In the 70s and 80s , there were the usual allegations of fit - up , verbals [ alleged admissions ] and fabricated confessions .
Since Pace , that has dwindled to almost non-existent .
But forensic science can be equally suspect because of the desire to convict . "
He cited the case of Angela Cannings , cleared on appeal in 2003 of the murder of her two baby sons .
" If that had been carefully analysed it should never have led to a conviction , " he said .
" There are other cases where scientific evidence is not being scrutinised carefully . "
The rules on fingerprinting had been loosened rather than tightened .
" Most solicitors are very reluctant to get tied up in cases of this kind and a lot of lawyers shy away from this [ forensic issues ] because it 's very specialised , " he added .
He said television in the past had been able to lay out budgets that led to new information being turned up , as with cases like the Birmingham Six .
A new series about miscarriages of justice , The Innocence Project , was , coincidentally , launched this week by the BBC .
It is a fictional account of students investigating potential miscarriages of justice , as happens in real life at Cardiff , Bristol and Leeds universities .
A CCRC spokesman acknowledged budget cuts .
" As a result of reduced funding the commission has needed to make savings without compromising the quality of the service that we provide .
We are working hard to erode our backlog of cases and extra resources would obviously speed that process up . "
He added : " New problem areas have emerged in recent years , such as expert evidence , disclosure and critical errors in the directions given by judges .
While still rare , miscarriages of justice are still occurring and will continue to do so . "
Rochdale is not short of famous sons and daughters : Lord Byron , Gracie Fields , reformer John Bright .
Stefan Kiszko will be remembered not for what he did but for what he did n't do - and what was done to him .
Along with his modest grave , with its vase of plastic roses , a fitting memorial might be an acknowledgement that a frightened , vengeful society can still lock up the wrong man .
1. Advanced search
2. Organizing your Diggs
3 . Better user interaction
4 . Spy on a category
5 . More categories
6 . The dupe police
Example :
This is a story ( 43 % dupe - see other similar stories )
7. Digger map
8. Buried stories
9. Firefox extension

Themes / skins
Here are 10 features that I feel would make the Digg experience better : Digg 's search has the AND operator by default , recognizes phrases , you can search last 7 , 30 or 365 days , and that 's pretty much it .
Where are the advanced options : boolean operators (+ , -, OR ... ) or precise time frame search ( for example , search only stories between two dates ?
Also , if you want to search a particular category , you must click that category ( two clicks if it 's a subcategory ) and then you can search it - it would be much better if you had a central search page with all that options in one place .
Many people use Digg primarily as a bookmarking service .
It makes sense : the community diggs the best stories so they come on top , you digg them to remember them .
However , there 's currently no way to organize the stories you dugg , commented on , or submitted - just a long list of stories which gets pretty unusable if you 're a digg veteran and have hundreds of dugg stories .
For starters , it would be nice if you could at least sort them by their category .
As far as user interaction goes on Digg , you can add someone to friends , or reply to his / her comment .
No way to leave someone a public or private message .
You do n't even get a note when someone makes you his / her friend - I just discovered I have some new friends and I had no idea about it .
One argument against this is that personal messaging might make some users to pester other users to digg their stories .
However , it 's still a thing to consider - and it has been done on some other services similar to Digg .
This is probably more interesting to veteran diggers who use the Spy option a lot , but still it would a very useful option if you could have the Digg Spy only for a certain category .
For example , I only closely follow Technology stories , I would like to be able to spy only on them .
How many times , while submitting a story , were you unable to find the right category ?
That 's because there just ain't enough of them .
An Internet category comes to mind ; also , some sort of fun / comedy category would be nice ( The current Comedy category is only for videos ) .
I 'm sure some more improvements could be done in this department , and I do n't think new categories are hard to implement .
Digg has some basic duplicate protection , meaning that you cannot submit a story whose exact URL was already submitted .
However , what is basically a same story usually appears on tens of different sources , which leads to a number of dupes .
And this lead to " the dupe police " , a much maligned group of users who ( not always unjustifedly ) swarm the comments and protest : Dupe , DUPE !.
Well , Digg itself could do more to protect from dupes .
Perhaps an algorithm that compares a story with other similar stories and gives out a percentage number next to the title ..
Similar stories could also be listed below the story that might be a duplicate , so the users have the choice to see them also and decide which one is the best .
This is definitely not an essential feature , but it would certainly be fun - a visual , geographical map of Diggers .
It would work simple ; when someone diggs a story , you can see a dot at his geographical location on the map .
Related to this , it would be possible to use this data for various statistical data , so you 'd know not only how many diggers dugg a certain story , but also which stories are most dugg in a certain country / continent , etc. ( and we all know geeks like me love statistics ) .
In every user profile , you can see which stories were dugg , submitted , or commented on by a user .
However , you can't see which stories the user buried .
This could help evaluating the credibility of a user - if someone just goes around and buries story like a madman without any reason , he / she 's not going to be very popular .
Yes , I know there already are a few Digg - related Firefox extensions out there , most notably Digg This ! .
However , it would be nice to have a Digg spy extension in your browser , so you could always have an eye on upcoming stories .
Personally , I like the way Digg looks .
But themes / skins are always a nice addition , even if it 's only a slight change of color .
The simplicity of Digg 's design practically begs for visual customization .
This is my list , what is yours ?
I 'd like to read ideas from other users , so feel free to comment on this .

US ambassador lambasts Australian Labor Party leader
By Richard Phillips and Linda Tenenbaum
13 February 2003
US Ambassador Tom Schieffer has publicly denounced Australian Labor Party leader Simon Crean in the local media over criticisms made by Labor MPs of President George W. Bush and Australian participation in the impending US - led war against Iraq .
The unprecedented intervention follows last week ’s parliamentary debate on Australian involvement in the military assault during which right wing Labor MP Mark Latham described President Bush as “ the most incompetent and dangerous president in living memory ” .
Several other Laborites also denounced the US administration and the Senate , where the government does not have a majority , passed a no-confidence motion in Prime Minister John Howard .
The ALP has officially stated that it will support a US - led military attack if the United Nations Security Council endorses it , but 15 Labor MPs have defied the policy and said that they will oppose war against Iraq under any circumstances .
While Prime Minister Howard has responded to US requests for military backing and forward - deployed 2,000 Australian troops to the Persian Gulf , his government has little domestic support for a US - led war .
With Germany , France and Russia manoeuvring against a unilateral attack on Iraq , any wavering in support from Australia , which Washington regards as one of its most dependable allies , would constitute an international diplomatic disaster for the US .
So when a few Labor MPs began criticising Howard ’s commitment of troops the US embassy reacted with fury .
Deputy Ambassador Mike Owens phoned ALP leader Simon Crean ’s office twice on February 6 claiming that Latham ’s speech was “ anti-American ” and those who accused Howard of deception over the commitment of troops were alleging Bush to be a liar .
The next morning Ambassador Schieffer , a close friend and Texas business crony of Bush , told Channel Seven television that he was “ concerned ” that the comments were straining relations with the United States .
Schieffer claimed he was not trying to bully , but then declared : [ W ] e ’re in the business of trying to express what American foreign policy is .
The Australian Labor Party has to make up its mind as to how it reacts to this process . ”
Crean , who has a tenuous hold on the ALP leadership , quickly tried to defuse the issue .
He met with Schieffer later that day and assured him that Labor ’s support for the US - Australia alliance was “ unshakeable ” .
Two days later Crean told the Ten Network that he had cautioned Latham and in future Labor would tone down its criticism of Bush and US policy .
These assurances , however , did little to satisfy the ambassador who stepped up his attack in the Bulletin magazine this week .
Schieffer told the national weekly in an interview published yesterday that Crean was making a “ rank appeal to anti-Americanism ” and “ anti-George Bush feeling ” .
The US previously had “ terrific relationships ” with the Labor party , the US ambassador said , and praised former leader Kim Beazley and current Foreign Affairs spokesman Kevin Rudd for their close collaboration with senior US government officials .
“ Sadly Simon Crean does n’t have those kind of personal relationships , ” he added .
Schieffer said he was “ surprised ” Crean had not met with US Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage on his Australian visit last December or met key US administration figures during a US vacation during the Australian parliamentary Christmas break .
The ambassador predicted a quick and successful victory against Iraq and said : “ By the end of March we ’ll begin serious negotiations [ with Australia ] for a free trade agreement .
And we want to conclude that very quickly .
Inside two years .
Now when that happens , that will mean a relationship that literally , I mean literally , does not exist anywhere in the world . ”
In other words , a favourable trade deal with the US depends on 100 percent political backing for the US - led war against Iraq .
And just in case the Labor leadership did not get Schieffer ’s message , the Bulletin spelt it out .
Unless Crean fully supports US foreign policy dictates on Iraq , Australian trade negotiations with America might become “ painfully , paralysingly slow ” if Labor “ managed to win the next election . ”
Confronted with Schieffer ’s crude and unprecedented ultimatum , Crean demanded another meeting .
“ He does not have the right , nor does any ambassador , to interfere into the domestic politics of this country ....
That ’s unprecedented and unacceptable , ” he said .
Labor backbencher and former foreign affairs spokesman Laurie Brereton , was even more blunt : “ I have n’t seen an intervention such as this since then - ambassador Walter Rice in the Nixon administration publicly attacked the Whitlam government after we criticised the carpet bombing of North Vietnam in December 1972 . ”
Schieffer ’s comments , Brereton said , constituted a “ huge breach of diplomatic protocol ” and the ambassador should be “ immediately recalled to Washington and counselled . ”
Schieffer , however , will not be counselled by Washington but encouraged to ratchet up the pressure .
Direct intervention into ALP internal affairs constitutes an extraordinary breach of national sovereignty and diplomatic conventions , but this is how US imperialism now does business with its post - World War II allies and former political partners .
Last September the Bush administration published its National Security Strategy ( NSS ) , which spells out the modus operandi of US foreign policy in the twenty first century .
The document makes clear that the American government has dispensed with all principles of national sovereignty and international law and reserves the right to get rid of any regime it considers hostile to its vital interests .
The Howard government , the Labor party and other members of Australia ’s political elite may try to console themselves that this doctrine is reserved for Iraq , Iran , North Korea , Libya or other impoverished ex-colonial countries .
But the US ruling class has its sights on any nation that stands in its way .
Soon after releasing the NSS , the Bush administration intervened in the German elections against Gerhard Schroeder ’s Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) - Green government because it made a last minute populist appeal to the anti-war sentiment in Germany , declaring it would not support a unilateral US military attack on Iraq .
Furious over this stance , the Bush administration publicly supported the right - wing Christian Democratic Union and its conservative allies and conspired behind the scenes to undermine Schroeder and force his electoral defeat .
US officials seized on private comments by a German cabinet minister comparing Bush with Adolf Hitler to whip up a political scandal and try to turn public opinion against the government .
While the SPD - Green coalition was returned with a narrow majority , the Bush administration has blackballed Schroeder and , to this day , has not observed the longstanding practice of formally congratulating the new government .
Likewise , Schieffer has regularly intervened in Australian domestic affairs since his appointment in 2001 .
He has declared , without a shred of evidence , that David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib , Australian citizens imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay for over 12 months without charge and in contravention of basic human rights and international law , are “ terrorists ” and likened them to “ Nazis ” .
Schieffer has also castigated Australians for being “ too complacent ” about terrorism and urged the Howard government to beef up police and security operations .
Last year , in a crude attempt to whip up domestic fears , he declared that terrorists could easily detonate a nuclear bomb in Sydney Harbour .
Under his leadership the US embassy stepped into a federal by - election last October in Wollongong , an industrial city 80 kilometres south of Sydney .
Nervous over mounting public opposition to Australian involvement in a US - led war against Iraq , embassy officials demanded meetings with all those contesting the election to discuss their positions on Iraq .
While US officials claimed they simply wanted to gauge public opinion in the run up to the November elections in the US , this information was widely available in Australian opinion polls .
The real purpose was to send a message to all those contesting the election that the US State Department was closely monitoring their actions .
Union officials have also reported that they have been visited or phoned by US embassy staff over the last few months to discuss their attitude to US plans to invade Iraq .
Notwithstanding their attempts to garner immediate political mileage over Schieffer ’s bullying — the overwhelming popular response in Australia has been outrage — Crean and the Labor leadership will eventually fall into line .
The ALP is a tried and tested political ally of US imperialism .
It initiated the establishment of the US - Australian alliance during World War II and has loyally defended it ever since .
Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke became the first government leader to send troops to the 1991 Gulf War and Crean has stressed the ALP ’s continuing and total support for the US - Australian alliance .
Schieffer ’s threats to Crean , however , are aimed at intimidating not just the ALP , but the entire political establishment .
The Bush administration confronts escalating economic problems at home and a growing domestic and international movement against its planned onslaught against Iraq .
Under these conditions , it cannot tolerate anything less than total submission to its reckless and criminal foreign policy agenda .
The United Nations ’ oil - for - food program was so badly managed and supervised that more than half of the 4,500 companies doing business with Iraq paid illegal surcharges and kickbacks to Saddam Hussein , an independent investigation into the program will announce today .
The inquiry , led by former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker , will detail how the U.N. and its member governments failed to stop the former dictator ’s exploitation of the $ 64 - billion program , and will expose the participation of prominent international companies , as well as fly - by - night operations , a spokesman for Volcker ’s committee said Wednesday .
“ There are a few marquee names that everyone will recognize , ” Mike Holtzman said .
“ Some worked with a wink and a nod with their governments .
But the corruption was so widespread that literally thousands of companies were caught up in it .
To play , you needed to pay . ”
The independent panel led by Volcker was established by U.N. Secretary - General Kofi Annan last year to investigate allegations of corruption and mismanagement in the program , which had been set up to help Iraqis weather international sanctions imposed after Hussein ’s 1990 invasion of Kuwait .

Under terms of the program , Iraq could sell oil only through the U.N. , and the proceeds could be used only to purchase humanitarian goods .
But in a major loophole , Iraq was allowed to choose its customers .
Russian companies were by far the most heavily implicated , followed by French firms .
U.S. companies made up a very small percentage , the report said , though some did business through intermediaries or foreign branches and may not be listed as U.S. firms .
The report also apparently alleges that flamboyant British Parliament member George Galloway received payoffs , despite his denials before the U.S. Congress this year .
But Holtzman said Volcker ’s emphasis would not be on who was involved as much as what the inquiry showed about the failure of the U.N. 's management and oversight of the massive humanitarian program that ran from 1996 to 2003 .

“ The moral of the story is that the U.N. was broken , and the program mismanaged to the point where it could be exploited from the outside and the inside .
In order to run major humanitarian programs in the future , the U.N. needs to be fixed -- urgently , ” he said .
The report is the final of several by the committee , which has spent 18 months and $ 30 million investigating how the oil - for - food program went so wrong , bolstering Hussein ’s grip on power when sanctions aimed to weaken him .
Revelations of the program ’s failures have also severely undermined the credibility of the U.N. , despite what Volcker describes as the success of the program in feeding Iraqi people under harsh international sanctions .
The last report , issued in September , focused on malfeasance and maladministration by U.N. staffers , including what Volcker deemed as the failure of Annan to rein in the abuses of the program .
It also charged Security Council members with knowingly allowing smuggling to continue for years .

September ’s report harshly criticized the secretary - general ’s lax oversight , but did n’t find evidence of wrongdoing by Annan .
It did find that his son Kojo traded on his father ’s name for financial advantage .
Earlier reports also concluded that the U.N. 's procurement process was politicized and in some instances corrupt , and that the chief of the program , Benon V. Sevan , received payoffs .
Sevan has denied wrongdoing but resigned from the U.N .
Today ’s report is a “ how - to manual ” of corruption , Holtzman said .
The majority of the companies involved supplied humanitarian goods to Iraq , and the surcharges they paid amounted to about $ 1.5 billion .
Oil companies paid an additional $ 300 million in kickbacks .
The committee notified all of the companies named in the report of the findings against them , but only a few responded to challenge the conclusions , Holtzman said .
Of those , a large percentage said they were unaware that they had done anything illegal .

The investigators had access to records from the Iraqi government as well as voluminous U.N. documents , and the 500 - plus - page report has an additional 950 pages of tables .
Each transaction with each company was meticulously recorded , Holtzman said .
“ The last entry in the ledger was ‘ surcharge paid . ’
It is that stark , ” he said .
Charges have been filed against two Texas oilmen , David B. Chalmers and Oscar S. Wyatt Jr. A former French ambassador to the U.N. , Jean - Bernard Merimee , was arrested in Paris this month .
In a report issued last month , Volcker ’s committee blamed Annan , the U.N. Security Council and some member states for allowing corruption and mismanagement of the program .
Advertisement
The September report did say that the program had helped deprive Hussein of weapons of mass destruction and allowed Iraqis to maintain minimal standards of nutrition and health .
But it also said such accomplishments had been obscured by the program ’s waste , inefficiency and corruption .
Today ’s report will reinforce recommendations made in September for an overhaul of the U.N. , including the creation of a chief operating officer post to oversee the organization ’s sprawling aid programs , along with an independent auditing board .
“ We are hopeful that the legacy of this investigation is reform , ” Holtzman said .
The Volcker committee will turn over the documents it has gathered to national law enforcement agencies to use for prosecutions , but expects to end its own investigations and close down in November .

It has been funded by the money the U.N. received from Iraq ’s oil sales to administer the program , and the current Iraqi government has demanded that it be repaid .

I felt obligated to write this article to let college students know what things to look out for when they graduate so they do n’t get railroaded .
I will not waste your time with a long introduction , so without further ado , I present to you :
5 Things Every College Grad Should Know .
# 1 . A Degree Does NOT Entitle You to a Job
It ’s amazing to hear recent college graduates get so worked up about not being able to find a job .
Here ’s their typical rant :
“ I ’ve worked my butt off at college .
I studied every night .
I got good grades .
I graduated Magna Cum Laude .
Why are there no jobs out there ?
This is a travesty !
I worked my butt off and for what ?
So I can input data into spreadsheets at Initech ?
Nobody told me it would be like this .
Everyone told me that if you have a degree , you ’re set .
What the %*%# is going on ?
Arrrgghhh !!!! ”
First off , let me sincerely congratulate you for sticking to a major commitment and following through on it .
I ’m not trying to be sarcastic here .
I sincerely congratulate you .
I know it ’s hard work and I feel for you because I know exactly what you went through .
Now here comes the tough love that you know is coming .
Just because you got a degree , it does n’t entitle you to a six figure job , with full benefits , a one month paid vacation to a company retreat , 20 floating holidays , a corner office , and a parking spot in front of the doors with your name on it .
It ’s time to get your head out of the sand .
The days where all you needed was a college degree to get a job are LONG GONE .
Deep down inside , you know it ’s true .
We were all told the same lie in high school .
Get into a prestigious university , get a degree , and your magic high paying job will fall squarely into your lap .
The smart people are the ones who have figured out this lie early on in college , and made sure the time they spent in school would separate them from the students who were still “ asleep ” .
You know exactly who these smart people are .
They ’re the ones who took the internships , the unpaid jobs , who made network contacts , and spent their days and nights gaining valuable working experience and marketable skills .
Think back to your graduation .
Remember your fellow classmates graduating with you ?
They too got degrees .
Now , think of the thousand other graduations across the nation that occurred in the same month .
They got degrees too .
What ’s going to separate you from them ?
Why should employers hire you instead of all the other clones ?
You must learn to differentiate yourself .
What can you offer that these other people can’t ?
It ’s not enough to put your future in the hands of an educational institution .
It ’s time to stop blaming the world .
It ’s time to take personal responsibility and to have the courage to shape your future with your own hands .
# 2. Find What You Love to Do
I should ’ve put this at the very top , but I wanted to address the biggest issue facing recent college grads first ( job entitlement ) .
Let ’s look at the typical path of a college graduate who has not found what they love to do .
Graduated from college -> ca n’t find job -> get ’s low paying “ temporary ” job just to pay the bills -> starts to become complacent and falls into routine -> struggles to get out of routine but ca n’t because of accumulation of debt to finance lifestyle of escaping reality and impressing people with material possessions -> effectively becomes a slave to the job as it is needed to pay the bills -> looks foward to weekend to complain about job but does nothing and gets wasted to forget troubles -> gets depressed -> struggles to find meaning in life -> maybe gets a small promotion at temporary job by employer as an incentive not to quit -> hates waking up in the morning everyday but does it anyway to pay the bills -> makes other people ’s lives miserable because his is -> rinse and repeat for 40 years -> lies on deathbed regretting life , wishing he could go back and change it all , and dies knowing that he can’t .
The time you have after college is THE TIME to find what you love to do .
You ’re not burdened ( I assume for the most part ) with the heavy responsibilities of a mortgage , family , or dependents .
You ’ll most likely move back home or room with a buddy .
Use that time to find what you love to do .
Do n’t put it off .
Otherwise , you may fall into the trap of getting a job just to get by and falling into a routine .
I ’m not saying it ’s bad to get a job just to get by , but if that ’s all you ’re doing , and if you do n’t have a goal , plan , or passion , to shoot for , the future looks very bleak for you .
How do you find what you love to do ?
I ’ve written an article on that subject that might help you out .
You can read it here .
# 3. Learn How to Interact With People
Learning how to interact with people is probably one of the most valuable skills you can have in your belt .
This is a “ street smart ” skill .
Sure there are books on this , but the only way you can develop this skill is by putting it into practice constantly until it becomes second nature .
This skill will come into play when you get your first job .
Learn to make a habit of greeting people with a smile .
Say “ thank you , please , and I appreciate it ” whenever you have the chance .
These small things make a huge difference .
Do n’t be so quick to dismiss the power of appreciation and courtesy .
Make small talk , get to know your co-workers , help them when they have a problem .
Eat lunch with them .
Talk about the TV shows you watch when you ’re at the water cooler or about the cool blogs you visit on the net – hint hint
Learn to be positive .
Make people smile when they see you coming your way .
You ’ll find that the skill of comfortably interacting with people will help you when it comes time to promotion .
This will also protect you from the next subject .
# 4 . Practice CYA ( You Know , Cover Your – – -)
Office politics – yes , everything you ’ve heard is true .
Office politics DOES exist and it is NOT pretty .
When it comes to downsizing , I ’ve seen employees turn on the quiet employee in the corner like a pack of wolves and whisper to the managers that he / she must go .
It ’s far easier to fire the loner than to fire one of the gang .
That ’s why you should learn how to interact with people .
When it comes to promotion with competition , work sabotage and trash talking behind the back are rampant and pretty much expected .
When it comes to personal differences between employees and managers , managers will look for the smallest excuse to fire their employees .
But even if you are the most charming employee ever , you should still CYA .
Keep ALL emails .
Back them up .
Have everything in writing .
If a potential problem or situation comes up , document it as fully as you can .
Do n’t trust your memory .
If someone accuses you of something so bad that it could cost you your job ( I ’ve seen it happen ) , then you can calmly pull out all the information you saved and effectively CYA .
Not to mention , make the accuser look like a total idiot ( I ’ve seen that happen too and it is SWEET ! )
# 5. Build and Maintain A New Social Network
When you graduate , you ’re not going to be surrounded by your classmates and dorm buddies 24 / 7 .
You ’ll most likely be living with a roommate or living with your parents and the majority of your social contact will be at work , and I do n’t think your workplace is going to be filled with 22 year olds .
The only people you ’ll probably keep in touch with are your roommates and your frat buddies or any other close friends you made , but they will all be doing their own respective things in different places .
Building a social network is crucial .
Studies have shown that having a strong social network leads to positive mental and physical health over the course of one ’s life .
So start building your social network .
Do n’t just stay at home and play video games and expect friends to magically show up at your doorstep .
Go join Toastmasters .
Go to the parties , bars , bookstores , and lounges but one quick point though .
Do n’t just go to these places just for the sake of making friends .
Make sure you have a genuine interest in the subject of the place you ’re going to .
For example , if you have no intention of learning how to give speeches , do n’t go to Toastmasters just to make friends .
You wo n’t have anything in common with them because the people there want to give speeches .
Go to places where you have a genuine interest and you ’ll meet similar people there who share your interests , which is perfect fodder for friendships .
If you go to places where there are regular meetings , it ’s even easier to make friends because you see the same people who hold the same interest as you on a continual basis .
Ever wonder why it was easy to make friends at school ?
That ’s why .
If you ’re apprehensive about making friends with complete strangers , let me let you in on a little secret when it comes to people and their friends .
Most people are sick and tired of their friends .
We ’re creatures of habit .
We hang out with the same people all the time , listen to the same stories , laugh at the same jokes , and complain about the same things .
Most people are bored out of their mind when it comes to their friends and they ’ll welcome any type of change .
That ’s where you come in .
So do n’t have any fear of making friends .
Save people from boredom and complacency by inserting yourself into their lives .
The biggest misconception is that everybody has all the friends they need and that they do n’t need anymore .
People will always need friends .
So go make friends at work .
Play social sports like basketball or tennis or softball afterwards .
You ’ll find that people do n’t have many opportunities to make friends after school , especially if they work 9 - 5 .
That ‘s why you see so many friendships made at work .
After all , you are spending a whole lot of time there .
There will come a time when your social network will help you get through tough times and you ’ll be extremely thankful that you spent the time to make it .
I ’m sure there are other things that every college grad should know , but I feel that the 5 discussed here are some of the more important ones that should be made known .
So college grads :
Take personal responsibility , find what you love to do , learn how to positively interact with people , always CYA , and build a strong social network .
By doing these things , you ’ll find it to be extremely beneficial and a worthwhile investment on your part when making your brand new start .
C’mon !
The Pentagon ’s inspector general concludes that nine top officers were involved in the cover - up of NFL football star Cpl. Pat Tillman ’s “ friendly fire ” death , yet insists that this apparent conspiracy to conceal the truth does not rise to the level of criminality ?
Rather , it was “ missteps ” that led four generals and five officers of lower rank to conceal from his family and the American public the truth known instantly in the field : Tillman died not , as the Pentagon first claimed , in a firefight with the enemy in Afghanistan but rather at the hands of his fellow Rangers .
That family includes Tillman ’s brother Kevin , who fought alongside Pat in Iraq and Afghanistan after ending his own sports career as a professional baseball player and enlisting with Pat in response to the 9/11 attacks .
Yet this family , which sent two of its sons to fight in President Bush ’s wars , was rewarded for its sacrifice with officially inspired fabrications enshrined in a Silver Star commendation .
For five weeks of mourning , from Tillman ’s death on April 22 , 2004 , through his nationally televised memorial on May 3 , the U.S. government — from the president on down — used the tale of Tillman ’s heroism to deflect the nation ’s attention from the Abu Ghraib prison scandal and the escalating American casualties in Iraq .
Four generals were cited by the inspector general as sacrificing the truth in Tillman ’s death .
But another Central Command chief , Gen. John Abizaid , who knew about the friendly fire death a week after it occurred , was noticeably absent in the report released Monday .
The one officer who did pursue the truth was then - Capt .
Richard Scott , now a major , who had been assigned within 24 hours of Tillman ’s death to investigate the fratricide .
His report , submitted May 10 , 2004 , concluded that possible criminal actions occurred .
It was never officially accepted .
He later testified that witnesses had been allowed , in subsequent Pentagon investigations , to change their testimony as to key details in the shooting .
As the Tillman family put it in a statement Monday : “ The Army continues to deny the family and the public … access to the original investigation and the sworn statements from that [ Scott ] investigation . …
His investigation contained the unaltered statements , taken when memories were still fresh , by witnesses to the events surrounding Pat ’s death .
We know … that more than one of the original statements was altered , after Capt .
Scott ’s investigation ‘ disappeared . ’
This is not a misstep .
It is evidence tampering . ”
The family scorned the inspector general ’s conclusion of “ missteps . ”
“ The characterization of criminal negligence , professional misconduct , battlefield incompetence , concealment and destruction of evidence , deliberate deception , and conspiracy to deceive , are not ‘ missteps . ’
These actions are malfeasance . ”
The Tillmans noted the buck stops artificially with one of the generals cited , Lt. Gen. General Philip Kensinger , now retired : “ While he is not blameless , we believe he is the pawn being sacrificed to protect the king … [ former ] Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld . ”
The family points out that Rumsfeld was very familiar with the case .
He had written Tillman a personal letter thanking him for enlisting .
Rumsfeld was obviously aware that this was the most high - profile death in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
The family noted it is inconceivable that the Pentagon would have been able to coordinate a carefully orchestrated campaign of lies converting Tillman ’s death as a result of friendly fire into a Rambo - like assault on Taliban guerrillas , while keeping the secretary of defense and the White House in the dark .
Pat was a hero , saving the life of a fellow soldier who also was being fired upon .
He sacrificed not only a lucrative career but also an extraordinary passion for life that included his marriage to a wonderful woman , his years of education in which he was distinguished as a scholar as well as an athlete , and the enormous love of his family and community .
He deserved the Silver Star granted him posthumously , but not for the phony reasons cited in the declaration .
As the Tillman family put it , “ the award of the Silver Star appears more than anything to be part of a cynical design to conceal the real events from the family and the public , while exploiting the death of our beloved Pat as a recruitment poster . ”
They are right .
As the family stated , “ In three years of struggling with the Pentagon ’s public affairs apparatus , we have never been dealt with honestly .
We will now shift our efforts into Congress , to which we appeal for investigation . ”
A congressional investigation into the administration ’s cynical exploitation of Tillman ’s sacrifice is long overdue .

Condoms are not guaranteed to stop HPV transmission
Gardasil protects against the most common of sexually transmitted infections , human papillomavirus ( HPV ) , which can cause cervical cancer .
But HPV also causes genital warts and anal and penile cancer , and men argue the jab would guard against these .
Many private clinics are offering it to men .
One in London says it has immunised dozens in the last six weeks .
Controversy
Gardasil has been causing controversy since it was launched in the UK late last year , mainly because it is designed to be given to children before they become sexually active and can catch HPV .
The motivation is to protect themselves and to prevent spreading HPV to their partners
Dr Sean Cummings , who has been supplying Gardasil to his male patients
Q&A : HPV vaccines
The government is considering whether all girls , and possibly boys , aged 11 or 12 should get it routinely in schools , ultimately to cut cervical cancer rates .
Gardasil is licensed for boys and girls aged nine to 15 and women aged 16 to 26 .
But doctors can opt to give it to other people " off licence " if they wish .
Strong demand
Dr Sean Cummings at the Freedom Health clinic in Harley Street , where dozens of men have had the jab , said he was happy to recommend Gardasil to his adult men , at £ 450 for a three - dose course .
" We 've had a strong demand for it .
I had a man come in for the vaccine this morning .
He was 24 .
Then I have one this afternoon who is 67 years old .
" The motivation is to protect themselves and to prevent spreading HPV to their partners . "
Opponents say there is no point in immunising people who are already sexually active .
More proof
But Dr Paul Fox , a genito - urinary medicine expert at the Chelsea and Westminster and Ealing hospitals , believes it can be worthwhile .
He argues that it is unlikely a person will have encountered all of the four strains of HPV found in Gardasil , including the two linked to cancers , even if they are leading a very promiscuous sex life .
" We should not just be looking at vaccinating people in their pre-teen years .
Other people would benefit as well . "
We would not urge mass vaccination until we know it works
Roger Peabody of the Terrence Higgins Trust
Dr Jo Longstaff , of the Independent General Practice private clinic in Cardiff , which also offers the Gardasil vaccine , agrees .
" Our first enquiry about Gardasil was from a male patient .
I think they should be considering it . "
Dr Anne Szarewski , clinical consultant for Cancer Research UK who has been involved in evaluating both Merck 's Gardasil and GSK 's rival jab Cervarix , says there may be a case for immunising men .
" Men who have sex with men are at a much higher risk than average of anal cancer and genital warts , particularly if they are HIV - positive .
" Clearly it would be very important if the vaccine could protect .
The problem is we do need proof . "
Trials in men
Merck is currently testing the vaccine 's efficacy in 4,000 men , including 500 men who have sex with men .
And the US National Institute of Health is also carrying out trials to see what benefits it could have for people with HIV .
Merck said its priority was to tackle cervical cancer , but has not ruled out giving the vaccine to other groups - including men who have sex with men .
Roger Peabody of the Terrence Higgins Trust said if the trials were successful , there would be a good case for vaccinating young boys , not only to stop the spread of HPV to women , but to protect men against HPV - related disease .
Dr Szarewski agreed , saying : " It is bad enough suggesting to people that their 12 - year - old daughter might need a vaccine against a sexually transmitted infection .
" I would be interested to see the response of suggesting to parents that they should vaccinate their boys at 12 in case they become gay . "
She said heterosexual men and women also risked anal cancer .
About 400 people are diagnosed with anal cancer each year in the UK .
The disease is slightly more common in women than men .

Subject : WYTM ?
Date : Mon , 13 Oct 2003 00:28:07 - 0400 ( EDT )
As many have decried in recent threads , it all comes down the WYTM - What 's Your Threat Model .
It 's hard to come up with anything more important in crypto .
It 's the starting point for ... every - thing .
This seems increasingly evident because we have n't successfully reverse - engineered the threat model for the Quantum crypto stuff , for the Linux VPN game , and for Tom 's q&d channel security .
Which results in , at best , a sinking feeling , or at worst , endless arguments as to whether we are dealing with yet another a hype cycle , yet another practically worthless crypto protocol , yet another newbie leading users on to disaster through belief in simple , hidden , insecure factors , or ...
WYTM ?
It 's the first question , and I 've thought it about a lot in the context of SSL .
This rant is about what I 've found .
Please excuse the weak cross over !
For $ 40 , you can pick up " SSL & TLS " by Eric Rescorla [ 1 ] .
It 's is about as close as I could get to finding serious commentary on the threat model for SSL [ 2 ] .
The threat model is in Section 1.2 , and the reader might like to run through that , in the flesh , here : http://www.iang.org/ssl/rescorla_1.html perhaps for the benefit of at least one unbiased reading .
Please , read it .
I typed it in by hand , and my fingers want to know it was worth it [ 3 ] .
The rest of this rant is about what the Threat model says , in totally biased , opinionated terms [ 4 ] .
My commentary rails on the left , the book composes centermost .
1.2 The Internet Threat Model Designers of Internet security protocols typically share a more or less common threat model .
Eric does n't say so explicitly , but this is pretty much the SSL threat model .
Here comes the first key point :
First , it 's assumed that the actual end systems that the protocol is being executed on are secure ....
( And then some testing of that claim .
To round this out , let 's skip to the next paragraph : ) ... we assume that the attacker has more or less complete control of the communications channel between any two machines .
Ladies and Gentlemen , there you have it .
The Internet Threat Model ( ITM ) , in a nutshell , or , two nutshells , if we are using those earlier two sentance models .
It 's a strong model : the end nodes are secure and the middle is not .
It 's clean , it 's simple , and we just happen to have a solution for it .
Problem is , it 's also wrong .
The end systems are not secure , and the comms in the middle is actually remarkably safe .
( Whoa !
Did he say that ? )
Yep , I surely did : the systems are insecure , and , the wire is safe .
Let 's quantify that : Windows .
Is most of the end systems ( and we do n't need to belabour that point ) .
Are infected with viruses , hacks , macros , configuration tools , passwords , Norton recovery tools , my kid sister ...
And then there 's Linux .
13,000 boxen hacked per month ... [ 5 ] .
In fact , Linux beats Windows 4 to 1 and it has n't even challenged the user 's desktop market yet !
It shows in the statistics , it shows in experience ; pretty much all of us have seen a cracked box at close quarters at one point or another [ 6 ] .
Windows systems are perverted in their millions by worms , viruses , and other upgrades to the social networking infrastructure .
Linux systems are n't much more trust - inspiring , on the face of it .
Pretty much all of us present in this forum would feel fairly confident about downloading some sort of crack disc , walking into a public library and taking over one of their machines .
Mind you ... in that same library , could we walk in and start listening to each other 's comms ?
Nope .
Probably not .
On the one hand , we'd have trouble on the cables , without being spotted by that pesky librarian .
And those darn $ 100 switches , they so ruin the party these days .
Admittedly , OTOH , we do have that wonderful 802.11 b stuff and there we can really listen in [ 7 ] .
But , in practice , we can conclude , nobody much listens to our traffic .
Really , so close to nobody that nobody in reality worries about it [ 8 ] .
But , every sumbitch is trying to hack into our machine , everyone has a virus scanner , a firewall , etc etc .
I 'm sure we 've all shared that wierd feeling when we install a new firewall that notifies when your machine is being port scanned ?
A new machine can be put on a totally new IP , and almost immediately , ports are being scanned ....
How do they do that so fast ?
Hence the point : the comms is pretty darn safe .
And the node is in trouble .
We might have trouble measuring it , but we can assert this fact : the node is way more insecure than the comms .
That 's a good enough assumption for now ; which takes us back to the so - called " Internet Threat Model " and by extension and assumption , the SSL threat model : " the actual end systems ... are secure .
.... the attacker has more or less complete control of the communications channel between any two machines .
" Quite the reverse pertains [ 5 ] .
So where does that leave us with SSL ?
I am going to assume , for now , that the Internet Threat Model ( ITM , ( R ) TM , YATLA ) is the SSL threat model .
And that both are described fairly in the book .
And , it 's wrong .
There are , then , given these stated assumptions , three questions : 1 . why was it chosen ?
2 . what effect did it have on the protocol ?
3 . what 's the deal with repairing it ?
Let 's go back to the book and see if we can't work it out [ 9 ] .
Here 's a designed - in limitation in Part One ( the end systems are secure ) :
Protecting against attacks where one of the end systems is under the control of the attacker is extraordinarily difficult , if not impossible .
Here 's the acceptance of the all - powerful comms channel attacker :
Other than that , we assume that the attacker has more or less complete control of the communications channel between any two machines with no limitations on the threat level of the attacker .
Now check this caveat in part two ( the comms is totally open ) : protocol designers do n't worry about _denial - of - service_ attacks not because these attacks are n't important but because they 're extraordinarily difficult to prevent .
What does all this say ?
Well , in a nutshell , we wo n't protect against the end system attack , because its really difficult .
And we 'll ignore DOS because that 's too difficult too .
But we 'll cover the entire on - the - wire threats ... because , as the book goes on to show , we can !
And that 's the clanger - the threat model is about what we can protect .
It is not a statement of what is needed for the application .
Rather , the whole SSL threat model is a statement , lifted out of some book from some academic 's library , of what we know , in theory , about how to create a channel protocol !
Whether the perfect channel protocol is useful or relevant or applicable was never at issue .
This means the threat model is n't the threat model it should be .
A threat model looks at the application - at what we are trying to protect .
In this case , we know that the actual threat that SSL was built for was the sniffer of credit card numbers .
But , he , the sniffer , is not considered , what 's replaced his role is some theoretical bogey man .
The bogey man can do anything that we know how to protect against , and not the things we can't protect against .
This is pretty damning .
What it means is that , in essence , the threat model analysis was n't carried out .
Properly , at least , or at all , at the most .
SSL was put together as a " perfect " protocol to solve a " convenient " threat model from the ( admittedly persuasive and pervasive ) knowledge of the times .
And , it took little or no account of the needs of the application .
And now , it should be clear to us why SSL looks so damn odd in the secure browsing application - because it was , as a result of its unhappy parentage , an unexpected child that was n't created to plan .
That 's why , for example , the protocol finishes its security job close to the borders of the comms .
That 's why CA - signed certs were chosen , because they solved something that could be solved , with no particular analysis as to whether anyone would bother to attack that weak link .
That 's why , for example , it 's a channel security product , and not a page ( credit card number ) protection product .
And , for example , the digsig creates a chain instead of affirming an intent .
It was only assumed , guessed at , indeed , hoped for that this protocol was the best way to secure the credit card in a browsing application .
Here 's the assumption that confirms the failure : Designers of Internet security protocols typically share a more or less common threat model .
It 's para three , section 1.2 .
And , it is of course , famously not true [ 10 ] .
SSH is the most outstanding example of not sharing that threat model [ 11 ] .
In fact , it 's fair to say that most Internet security protocols do not share that threat model , unless they happen to have followed in SSL 's footsteps and also forgotten to do their threat model analysis .
Which is not to say that the threat model is inappropriate in the circumstances .
And , there is still some room to consider that fortune might have favoured the brave .
But , it is murky enough that we can rip the pretense aside : SSL borrowed someone else 's threat model , and it happened to have at least two highly challengeable assumptions in it , both of which led to a strong design feature we are now finding is detrimental .
These two assumptions - node is secure and comms are insecure - led to the very strong emphasis on MITM protection , which is the root cause of the failure of availability of secure browsing to the Internet public [ 12 ] .
What do we do about it ?
Firstly , we should recognise that the threat model is wrong .
Broken , in the crypto parlance .
No , not just broken , but irrelevant .
We know that the active attack is not a serious threat , and is in any event way less important than the threat to the machine itself .
Secondly , and thusly , this clears the way to de- emphasise protection against active attacks .
We can in most cases safely propose opportunistic cryptography from self - signed certs , cached or otherwise , from other methods of fingerprint distribution , or even from anonymous Diffie - Hellman .
For example , for starters .
That does n't mean ripping out the CA - signed certs , but just making them honestly optional .
Any server that wishes to use them can and should .
But servers and browsers that have no need , should n't need to .
Thirdly , it remains that secure browsing , is n't [ 13 ] .
We need to recognise that the pervasive myth that SSL secures the browing process is holding back a rethink on how to do it better .
And that has to come from the crypto community ; that 's where the myth was created and that 's where the debunking has to come from .
Or , at least , it 's better if the crypto community repairs its own myths , rather than the Internet community debunking it , and the credibility of the crypto community along with it . iang [ 1 ]

Rescorla 's book is becoming the must - have guide for SSL & TLS , a point I rely upon overly much . [ 2 ]
The spec for TLS does n't really mention threats .
The scattering of papers on the topic seem to gloss over it as well .
So the book is both well needed and somewhat belated , this late in the SSL cycle . [ 3 ]

Quick reality check : yes , WEP is broken , but no , it is n't useless : who is going to go to the library and crack the crypto ?
Not me .
Fact of the matter here is that for the vast majority of uses , WEP may very well be " good enough " ... not great or a protocol to be proud of , but it 's good enough for ordinary net use . [ 8 ]

On the day the American tanks rolled into Baghdad , Abather Abdul Hussein and his wife , Balqes Abdel Mohammed , threw flowers .
Literally .
After a lifetime of turmoil and tyranny , the couple fervently believed the invasion would bring peace .
Abather joined U.S. “ democratization ” efforts , such as a project to create a governing council for his neighborhood , and he occasionally ended up in the good - news Iraq stories that still seemed plausible in those days ; one U.S. paper ran a five - column photo of him perched on a classroom chair surrounded by American soldiers , with a story about the “ new Iraq . ”
These days , Abather and his young family are among the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis who have fled in fear for their lives .
After months spent dodging insurgents who had targeted them for supporting the Americans , he and Balqes are relieved to have escaped — and bitter , like thousands of fellow refugees , that the superpower for which they risked their lives has abandoned them .
A short man who bundles his shattered body in layers against the desert ’s winter chill , the 34 - year - old Abather is polite and relaxed , with an easy smile .
An engaging conversationalist even in broken English , he loves to talk about Baghdad , his infant daughter , and his wife , an outspoken woman several years his senior , whom he calls a genius .
“ When we met she was a professor at Baghdad University , ” he boasts .
“ I was her student .
When she walked into a room , hundreds of people would stand to pay her respect . ”
Considering that his life savings will run out in two months , that he can’t work legally in Jordan , and that he could be deported at any moment , Abather is remarkably stoic , though the anxiety leaks out in tics .
He chain - smokes cheap Craven A cigarettes , crushing the charred filters in an overflowing ashtray ; when Balqes complains , he sheepishly offers that “ smoking is my only work . ”
It ’s not quite true — his one other job during the past 18 months has been recounting his nightmare , over and over again , to border guards , embassy workers , and aid agencies .
In December , he reluctantly told it to me , pulling documents from a worn leather folder to corroborate the details .
The story began after the ouster of Saddam , when Abather and Balqes , like many Iraqis , launched a de-Baathification program of their own .
Their target was the dean who had been Balqes ’ boss at Baghdad University ( and who , as Abather tells it , had forced her out when she resisted joining the Baath Party ) .
Balqes wanted her job back ; one day Abather confronted the dean , and tempers flared .
American soldiers broke up the brawl , bound Abather ’s wrists with a zip tie , and interrogated him .
He explained Balqes ’ gripe and what the loss of her job had meant for their family , including their 3 - year - old son and Balqes ’ 14 - year - old son from a previous marriage ( her first husband had been killed in the Iran - Iraq War ) .
Though he held a master ’s degree in engineering , Abather had n’t been able to get a job in the doldrums of sanctions - era Iraq , so he was scraping together a living repairing watches , his wife and children crammed into his father ’s small home .
“ The soldiers were very understanding , ” Abather recalls .
“ I was impressed . ”
They offered the family an apartment in a place called Iraqi Village , a compound near the Baghdad airport where Saddam had housed orphans he was grooming to become fedayeen loyalists .
In return , the couple translated for the Americans , and eventually the Washington National Guard ’s 1st Battalion 303rd Armored Regiment hired Balqes as an interpreter , at $ 15 per day .
Abather ended up leading a U.S. Army - contracted security squad with a monthly salary of $ 130 .
Learning that he was an engineer , soldiers later gave him lucrative reconstruction assignments .
He started an engineering firm and worked with contractors such as ABB and Kellogg , Brown and Root ; in one heady year , Abather ’s contracts would mushroom from a few thousand dollars to an $ 862,000 electrification project ( later canceled because he could n’t procure the needed equipment ) .
Abather and Balqes glow with wonder when they speak of those days , of earning a good living and having their own home for the first time .
Most of all , Abather enjoyed hanging out with the Americans .
He seems to remember every soldier he ever met : Captain Philips and Sergeant Buchard gave his children toys , a soccer ball , and school stationery ; Lieutenant Glenn Allen got so close to the family they called him “ Uncle Allen . ”
( Allen confirmed Abather ’s story in emails to me , calling him and Balqes “ very helpful individuals ” who “ risked their lives by meeting with us . ” )
It was as if they had suddenly found themselves citizens of the 51st state .
And so , in October 2004 , when Abather got his first death threat , he thought it was a joke .
It was handwritten , tucked under the windshield wiper of his car inside Iraqi Village , a gated community with American checkpoints at both its entrances ; how , Abather wondered , could an insurgent even have gotten in ?
The note read :
Abather ,
Leave your work with the Americans .
Otherwise you will be killed by jihadis because you are a traitor .
Jihad Army
Then the killings began .
Lieutenant Allen had once given Abather a photo depicting two American soldiers with five of their Iraqi friends .
Three of the Iraqis were assassinated in short order .
Abather began to notice cars following him , and a few times shots were fired at his car .
The anonymous notes grew increasingly menacing .
Eventually , Iraqi Village felt so dangerous that Abather and Balqes moved the family back to his father ’s house .
A death threat arrived there almost immediately .
Still Abather continued working with the Americans .
One day in August 2005 , Abather was driving Balqes , six months pregnant with their second child , to a doctor ’s appointment .
At an intersection , he noticed a gold car parked by the road ; suddenly the two men in it leveled guns at him .
“ This is the end , ” Abather thought , and then a U.S. patrol appeared and the assailants vanished into traffic .
Within days , Abather and Balqes had sold off their belongings and fled to Amman .
Their troubles had only just begun .
The U.S. Embassy in Amman is an attractive , Arabian - style fortress , heavily guarded machine - gunners in Ford pickups .
It sits high on a hillside , and the view is so phenomenal that you can imagine your gaze reaching all the way to the Iraqi border , some 200 miles away .
In the foreground , Amman ’s rolling mosaic of pale , boxy limestone buildings shimmers against the azure sky .
At its edges , in dank apartments on outlying hillsides , lives a substantial portion of Baghdad ’s educated middle class .
Almost all fled in a panic , after getting death threats or seeing loved ones murdered ; many were targeted by insurgents or jihadis because they supported , or worked for , the Americans .
Of Iraq ’s 27 million prewar population , about 1 in 8 — some 3.4 million people — have left their homes since the invasion , according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees ( unhcr ) , and more than half of those have ended up abroad .
Refugees International labels this the world ’s fastest - growing humanitarian crisis .
Yet the Bush administration has refused to so much as acknowledge the refugees ’ plight , let alone help them get to safety or even provide basic humanitarian aid .
In the past , notes Bill Frelick , refugee policy director at Human Rights Watch , the United States has often aided those persecuted for supporting it ; since the Vietnam War , 1 million Vietnamese refugees have been resettled in the United States , including tens of thousands of South Vietnamese army veterans .
But the Bush administration “ has abdicated that obligation , ” says Frelick .
“ The people who have fled are the ones the administration was relying on to build democracy in Iraq ; it would rather ignore them than acknowledge that its initiative has failed . ”
It was in Jordan that Abather and Balqes discovered the limitations of their friendship with the United States .
Lieutenant “ Uncle ” Allen had emailed the embassy in Amman to explain that the family feared for their lives ; he ’d even offered to sponsor their relocation “ to the safety of the United States . ”
An unsigned email from the embassy commended Allen — ” I know that your Iraqi friends appreciate your friendship ” — but noted that U.S. visas are “ quite difficult ” for Iraqis to get .
Since 9/11 , Middle Easterners in general , and Iraqis in particular , have faced enormous hurdles getting admitted to the United States ; until 2005 , the Bush administration maintained a total freeze on Iraqis that shut out current refugees as well as hundreds of people who had fled Saddam Hussein ’s regime years earlier .
The email nonetheless provided instructions on getting a tourist visa , and Abather and Balqes quickly filed their application along with the $ 200 fee — almost two months ’ rent .
Several months later they were notified that they could visit the United States for up to three months , but that they could not bring their children .
They then made repeated visits to the unhcr to apply for official refugee status .
As it has with almost 99 percent of the Iraqis who have come through its office in Amman , the agency turned them down .
Abather and Balqes set their sights on a visa to Australia , a major destination for Iraqi refugees , and even hired an Iraqi lawyer there .
They waited for months .
Their savings dwindled ; then their baby fell ill , and the emergency surgery , for an intestinal obstruction , cost $ 2,100 in cash .
In early June 2006 , Abather got a rejection letter from Australia .
Around the same time , word came that his father had died of a heart attack .
So he went back to Iraq to bury his father , help his mother find a place to live , and buy state - subsidized medicine for his daughter .
But when he returned to the Jordanian border less than a week later , he was told he could n’t reenter the country :
Having recently suffered two terrorist attacks , Jordan had enacted a ban on entry for Iraqi men aged 17 to 35 .
For two days Abather stood on the highway at the border post , beseeching successive shifts of immigration officials .
Finally , a guard promised to send the medicine to his family in Amman if he would just go away .
Once again Abather headed back to Baghdad .
Driving in Baghdad a few days later , he noticed a bmw — the Iraqi gangster ’s vehicle of choice — in his rearview mirror , closing in .
The car forced him off the road ; armed men blindfolded him and knocked him unconscious .
When he woke up , he was in a tiny room , handcuffed to a chair .
Masked men came and went , videotaping as they cursed him as a traitor .
They whipped him with a steel cable ; six months later , his back was still etched by deep , evenly spaced grooves .
“ We ’ve been searching for you for a year , ” his captors told him .
Abather recognized the voice of one man , an acquaintance from Iraqi Village who had seemed to befriend the Americans .
“ I ’m sorry your father passed away , ” the man said .
Soon , a bearded imam sentenced Abather to decapitation for collaborating with the United States .
Abather barely heard the proceedings .
“ I was thinking the whole time about my little daughter in Amman . ”
He was told he could save himself by spying on the Americans , but he refused .
On the eighth day , the men asked if there was anything he wanted before he died ; then they put him on the floor in the back of the bmw and sped off .
Suddenly , Abather heard gunshots .
The men shouted .
The car crashed , and everything went black .
He woke up in a hospital bed 60 miles from Baghdad ; Iraqi forces had attacked the bmw and pulled him from the burning wreck .
He had a compound fracture in his leg and severe burns all over his body , but the nurses urged him to leave :
His captors would be looking for him .
His brother — who had received a ransom note from the kidnappers , complete with a photo of Abather bound and gagged — brought him back to Baghdad , where doctors fused a piece of plastic onto his shin and grafted skin from his thighs over his wounds .
A few weeks later , he was back at the Jordanian border , and this time the guards took pity .
The family had n’t told Balqes of the kidnapping .
But when she saw her disfigured husband , she says , “ I knew right away what happened . ”
On a crisp , clear day this past December , clutching a sheaf of papers documenting Abather and Balqes ’ ordeal — contracts , soldiers ’ recommendations , death threats , a missing - person report — I headed to American Citizen Services at the U.S. Embassy in Amman .
Abather and Balqes had made several pilgrimages there ; they were convinced that if only they could speak to an American , Abather ’s charred and mangled flesh would make their case , but they had never gotten past the Jordanian security guards .
Outside the embassy , I joined a chatty , eclectic crowd of Americans : a retired hippie turned English teacher from Vermont ; a woman with a New York accent who struggled through the narrow eye - slit in her black veil to keep track of her hyperactive daughter ; a white - bearded man in a Santa hat , who said he was picking up his passport before returning to the North Pole .
I wondered whether any of us would risk our lives for the United States as Abather and Balqes had .
To get past the compound ’s first wall , we navigated a metal detector , a body frisk , and an X - ray machine ; after crossing a 30 - foot no man ’s land we repeated the process at the second wall .
Then we waited to be called .
The United States admits more refugees than any country in the world , but in 2006 , only 202 Iraqis were allowed in , and most of them had fled persecution under Saddam before the war .
This year , millions of Iraqis , Tibetans , Sri Lankans , and Afghans must compete for a mere 5,500 refugee slots Congress has allocated for the Middle East and South Asia .
The Iraqis are in line behind their compatriots who have been waiting in Jordan since the late 1990s .
Like other Western representatives , U.S. officials here refer displaced people to the unhcr , which is charged with determining whether someone is a real refugee , and if so , with finding him a safe place to go .
Except that , as Amman unhcr head Robert Breen told me , a 1998 agreement with Jordan forbids the agency from classifying anyone as a refugee whom it ca n’t get out of the country within six months — an impossibility in the post - 9/11 world .
( A country of about 6 million , Jordan has long had the world ’s highest refugee population per capita , hosting more than a million Palestinians who fled Israel in 1948 and were supposed to stay only a short time . )
Of the 21,000 Iraqi asylum seekers the office has registered since the U.S. invasion , only 291 have been granted refugee status ; meanwhile the line outside the unhcr ‘s gates gets longer every week , and the wait for an interview stands at five months .
To care for all of the region ’s displaced Iraqis , the agency had a total budget of $ 22 million in 2006 — less than $ 7 a person , which must cover not only the Kafkaesque registration programs but also basic survival aid to refugees trapped in desert camps or squatting in abandoned buildings .
Recognizing the potential for “ severe humanitarian suffering , ” the Iraq Study Group in December recommended that “ the United States take the lead ” in funding the UNHCR ’s Iraq program ; currently it donates no more than a quarter of the budget .
Direct U.S. aid to the refugees consists of a tiny grant to the Catholic relief organization Caritas ( see “ How to Help , ” page 68 ) .
At the embassy , I recounted Abather and Balqes ’ ordeal at Window 3 , then at Window 1 — the setup was similar to visitation in a high - security prison .
Then , at Window 4 , I told the story again to the consul general , who stood behind the bulletproof glass wearing a telephone headset .
I was expecting to hear that “ the United States is doing its best to help , ” but there was only silence as the consul ’s eyes welled up .
( An Amman - based aid worker later told me that American diplomats are so distraught by the policies they are charged with representing that “ it just takes a few gin and tonics and they ’ll break down . ” )
Finally , the consul said , “ We hear stories like this all the time .
We have enormous empathy for the Iraqis who ’ve suffered after working with the Americans , but there ’s really nothing the embassy can do for them . ”
She handed me a document outlining Congress ’ sole concession to people like Abather and Balqes : visas for up to 50 military translators from Iraq or Afghanistan each year .
“ But do n’t get their hopes up , ” she added quickly ; there were thousands with the same story .
“ This is something Congress really needs to address , ” she said as we parted .
The administration certainly does n’t seem inclined to take the initiative .
Philip A. Frayne , an embassy spokesman in Amman , told me that “ there are no reliable figures ” on how many people have fled Iraq , and that in any case , it was Saddam who drove out “ a large percentage ” of them .
Likewise , in its 2006 annual refugee report to Congress , the State Department focused mainly on those Saddam - era exiles , and blithely intoned , “ It is hoped that significant numbers of Iraqi refugees will soon be able to return home , although the security situation will remain an important consideration . ”
The report ignored the fact that , according to a survey by the nonprofit U.S. Committee for Refugees , 644,500 new refugees entered Jordan and Syria in 2005 alone .
And 2006 will likely be worse .
As much as a quarter of greater Amman ’s population is now Iraqi , and the crowds have exacerbated the city ’s severe water shortage .
Prices have skyrocketed .
Until recently Iraqi children could n’t attend Jordanian schools , and their parents cannot legally work ; easily identified by their dialect , Iraqis are discriminated against and terrified of deportation .
Some refugees never go outside .
Jordanian government spokesman Nasser S. Judeh told me that his country , a staunch U.S. ally and aid recipient , “ certainly needs help , and has held discussions with U.S. diplomats ” about this issue .
Incidentally , Human Rights
Watch has also called upon the Gulf Arab states to pitch in ; Saudi Arabia ’s response so far has been to plan construction of a 560 - mile wall along its border with Iraq .
before i left jordan , Abather invited me to visit his family and a physician friend from Baghdad who shares their two - room basement apartment .
On the Al Zawraa TV channel from Baghdad , we watched U.S. Army vehicles disappear behind roadside bomb blasts as a man sang , “ Let ’s go kill the Americans ! ”
The channel ’s endless stream of anti-American propaganda perplexed Abather and his friends : “ Why does the United States allow this ? ” they inquired .
When images of dead children supposedly killed by the Americans hit the screen , Abather ’s friend switched to a channel on which voluptuous Arab women danced in an un-Islamic way .
Balqes served Iraqi coffee , and to keep the baby from playing with the colorful cups , Abather suspended her from an elastic swing above our heads .
She giggled as he bounced her by her tiny foot .
“ This is her prison , ” he joked .
Six months after the kidnapping , he still had n’t gotten the surgery he needed to heal his burned flesh ; if the wounds become infected , he could die .
Abather rarely complained .
“ God is testing us , ” he said .
“ But we will get through it . ”
He looked at the girl bouncing from the ceiling and smiled .
“ I have a daughter , and I ’m very happy . ”
Balqes was more fearful — twice in the past month , suspicious men had shown up at the apartment .
Iraq , she worried , had already caught up with them .
How to Help
Very few organizations are working on getting aid to Iraqi refugees , and of those that are , many are too small or too beleaguered to accept individual donations ; the Iraqi Red Crescent , for example , has suffered bombings and mass kidnappings , yet its volunteers continue to deliver aid to displaced families inside Iraq .
One of the larger relief organizations working with the refugees is the Catholic group Caritas , whose caseworkers I shadowed while in Amman .
Bucking the image of the Land Rover - driving aid worker , they made their rounds in an aging gray Honda , its roof eaten through by rust .
They visited Iraqi doctors , engineers , and executives desperate for food , heat , or blankets to fend off the desert winter ; one family told the crew they had just sold their stove to buy food .
Caritas helps a few thousand families a year , but “ the demand far outstrips the money available to us , ” says Magy Mahrous , who oversees the project .

Chart as Displayed During Today 's Congressional Oversight Hearing During the Testimony of the Outed CIA Agent ...
Brad Friedman Byon 3/16/2007 , 12:36 pm PT
As requested by a number of readers , the following chart was displayed at today 's House Oversight Committee hearings ( live blogged here ) as chaired by Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) .
The BRAD BLOG obtained the chart from his office .
It was presented by Rep. Paul Hodes ( D - NH ) during the hearing and shows the known number of disclosures of Valerie Plame - Wilson 's identity by the White House and the State Department .
Plame - Wilson testified under oath today that she was a covert CIA operative working to monitor WMD in Iraq when her cover , and that of her entire network , was blown after the disclosure of her identity by White House officials .
She also testified it was the first time such a CIA agent 's cover was purposely blown by our own government .
The chart is followed by the section from the text transcript when the chart was initially displayed this morning ...
REP .
PAUL HODES ( D - N.H. ) : Thank you , Mr. Chairman .
Mrs. Wilson , thank you for coming today .
What happened to you is deadly serious .
You were the victim of a national security breach .
If this was a law enforcement context , something I 'm familiar with , it would be equivalent to disclosing the identity of an undercover police officer who has put his life on the line , and the lives of all those who help that officer .
Our job on this committee is to find out how the breach happened .
Now , I 'd like to show you a chart that we prepared on the committee --- you 'll see it up on the screens , and we 're putting it up here on paper .
That chart is a graphic depiction of all the ways that your classified CIA employment was disclosed to White House officials and then to the press .
Every colored block on that chart is an individual , and every arrow shows a disclosure of classified information .
That classified information was your CIA employment status .
And the arrows are based on the testimony in Mr. Libby 's criminal case and press reports .
This chart shows over 20 different disclosures about your employment .
Let me ask you , looking at this chart , are you surprised that so many people had access to the classified information about your CIA employment ?
MS . PLAME WILSON : Yes , I am , Congressman .
And I 'm also surprised at how carelessly they used it .

All for the want of a dog .
" What 's a dog ? " I inquired .
The middle - aged Jamaican smiled , " The dog is that little part down there . "
He knelt , pointing to the rear wheel of his broken bicycle leaning against the stuccoed cement block wall that outlined his neatly kept yard .
He rose , looked me in the eye , and inquired , " Can you bring me a new one back when you return from the States ? "
You see , my friend really needed a dog — the local term for the broken small part of the wheel assembly — in order to fix the bike he used for work .
The local bike shops — more like bike shacks — did n't have the part in stock .
And , even if they did , the price of a dog sold on the island would have been too high for a day laborer to afford .
Sure , I would have loved to have brought one back for him , but I was n't coming back as my service in the US Peace Corps was about to end .
The bike — a gift from my friend 's generous , well - meaning US relative — would slowly rust against the wall in the rain and lightly salted winds , all for the want of a dog .
This incident was one of many lessons in Third World economics that I received as a Peace Corps volunteer serving in Jamaica in the early 1990s .
Another such incident was the abrupt end to the computer class I initiated at a local secondary school .
The dog bit once again , this time in the form of the failed keyboard , which doomed the program .
For the want of a simple US $ 10 keyboard , a US $ 1,500 PC would sit idle .
These lessons come to mind as I hear more and more about the idea of providing laptops to millions of students in Third World countries .
The idea sounds wonderful , utopian even .
But the dog will bite again , and this idea will assuredly fail .
What causes the dog to react so ?
Well , the political and economic structures of Third World countries — such as Jamaica — of course .
During my service , the Jamaican political economy was based on a centralized , interventionist government ; a supposed democracy where garrison districts recorded landslide victories of 99 % ; an island where the ruling party had close ties to Castro in the ' 70s ; a nation whose political parties ran drug posses to generate funds and enforce political power ; a country where the confiscation and nationalization of private property was one stroke of the pen from reality .
Jamaica is a nation where my students believed the solution to the country 's ills was to " ask for more money from President Bush . " [ 1 ]
I knew better .
US aid rarely makes it to a small school in the countryside .
There were too many dollar - hungry bureaucrats driving late - model Fords circling the government agencies and NGOs of the capital , Kingston , to allow much money to escape their grasps .
And , it would not have mattered even if some money filtered through ; the money always went for the PC when it was the dog that was needed .
Mises long ago explained this inability for central planners to lead an economy in any direction other than down Chaos Avenue .
In addition , Jamaicans suffered due to an official exchange rate that was about 30 % below the active black market for dollars .
This , in addition to outrageous protective tariffs and inflationary policies , drove the cost of the dog my friend needed above the price he could afford .
All of this resulted in the typical contradictory Third World activities existing side by side : water and electric rates set at an unaffordable price forcing residents to illegally tap into the pipes and wires — and no one really caring since the government owned the utilities ; tourist hotels — mostly exempt from tariffs and quotas - and government agencies flowing with food while the local shops were barren of most essentials .
Such is life in the Third World .
The laptop idea is doomed to fail .
What 's worse , since the failure is the result of politics , the cost , as usual , will be borne by taxpayers .
There will be winners , those who live as pilot fish , eating scraps left over from the victims of a gorged government shark .
In fact , the laptop idea appears to have resulted in a manner akin to a pilot fish whispering in the ear of its sycophant shark , encouraging the shark to strike so that more scraps can be scavenged without effort by the beguiling fish .
The general public in the United States will be sold on the supposed benefits of providing laptops to the impoverished students of the world , and will wait like Pollyanna for the sun to rise on a worldwide education utopia .
A dawn that will never appear .
There are so many holes in this vision .
First , while the solution is sold as the doings of altruistic donors , the truth is that governments and pseudo governmental organizations — such as the Inter - America Development Bank — are waiting in the wings .
With the sharks on attack , and the pilot fish alongside , failure is impossible .
Oh , the program will not be worth a darn , but that is not failure in the eyes of government .
It is simply the signal that more money must be invested , more laptops delivered , more , more , more .
Failure ?
Out of the question .
Additionally , another problem is the little dog that lies inside every electronic device .
And once that dog goes bad , the laptop will be tossed into the dusty corner of a closet somewhere in the backcountry .
Even if students take great care of their new machines , many will simply malfunction .
And , without a capital structure to support repairs , and an economy based on borders free of tariffs and quotas , the replacement dogs will never find their way into the malfunctioning laptops .
If you want to help the Jamaican lamenting his dog and impoverished students struggling overseas , while also assisting US taxpayers and consumers , encourage the development of international and local free markets .
It 's a simple solution to what has become , through continued government interventions , a very complex issue .
Once the steps are taken to open borders , allow goods to be traded without barriers , tariffs , and quotas , the ingenuity of acting humans will correctly resolve the situation .
Of course , it will take some time before the capital structures of poor countries can change from that which supports despotic governments into structures that respond to consumer wants worldwide .
In addition , capitalists and entrepreneurs will have to be convinced that a new social system will keep their investments safe from government appropriation — no small task .
This process will not happen over night , nor will it be painless .
But the short - term pain will quickly result in the appearance of cheap dogs for the laborer who needs simple transportation .

Entrepreneurs can struggle to raise the first million or so , even with a good idea .
But a business angel might smile on them
IN AUGUST 2003
Skype released the first version of its software , which allows people to make free voice and video calls over the internet .
The company had raised its seed capital only a year before from a group of private investors , who had later been joined by venture - capital funds .
It was a remarkable investment .
In September 2005 Skype was bought by eBay for € 2.1 billion ( $ 2.6 billion ) .
The deal made its Scandinavian founders , Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis , millionaires many times over .
For their part , the earliest investors saw a huge return , 350 times or so , on their estimated € 2 m investment .
Few start - ups can hope to become so big so fast .
Most new companies wither and die in their first few years , leaving their investors out of pocket .
That risk and would - be investors ' unavoidable lack of knowledge when faced with unproven business plans explain why entrepreneurs struggle to finance their dreams .
Not only must entrepreneurs find the money to get a business off the ground , but they will also need further finance if it is to flourish .
The search was never easy .
But it has become harder in recent years with the opening of what has been called the “ equity gap ” — a scarcity of ready sources of outside financing for the smallest companies .
This matters in an age that has recognised the part new businesses play in invigorating economies .
Governments everywhere are desperate to help entrepreneurs start the companies that will create new jobs and new wealth .
Which is where the ragtag army of “ business angels ” comes in .
Professional venture capitalists get all the kudos — and most of the money — but the informal choir of business angels plays a large role in starting the innovation machine rolling .
Between them , the angels form an unofficial and little - known capital market on which the future is built .
The equity gap exists because two well - trawled sources of finance no longer overlap .
In their earliest stages , start - up companies typically rely on precarious financing , such as their owners ' credit cards , second mortgages or cash from close contacts .
There is a limit to these sources , which professional venture capitalists disparagingly called the “ three Fs ” — family , friends and fools .
They might provide the first $ 250,000 or so .
But that is too meagre to bring to market the sort of groundbreaking ideas , like Skype , that can eventually turn into a billion - dollar business .
So another source of funds is needed .
Once , businesses would have turned to venture capitalists , who put up money in return for a stake in the enterprise .
A decade or more ago $ 1 m could have been raised this way .
But as venture - capital funds have developed and expanded , so their ambitions have grown with them .
Many are no longer interested in deals unless they are worth much more .
Most venture - capital firms in America will now consider only deals in which they can invest at least $ 7 m , says Jeffrey Sohl , director of the Centre for Venture Research at the University of New Hampshire .
Europe is not much different .
British entrepreneurs struggle to find well organised investors if they are looking for less than £ 2 m - 3 m ( $ 3.7 m - 5.6 m ) , estimates Colin Mason , academic director of the Hunter Centre for Entrepreneurship at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow .
A wing and a prayer
Where can business people go to bridge this equity gap ?
British entrepreneurs could try a television programme such as the BBC's “ Dragons ' Den ” .
Contestants pitch their business plans to a group of potential investors to win the prize of some backing .
But television is about entertainment .
So , one of the show 's advisers recently confided , “ I find them a few mad people and plonkers . ”
To avoid humiliation , it might be better to seek help privately , from some business angels .
Angels are rich .
They usually have business experience and are often prepared to invest in a risky venture .
But they do not operate by the standard rules typical of stock exchanges or formal investment firms .
For all its obscurity , the market they operate in is huge .
Mr Sohl estimates there are up to 350,000 business angels in America who invest around $ 30 billion a year in some 50,000 ventures , an average of $ 600,000 per investment .
In contrast , venture - capital funds in America invest on average $ 6 m in each venture , according to PricewaterhouseCoopers .
Business angels have a long history .
America 's National Venture Capital Association believes that over the past 30 years they have put more than twice as much money into new ventures as have venture - capital funds .
In Europe business angels may be investing between € 10 billion and € 20 billion each year , thinks Mr Mason .
He estimates there are as many as 40,000 business angels in Britain alone .
The angels ' distant origins are on display in Mel Brooks 's comedy “ The Producers ” .
In the 1920s Broadway executives sought people like the little old ladies in the film to back their shaky new stage productions .
In return , these backers — and here imagine a greenroom thick with endearments like “ darling ” and “ angel ” — could expect to rub shoulders with the stars at post - production parties .
Rarely would they get their money back .
Where VCs fear to tread
Just as theatrical angels are now less star - struck , so business angels tend to be highly professional .
Many are successful entrepreneurs in their own right .
Others are well - paid managers or professionals who have specialist knowledge of an industry .
Like most rich people , they prize anonymity and do not broadcast their activities , which can make them as hard to dig out as the details of their successes .
And they do expect success .
Typically , a business angel is willing to invest between $ 25,000 and $ 250,000 in each of between five and ten new ventures .
They expect to make money from the spread of investments , but Mr Sohl believes they also seek “ psychic income ” .
Angels want the satisfaction of putting their commercial acumen , contacts and practical knowledge to work on behalf of talented people whom they like .
Such sentiment may explain why professional venture capitalists can often be critical of business angels .
“ Angels usually overvalue businesses .
This makes it difficult for us to come in later on , ” says one .
Another adds : “ Angels interfere in businesses , particularly in Britain where they have less experience . ”
Mr Sohl agrees that there can be problems , cautioning would - be entrepreneurs to make careful inquiries into any prospective investors .
“ Finding out about your investors before you sign them up is critical , ” he says .
“ And you have to understand what everybody wants from the business .
It 's a marriage without the possibility of divorce .
If you can't make it work , bankruptcy is the only alternative . ”
Sentiment also helps explain the differences between angels and venture - capital firms .
The managers of venture - capital funds take an almost - universal fee of “ two and 20 ” ; a 2 % annual management fee and up to 20 % of any profits made by their funds .
Angel investors set their own terms .
Despite the potential for acrimony , business angels and venture capitalists have to work together .
Angels are an important source of deals for the bigger funds .
In America , according to one estimate , angels introduce about two - fifths of the new investment opportunities seen by venture - capital firms .
Raising money will never be easy for the kind of new business that exists only on paper .
Skype was no exception .
Some 20 venture - capital firms are said to have refused to finance it in its early days .
Many of these were sceptical about its business plan .
Not only was the company setting out to take on the trillion - dollar telecoms industry , but its founders also bore the taint of litigation .
In 2001 Skype 's founders had set up Kazaa , an online file - sharing service that enabled people to download music from each other 's computers — to the great irritation of copyright holders .
Litigation is just one of the things the big venture - capital funds now have to worry about .
In the 1980s most funds were only worth $ 10 m - 20 m .
Today , most funds are worth more than $ 100 m .
The firms have to do a lot of work before investing .
Because they owe fiduciary duties to their own investors , they must delve deeply into whether a new idea can work , the people behind it and whether there is a market for it .
They must draw up contracts to allocate any profits and what will happen if anything goes wrong .
These complex arrangements contain a baffling array of “ liquidation preferences ” , “ redemption rights ” , “ anti-dilution protection ” and other jargon .
Few smaller investments justify all this paper work .
Another reason to avoid the smallest deals is that they promise lower overall profits than more mature ones do .
According to the European Private Equity and Venture Capital Association , investments in “ early stage ” European ventures have in total made no money for their investors over the past 20 years , whereas later - stage ventures have provided 6 % annual returns .
Those totals , of course , contain a great many failures and a few big successes .
Nevertheless , the record gives yet more reason for bigger funds to seek to avoid fledgling companies — especially those that have not yet put together a complete team of managers and so require extra attention .
Some entrepreneurs whose investment needs fall somewhere between venture - capital and angels can play one off against the other .
But the market can be confusing .
Venture - capital firms are often demanding , setting ambitious commercial objectives — milestones , as they are known — and complex provisions to protect the value of their shares .
If things do not go according to plan , company founders can quickly end up losing their voting rights and even their jobs .
Besides offering entrepreneurs easier terms , angel investors have their own strengths and weaknesses .
Sometimes , in fields where they have experience , they can advise managers on the nitty - gritty just as well as a venture - capital firm would .
They may even have more time and patience to offer .
Their informality has its benefits , too .
“ The entrepreneur 's life is a lonely one , ” Mr Mason observes .
“ His wife will leave , his employees will look for other jobs and his bank manager will repossess his house . ”
Besides giving practical help , an experienced angel might also provide much - needed encouragement in the inevitable hard times .
Angels can help young companies meet important new customers and recruit essential employees .
And , says one business founder , business angels can help negotiate better terms with the venture capitalists when the day comes to scale up even further .
How should entrepreneurs find an angel ?
What was once a hit - and - miss affair is becoming increasingly systematic .
Interest in investing in small businesses is growing among the wealthy , not least because of tax breaks that some countries offer .
Business angels have started to organise themselves into groups that can go out and develop contacts who will steer promising opportunities in their direction .
These new networks gather angels into quasi- professional investment syndicates , allowing investors to spread their risk and take part in bigger and sometimes more attractive opportunities without betting the bank .
Europe has perhaps as many as 200 networks already .
Some contain a handful of investors ; others have several hundred .
This more “ professional ” angel market is expected to bring with it specialisation and even brand recognition , thinks Mark Tluszcz , who is both an angel and a professional investor , as the managing partner of Mangrove Capital Partners , a Luxembourg - based venture - capital firm .
Mr Tluszcz believes that a small number of angels will eventually form a “ first tier ” in each industry , investing in a few specialist businesses .
The most promising entrepreneurs will probably seek out these investors first .
Any scheme they back will gain credibility at critical moments , such as when they are signing up the first big new customers or trying to lure a manager with valuable experience .
This rapidly evolving capital market even has its own award .
The first winner of a European angel prize sponsored by three European business schools and a number of financial institutions was the German - born Klaus Hommels .
A former manager at AOL , the “ Entrepreneurial Private Investor ” for 2006 has focused on how the internet can foster new markets , linking millions of consumers .
Luckily for Mr Hommels , investing came early .
He picked his first shares at 14 , when his grandmother gave him $ 20,000 to invest .
His portfolio has included several successes , notably Skype , and now he has interests in a handful of internet start - ups in China .
In addition to expecting his entrepreneurs to apply sensible commercial disciplines , such as knowing their market , Mr Hommels looks for obsession in the people he backs .
“ If you talk to them about vacations , they must always find a way to bring the conversation back to the business , ” he says .
One common European pitfall is that entrepreneurs too often think locally or nationally , but fail to grasp that there are much bigger opportunities afforded elsewhere .
Even a better - organised angel market — with or without awards — will still have its flaws .
Mr Sohl , of the University of New Hampshire , believes that some weaknesses have already started to surface in America .
He identifies a new , emerging “ secondary equity gap ” .
Loose networks of angel investors are beginning to codify the terms on which they can work together , such as by agreeing investment strategies and standardising investment terms .
That is sensible , because it makes it easier to do deals .
The trouble is that such angel syndicates may start to behave more like venture - capital firms .
This risks having two unwelcome effects .
One is that the syndicates will spurn smaller deals because of the cost of the paperwork .
This would be at the expense of the market for seed capital , which means more businesses could struggle to get off the ground .
Second , a more organised market could become more prone to the herd mentality that infected the venture - capital industry in the dotcom craze .
Wary since last year of a fresh outburst of exuberance , Mr Sohl now monitors the share of business plans in America that succeed in getting finance .
In the long run , he estimates that only 10 % of new ideas get enough money to set up .
However , in 2000 the proportion shot up to 25 % , before falling back to the teens during the bear market .
He frets that since 2004 the approval rate has steadily risen from 18 % to 23 % .
It is still rising .
This rise may reflect the increasing supply of capital as existing angels lend more and new angels join the throng .
Either way , some undeserving businesses are probably raising capital .
The value of nothing
It is all very well to talk in general terms about an overheating market .
But in any single deal how do the entrepreneur and the angel work out whether the price is right ?
As any corporate financier will privately admit , assessing the value of even an established business is more art than science .
When that business has rarely made a sale , let alone a profit , valuation becomes inspired guesswork .
David Beer runs a network that matches British entrepreneurs with prospective investors .
In 20 years of observing start - ups , he has developed a simple rule of thumb .
“ If it 's just an idea , it 's worth £ 10,000 ; if it has a credible management team in place , it might be worth £ 100,000 .
On the other hand , if it has sold something for real money to real customers , it could be worth £ 500,000 . ”
Another investor says that early stage capital is flowing too freely now .
He remarks that managers now “ think 30 pages of business plan are worth $ 5 m without a management team or even having made a penny in sales . ”
He believes that entrepreneurs have less humility than they once did .
“ You have to make these guys understand that they are better off with a smaller slice of a really big pie than owning most of a tiny business . ”
Although luck is a big part of finding the right opportunities , Anthony Clarke , president of the European Business Angel Network , offers further advice to budding angels .
He advises avoiding lone wolves and backing fully formed founding management teams instead .
The founders should show an innate ability to sell .
And they must have a one - track mind and the obsession to work 60 or 70 hours week in , week out .
Perhaps of greater importance in raising finance is what angel networks now call “ investor readiness ” .
Few entrepreneurs realise that most angels will decide whether or not to look at a business in depth after skimming a business plan for only a couple of minutes .
In spite of this , one commentator suggests that fully four - fifths of business plans put potential investors off , by being badly written or making implausible claims such as “ we have no competition ” .
Ultimately , the success of any new venture will depend on the desire of people with ideas to risk their careers and livelihoods on the promise of wealth and success .
According to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor , an annual report of enterprise , the proof of such animal spirits depends on the fear of failure and the example of successful entrepreneurs .
A survey on attitudes to entrepreneurship , sponsored by the European Commission , estimated that 26 % of Americans would refrain from starting a business because of the risk to income and career .
This share grows to 34 % in Britain and to 46 % in the European Union as a whole .
The European Business Angel Network says there is a social dimension to this disparate result .
Americans are surrounded by entrepreneurs who have “ cashed out ” and have lived through a full cycle of founding , cultivating and then selling their businesses only to start all over again .
Angels are more likely to put up their money if the person knocking on the gate has already worked out a heavenly exit route .
I may be the happiest computer - science teacher in the world : in less than three months , I will start teaching a whole new class called “ non-classical paradigms and languages ” .
The goal is to let students pursuing their masters degree discover and manipulate concepts that they have n’t had a chance to play with when using mainstream languages ( C , C* * , Java and Ada being the ones they have been taught so far ) .
I do not want my students to know every language on the earth .
However , I want them to be able to recognize that the problem they have in their hands could be more elegantly solved using continuations , or that embedding a Forth - like interpreter would make their program easier to test and extend .
Now comes the difficult part : what languages should I teach and what paradigms should I show ?
I have 60 hours at my disposal that I can freely dispatch between theory and practice .
Since I will be leaving tomorrow for one week , I thought it would be a good idea to let people comment , either publicly or privately , on some of the ideas I got so far .
The students already know C , C** and Java quite well , and most of them have already played with Ada , Lisp ( although only at a very basic level ) or Prolog .
Below you can find an HTML export of the Freemind map I used to structure my thoughts .
I did it in 10 minutes , so it is neither complete nor well organized .
Do not hesitate to throw in new ideas or languages .
The main constraint is that the students must be able to get the same environment at home as in the labs , meaning that a good Free Software implementation must exist ( and will be used in labs ) .
The only exception might be J if it gets included in the course as the language itself is very interesting ( and simpler to use than APL on modern machines ) , and a free ( gratis ) implementation exists and runs on most platforms .
It is a testament to the power of money that Nicholas Stern 's report should have swung the argument for drastic action , even before anyone has finished reading it .
He appears to have demonstrated what many of us suspected : that it would cost much less to prevent runaway climate change than to seek to live with it .
Useful as this finding is , I hope it does n't mean that the debate will now concentrate on money .
The principal costs of climate change will be measured in lives , not pounds .
As Stern reminded us yesterday , there would be a moral imperative to seek to prevent mass death even if the economic case did not stack up .
But at least almost everyone now agrees that we must act , if not at the necessary speed .
If we 're to have a high chance of preventing global temperatures from rising by 2C ( 3.6 F ) above preindustrial levels , we need , in the rich nations , a 90 % reduction in greenhouse - gas emissions by 2030 .
The greater part of the cut has to be made at the beginning of this period .
To see why , picture two graphs with time on the horizontal axis and the rate of emissions plotted vertically .
On one graph the line falls like a ski jump : a steep drop followed by a shallow tail .
On the other it falls like the trajectory of a bullet .
The area under each line represents the total volume of greenhouse gases produced in that period .
They fall to the same point by the same date , but far more gases have been produced in the second case , making runaway climate change more likely .
So how do we do it without bringing civilisation crashing down ?
Here is a plan for drastic but affordable action that the government could take .
It goes much further than the proposals discussed by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown yesterday , for the reason that this is what the science demands .
1 . Set a target for reducing greenhouse - gas emissions based on the latest science .
The government is using outdated figures , aiming for a 60 % reduction by 2050 .
Even the annual 3 % cut proposed in the early day motion calling for a new climate change bill does not go far enough .
Timescale : immediately .
2 . Use that target to set an annual carbon cap , which falls on the ski-jump trajectory .
Then use the cap to set a personal carbon ration .
Every citizen is given a free annual quota of carbon dioxide .
He or she spends it by buying gas and electricity , petrol and train and plane tickets .
If they run out , they must buy the rest from someone who has used less than his or her quota .
This accounts for about 40 % of the carbon dioxide we produce .
The remainder is auctioned off to companies .
It 's a simpler and fairer approach than either green taxation or the EU 's emissions trading scheme , and it also provides people with a powerful incentive to demand low - carbon technologies .
Timescale : a full scheme in place by January 2009 .
3 . Introduce a new set of building regulations , with three objectives .
A. Imposing strict energy - efficiency requirements on all major refurbishments ( costing £ 3,000 or more ) .
Timescale : in force by June 2007 .
B. Obliging landlords to bring their houses up to high energy - efficiency standards before they can rent them out .
Timescale : to cover all new rentals from January 2008 .
C. Ensuring that all new homes in the UK are built to the German Passivhaus standard ( which requires no heating system ) .
Timescale : in force by 2012 .
4 . Ban the sale of incandescent lightbulbs , patio heaters , garden floodlights and other wasteful and unnecessary technologies .
Introduce a stiff " feebate " system for all electronic goods sold in the UK , with the least efficient taxed heavily and the most efficient receiving tax discounts .
Every year the standards in each category rise .
Timescale : fully implemented by November 2007 .
5 . Redeploy money now earmarked for new nuclear missiles towards a massive investment in energy generation and distribution .
Two schemes in particular require government support to make them commercially viable : very large wind farms , many miles offshore , connected to the grid with high - voltage direct - current cables ; and a hydrogen pipeline network to take over from the natural gas grid as the primary means of delivering fuel for home heating .
Timescale : both programmes commence at the end of 2007 and are completed by 2018 .
6. Promote the development of a new national coach network .
City - centre coach stations are shut down and moved to motorway junctions .
Urban public transport networks are extended to meet them .
The coaches travel on dedicated lanes and never leave the motorways .
Journeys by public transport then become as fast as journeys by car , while saving 90 % of emissions .
It is self - financing , through the sale of the land now used for coach stations .
Timescale : commences in 2008 ; completed by 2020 .
7 . Oblige all chains of filling stations to supply leasable electric car batteries .
This provides electric cars with unlimited mileage : as the battery runs down , you pull into a forecourt ; a crane lifts it out and drops in a fresh one .
The batteries are charged overnight with surplus electricity from offshore wind farms .
Timescale : fully operational by 2011 .
8. Abandon the road - building and road - widening programme , and spend the money on tackling climate change .
The government has earmarked £ 11.4 bn for road expansion .
It claims to be allocating just £ 545 m a year to " spending policies that tackle climate change " .
Timescale : immediately .
9. Freeze and then reduce UK airport capacity .
While capacity remains high there will be constant upward pressure on any scheme the government introduces to limit flights .
We need a freeze on all new airport construction and the introduction of a national quota for landing slots , to be reduced by 90 % by 2030 .
Timescale : immediately .
10 . Legislate for the closure of all out - of - town superstores , and their replacement with a warehouse and delivery system .
Shops use a staggering amount of energy ( six times as much electricity per square metre as factories , for example ) , and major reductions are hard to achieve : Tesco's " state of the art " energy - saving store at Diss in Norfolk has managed to cut its energy use by only 20 % .
Warehouses containing the same quantity of goods use roughly 5 % of the energy .
Out - of - town shops are also hardwired to the car - delivery vehicles use 70 % less fuel .
Timescale : fully implemented by 2012 .
These timescales might seem extraordinarily ambitious .
They are , by contrast to the current glacial pace of change .
But when the US entered the second world war it turned the economy around on a sixpence .
Carmakers began producing aircraft and missiles within a year , and amphibious vehicles in 90 days , from a standing start .
And that was 65 years ago .
If we want this to happen , we can make it happen .
It will require more economic intervention than we are used to , and some pretty brutal emergency planning policies ( with little time or scope for objections ) .
But if you believe that these are worse than mass death then there is something wrong with your value system .
Climate change is not just a moral question : it is the moral question of the 21st century .
There is one position even more morally culpable than denial .
That is to accept that it 's happening and that its results will be catastrophic , but to fail to take the measures needed to prevent it .

Behind the resveratrol test is a considerable degree of scientific theory , some of it well established and some yet to be proved .
Dr. Sinclair ’s initial interest in resveratrol had nothing to do with red wine .
It derived from work by Leonard Guarente of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , who in 1995 found a gene that controlled the longevity of yeast , a single - celled fungus .
Dr. Guarente and Dr. Sinclair , who had come from Australia to work as a post - doctoral student in Dr. Guarente ’s lab , discovered the mechanism by which the gene makes yeast cells live longer .
The gene is known as sir - 2 in yeast , sir standing for silent information regulator , and its equivalent in mice is called SIRT - 1 .
Dr. Guarente then found that the gene ’s protein needs a common metabolite to activate it and he developed the theory that the gene , by sensing the level of metabolic activity , mediates a phenomenon of great interest to researchers in aging , the greater life span caused by caloric restriction .
Researchers have known since 1935 that mice fed a calorically restricted diet — one with all necessary vitamins and nutrients but 40 percent fewer calories — live up to 50 percent longer than mice on ordinary diets .
This low - calorie - provoked increase in longevity occurs in many organisms and seems to be an ancient survival strategy .
When food is plentiful , live in the fast lane and breed prolifically .
When famine strikes , switch resources to body maintenance and live longer so as to ride out the famine .
Researchers had long supposed that the increase in longevity was a passive phenomenon : during famine or on a low - calorie diet , organisms would have lower metabolism and produce less of the violent chemicals that oxidize tissues .
But Dr. Guarente and Dr. Sinclair believed that longer life was attained by an active program that triggered specific protective steps against the diseases common in old age .
It was because these diseases were averted in calorie restriction , they believed , that animals lived longer .
Most people find it impossible to keep to a diet with 40 percent fewer calories than usual .
So if caloric restriction really does make people as well as mice live longer — which is plausible but not yet proved — it would be desirable to have some drug that activated the SIRT - 1 gene ’s protein , tricking it into thinking that days of famine lay ahead .
In 2003 Dr. Sinclair , by then in his own lab , devised a way to test a large number of chemicals for their ability to mimic caloric restriction in people by activating SIRT - 1 .
The champion was resveratrol , already well known for its possible health benefits .
Children growing up in the United Kingdom suffer greater deprivation , worse relationships with their parents and are exposed to more risks from alcohol , drugs and unsafe sex than those in any other wealthy country in the world , according to a study from the United Nations .
The UK is bottom of the league of 21 economically advanced countries according to a " report card " ' put together by Unicef on the wellbeing of children and adolescents , trailing the United States which comes second to last .
Today 's findings will be a blow to the government , which has set great store by lifting children out of poverty and improving their education and prospects .
Al Aynsley Green , the children 's commissioner for England , acknowledges that the UN has accurately highlighted the troubled lives of children .
" There is a crisis at the heart of our society and we must not continue to ignore the impact of our attitudes towards children and young people and the effect that this has on their wellbeing , " he says in a response today .
" I hope this report will prompt us all to look beyond the statistics and to the underlying causes of our failure to nurture happy and healthy children in the UK .
These children represent the future of our country and from the findings of this report they are in poor health , unable to maintain loving and successful relationships , feel unsafe and insecure , have low aspirations and put themselves at risk .
" It is time to stop demonising children and young people for what goes wrong and start supporting them to make positive choices .
To bring an end to the confusing messages we give to young people about their role , responsibility and position in society and ensure that every child feels valued and has their rights respected . "
The Unicef team assessed the treatment of children in six different areas - material wellbeing ; health and safety ; educational wellbeing , family and peer relationships , behaviours and risks ; and the young people 's own perceptions of their wellbeing .
The Netherlands tops the league , followed by Sweden , Denmark , Finland and Spain .
The bottom five are Portugal , Austria , Hungary , the US and the UK .
Nine countries , all of them in northern Europe , have brought child poverty down below 10 % , the report shows .
But it remains at 15 % in the three southern European countries - Portugal , Spain and Italy - and in the UK , Ireland and the US .
Child poverty is a relative measure that shows how far their standard of living has fallen below the national average .
The Unicef report adds : " The evidence from many countries persistently shows that children who grow up in poverty are more vulnerable : specifically , they are more likely to be in poor health , to have learning and behavioural difficulties , to underachieve at school , to become pregnant at too early an age , to have lower skills and aspirations , to be low paid , unemployed and welfare - dependent . "
The Conservatives seized on the report , claiming that it endorsed their attack on the way in which Gordon Brown had addressed the issue of child poverty , and the prime minister had demonised the role of children in his drive against antisocial behaviour .
The shadow chancellor , George Osborne , said : " This report tells the truth about Brown 's Britain .
After 10 years of his welfare and education policies , our children today have the lowest wellbeing in the developed world . "
Labour said it had taken 700,000 people out of child poverty and was mounting an unprecedented investment programme in a network of children 's centres .
A government spokesman argued that in many cases the data use d in the report was several years old and " does not reflect more recent improvements in the UK such as the continuing fall in the teenage pregnancy rate or in the proportion of children living in workless households " .
Some of the most shocking findings concern the relationships children and adolescents have with their family and peers .
The UK is bottom of the 21 countries .
This , says Unicef , " is as difficult to measure as it is critical to wellbeing " .
To attempt to score countries , the experts have focused on children 's own reports of how much time their parents spend " just talking " to them , how many say they eat the main meal of the day with their parents more than once a week and the percentages of 11 , 13 and 15 - year - olds who find their peers " kind and helpful " .
UK parents do reasonably well on " talking regularly " - 60 % of children say they chat , putting Britain 12th in the league table .
But while a similar proportion say they eat together more than once a week , the UK lags towards the bottom of the league , with Italy , Iceland and France at the very top end .
The report presents a sad picture of relationships with friends , which are so important to children .
Not much more than 40 % of the UK's 11 , 13 and 15 - year - olds find their peers " kind and helpful " , which is the worst score of all the developed countries .
The UK takes bottom place " by a considerable distance " for the number of young people who smoke , abuse drink and drugs , engage in risky sex and become pregnant at too early an age .
For 16 out of 17 OECD countries with the data , between 15 % and 28 % of young people have had sex by the age of 15 .
For the UK , the figure is 40 % .
On education , the UK comes 17th out of 21 .
At the age of 15 , British children score relatively well on reading , mathematical and scientific literacy .
But more than 30 % of 15 - to 19 - year - olds are not in education or training and are not looking beyond low - skilled work .
Eight RH - 53D Sea Stallion transport helicopters lift off in twilight from the nuclear - powered aircraft carrier USS Nimitz in the Gulf of Oman , bound for a makeshift airstrip 600 miles away in the middle of Iran 's Dasht - e - Kavir desert .
Their clandestine mission , Operation Eagle Claw , is to rescue 53 Americans held hostage in the US embassy in Tehran .
At the airstrip , codenamed Desert One , six bumblebee - shaped C - 130 Hercules transport planes wait to refuel the Sea Stallions .
The helicopters are there to carry Delta Force commandos 270 miles to a staging area in the mountains outside Tehran , then raid the embassy the next night .
The mission can't proceed any faster .
The Vietnam - era Sea Stallions have limited range and cannot refuel in - air .
The helicopters enter Iranian airspace below 200 feet to avoid radar detection .
Somewhere over the desert , they get trapped in a large haboob , a storm of dust as fine as talc .
Visibility drops to near zero .
One Sea Stallion drops out after a warning light flashes .
A second reports gyro failure and turns back .
A third loses its hydraulic pump .
Only five fully functioning helicopters reach the airstrip .
Concerned that the mission is too hobbled to succeed , President Carter orders the team to abort .
As the aircraft prepare to evacuate , one Sea Stallion shifts position on the airstrip to allow a C - 130 to take off .
The pilot lifts off , banks left , and loses his bearings in a welter of dust and downwash .
He banks back to the right and collides with the C - 130 , his rotors slicing into the transport plane 's fuselage .
Both aircraft burst into flames ; eight servicemen die .
The fiasco at Desert One in 1980 highlighted the Pentagon 's need to replace its antiquated fleet of transport helicopters .
The Sea Stallion and its 1960s - era cousin , the CH - 46 Sea Knight , were too slow and , in their old age , had become maintenance nightmares and safety hazards .
Incoming Navy secretary John Lehman , a pilot during the Vietnam War , thought he had an answer .
When he was working for Henry Kissinger on the National Security Council in the 1970s , he saw photographs of a curious - looking experimental aircraft called the XV - 15 .
It was a tilt - rotor hybrid – equal parts helicopter and plane , able to take off vertically and hover like a helo and then swivel its tilt - rotor pods ( called nacelles ) forward to fly like a traditional fixed wing .

After President Reagan put Lehman in charge of the Navy in 1981 , Lehman traveled to the Paris Air Show to see the XV - 15 in action .
It was n't as cool as , say , the British short - takeoff / vertical - landing Harrier jump jet .
In fact , it did n't look remotely aerodynamic – more like a moving van stuck between two 38 - foot - wide windmills .
But Lehman was smitten .
" It was very easy to fly , " he says , " far more stable than a traditional helicopter , and simpler and safer than a Harrier .
I was convinced it was what we needed . "
Lehman pushed the plane through the Navy 's acquisition process .
In 1983 , the Navy awarded Bell Helicopters and Boeing Aircraft a $ 68.7 million joint contract to design an aircraft based on the XV - 15 .
This was the V - 22 , nicknamed the Osprey .
It would carry two dozen geared - up marines or 10,000 pounds of weaponry , fly 2,100 nautical miles at 25,000 feet with just a single , in - air refueling , and land anywhere , no runway required .
At least , that was the theory .
It 's been 22 years , and the skies are n't exactly crowded with Ospreys .
After more than two decades and $ 16.4 billion , the history of the V - 22 is a sorry tale of cost overruns , shoddy construction , and managerial incompetence .
Thirty people have died in four Osprey crashes , making the V - 22 one of the killingest experimental planes ever .
The program has teetered on the brink of elimination since almost the beginning .
But it never went away , propped up by genuine need , pork barrel politics , and the hope that the money already spent was n't money wasted .
Now the weird hybrid plane has entered a critical test phase called operational evaluation – the last hurdle before full production .
The Osprey made it to op - eval once before , five years ago , and failed spectacularly .
After an intense few years of engineering and test flights , years of tearing the plane apart and putting it back together under a fix - it - or - kill - it threat from the Pentagon , the Osprey is back .
At military bases across the country , from New River Marine Corps Air Base in North Carolina to Edwards Air Force Base in California , pilots and engineers are testing the plane under combat conditions : extreme heat and cold , desert sand , high - altitude flying , aircraft carrier takeoffs .
If all goes well , the evaluation will end in July and construction of the fleet will begin in 2006 , and the first Osprey squadron will fly in fall 2007 .
The Pentagon is confident it has a winner .
The engineers and pilots believe they have solved the problems , both technological and organizational , that made the Osprey seem like little more than a deadly boondoggle .
The Marine Corps has already ordered 360 Ospreys .
The Air Force Special Forces is in for 50 , and the Navy for 48 .
Sticker price : roughly $ 73 million apiece ( GlobalSecurity.org , a defense consulting group , estimates the figure is really more like $ 105 million ) .
" The Sea Knight can fly marines 50 miles from ship to beach , where the enemy is generally waiting , " says Marine lieutenant colonel Kevin Gross , a manager on the Osprey team and the program 's former flight test director .
" With the Osprey , we 'll be able to carry them past the beach , around the threat , around the weather , across any terrain , to where the enemy is weakest , where we can dictate the battle . "
The V - 22 barely survived the 1990s .
The cold war was over , terrorism was a distant threat , and military spending was under scrutiny .
When the Osprey budget ballooned from a projected $ 2.5 billion in 1986 to $ 30 billion in 1988 without a single test flight , defense secretary Dick Cheney tried to zero out the funding .
Congress , not the Pentagon , kept the budget at the minimum level .
The plane finally flew in 1989 , and two years later it had its first crash .
On June 11 , 1991 , an Osprey prototype hovering in helicopter mode – about 15 feet off the ground – wobbled .
The left nacelle hit the runway and the plane dropped , bounced a few hundred feet , and burst into flames .
The two pilots aboard sustained minor injuries in the accident , which investigators traced to incorrect wiring in a flight control system .
A second crash a year later generated more attention .
At Quantico Marine Air Base , in a special ceremony designed to win congressional support , an Osprey was supposed to roar over the airfield like a military jet , then dramatically drop to the tarmac in helicopter mode .
But as members of Congress and government officials watched , the aircraft 's right engine caught fire .
The plane plunged 500 feet into the Potomac River , killing all seven marines aboard .
The program was grounded for 11 months .
The Navy 's investigation blamed a leak of gearbox fluid from the right nacelle into the engine .
For almost a decade , the program limped along , overbudget and behind schedule .
Then , in April 2000 , a third aircraft crashed , killing 19 marines – the worst military flight accident since a Marine jet sliced through a ski gondola cable in the Italian Alps in 1998 , killing 20 .
The plane , which had taken off from Yuma Marine Corps Air Station , was bound for Marana Northwest Regional Airport near Tucson , Arizona .
Flying in tandem with a second Osprey , its mission was to load passengers in Yuma – a simulation of a rescue from , say , an overseas embassy – and fly them to safety .
The lead Osprey approached the Marana airport about 2,000 feet too high , but rather than circle to shed altitude , the pilot decided to land .
He descended dangerously fast , hitting the runway hard .
The second aircraft , with a crew of 4 plus 15 fully outfitted marines on board , followed the lead plane and came down even faster – more than 2,000 feet per minute going just under 45 miles per hour .
At 245 feet above the ground , the Osprey lost lift in its right rotor , stalled , and rolled over before it could issue a mayday .
It crashed and exploded , killing everyone aboard .
The accident was attributed to a little - understood flight phenomenon called vortex ring state , or VRS , in which a helicopter descending rapidly at low forward speed drops into its own turbulence .
Its rotors lose their grip on the air , and the bird drops out of the sky .
That news especially shook the Osprey community – it suggested that the plane might be fundamentally flawed .
One squadron member reportedly turned in his wings .
The program took another hit on the ground .
Odin Leberman , then a lieutenant colonel and the Osprey squadron commander at New River , ordered marines in his command to falsify Osprey maintenance records .
He did it to make the plane appear more reliable than it was , to increase its chances of winning new funding .
" We need to lie or manipulate the data , or however you wanna call it , " he said in a meeting .
A maintenance crew member was secretly running a tape .
Leberman was later relieved of duty .
Then , on December 11 , 2000 , another Osprey went down .
Its crew was practicing instrument approach landings at night , and the plane fell 1,600 feet into a boggy forest near the New River base ; all four marines aboard died .
One of the nacelles had a catastrophic leak in the hydraulic system , and to compensate , the pilot hit a systems - reset button .
Nothing happened .
He hit it again .
And again , at least eight times .
Later , investigators found a glitch in the aircraft 's software .
Each press of the button had , for some reason , caused the plane to decelerate , making an accident even more inevitable .
On December 12 , 2000 , the V - 22 was grounded indefinitely .
The Osprey had reached a crisis .
Several engineers transferred to other aircraft projects .
The program manager left .
The chief engineer was promoted off the project .
A new regime at the Pentagon was demanding that the plane get fixed in two years or get canceled .
The entire culture of Osprey - making had to be fixed , and a series of significant technological problems had to be solved – fast .
Around Christmas of 2000 , Ken Baile was offered the assistant chief engineer position .
He hesitated .
" I talked to my wife , I talked to my dad .
I asked myself :
Is this plane dependent on some technology that can never work ?
Do I want to associate my career with this ?
I talked to a lot of the engineers who'd remained .
I read the reports .
I took the job because I was satisfied the Osprey 's technology was sound . "
Under the weight of a stack of accident reports and assessments from the Pentagon , other government agencies , and various independent commissions , Air Force colonel Craig Olson , the new program manager for the military , set out to change Osprey Country ( the flyboys ' nickname for the test center at Patuxent River Naval Air Base ) .
Olson realized that engineers had been in too much of a hurry , pressured by Defense higher - ups and Congress .
" Before 2001 , we were schedule - driven , " he says .
" Meeting a funding deadline was more important than making sure we 'd done all the testing we could . "
Evidence of that permeated the program .
A Navy investigation following the 1992 crash found that a warning light had flashed in the Osprey 's cockpit shortly after takeoff from Florida 's Elgin Air Force Base .
Yet the pilot kept going .
He skipped a stop in Charlotte , North Carolina , under pressure from command not to be late to the fundraising ceremony at Quantico .
After the Marana crash , a GAO report revealed that in 1997 and 1998 , with pressure mounting to get the Osprey on budget and on schedule , program officials eliminated 70 of 103 planned tests , including rapid descent while carrying a full load .
At a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing after the New River crash , program managers admitted they 'd known about the hydraulic leak problem for six months .
They had n't corrected it , they testified , because an important funding deadline was approaching and the plane could n't afford to fall any further behind schedule .
That pattern of eliminating flight tests to stay on schedule worried no one more than the test pilots , who already felt their concerns were being ignored .
" I remember one time our onboard primary mission computers were failing , and we'd have a black cockpit for 8 or 12 seconds before the software recognized the problem and the backup kicked in , " says Gross , the former flight test director .
" That 's too long to go with no cockpit displays , not knowing our air state .
When we wrote it up in our deficiency reports , the program office got extremely angry and frustrated with us .
They did n't want us slowing down the program because of unfavorable reports . "
But the increased scrutiny from Congress and the media after the last crash scared Pax River straight .
" I think another crash would shut us down , " Olson says .
" People now actually read my flight test reports , " says Steve Grohsmeyer , an Osprey test pilot .
" Shortcuts do n't happen anymore . "
As a result of the culture changes – and with the Pentagon 's 2003 deadline looming – the Osprey engineers dived back into their technology .
Armed with the conclusions from a decade of reports and analyses , they set out to correct the failures behind each of the four crashes .
The first one , in 1991 , was relatively easy .
A flight control system had been miswired , and the engineers and mechanics fixed it soon after the accident .
Crash number two , a year later , was tragic – seven marines killed in front of an audience – but the pilot knew he had an engine problem .
Under pressure to get to his destination , he 'd simply ignored the warning light .
A more safety - minded , less time - crunched culture would make sure that kind of thing did n't happen anymore .
More important , the nacelle was redesigned to prevent fluids from pooling – eliminating a potential fire hazard .
The third and fourth accidents , though , were trickier .
Even two years after the third Osprey went down , pilots and designers worried about the mysterious aerodynamic problem of vortex ring state .
The problem was that nobody knew much about VRS .
When airplane wings or helicopter rotor blades cut through the air , they create a region of low pressure above them and high pressure below .
That differential creates lift , but maintaining it depends on the smooth flow of air over both surfaces .
Spinning helicopter blades turn the air beneath that high - pressure zone into chop – drop into that turbulence and the air stops sticking to the blades .
The prop stops pushing , and the bird stops flying .
Lead test pilot Tom MacDonald of Boeing was assigned the VRS problem .
" It was this mystery area , " he says .
" So little research had been done on it .
People wondered : Would it swallow planes alive ? "
MacDonald and the engineers worked out a system .
He 'd take the plane to 10,000 feet , putting enough air between him and the ground so he'd be able to recover if he got into trouble .
Then he'd pull the nacelles back until they were almost vertical , in helicopter conformation , slow his forward airspeed , and try to induce VRS .
" We 'd fly all day long , " says Gross , copilot on a few of the test runs .
" We 'd fall 2,000 or 3,000 feet and recover .
We 'd fly back up to 10,000 feet , repeat the exercise at 1,000 feet per minute , then 1,500 , then 2,000 , all the way up to 5,000 feet per minute .
Then we'd do it again , this time changing our airspeed . "
( A typical rate of descent for a 747 passenger jet on runway approach is 700 to 800 feet per minute . )
In the process MacDonald , a former Marine pilot , quadrupled the published knowledge base on VRS .
What he found was that vortex ring state is surprisingly hard to induce .
He had to fly slower than 40 knots while keeping the plane in a steady position for at least five seconds , and then descend at a hot 2,200 feet per minute .
He also found that in an Osprey , he could recover from the condition relatively easily , provided he had 2,000 feet of altitude to play with .
In the end , the team did n't alter the aircraft .
Solution : Install a simple warning system .
When a pilot pushes an Osprey toward VRS , a light flashes in the cockpit and a voice cautions , " Sink rate . "
And Osprey pilots now know to pay attention to those warnings .
The hydraulic leaks that had plagued the Osprey – and caused the last crash – required an entirely different kind of problem - solving .
Engineers on the ground would have to rip the engines apart and start over .
The investigation into the 2001 accident showed that a tangle of tubes in a nacelle had chafed against a main hydraulics line .
Chafing had been a problem for years ; the titanium hydraulic tubes are ultralightweight but brittle and relatively fragile .
The solution seemed obvious : Rejigger the plane 's hundreds of feet of hydraulic lines so none of them touch .
But that meant remodeling the guts of the nacelles , finding new space for fuel and electrical lines as well .
" The technology was n't in question , " says Don Courson , the lead hydraulic engineer .
" It was more of a design issue . "
So Courson 's team stripped a nacelle down to its frame and panels .
Then , system by system , they started replacing parts – the prop rotor gearbox , the tilt axis mechanism , the engine .
Finally , they redesigned and reinstalled the hydraulics lines .
Line clearance is n't a common mechanical problem .
Pop the hood of a car and you 'll find bundles of wires everywhere .
The Osprey is unique because the nacelles shift and rotate , pulling lines taut and causing them to rub against adjacent surfaces .
To be safe , the engineers decided that all hydraulic lines would have a half - inch of clearance .
That 's not easy to design or build .
" Imagine a million - piece jigsaw puzzle , " Courson says .
To make sure they 'd solved that puzzle , they put the test plane back together and flew it for five hours .
Then they took it apart again and checked the lines .
No problem .
They reassembled it and flew it for 10 hours .
Took it apart .
Checked the lines .
Once they got up to 35 flight hours with no chafing and no leaks , they knew they had it right .
But the hydraulic leak was n't the only problem in the fourth crash .
Control software had warned the pilot of a problem , but it had n't told him what to do about it – in fact , the pilot 's attempts to get the aircraft under control had made things worse .
" That was a little unnerving , " Grohsmeyer says .
" The last thing a pilot wants is to feel he 's lost control of his plane . "
There were thousands of lines of code , and weak spots could surface anywhere .
Baile 's team created what they called a Triple Lab .
It consisted of a flight simulator , every bit of software installed in an Osprey , and a full hydraulics system to power it all .
They spent a year in the Triple Lab , with a test pilot , letting their minds run wild .
" We imagined every conceivable systems failure , " Baile says .
The first glitch they tried to induce was the one that caused crash number four .
The accident report said that a warning light had confused the pilot about the nature of the problem .
And the flight manual had n't explained what the light meant either .
In the end , the engineers rewrote the software that set off the warning , and they fixed the bug that caused the Osprey 's catastrophic deceleration before the crash .
They changed a majority of the existing code and improved cockpit displays .
" We wanted to remove all ambiguity , to make sure the pilot would know what and where the trouble was , " Baile says .
On an April morning 25 years after the disastrous mission in Iran , a V - 22 taxis to a grass strip between two runways at Pax River .
It 's one of the base 's seven Ospreys , gearing up for a test run .
Covered in primer paint , its Marine Corps insignia barely visible , the craft looks characteristically awkward .
From 75 yards away , I see an airman give a hand signal .
The plane 's twin Rolls - Royce engines rev , generating a backwash so powerful that my sunglasses fly off .
The two dozen flight engineers in the blockhouse - like building behind me are spared the windstorm ; they 're all staring at computers , reading telemetry .
The Osprey 's rotors , pointing upward , dig into the air with an earsplitting thrum .
The 16.5 - ton aircraft rises to 15 feet .
It floats for half a minute , then tilts its rotors and slides 300 feet to the right .
Then to the left .
The three - man crew is checking tolerances at low hover .
" See how smooth it flies ? " says Scott Trail , shouting over the prop noise .
Trail , a major in the Marines , is one of a dozen test pilots on the Osprey , and , like MacDonald , he 's a big fan .
Three years ago he flew troops into Afghanistan in Sea Knights , the Vietnam - era transport helicopter .
Twice as old as most of the guys on board , the Sea Knights were so creaky that Trail could carry only eight passengers at a time ( even though the chopper has seats for 24 ) .
" Watch this , " he says .
The Osprey starts to move forward , gathering speed like a dragster tearing down the track .
The nacelles start to rotate forward – 10 degrees , 30 , 70 , 90 – until the helicopter has morphed into an airplane and is roaring at 290 miles per hour .
In 15 seconds the conversion is complete .
The plane shoots skyward and disappears over the horizon .
That was one of many tests the Osprey will have to pass .
Right now , at air bases around the US , V - 22s are performing similar – and more complicated – maneuvers , all part of the op -eval cycle .
Even if everything works , the plane faces one last hurdle : Congress can still say no .
Depending on the economy , the military 's needs , political pressures , and concerns about deficit spending , Congress may balk at the program 's final cost .
" There 's a limit to our resources .
You have to decide on priorities , " explains Representative Mark Udall ( D - Colorado ) , a member of the House Armed Services Committee , who says he plans to vote to continue funding the planes .
Some of the biggest believers are those who started the program .
" The fact is , we have an airplane that will save a lot of lives and give us a lot of capabilities we do n't currently have , " says Lehman , the former Navy secretary who funded the project back in 1983 .
" When I look at the aircraft , I think of how useful it would have been in Afghanistan and Iraq .
That 's why the military wo n't give it up . "
Mike Lieberman , a military affairs aide on the House Armed Services Committee , has a more pragmatic view : " My God , we 've thrown so much money at it , we have to get something out of it . "
The V - 22 Osprey : A Crash Course
Planned as a medium - range troop transport craft with unprecedented speed and flexibility , the V - 22 became the plane that could n't get ( and stay ) off the ground .
The latest operation - evalution period ends this summer .
Here 's a look at how the Osprey is supposed to work – and four tragic times it did n't .
1. June 11 , 1991 : Miswired flight control system .
Left nacelle hits the ground .
Two injuries .
2. July 20 , 1992 : Gearbox fluid leak leads to a fire in the right nacelle .
The plane crashes in front of a VIP audience .
Seven deaths .
3. April 8 , 2000 : Rapidly descending plane stalls and crashes .
Engineers suspect the rotors lost lift .
Nineteen deaths .
4. December 11 , 2000 : Hydraulic leak cripples an engine ; a bug in the pilot 's control software slows the plane further .
Four killed .
SPECS Length : 57 feet Wingspan : 46 feet Weight : 33,140 pounds Cruising airspeed : 288-345 miles per hour Maximum altitude : 25,000 feet Range ( with maximum payload ) : 360 miles Crew : 3 ( pilot , copilot , crew chief )
Capacity : 24 fully loaded troops , plus crew
With its nacelles pointed up , the Osprey flies like a helicopter .
When they 're positioned horizontally , the rotors act like traditional airplane propellers .

I get a lot of interesting letters in the mail .
( To those of you who send me things , I apologize that I so rarely respond .
If you want to hear from me , your odds are better — but still not great — on email . )
I got a package recently , however , that really stood out .
It came from a Texas woman named M.R. Stewart , who is a proud mother , as well as being grandmother to four pit bulls .
Ms. Stewart has an unusual hobby : clipping newspaper articles of a particular ilk .
She sent me copies of her most recent finds .
All of these clippings were from her local newspaper , from February 2006 to the present .
The articles had two things in common : ( 1 ) all of them were stories reporting on crimes , and ( 2 ) the perpetrator ’s middle name was “ Wayne . ”
I have to say I was stunned by the number of examples she sent me ; in order to protect the potentially innocent , I will obscure their last names :
Eric Wayne XXXXXX — sex charges
Nathan Wayne XXXXXX — kidnapping and beating , homicide
Ronald Wayne XXXXXX — triple homicide
David Wayne XXXXXX — 10 years for practicing nursing without a license
Larry Wayne XXXXXX — homicide

Charles Wayne XXXXXX — homicide
Maybe you could assemble a list this impressive for some other middle name , but I doubt it .
Of course , these folks are following the path set for them by the notorious Chicago serial killer John Wayne Gacy , Jr .
( She also collects clippings with middle names that rhyme with Wayne … she sent me 4 DeWaynes , 4 Duanes , and 2 Dwaynes . )
After going through the package , I pulled my two oldest daughters aside ( they are six ) and told them they were not allowed to ever have a boyfriend with the middle name “ Wayne . ”
Olivia , who is obsessed with a boy named Thomas in her class , is going to check on his middle name tomorrow .

They ’re not prisoners , they ’re “ detainees . ”
It sounds better , as if they ’re merely inconvenienced rather than shoehorned into cinderblock cells , thumbing their military - issued Korans and waiting to be interrogated .
One - third are innocents caught up in sweeps ; one - third are jihadists who will slit your throat , and one - third are opportunists who will rat out their neighbors .
You will hold them for 14 days , no more , while the interrogators try to figure out who is what .
Each gets a CF , for Camp Fallouja , and a four - digit number .
No names will be used , mainly because numbers fit more easily onto spreadsheets .
They will be forever known as entas .
“ Enta ” means “ you ” in Arabic , and that ’s what you call them day after day , meal after meal , port - a - potty call after port - a - potty call .
“ Enta , ishra mai , ” you say , and the enta drinks his water , and if you say , “ Enta , ishra mai kulak , ” he drinks all of his water , every drop , and holds the bottle upside down to prove it .

It ’s not personal .
“ meesta ! ”
[ 3 ]
You wo n’t fire your weapon in anger .
You ’ll fire plenty of training rounds .
You ’ll be awakened nightly by outgoing artillery shells being blasted into the ether a mere 400 meters from your tin-can hooch , where you fall asleep to the drone of your air - conditioning unit and the faint yelps from the sergeant - next - door ’s porn videos .
Your fingers will ache from absently squeezing the grip of your M16A4 during endless nighttime convoys , transporting detainees from Fallouja to Abu Ghraib or Camp Cropper .
The only illumination in the back of the truck will come from the red-lens flashlight you pan across the entas to make sure none of them have wormed loose from their flex cuffs and hatched a plot to kill you .
Your truck will stop one night outside Abu Ghraib .
You will wait for explosive ordnance techs to clear a suspicious burlap bag .
Because there are so many bombs , you never know how long you ’ll sit exposed on the road .
During the second hour , CF - 4562 will ask you in perfect English if he can pee .
You will escort him to the edge of the road .
When he thinks you are n’t looking , 4562 will slink away from you and your rifle .
You will immediately see through such a feeble escape attempt , and here , outside the site of America ’s shame , this enta will be one sandal step away from giving you an absolutely justifiable reason to finally click your weapon ’s selector off of “ safe . ”
You will raise the muzzle slowly with muscles that ache from humping 60 pounds of body armor and ammo and water and Quick - Clot coagulant , but before your thumb moves over the safety , you will automatically say “ kiff , ” Arabic for “ stop , ” because it ’s been drilled into you as part of the rules of engagement .
You will want to shoot , and 4562 will hear that in your voice .
He will stop .
He will manage a feeble stream of urine before you shoo him back aboard the truck .
[ 4 ]
You will be a constant target outside the wire .
A green beam of light will dazzle you through the Cyclops lens of your night - vision goggles as it streaks toward the armored sides of your truck .
You will grit your teeth , and the rocket - propelled grenade will hit , and then , by the grace of some malfunction , it will only gouge out a divot from the big green plates , an errant golf swing ’s worth of metal .
You will pan your rifle barrel across the garbage - strewn fields and pockmarked buildings , but you will see nothing , just a stray dog scurrying away from the tiny blast .
A feeling of anticlimax will wash over you , of one beer short of the perfect buzz and a throw just wide of the catcher ’s mitt .
You are a Marine and trained to kill , but you can never find any insurgents to shoot .
[ 5 ]
You will tell yourself lies about how being shot at will change you .
You wo n’t be able to tell your wife about the near - miss when you call home because you know she ’ll be worried , and when she worries , she cries , and you cannot , absolutely cannot , have her cry , mainly because it will make you cry , and you ’re a captain in a crowded phone center surrounded by junior Marines .
Your neck will cramp up for two weeks , as if all your fears have been concentrated into a small kernel of misery somewhere north of your shoulder blade .
Then , one day , the pain will be gone , and you will walk up to the side of the truck and place your fist inside the divot to remind yourself that it really happened .
[ 6 ]
You will screw up .
A sergeant will push one of your female Marines too hard during physical training , and she will turn on the waterworks and accuse him of sexual harassment .
You will chew out the sergeant , but later discover that she is simply angry with him for forbidding her to visit her boyfriend in another unit .
You will apologize to the sergeant , but the incident will have cost you some of the platoon ’s trust , and you will find yourself hating her .
She will hate you too , until she goes home early , knocked up by the very same boyfriend she was forbidden to see .
You will feel a quick self - righteous high , followed by a prolonged low ; your neglect of your own rule — do n’t take it personally — means you failed her as a leader .
[ 7 ]
You will drink water until your urine is clear .
You will drink and drink and keep drinking until you ’ve drained more than 800 bottles of water during your stay in the Iraqi desert .
[ 8 ]
Your interpreter will be your greatest hidden ally .
Ali is rotund , aged and bearded , a prototypical Islamic authority figure .
He reads the facility rules to all new detainees , his face hidden behind dark glasses and a ball cap .
Your understanding of Arabic progresses to the point where you know he ’s adding regulations .
You take him aside , and he explains that he tells the new arrivals that there are snipers in every tower , that trapdoors lurk beyond the borders of each gravel path and that attacking a Marine in the facility would result in a coward ’s death , voiding the promise of 72 virgins .
You allow him to continue .
[ 9 ]
You wo n’t abuse any detainees .
Your property room will hold a sniper rifle that killed a Marine and bears the fingerprints of the man inside Cell 4A .
Evidence photos will show a bomb crater and bloody boots with shinbones still laced inside , and wires that lead from the crater to the home of CF - 7634 .
As you perform your daily cell checks , you will occasionally want to smash and kick and eye gouge and palm - heel strike .
But you wo n’t .
You will need to look in the mirror tomorrow when you shave .
[ 10 ]
You will get by with 20 words of Arabic .
When your prisoner - release convoy is waved into a field strewn with basketball - sized boulders by an Army lieutenant too new to speak Arabic , that will be just enough to get the entas to stop washing their feet and shouting blessings to Allah and to herd them into the civil affairs compound .
Later , an 18 - year - old lance corporal will fall asleep at the wheel and swerve off the Fallouja cloverleaf .
As the 7 - ton rumbles down the embankment , the entas will fling themselves off the truck .
One enta will break his arm , and , again , your 20 words will coax him into medical treatment .
Through it all — the bungled release , the accident , the medevac — you will not be attacked .
Two days later , a similar convoy traveling the exact same route will be blown up by an IED , and the ache in your neck will return for another two weeks .
[ 11 ]
After seven months , you will fly home .
On the way back to the U.S. , your Marines will be told by Maj .
NASCAR that they can drink , and they will — to excess .
You will resign yourself to breaking up the inevitable fights , and as you step between two Marines about to swing , you will realize that this has been your purpose .
You set limits .
[ 12 ]
You will return to civilian life .
You will be jumpy and vaguely unsatisfied , disconnected from the civilians around you who care only about text messages and gas prices and catty e-mails .
Navy doctors will find Iraqi sand trapped in the innermost pathways of your ear canals .
Your wife now snores , and all her unfamiliar noises combine to drive you from your bed .
On one such night , you will turn on the television news and see that Anna Nicole Smith ’s death has trumped the coverage of America ’s 3,118th fatality , 31 - year - old Petty Officer 1st Class Gilbert Minjares Jr .
You will note that , at 39 , Smith was younger than most of the helicopters flying in Iraq .
You will turn off the TV and sit in the dark and feel your eyes water as you think about how you took 55 Marines and sailors into a combat zone and brought all 55 back home , and that no one in America besides you and those 55 really cares or understands what you went through .
You processed 1,230 detainees , without a single incident of abuse , while America sat on the couch and watched girls go wild .
As far as you know , you killed no one .
This used to bother you , because killing is what Marines are trained to do .
But now , after viewing documentaries and reports that paint American forces as Redcoat invaders , you take some comfort in the fact that you never pulled the trigger .
Those numbers — 55 , 1,230 and 0 — will allow you to sleep tonight , and the next night , and the next .
But each night you will insert a mouth guard made of silicone before you go to sleep , because your dentist informs you that you are always , always , always unconsciously grinding your teeth .
The People 's Daily Online reports that scientists in China have successfully used brain implants in pigeons to control the birds ' movement :
Scientists with the Robot Engineering Technology Research Center of east China 's Shandong University of Science and Technology say they implanted micro electrodes in the brain of a pigeon so they can command it to fly right or left or up or down .
The implants stimulated different areas of the pigeon 's brain according to signals sent by the scientists via computer , and forced the bird to comply with their commands .
" It 's the first such successful experiment on a pigeon in the world , " said the lead researcher , who hopes the work will have " practical use " in the future .
In the United States , similar work on animals has been of interest to the military .
For example , the pigeon news follows the equally amusing animal tale about the Pentagon 's attempts at creating remote controlled shark spies .
Like the Chinese pigeon experiment , the sharks had brain implants used to control their movements .
But do n't hold your breath waiting for animal spies to roam the world anytime soon .
One of the most infamous would - be animal espionage projects , dubbed Acoustic Kitty , dates back to the 1960s , when the CIA wired a furry feline to eavesdrop .
On its trial run , the cat was run over by a car .

Sharon , as an Iowa girl , may be able to look at this development with detached amusement .
I , for one , am outraged .
Those of us growing up in New York know that there is nothing nastier than the swarming , disease - ridden , flying rats who turn every public place into a fight for room to breathe .
Now China is looking to engineer a fleet of cyborg pigeon slaves ?
Damn them .
And damn those old ladies who feed the pigeons , in the first place .

" We were ready to co-operate , but for unknown reasons , the United States have said they will undertake this programme themselves , " Anatoly Perminov said .
US space agency Nasa has said it plans to start work on a base on the Moon when astronauts return there in 2020 .
Nasa has not commented on Mr Perminov 's statement , reported by Interfax news .
Nasa and Russia 's federal space agency Roskosmos have experience of working together on the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
The construction of the ISS has relied heavily on Russian Soyuz spacecraft to ferry personnel and supplies , particularly when all US space shuttles were grounded as a result of the Columbia disaster in 2003 in which seven astronauts died .
And Mr Perminov announced that Roskosmos had signed a " contract for nearly $ 1bn " with Nasa to supply cargo shuttles between now and 2011 for the ISS .
Expert shortage
Mr Perminov said that he hoped Russian and US expertise could also be pooled as part of Nasa 's plan to build a permanently - occupied Moon base .
" Strange as it is , the United States is short of experts to implement the programme , " Interfax quoted him as saying .
The base is likely to be built on one of the Moon 's poles and will serve as a science centre and possible stepping stone for manned missions to Mars .
The US has already said it plans to build a new lunar spacecraft using funds diverted from space shuttle flights , due to be scrapped in 2010 .
in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind
The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind
Julian Jaynes
At the heart of this book is the revolutionary idea that human consciousness did not begin far back in animal evolution but is a learned process brought into being out of an earlier hallucinatory mentality by cataclysm and catastrophe only 3,000 years ago and still developing .
The implications of this new scientific paradigm extend into virtually every aspect of our psychology , our history and culture , our religion – and indeed , our future .
In the words of one reviewer , it is “ a humbling text , the kind that reminds most of us who make our livings through thinking , how much thinking there is left to do . ”
New to Julian Jaynes ’s theory ?
Start by The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind , along with Gods , Voices , and the Bicameral Mind , The Julian Jaynes Collection and Reflections on the Dawn of Consciousness .
Need a short version ?
Read Julian Jaynes ’s lecture , “ Consciousness and the Voices of the Mind . ”
Julian Jaynes ’s book is available in the following languages :
“ O , what a world of unseen visions and heard silences , this insubstantial country of the mind !
What ineffable essences , these touchless rememberings and unshowable reveries !
And the privacy of it all !
A secret theater of speechless monologue and prevenient counsel , an invisible mansion of all moods , musings , and mysteries , an infinite resort of disappointments and discoveries .
A whole kingdom where each of us reigns reclusively alone , questioning what we will , commanding what we can .
A hidden hermitage where we may study out the troubled book of what we have done and yet may do .
An introcosm that is more myself than anything I can find in a mirror .
This consciousness that is myself of selves , that is everything , and yet is nothing at all – what is it ?
And where did it come from ?
And why ? ” — from the Introduction
Reviews
When Julian Jaynes …speculates that until late in the second millennium B.C. men had no consciousness but were automatically obeying the voices of gods , we are astounded but compelled to follow this remarkable thesis through all the corroborative evidence … ” – John Updike , in The New Yorker
“ This book and this man ’s ideas may be the most influential , not to say controversial , of the second half of the twentieth century .
It renders whole shelves of books obsolete . ” – William Harrington , in Columbus Dispatch
“ Having just finished The Origin of Consciousness , I myself feel something like Keats ’ Cortez staring at the Pacific , or at least like the early reviewers of Darwin or Freud .
I ’m not quite sure what to make of this new territory ; but its expanse lies before me and I am startled by its power . ” – Edward Profitt , in Commonweal
“ He is as startling as Freud was in The Interpretation of Dreams , and Jaynes is equally adept at forcing a new view of known human behavior . ” – Raymond Headlee , in American Journal of Psychiatry
“ The bold hypothesis of the bicameral mind is an intellectual shock to the reader , but whether or not he ultimately accepts it he is forced to entertain it as a possibility .
Even if he marshals arguments against it he has to think about matters he has never thought of before , or , if he has thought of them , he must think about them in contexts and relationships that are strikingly new . ” – Ernest R. Hilgard , Professor of Psychology , Stanford University
“ The weight of original thought in it is so great that it makes me uneasy for the author ’s well - being : the human mind is not built to support such a burden . ”
– D.C. Stove , in Encounter
“ Daring and brilliant … well worth reading by any person interested in theories of human learning and behavior , in theory devleopment , and in seeing a scholarly , fertile and original thinker at work . ” – Martin Levit , Professor of Education , in Educational Studies
“ An exciting , ingenious , heavily documented , beautifully written … theory of the development of human consciousness . ” – George Adelman , M.I.T. Neuroscience Research Program , in Library Journal

The recent discovery that a mutant " clock " gene made some people " early to bed and early to rise , " a condition known as familial advanced sleep phase syndrome ( FASPS ) , offered one of the first glimpses into the genetic basis of sleep in humans .
Now , researchers report in the Jan. 12 , 2007 issue of the journal Cell new evidence that helps to explain just how their bodies ' natural alarm clocks get set to such an early wake - up time .
In studies of mice carrying the human FASPS gene , the researchers found that the mutant version of the Period 2 ( Per2 ) clock gene -- which is crucial for resetting the body 's central clock in response to light -- cannot be chemically modified by another enzyme that controls it .
That failure leads to a reduction in the number of copies of the Per2 " message , " and the characteristic shifted sleep pattern .
Eventually , such insight into the factors influencing people 's so - called circadian , or daily , rhythm might lead to therapies that could adjust the body 's clock in those suffering from conditions including jet lag or shift work sleep disorder , according to the researchers .
" This study highlights the power of natural human mutations to uncover things [ about the circadian clock ] that we might not otherwise have learned , or that we might have misunderstood before , " said Howard Hughes Investigator Louis Ptácek , of the University of California , San Francisco .
" Most of the information we 've had about these clock genes has been based on the Drosophila model and Per2 knockout mice , " which lack the Per2 clock gene altogether , added study author Ying - Hui Fu , who is also at UCSF .
Based on those studies , " everybody had thought a short or long period depended on a change in protein stability , " she said .
" That 's how we thought the system should work .
But this paper shows that is not the case .
It comes back instead to the transcription level as the most important step . "
FASPS is a relatively rare , inherited condition in which people are " morning larks , " with early morning awakening and early sleep times .
People with the condition generally show changes in core body temperatures and other characteristics governed by the circadian clock that are shifted up by three to four hours .
The syndrome is passed on in a dominant fashion , meaning that it takes just one copy of the abnormal gene to exhibit symptoms .
The UCSF group had earlier discovered a variant of the human Per2 gene that causes FASPS .
They also showed that the so - called " S662G " variant , in which the serine building block normally present at position 662 is replaced by glycine , prevented a regulatory enzyme from tacking a phosphate onto the encoded protein .
Now , the researchers report additional evidence that the lost " phosphorylation " prevents a cascade of chemical modifications that are normally primed by the initial event .
Moreover , they show that the human gene inserted into otherwise normal mice causes them to rise early , symptoms that mirror those in people with FASPS .
In contrast , a mutation that mimicked an increase in phosphorylation at amino acid 662 increased the transcription of PER2 and pushed the animals ' sleep pattern later .
Their studies in mice revealed that the amino acid change associated with FASPS , which alters the charge of the residue , alters the ability of PER2 to regulate its own transcription .
PER2 presumably manages such regulation through interaction with other proteins since it does n't bind DNA itself , they said .
The findings led the researchers to suggest a model of clock function in which cells sense changing PER2 levels over time , beginning a new daily cycle when a certain threshold is crossed .
" In S662G individuals or mice , the alteration in transcription leads to production of less PER2 , while the clock protein 's degradation remains unaffected , " they explained .
Thus , the researchers added , " PER2 levels are lower at all time points and , in the latter half of a cycle , fall below the threshold earlier than normal , leading to activation of transcription earlier and resulting in a shorter period . "
The advance in understanding of PER2's role may ultimately lead to methods for people , such as nurses who must care for patients in the middle of the night , to synchronize their internal clocks with their regular or changing daily routines , the researchers said .
Someday " people with jet lag or shift work -- some of the most common of sleep disorders -- might take a pill and be back to normal again , " Fu said .
" When we fly to Europe , we set our watch ahead several time zones and our watch is back on track , " Ptácek added .
" We do n't understand the [ internal ] human clock well enough to advance or delay it that way .
But with all that we 've learned from the fruit fly , mouse and now human about the gears and how they are working , we 're getting closer to a ' button ' that might be able to do that . "

This is my first week of teaching as a full - time faculty member and not as an adjunct or TA .
While most of the new experiences have been positive , I 'm seeing things in a new light .
The most intriguing facet of my new " education " experience is confirmation that economists do indeed think and act differently than " normal " folk .
Being fresh out of grad school , I often times feel as though I have a unique perspective ; able to think like a student and teacher all at the same time .
Unfortunately , my experience with current undergrads is proving me wrong .
During my first - day soapbox session , I ranted on and on about the virtues of things such as class participation , studying , group work , taking advantage of extra help , etc .
While I am an eternal optimist , I know deep down this message is mostly ignored .
However , I continued on with my rant to include the phrase , " Delivering what you 've paid for . "
Now I realize that my salary is not specifically tied to class attendance and actual dollars paid ; but indirectly , student 's tuition is in fact my main source of income .
My realization came to me at approximately 1:38 PM .
At this point in the class , I had spent the previous 38 minutes doing introductions , and explaining every last detail of the syllabus .
At this point , approximately 50 % of the class started to pack up their material in preparation for an early departure .
While it was disappointing , it did provide me my first non soap - box rant opportunity to show students how seriously I considered the value of academic rigor .
The first thing I did was shoot the meanest , dirtiest look I could to the offending students .
Apparently the " teacher look " is a skill I have yet to master .
So I did the next logical thing , I threw my arms in the air yelling , " whoaaaaaaaa . "
I do n't know if it was the volume , tone , or crazy arms , but this seemed to work .
They sat back down ; I ranted , and then finished my lecture .
Around midnight the realization of the perverse nature of classroom utility hit me : students would be happier if I did n't show up .
It was n't just my class , it 's all classes .
Nearly all students welcome the absence of their teachers , and subsequent cancellation of class .
This is logical in some settings — for instance the day of a hard exam — but for the most part seems quite irrational .
Irrational by my values , of course !
To that point , I just have to consider the fact that students are not well - informed enough to be disappointed about the cancellation of class .
To be clear , this theory does break down .
I 'm simply referring to sporadic unexpected class dismissals , not constant ones .
I have several explanations for this theory .
The first is that college education is not viewed as a privilege ; it is often times taken for granted .
As with high school , students are no longer worried about graduating .
Graduating after four years is simply given , and classes along the way are a necessary evil interfering with an awesome four - year party .
Along those same lines is the reasoning for my second explanation : unexpected fun .
When students realize they have a free hour , they 're overwhelmed with the many opportunities for fun that previously did not exist .
This amazing amount of " feel - goodedness , " almost always outweighs the cost of attending class .
I attribute a large part of this phenomenon to the climate of the region .
In the temperate state of Iowa , kids grow up with the anticipation of the two best words to be uttered upon waking up each winter morning : snow day .
The difference is obvious .
The result of a snow day is obvious fun : playing in the snow !
Unfortunately , snow is only around part of the year , and most 18 - 22 year olds have made their quota of snowpersons .
Still , this feeling of possible unexpected fun lingers , even if students fill the time honing their video game skills .
This leads me to my final explanation : the rising price of college .
Because the price of attending a four - year institution has increased so much faster than inflation , nearly all students are unable to afford school on their own .
In fact , nearly all students rely on financial aid in the form of scholarships and loans to finance their education .
In the case of loans , the actual payment for education is timed accounting style .
That is , persons pay for school while they 're reaping the benefits of higher education .
This total disregard for actual cost skews the current cost - benefit analysis within the minds of students .
Originally , my overall goal for this semester was to foster economic thought , and less negative feelings towards the dismal science .
Now I can add one more specific goal for the semester : making students demand the education they 've paid for .
In February 2005 , 2ndSite went from Bronze - Silver - Gold ( “ three buckets ” ) package pricing to a total user customized pricing strategy .
What ’s better ?
Three buckets .
We switched because a handful of users complained about having to pay for things they were n’t using .
You cannot please everybody all the time , but we decided to try .
We switched to customizable pricing .
Our new pricing did a lot of good for 2ndSite , but along the way we confused a lot people with the way we presented our pricing .
After spending time with Tom Wellner ( 2ndSite Advisor ) over the holidays , we changed the pricing PAGE – but NOT pricing structure – on our website back to buckets .
The pricing can still be customized when you upgrade , but we chose two of our more popular packages and presented them as buckets .
Tom impressed upon me the importance of having your pricing in “ three buckets ” to make it SIMPLE .
Basically we had been trying to please everybody and therefore we were confusing people with our pricing plan .
Again , what is better : buckets or custom pricing ?
Buckets .
How do I know we learned this ?
Since changing the pricing page on our site , our sign - ups / trails have increased 30 % .
We had VERY good conversion rates prior to that .
This bump is great .
What ’s amazing is our actual prices are identical , but just by presenting our pricing in three easy to understand buckets , conversions of first time visitors to trials have increased about 30 % …. that will affect our bottom line from here on in …Amazing the power of a single web page , no ?
You know what I find weird ?
The exact same number of people exit our website on the Pricing page as they did before .
Had the redesigned page not been the only site change , we never would have been able to be certain about the BUCKET FACTOR .
That is why we try to make on design change at a time and track the results .
I still have lots more to say about pricing .
I ’ll get to it .
But step one is to think in buckets .
Thanks Tom .
The United States has given Israel $ 51.3 billion in military grants since 1949 , most of it after 1974  more than any other country in the post - 1945 era .
Israel has also received $ 11.2 billion in loans for military equipment , plus $ 31 billion in economic grants , not to mention loan guarantees or joint military projects .
But major conditions on these military grants have meant that 74 percent of it has remained in the U.S. to purchase American arms .
Since it creates jobs and profits in many districts , Congress is more than ready to respond to the cajoling of the Israel lobby .
This vast sum has both enabled and forced Israel to prepare to fight an American - style war .
But the US since 1950 has failed to win any of its big wars .
In early 2005 the new chief of staff of the Israel Defense Force , Dan Halutz , embarked on the most extensive reorganization in the history of IDF .
Halutz is an Air Force general and enamored with the doctrines that justify the ultra-modern equipment the Americans showered upon the Israelis .
Attack helicopters , unmanned aircraft , advanced long - range intelligence and communications , and the like were at the top of his agenda .
His was merely a variation of Donald Rumsfelds “ shock and awe ” concepts .
The 34 - day war in Lebanon , starting July 12 last year , was a disastrous turning point for Israel .
Until the Eliyahu Winograd Commission , which Olmert set up in September 2006 , delivers its interim report in late April  which will cover the first five days of the war only  and resolves these matters , we will not know precisely the orders sent to specific units or the timing of all of the actors , but there is already a consensus on far more important fundamentals .
But the Israelis did not lose the war because of orders given or not given to various officers .
It was a war of choice , and it was planned as an air war with very limited ground incursions in the expectation that Israeli casualties would be very low .
Major General Herzl Sapir at the end of February said that “ the war began at our initiative and we did not take advantage of the benefits granted to the initiator . ”
Planning for the war began November 2005 but reached high gear by the following March before the expected kidnapping of two IDF soldiers  the nominal excuse for the war .
There is no controversy over the fact that it was a digitized , networked war , the first in Israels experience , and conformed to Halutz  and American  theories of how war is fought in this high - tech era .
The US fought identical wars in Afghanistan and Iraq  and is in the process of losing both .
What were the Israeli objectives ?
 war aims , if you will .
While the Winograd Commission report may clarify this question , at the very least a number of goals are known already .
Halutz wanted to “ shock and awe ” the Hezbollah and their allies with Israeli power  all within a few days .
There were lesser aims , such as moving the Hezbollah rockets well away from the borders or even getting its two kidnapped soldiers returned , but at the very least Halutz wanted to make a critical point .
Instead , he revealed Israels vulnerability based , in large part , on the fact the enemy was far better prepared , motivated , and equipped .
It was the end of a crucial myth , the harbinger of yet more bloody , but equal , armed conflicts or a balance of power conducive to negotiations .
Olmert and his generals very likely expected to have a great victory within five days , thereby increasing his popularity with the hawkish Jewish population that is a growing majority of the voters , to reverse his abysmally low poll ratings , thereby saving his political career  he received three percent popularity in a TV poll in early March .
There are many reasons the Israelis lost the war in Lebanon , but there is general agreement within Israel that the war ended in disaster and the deterrent value of the once unbeatable , super - armed IDF gravely diminished in the entire Arab world for the first time since 1947 .
But the Israelis were defeated for many of the same reasons that have caused the Americans to lose the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  and in Vietnam as well .
Both their doctrine and equipment were ill suited for the realities they confronted .
There was no centralized command structure to destroy but small groups , lightly armed , mobile , and decentralized , able to harass and ultimately prevail .
The Hezbollah also had highly effective Russian anti-tank missiles , and the IDF admits that “ several dozen ” tanks were put out of commission , if not destroyed , including the Merkava Mark IV , which Israel claims in the best protected tank in the world  and which it seeks to export .
They also fired around 4,000 rockets at Israeli population centers and the IDF could not stop this demoralizing harassment .
Hezbollah bunkers and arsenals were largely immune to air attacks , which caused the Israelis to “ stretch the target envelope ” to attack densely populated areas , with over 1,000 civilian dead .
“ Israel lost the war in the first three days , ” an American military expert concluded , expressing a consensus shared by many US Air Force analysts .
“ If you have that kind of surprise and you have that kind of firepower you had better win .
Otherwise , you re in for the long haul . ”
The problem , though , was not merely a new Arab prowess , though changes in their morale and fighting organizations should not be minimized .
Halutz drastic reorganization of the IDF since early 2005 , one that was supposed to attain the promises of all its American - supplied equipment , “ caused , ” in General Sapirs words , “ a terrible distortion . ”
The IDF was an organizational mess , demoralized as never before , and on January 17 , 2007 Halutz resigned , the first head of the IDF to voluntarily step down because of his leadership in war .
Had he not resigned he would have been fired .
His successor quickly annulled his reorganization of the IDF , which is now sorely disorganized .
The American way of warfare had failed .
The Next War
The Lebanon War is only a harbinger of Israeli defeats to come .
For the first time there is a rough equivalence in military power .
Technology everywhere is now moving far faster than the diplomatic and political resources or will to control its inevitable consequences .
Hezbollah has far better and more rockets  over 10,000 short - range rockets is one figure given  than it had a few years ago , and Israels military intelligence believes it has more firepower than it had last spring , before it was attacked .
Israel has failed to convince Russia not to sell or give their highly effective anti-tank missiles to nations or movements in the region .
They fear that even Hamas will acquire them .
Syria is procuring “ thousands ” of advanced anti-tank missiles from Russia , which can be fired from five kilometers away , as well as far better rockets that can hit Israeli cities .
If the challenges of producing a realistic concept of the world that confronts the mounting dangers and limits of military technology seriously are not resolved soon there is nothing more than wars to look forward to .
The IDF intelligence branch does not think a war with Syria is likely in 2007 ; other Israeli military commentators think that any war with Syria would produce , at best , a bloody standoff  just like the war in Lebanon last summer .
Israel has about 3,700 tanks and they are all now highly vulnerable .
Its ultra -modern air arm , most of which the US has provided , only kills people but it cannot attain victory .
The New Israel  A ‘ Normal ’ Nation
In the past , wars produced victories and more territory for the Jews ; now they will only produce disasters for everybody .
The Lebanon War proved that .
Zionism was a concoction of Viennese coffee houses , Tolstoys idealization of labor , early ecological sentiment in the form of the wanderfogel that influenced Zionism but various fascistic movements as well , militarism , and varieties of socialism for parts of it , including bolshevism .
Jews sought to go to Palestine not only because of the Holocaust but also the changes in American immigration laws in the first half of the 1920s .
Without the vast sums the Diaspora provided , Zionism would never have come to fruition .
Every nation has its distinctive personality reflecting its traditions , pretensions , and historys caprices , and in this regard Israel is no different .
It exists but it is becoming increasingly dangerous to world peace  and to itself .
Zionism always had a military ethos , imposed only in part by Arab hostility , and from the inception of Zionisms history its political and military leaders were one and the same .
Generals were heroes and they did well in politics .
The logic of force merged with an essentially Western , colonialist bias .
Its founders were Europeans , and it was an outpost of European culture until the globalization of values and products made these cultural distinctions increasingly irrelevant .
It always has been a militarist society , proud of its fighters .
And notwithstanding the Cold War and the increasing flow of arms from the US , which , merged with its élan , meant it won all its post - 1947 wars until last summer , it still retains a strong element of hysteria about the world it faced .
And it is often messianic  especially its politicians  because messianism is very much influential among a growing portion of the religious and traditional population .
Israel has ceased being “ Zionist ” in the original sense of that ideology .
For the sake of ceremony it retains Zionism as a label , just as many actual or aspiring nations have various myths which justify their claims to a national identity .
But it is a long way from the original premises , in large part because its war with its neighbors  especially the Arabs who live in its midst or nearby  made its military ethos dominant over everything else .
Israel today is well on its way to becoming a failed state .
Were it not for the fact that this outpost of fewer than five million Jews is a critical factor of war and peace in a much larger and vital region it would not be important or at all unusual .
But it is terribly confused and has a very mixed identity ; the US has since the late 1960s protected it .
World peace now depends on this place , its idiosyncrasies , personality , and growing contradictions .
Israel is a profoundly divided society and its politicians are venal cynics .
Many nations  and surely the Palestinian leaders until Hamas , by default , took over  are no different .
As Shlomo Ben - Ami , the former foreign minister , describes it , on one side there are economically disadvantaged Oriental Jews , Russian nationalists who were motivated above all by a desire to leave the USSR ( an appreciable minority is not Jewish ) , and Orthodox Jews of every sort united only by their intense dislike of “ assimilationists ” ; on the other hand we have secular Jews , some leftists and modernizers , more skilled and of East European parentage who were once crucial in the formation of Zionism .
There are an increasing number of “ Jerusalem - Jews , ” as Ben - Ami calls them , motivated to come primarily by economic incentives , and they are bringing the Right to power more and more often .
They fear the Arabs who live in Israel .
“ Tel Aviv ” Jews are assimilating to a global , modernizing culture , more akin to the “ normal ” existence the early Zionists preached , and they are also the emigrants out because they have high skills .
Israel now has as many people leaving as immigrate to it , and North America alone is home to up to a million of them .
Some indications of these trends range from the banal to the tragic .
There are all varieties of punks , gays , everything .
As for the ultra-Orthodox , some have placed “ curses ” on those who advocate disengaging from any settlements in the West Bank or Gaza ; they will be punished by heaven .
One of four ultra-Orthodox Jews believes this is precisely why Sharon was struck with a coma .
Martin van Creveld , professor of military history at the Hebrew University and friend of many IDF leaders , whose fame was made studying the role of morale in armies , thinks the morale of the conscripts in the IDF is “ almost to the vanishing point ; in some cases crybabies have taken the place of soldiers . ”
“ Feminism ” in the armed forces has intensified the rot , but “ social developments ” have destroyed much of the army  as have officers “ who stayed behind their computers ” last summer .
Never before has Israel been wracked by so many demoralizing scandals .
The president of Israel just resigned because of rape charges against him , Prime Minister Olmert is being investigated by the comptrollers office on four charges of corruption , the new chief of police was once accused of accepting bribes and fraud and his appointment has created an uproar , and other sordid cases too numerous to cite .
Israel is “ stewing in its own rot , ” a Haaretz writer concluded ; the police , retired judge Vardi Zeiler commented after heading a committee to investigate the states operation , were like Sicily and the state was on its way to becoming a mafia - style regime .
In this anarchy wars are motivated for political reasons but now they are lost because the society is disintegrating and  again to quote a Haaretz writer  the government “ lacks both direction and a conscience . ”
Worse yet , its leaders are incredibly stupid and Olmert can only be compared to Bush in political intelligence .
There is a consensus among Israeli strategists that the Iraq War was a disaster for Israel , a geopolitical gift to Iran that will leave Israel in ever - greater danger long after the Americans go home .
“ Israel has nothing to gain from a continued American presence in Iraq , ” the director of the Institute for National Security Studies of Tel Aviv University stated last January .
The US ousted the Taliban from Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein from Iraq and created an overwhelming Iranian strategic domination .
Its campaign for democracy has brought Hamas to power in Palestine .
“ It ’s a total misreading of reality , ” one Israeli expert is quoted when discussing America ’s role in the region .
American policies have failed and Israel has given a carte blanche to a strategy that leaves it more isolated than ever .
Notwithstanding this consensus , on March 12th Olmert told the American Israel Public Affairs annual conference by video link “ Those who are concerned for Israels security should recognize the need for American success in Iraq and responsible exit . ”
“ Any outcome that will not help Americas strength would undercut Americas ability to deal effectively with the threat posed by the Iranian regime . ”
His foreign minister was even stronger .
“ Stay the hell out of it , ” a Haaretz writer concluded .
No group is more antiwar than American Jews , Congress  in its own inept way  is trying to bring the war to an end , his own strategists think the Iraq War was a disaster  and Olmert endorses Bushs folly .
The Syrian Option
It is in this context that the peace of the region will or will not evolve .
Olmert will do what is best for his political position domestically , and retaining power will be his priority  no less than his predecessors and most politicians everywhere .
It is not at all promising .
But for technical , social , and morale reasons Israel will not win another war .
At every level , it has become far weaker .
It can inflict frightful damage on its enemies but it cannot change the fundamental balance of all forces that lead to victory .
Making peace with Syria would be a crucial first step for Israel , and although the Palestinian problem would remain it would nonetheless vastly improve Israels security  and disprove the Bushs Administrations contention until very recently that negotiations with Syria or Iran on any Middle East question involves conceding to evil .
The Israeli press reported in great detail the secret 2004 - 05 Israel - Syria negotiations , which were very advanced and involved major Syrian concessions  especially on water and Syrian neutrality in a host of political controversies with the Palestinians and Iranians .
It also reported that Washington followed these talks closely and that it  especially Cheneys office  opposed bringing them to a successful conclusion .
At the end of January many important members of Israels foreign policy establishment publicly urged reopening these talks .
Olmert dismissed Syrias gestures categorically after they became public .
“ Dont even think about it ” was Secretary of State Rices view of a treaty when she saw Israeli officials in mid-February .
But though Mossad supports the obdurate Rice - Olmert view , military intelligence argues that Syrias offers are sincere and serious .
Moreover , intelligences head warned that Syria is growing stronger and peace was very much to Israels interest .
He was supported by most of the Foreign and Defense ministries , including Minister of Defense Amir Peretz .
Olmert demanded , and got , their acquiescence .
A treaty could be finalized with Syria within four to six months , Alon Liel , former director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry who negotiated with the Syrians , reported the Washington Times on March 7 .
Liel was asked to come to the US embassy in Tel Aviv about this time and tell the entire political staff of his talks .
The reports in Haaretz , which included the draft treaty , were by then quite definitive .
Then the Knesset , Israels parliament , invited Ibrahim Suleiman , Syrias representative to the talks , to speak to the foreign affairs and defense committees .
Such invitations are very rare , not least because Syria and Israel are legally in a state of war .
But if the Syrians and Israelis go to war again , the normally hawkish Martin van Creveld concluded at this time , Israel “ could wreak much destruction , but it could not force a decision . ”
In three or four years the Syrians would be ready for a protracted war that would prove too much for Israel .
After running through his bizarre alternatives , and the state of the IDFs morale , van Creveld concluded that reaching a peace with Syria was very much to Israels interests  and that even the Americans were coming to the position that talking to Syria and Iran ( as the Baker - Hamilton panel had recommended last December ) was rational .
Syria has been attempting desperately to improve its relations with Washington , if only to forestall some mad act on the US  part .
When Israel attacked Lebanon last July , Elliott Abrams , in charge of the Middle East at the National Security Council , along with other neocons in Washington , urged it to expand the war to Syria .
At the end of February Syria renewed its appeal to the US to discuss any and all Middle East issues with it in “ a serious and profound dialogue . ”
For over two years it has made similar attempts ; Baker knew all about these .
Talking to alleged adversaries is perhaps the most fundamental point of difference between Cheney , his neocon alliance , and Rice , and it covers North Korea , Iran , and many other places .
The debate is less the nature and goals of American foreign policy but how to conduct it  by the application of material power and even the threat of war versus more traditional means , such as diplomacy .
In the past several weeks , taking her cue from the Republican Establishment in the Iraq Study Group last December , Rice has been winning points in this debate but her successes are fragile .
Cheney is a powerful , determined and cunning man who knows how to succeed all too well with the president .
Americas overwhelming problem is Iraq and , above all , Iran , and apparently the Bush Administration has now decided that Syria can help it in the region .
Ellen Sauerbrey , an Assistant Secretary of State , was in Damascus on March 12 , nominally to discuss refugees but she heard from the Syrians “ that all the questions are linked in the Arab region and that a comprehensive dialogue is needed on all these questions . ”
Syria has also mobilized the European Union , which now favors a return of the Golan Heights to it .
On March 13 the US ambassador to Israel publicly stated a bald lie that the Americans had never “ expressed an opinion on what Israel should or should not do with regard to Syria . ”
It is now entirely in the hands of the Olmert government whether to negotiate with Syria .
Israel has ignored Washington on at least four very important issues , starting with the Sinai campaign in 1956 , and acted in its own self - interest .
The Americans were Olmerts alibi but he can use them no more .
There are other crucial issues , such as the Saudi plan for the resolution of the Palestine question , and never has Israel had a greater need for peace than at the present .
Instead , like the US , its head of state may be the worst in its history , motivated by short - term political advantage and a consummate desire to retain power .
But the Syrian option is there for the taking .
If there is war then the brain drain out will accelerate and migration in will fall ; demography will take over .
Israel will then become the only place in the world a Jew is in danger precisely because he or she is a Jew .
If this opportunity is lost there will eventually be a mutually destructive war that no one will win  the Lebanon War proved that Israel must now confront the fact that its neighbors are becoming its military equals and US aid cannot save it .
Indeed , Americas free gifts enabled Israel to begin a war last July with illusions identical to those that also caused the Bush Administration to embark on its Iraq folly .

Screenshot of a blocked website
The government of Saudi Arabia blocked access to Google 's Web blogging service Blogger , Yahoo !'s photo sharing website Flickr , and the diary service LiveJournal as well as some other websites through their nationally run Internet Services Unit ( ISU ) last Tuesday .
As a result , English - speaking Saudis were prevented from publishing blogs , reading journals , or viewing pictures on Flickr .
The Saudi Arabian government uses a filtering service provided by the United States - owned company Secure Computing .
Similar blocking services have been implemented in other countries , such as The People 's Republic of China .
In the past , the ISU had , on and off , blocked access to BlogSpot.com 's free hosting service .
However , according to activist organization Reporters Without Borders , " blog services [ applications ] had not until now been affected by the ISU 's filters .
The complete blocking of blogger.com , which is one of the biggest blog tools on the market , is extremely worrying .
Only China had so far used such an extreme measure to censor the Internet . "
On Thursday , access to Blogger.com was restored , but Flickr and LiveJournal remained inaccessible .
The ISU did not release any public statement about the blocking or restoration of service to any specific website .

A community response grid could have helped the Katrina relief effort
Two lecturers in the US have suggested creating a network of Community Response Grids ( CRG ) in conjunction with the emergency services .
Citizens could leave text , video and photos on the site of emergencies , natural disasters and terror attacks .
A pilot could start later this year based at the University of Maryland , driven by 40,000 students and staff .
The idea of a nationwide network of 911.gov websites has been proposed by Maryland university lecturers Ben Shneiderman and Jennifer Preece in this month 's edition of Science magazine .
" The 911 telephone system functions effectively when there are traffic accidents , health emergencies or small fires , but when large numbers of people are involved it does not handle the capacity , " said Professor Shneiderman .
He added : " The evolution of the internet and its maturity at this point and the great success of social networking sites like MySpace , Craig 's List and Amber Alert , suggests there is an opportunity to do something for emergency response and recovery . "
Community driven
The proposal is for community - driven websites to be run by trained volunteers working in conjunction with the 6,100 local 911 services around the US .
" Citizen reporters would report to a centralised authority who will take care of emergency response coordination and allocate scarce resources of police fire and medical services , " said Professor Shneiderman .
The idea came after Prof Shneiderman typed 911 into his web browser to see if there were any official websites .
It gives neighbours and people in the community much more power in protecting and supporting each other
Jennifer Preece , University of Maryland
The two professors believe the growth of community - driven websites and the rise of user generated content , especially in the field of citizen journalism , would give the grids every chance of success .
" It gives neighbours and people in the community much more power in protecting and supporting each other , " said Professor Preece .
Information from residents would be added to regular updates from hospitals , emergency crews , surveillance cameras and other sensors used for Homeland Security so that the site would be both a resource for information and a place to contribute material .
The two academics admitted there were many hurdles to overcome but said the grids could be set up within three to five years .
They have applied for funding from the National Science Foundation to pay for a pilot study on the campus .
They said the net was robust enough and reliable enough to be used as a conduit and source for information in major disasters .
' Legitimate concerns '
Prof Shneiderman said : " Any communications medium is vulnerable especially in certain kinds of devastation - either natural disasters or terrorist attacks .
Those are legitimate concerns .
" The internet is designed for resilience and if this proposal goes forward it would certainly strengthen the need to have very reliable systems which are increasingly available . "
Locals could leave details , text and photos , on the website
Encouraging the participation of existing local groups , such as volunteer firemen , libraries , sports groups etc , would keep the community alive even when there were no emergencies or disasters .
The CRGs would need to be robust enough to deal with traffic spikes during times of large - scale emergencies , said the professors .
" Peak service problems are substantial issues , " said Prof Shneiderman .
" News sites have the same problem - when a big story breaks demand is 40 to 100 times greater than the normal load .
" The internet does very well when it comes to scaling up , certainly better than phones . "
Pranksters
There were also issues around pranksters leaving false information which could have fatal consequences if acted upon by the emergency services .
" 911 phone calls are subject to prank callers and we think web - based reporting would have that danger just as well , " said Prof Shneiderman .
" You would have to pre-register , the system would not allow anonymous entries .
" You must get people engaged in advance , to try it and learn it and be part of it . "
Prof Preece said the mobile phone would be an important tool for the CRGs .
" We are expecting to have cell phone access .
Many people 's lives are directed by their cell phones - their communications , their social lives , contact with families . "
Prof Shneiderman said the French heatwave in 2003 in which thousands of people died was an example of where community - driven services could have helped .
" 11,000 people died and that was really for the lack of people offering each other water , checking on their neighbours , and arranging for people to go to air conditioned facilities .
" There would be a need and demand for a service like this even if there were not a Hurricane Katrina or terrorist attacks - there are lots of occasions where community help on a resident by resident basis could be very beneficial . "
On December 20 1954 , a woman known as Marion Keech gathered her followers in her garden in Lake City , Illinois , and waited for midnight , when flying saucers were supposed to land and save them from huge floods about to engulf the planet .
Keech had received news of the impending deluge from Sananda , a being from the planet Clarion , whose messages she passed on to a small group of believers .
Unbeknown to her , the group had been infiltrated by a University of Minnesota researcher , the social psychologist Leon Festinger .
As dawn rose on December 21 with no flying saucer in sight , Keech had another revelation .
Sananda told her that the group 's advanced state of enlightenment had saved the entire planet .
They rejoiced and called a press conference .
" A man with a conviction is a hard man to change , " wrote Festinger in his book on the cult , When Prophecy Fails .
" Tell him you disagree and he turns away .
Show him facts and figures and he questions your sources .
Appeal to logic and he fails to see your point . "
George Bush is a man of conviction and clearly a hard man to change .
When reality confronts his plans he does not alter them but instead alters his understanding of reality .
Like Keech and her crew , he stands with a tight band of followers , both deluded and determined , understanding each setback not as a sign to change course but as further proof that they must redouble their efforts to the original goal .
And so we watch the administration 's plans for a military attack against Iran unfold even as its official narrative for the run-up to the war in Iraq unravels and the wisdom of that war stands condemned by death and destruction .
As though on split screens , we pass seamlessly from reports of how they lied to get us into the last war , to scenes of carnage as a result of the war , to shots of them lying us into the next one .
One moment we see the trial of Dick Cheney 's former deputy , Lewis " Scooter " Libby , revealing how the administration sought to discredit critics of the plans to invade Iraq ; the next we see them discrediting critics of their plans to attack Iran .
On one page , newly released documents reveal how the defence department contorted evidence to justify bombing Baghdad ; on the next , the administration is using suspect evidence to justify bombing Iran .
" It is absolutely parallel , " Philip Giraldi , a former CIA counter - terrorism specialist , told Vanity Fair magazine .
" They 're using the same dance steps - demonise the bad guys , the pretext of diplomacy , keep out of negotiations , use proxies .
It is Iraq redux . "
The administration , of course , denies this .
Despite the fact it has ordered oil reserves to be stockpiled and has just sent a second aircraft carrier as well as more patriot missiles and minesweepers to the Gulf , they swear these allegations are groundless .
Robert Gates , the new defence secretary , recently insisted : " I do n't know how many times the president , secretary [ of state Condoleezza ]
Rice and I have had to repeat that we have no intention of attacking Iran . "
The sad fact is Gates can say it as many times as he likes because no one believes him .
In April 2002 , Bush told Trevor McDonald : " I have no plans to attack [ Iraq ] on my desk . "
An $ 8 cab ride to the Pentagon and Bush would have found the plans on Donald Rumsfeld 's desk .
He knew this because he put them there four months earlier .
On November 21 2001 , he asked Rumsfeld : " What kind of war plan do you have for Iraq ? "
True they are pursuing diplomatic avenues to derail Iran 's nuclear programme , but we now know that this may be little more than a sideshow .
The day before Iraq was due to let in UN weapons inspectors , Bush told Rumsfeld and the head of central command , General Tommy Franks , to " dissociate a big deployment or build - up from what Colin [ Powell ] is doing on the diplomatic front ...
Do n't make it look like I have no choice but to invade " .
The aim here is n't to reprosecute the case against the Iraq war - in almost every venue but the White House and Downing Street that has been won - but to illustrate that the duplicities from that war and a possible next one are playing out concurrently .
Whatever excuses people make for backing an attack on Iran , what they can't say is they did n't know .
Nor does it mean America will attack tomorrow .
But it does mean they are almost ready to attack today .
" Targets have been selected , " says Vincent Cannistraro , a US intelligence analyst .
" For a bombing campaign against nuclear sites , it is quite advanced .
The military assets to carry this out are being put in place .
We are planning for war . "
These plans run not in historical parallel with the period before the attack on Iraq , but rather in lockstep with the current situation there .
They do not so much replicate the preparations as seek to exploit the dire situation caused by the invasion .
For the time being , US focus has shifted from Iran 's desire to acquire a nuclear bomb - a development that should be resisted by diplomatic means , because it will undermine prospects of stability and peace in the region - to its involvement in Iraq .
The accusation is that the Iranians are supplying insurgents with a bomb known as the " explosively formed penetrator " , which , the Pentagon says , is responsible for killing at least 170 US military personnel and wounding a further 620 .
Bush claims these weapons were provided by Quds , an elite branch of the Iranian military .
He admits he has no idea whether the Iranian government is involved or not .
There are a few problems with this .
First , the US is in no position to condemn other countries for meddling in the foreign affairs of Iraq .
Second , the administration 's credibility , like Saddam 's weapons of mass destruction , is non-existent .
Recently , the Pentagon 's inspector general , Thomas Gimble , slammed Rumsfeld underling Douglas Feith for wilfully contorting intelligence about links between Iraq and al - Qaida in order to justify the Iraq war .
Feith compiled a briefing that was " inappropriate " with conclusions that were " not fully supported by the available intelligence " , concluded Gimble , who fell just short of branding Feith an outright liar .
But most importantly , the region 's biggest obstacle to peace and stability is not Iran but the US .
The invasion of Iraq has both bolstered Iran 's standing by installing a friendly Shia regime in Baghdad , and given Iran every reason to arm itself for fear of imminent attack from US bases now embedded on its border .
Each time the White House issues threats against Iran , it strengthens the crude , anti-semitic prime minister Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who can rally the nation around a foreign enemy - a strategy with which Bush is all too familiar .
" We have to throw away the notion the US could not do it because it is too tied up in Iraq , " says Colonel Sam Gardiner , a former US air force officer who has carried out war games with Iran as the target .
" It is an air operation . "
Like Keech before him , it seems once Bush has got hold of a bad idea he just can't let it go .
Just because it is irresponsible , irrational , unpopular and unconscionable does n't mean he wo n't do it .
" History does not repeat itself , " Mark Twain once wrote .
" But it does rhyme . "

I 'm already a professional programmer , and I 've been doing it for quite some time now .
And not to be cocky , but I think I 'm pretty good at it ; I 'm the lead developer in my department , and I 'm the co-lead of a pretty successful open - source project .
Still , I never studied computer science ( in college I majored in literature ) .
In some sense I think this puts me at a disadvantage — not in terms of hireability or pay grade or anything professional , but when I 'm talking to other programmers , it often seems there 's a shared vocabulary I 'm missing .
So I 'd like to come up with a reading list of essential computer science books .
I 'm thinking big here : I 'd like to spend at least the next year or two reading heavily , and I read very fast .
If possible , I 'd like to put together a list that rivals what one would read in a graduate CS program .
So , hive mind , what should I read ?
I 'm trying to come up with a reading list for a " personal comp. sci. degree " ( along the lines of Josh Kaufman 's " personal MBA " reading list ) .
What books should be on my list ?
Sometimes the most important thing in a fight is which side you are on , and not whether that side can win or not .
Sometimes we just have to believe that , eventually , good will win out , and we have ask ourselves , “ How will my children judge me when I tell them the story of this time ? ”
When my kids ask me about the first black man who really had a shot for the presidency , will I be forced to dissemble : ‘ Well , see , kids , at the time , I did n’t think he could win , so it seemed expedient for me … ’
Let ’s start by dispelling one ugly myth about voting “ strategically ” ( as we say in Canada ) or for someone “ elect - able ” ( as you say in America ) :
It is n’t about the outcome of the election .

The Wisdom of Crowds explains why crowds do a better job than experts predicting the future and evaluating worth .
Of especial interest is the author 's analysis of information cascades and the deep flaws introduced when organizations attempt to harness the wisdom of crowds in committees and meetings .
Synonyms for expedient include “ backwards compatible , ” “ maintainable , ” “ easy to understand , ” “ easy to sell to management , ” and many others .

They have no idea how to manage software development to a deadline , so forcing developers to estimate every activity in advance — no matter how far the activity is away — relieves their anxiety that they will have to ever explain whether a project is on target for release or not .
Instead , they can simply parrot how much of “ The Plan ” seems to be complete and whether actual times for activities are ahead or behind estimates .
They have no idea how to manage stake holder expectations and priorities , so forcing stake holders to specify all of their requirements in advance relives their anxiety that they will have to engage stake holders in a continuous and open dialogue over the life of the project .
The road to senior management in their organization is paved with process documentation , not successful projects .
Be careful when presented with a choice between what we value and what is “ expedient . ”
This choice is almost always a false dichotomy : the “ expedient ” option is usually a little white lie someone else has told us because they think it will sound reasonable .
If you ’re reading this blog and telling me that you — to pick just one example — choose to program .NET because “ that ’s where the money is , ” you are misguided .
Sorry , but the money is actually on Wall Street or Bay Street where even the poorest analyst makes more money with convexities and gammas than you or I will ever make with objects and tables .
Wil Shipley : This blog is not about politics , and it is especially not about politics in another country .
If you are one of my American readers , I expect you to decide for yourself what is the right thing to do with your vote , time , and money .
That being said , I quoted Wil because I admire something that he is saying there , something that is on topic for this blog .
Let ’s start by dispelling one ugly myth about voting “ strategically ” ( as we say in Canada ) or for someone “ elect - able ” ( as you say in America ) :
It is n’t about the outcome of the election .
That ’s a little white lie people tell themselves so they can do something they are embarrassed about .
They are really thinking “ Here ’s this thing that I ought to want to do , vote for the best man who happens to be Black , but — truth be told — I do n’t want to do it .
But I absolutely do n’t want to admit I do n’t want to do it , so …
I ’ll make up this story about expediency and how important it is for a Donkey to beat an Elephant , so I ’ll nominate this other guy to run .
” Did you read my “ Do n’t Feed the Trolls ” post ?
One of the key lessons was that people often are embarrassed about their real motivations for making decisions , so they dress them up in objections that they think sound reasonable to other people .
Like winning elections .
I ’m going to come back to this in a moment .
You are a stack - based reasoner , right ?
Sothe idea that what people say about why they are doing things rarely matches why people are actually doing things .
Think about your software development values .
A value is something you are willing to pay for .
I ca n’t tell you what your values ought to be , but I can tell you one thing that absolutely is n’t a value .
Making money is not a value .
It ’s an expediency .
Money is almost always a “ reasonable objection to tell other people . ”
For example , taking a job with a consulting firm because “ it pays more money . ”
When what you really want is the prestige of going into workplaces and telling people what to do .
Without bothering to actually , you know , have any real industry experience first .
Synonyms for “ making money ” include “ getting a job , ” “ sales , ” “ raising capital , ” amongst many others .
Now we have already talked about people that have a value but ca n’t admit it so they tell a little white lie about “ expediency . ”
It ’s not just politics .
Do you think our choices in software development are any different ?
Of course not .are the same whether we are choosing mates , voting , or picking a programming language .
So the way we choose is the same .
But there ’s an extra dimension we are not considering .
If you read The Wisdom of Crowds , you remember this idea of an information cascade , where information about other people ’s choices actually makes the crowd more stupid , not more wise .
The problem is this : when we see a bunch of people doing something , it seems like a reasonable , sane option .
So do you want your fourth Java Certification ?
It seems reasonable , a lot of people are getting their certification , it ’s an expedient way of getting a job .
Or let ’s pick something that is n’t such a blatant straw man .
Do you want to put your business logic into stored procedures instead of in your model objects ?
Or perhaps do you want to build yet another rich MVC web application instead of something REST - ful or perhaps one that is continuation - based ( like a Seaside application ) ?
Really ?
Or is it just expedient to do it that way ( synonyms for expedient include “ backwards compatible , ” “ maintainable , ” “ easy to understand , ” “ easy to sell to management , ” and many others ) .
So you ’re a reasonable person , and you see a lot of other reasonable people doing something because it ’s expedient .
You value something , but you are wondering whether you ought to compromise your value in favour of expediency .
Life is tough some times , and you have to grow up .
What ’s wrong with that ?
Here ’s where we go to the stack : .
Remember , lots of those other people are n’t actually doing the expedient thing when they say they ’re being expedient !
They ’ve got a whole ‘ nother motivation , but they lied about that motivation to you .
It is n’t a real reason , they are n’t being honest with you ( or themselves ) about why they ’re doing it , and you go along with it thinking it ’s a real , valid option .
But it ’s smoke and mirrors for other people ’s frailties ( bless them , they are as human as we are ) .
For example , the argument that BDUF is the expedient way to manage a project ?
Look , I ’ll level with you : if what you want is to demonstrate to your manager that you have everything under control , that you are in charge , then go for it .
But expedient ?
Sorry , that ’s bunk .
It ’s just a little white lie a lot of people have told you because they fear telling the truth , like : Yes , we have to grow up and consider expediency .
But we also have to grow up and learn that other people are human and do n’t always tell us the whole truth about why they do what they do .
Which means it is difficult to judge whether something is right for us based on what other people say is right for them .
We need to be very , very , very careful when presented with a choice between what we value and what is “ expedient . ”
This choice is almost always a false dichotomy : the “ expedient ” option is usually a little white lie someone else has told us because they think it will sound reasonable , even if it is n’t what they were thinking .
Therefore my exhortation to you is this :
If you really , truly want to program in Lisp , or manage your next project with BDUF , or write unit tests before you write code , because these actions reflect your values , then go ahead .
I honour you for your choice , even if it ’s different than my choice .
Rock on !
But … if you really , truly want something else but are doing the expedient thing because that ’s where the money is , or the jobs are , or there ’s safety from criticism , or any of a hundred or a thousand or ten thousand little white lies , stop it right now .
You need to understand that the chattering voices you hear , the ones that sound so reasonable ( “ Zune sucks , but MSFT always wins in the end , so buying a Zune is expedient ” ) do n’t even reflect what those other people really think or want .
They ’re just little white lies other people are telling you because they do n’t have the courage to tell you the truth about themselves .

TALKING on a cellphone is more distracting for a driver than talking to a fellow passenger .
And now we may know why .
While a car is moving , the strength of signal received by a driver ’s phone continually changes , and the phone often has to switch from one base station to another during a call .
That causes a slight loss of sound quality , forcing the driver ’s brain to work harder to work out what the person at the other end is saying , say Takashi Hamada and colleagues at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Tokyo , Japan .

Ok I find one very interesting , cool optical illusion and similar to the dragon one but this is a definitely better , I agree dragon illusion is really a wonderfull but this is also one cool illusion !
When you move around , the face seems to follow you around the room if you stare in it 's eyes .
Have a look at the video , to see what I mean .
The effect is frightening !
However the face gives us the wrong clues , because we mis-interpret what its shape is .
We assume that the nose of the face is pointing out towards us , but in fact the face is concave .
Yes I remember the dragon illusion , but I also look this illusion and I circuitry can tell you this is awesome optical illusion , just similar like dragon one !

Scientists are creating artificial bones using a modified version of an inkjet printer .
The technology creates perfect replicas of bones that have been damaged and these can then be inserted in the body to help it to heal .
The process will revolutionise bone graft surgery , which currently relies on either bits of bone taken from other parts of the body or ceramic - like substitutes .
More follows ...
Professor Jake Barralet of McGill University in Montreal , Canada , explained : " The " paper " in our printer is a thin bed of cement - like powder .
The inkjets spray the cement with an acid which reacts with it and goes hard .
" That deals with one layer .
Then new layers of fresh powder are sprayed on top , and the layers build up to the shape we need . "
It takes only ten minutes for the printer , which is the size of about three filing cabinets , to print a typical bone graft .
The printed graft acts as a bridge to allow the body to replace the damaged section with new bone .
Crucially , the substance created by the printing process contains the same building blocks as real human bone , allowing the graft to eventually dissolve harmlessly into the body .
The sections made by the printer are so precise that spaces can be left to encourage the regrowth of tissue and blood vessels through the graft , mirroring the make - up of normal bone .
Professor Barralet said : " The holes in the bone graft will affect how new bone grows into the graft .
" You can design it so you encourage it in a particular direction , to get different tissue repair .
It is mainly useful in areas where you need a very good sort of fit , like cosmetic surgery or reconstructive surgery , or in the spine where you do n't want to be playing around to get something to fit .
" We 're a long way from seeing this used in a hospital setting , but it 's an important first step . "
A team of scientists at Manchester University led by Professor Brian Derby are working on a similar printing method to make sheets of artificial skin .
For the three months October to December 2006 compared to the same period a year earlier :
Latest three months
Total production of indigenous primary fuels in the three months to December 2006 stood at 48.0 million tonnes of oil equivalent , 11.7 per cent lower than the corresponding period a year ago .
Regular readers will not be surprised by the core data , in summary :
The Department of Trade and Industry ( DTI ) today ( 22nd Feb 2007 ) released the latest national energy statistics to the end of 2006 .
The Excel sheets can be downloaded here
electricity produced from nuclear sources fell by 24.1 per cent ;
The critical point in my mind is this :
This is due to the extended closure of several power stations due to defects in boiler pipes and aggressive cracking of the graphite cores .
The reactors are approaching end of life , these problems were anticipated to a certain degree and are resulting in reduced availability .
These problems do make it increasingly unlikely that life time extensions will be granted .
Production is of course only half the story .
To complete the picture we must also consider the consumption data also published today :
Main points
In 2006 total consumption was 232.9 million tonnes of oil equivalent , 0.6 per cent lower than in 2005 .
Within this , consumption of oil had risen by 0.8 per cent , consumption of Coal and other Solids had risen by 9.6 per cent whereas consumption of natural gas had fallen by 5.0 per cent .
Latest three months
Total inland consumption of primary fuels , which includes deliveries into consumption , was 62.2 million tonnes of oil equivalent during the three months to December 2006 , 2.4 per cent lower than recorded for the same period a year ago .
On a temperature corrected basis , total inland consumption of primary fuels was 0.6 per cent higher during the three months to December 2006 than that recorded for the same period a year ago .
For October to December 2006 annualised temperature corrected and seasonally adjusted figures , compared to the same period a year earlier show that : consumption of oil had risen by 7.8 per cent ;
consumption of coal and other solid fuels had fallen by 1.3 per cent ;
consumption of natural gas remained broadly unchanged .
This brings us to the familiar picture with its rapidly growing gap representing an increasing balance of payments deficit :

Javascript Object Notation ( JSON ) is a fancy name for a simple idea : A web page can download data stored as javascript variables .
It ’s caused a buzz in the tech world because JSON is much easier to load , read and manipulate compared to XML .
Also , parsing large XML files can be a large performance hit – JSON gives you an object , packaged up and ready to go !
Remember the Script Tag ?
In javascript you can import any script using notation like this :
< script src= " http://www.mysite.com/myscript.js "></ script>
The browser will pull down the script and run it inside the current page .
This is how embeddable widgets like Adsense and InstaCalc work .
The neat thing is that any variables and functions defined inside the script are available to the page .
If myscript.js includes a function showMeTheMoney ( ) , your page can call it ( and , presumably , get shown the money ) .
This is all fine and dandy , and been known for a while .
A cool use is to provide dynamic data to a page with encoded Javascript variables .
If the variables were “ objects ” and we passed them using their special “ notation ” , we could call the system JavaScript Object Notation .
( Technically , JSON just covers the “ object ” part ; executable functions are dynamic javascript ) .
In Javascript , you can use objects like this :
var fruit = {} ; // create new obj fruit .
name = " apple " ; // set properties fruit. color = " red " ; // that is old fashioned !
Try my new notation : var fancy Fruit = { " name " : " pear " , " color " : " greenish " } ;
Javascript has a nice notation where you can define objects using " key " : " value " pairs .
You can define arrays and functions this way too , so your objects are more like a class , in fact .
So why is this useful again ?
So far , passing scripts around is old news .
But an idea comes along : what if you load a dynamically generated script , which has data inside of it ?
Now you can access the data as javascript variables .
Here ’s what I mean :
< script src= " http://www.weathersite.com/latestweather.js "></ script>
Today 's weather is : < script > document.write( Weather.today ) ; </ script >
See what ’s happening here ?
We load the javascript ( which could be updated every hour by the server ) , and access the Weather object it defines .
Presumably , Weather . today is a string containing today ’s weather .
Realistically , we could have Weather [ zipcode ] or whatever format the site defines .
Cool , huh ?
But Why Not XML ?
Ah — some programmers will say “ Verily , can you not download an XML file , and then process and parse it into Javascript variables ? ”
Sure , just like you can run a marathon or floss your teeth .
Many want to , some try to , not everybody does .
XML is fine for certain things , but it can be quite cumbersome .
JSON is great because you can include data in an easy , painless process .
There ’s no parsing step – you are getting your variables “ for free ” by just including the javascript file .
Also , JSON lets the site include functions , which may be used to process the data or handle other tasks .
A Few Details ( As Always )
There are various ways to use JSON ( see links for source of code sample ) :
Include a script tag directly ( as above ) .
This means the code inside the script is run immediately as the browser encounters it .
< script src= "
http://www.mysite.com/mydata.js "></ script>
Dynamically load the script tag .
You can add a javascript tag to the head of a document ( from codehouse.com ) : function dhtmlLoadScript ( url ) { var e = document.createElement (" script " ) ; e.src = url ; e.type= " text / javascript " ; document.getElementsByTagName( " head " ) [ 0].appendChild(e ) ; } dhtmlLoadScript ( " http://www.mysite.com/mydata.js " ) ;
Use an AJAX library like jQuery to access the information : $.getJSON ( " mydata.js " , function ( json ) { // access data with json. fieldname } ) ;
Note :
The first two methods can load files from any domain ; an AJAX request can normally only access files on the same domain .
For a cross - domain AJAX request , you may need to use a “ callback= ? ” parameter , like this :
http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?tags=cat&tagmode=any&format=json&jsoncallback=?
This tells jQuery to create a temporary callback function to process the data , and tells the endpoint to wrap the JSON response in that callback function ( example using jsoncallback=test ) .
Security , Security , Security
I ’m not an expert in Web Security , but I know enough to realize it ’s tricky and that there will be things I miss .
Even the big boys like Google can get caught in bugs sometimes .
The safest approach is to only store public data with JSON .
If you store private data in JSON ( or XML for that matter ) , there are techniques where malicious sites can impersonate logged - on users .
Yes , there are complicated workarounds for the security problems ( like double - submitting cookies ) .
But if you ’re starting out ( like me ) , start off using JSON for public info you do n’t mind having disclosed ( like weather reports ) .
Callbacks
The JSON data may not be a raw object ; it could be an object passed to a callback function , such as :
In this case , the script will run a function called specialFunction that you ’ve defined , passing it an anonymous object with a “ name ” and “ email ” property .
Your specialFunction can then do wild things with this information .
This technique is the same at heart – this is how Google originally passed your Gmail contacts .
Sometimes you can specify the name of your callback function in the URL you use to access the JSON data – it depends on the data provider .
Real - life Example : Currency Conversion in InstaCalc
I recently added currency conversion to the InstaCalc Online Calculator , which was a good lesson in importing data :
Find your data source .
The Federal Bank of New York has an XML file with currency conversion data .
That ’s good enough for me !
Convert data to JSON format .
You can convert XML to JSON using XSLT transformations .
Install XALAN so you can do XSL transformations using Java .
A typical transformation looks like this : java org.apache.xalan.xslt .
Process - classpath " xalan.jar " - IN in.xml - XSL in.xslt > out.xml
Be careful for Java classpath issues , I had trouble and had to include the classpath to xalan . jar manually .
Convert XML attributes to elements .
Attributes can be difficult to access in the various XML to JSON scripts , so make them elements .
Use this XSL to convert attributes to elements :
Then process the XML file using XALAN :
java org.apache.xalan.xslt .Process - classpath " xalan.jar " - IN in.xml -XSL attributes - to-elements.xslt > no-attributes.xml
Finally , convert the XML to JSON using this XSL transformation .
There are several XML 2 JSON stylesheets out there if you search .
Run your XML through XALAN to create the final JSON data .
java org.apache.xalan.xslt .Process - classpath " xalan.jar " - IN no-attributes.xml - XSL xml2json.xslt > currencies.json
Clean up your data .
You have the raw JSON data as an object , but you may wish to wrap it in a function call .
You can use a quick perl script to wrap myFunction ( ) around the data above so your file does a callback when executed .
Tada !
Now you have JSON data ready to access using one of the techniques above ( see the currency JSON data ) .
Inside InstaCalc , I have a static reference to the file :
< script src= " http://instacalc.com/data/currencies.json ">< script>
Because the bank has some namespace information , I access variables like this inside the callback function : data [ " frbny : DataSet " ] ; .
Of course , the details of how you access your JSON data will change given the format of your XML and the exact stylesheet you used .
Play around .
If you look at the raw JSON file you can see the field names you need to use .
Bonus round : Updating the JSON .
If your data changes often ( like currency data does ) , you can put the above steps into a script and run it on a schedule .
The next time your webpage is loaded , it will get the new JSON data .
Parting Thoughts
JSON is a really easy way to exchange data – just think of it as including extra javascript files in your program .

A prominent fertility scientist whose firm owns Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles is embroiled in a plagiarism dispute that straddles two continents , has triggered legal battles in South Korea and has raised questions about the practices of a leading U.S. fertility journal .
Dr. Kwang - Yul Cha , whose company also owns fertility clinics and a large hospital in Seoul , is listed as the primary author on a medical paper that appeared in December 2005 in the U.S. medical journal Fertility and Sterility .
But that paper appears to be nearly a paragraph - for - paragraph , chart - for - chart copy of a junior researcher ’s doctoral thesis , which appeared in a Korean medical journal nearly two years earlier , according to a Times review of both papers and the findings of a Korean medical society .
Cha has denied any wrongdoing .

The allegations mark the latest example of a challenge facing the editors of scientific journals : how to ensure that the work they print is honest and original .
Doctors often base medical decisions on articles printed in such journals , and researchers similarly rely on them for their studies .
In an international scandal in late 2005 , the work of another South Korean scientist was exposed as fraudulent .
Hwang Woo - Suk claimed to have created 11 stem cell lines from the DNA of sick and injured patients , publishing his work in the well - respected journal Science .
But the articles had to be retracted after questions were raised about his claims , and he ultimately apologized .
The current dispute involves the much more modest thesis of Dr. Jeong - Hwan Kim , 36 .
He showed that a simple blood test might be able to predict which women are at risk for premature menopause .
The test would allow those women to have their eggs retrieved and frozen for later use if they wanted children .
Kim said his research was conducted while he was pursuing doctoral studies at Korea University and doing clinical work at CHA infertility medical center in Seoul , which is part of Cha ’s medical group .

Cha , 54 , has received international accolades for his work on egg freezing and is well known in medical circles in South Korea .
But in the United States , he is a somewhat controversial figure .
He came under criticism a few years ago for his involvement in a study suggesting that anonymous prayers from strangers might double a woman ’s chances of fertility .
Nearly a year ago , Kim notified Fertility and Sterility that he believed his thesis had been copied by Cha and his colleagues .
But it was n’t until last week that editor in chief Dr. Alan DeCherney said he would recommend retracting Cha ’s article at an editorial board meeting in April .
DeCherney also said he would seek to ban Cha and all of the listed authors from publishing in the journal for three years .
“ I ’m sure that it ’s plagiarism , ” DeCherney said .
Cha did not respond to requests seeking comment .

He previously told South Korean prosecutors investigating Kim ’s allegations that he had contributed ideas and patient blood samples for Kim ’s thesis , according to Korean legal papers .
He said he had not known that he would be listed as the primary author on the second paper .
DeCherney ’s decision to recommend retraction of Cha ’s paper came days after he received an official request to do so from the editor of the Korean Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology , which published Kim ’s thesis in January 2004 .
That journal ’s editor in chief , Soon - Beom Kang , “ denounced ” Cha ’s article as “ a case of multiple publication , ” according to a Feb. 9 e-mail , which was reviewed by The Times .
Kang also wrote that a “ stern warning ” had been issued to one of Cha ’s co-authors , Dr. Sook - Hwan Lee , who is set to stand trial later this month in Seoul on copyright infringement charges pertaining to the research .
Cha has not been indicted in the case .

Lee told The Times that the work submitted to Fertility and Sterility was her own .
“ I myself wrote the article published in Fertility and Sterility , ” she said in an e-mail .
“ This was the outcome of the work done at my laboratory ....
Dr. Kim was one of the researchers and was involved in the project on a very limited scale . ”
She did not explain why she listed Cha ’s name first .
Kim ’s name was left off the Fertility and Sterility piece , Lee said , because she could not locate him to fill out the necessary paperwork .
Charges and countercharges are flying .
In Korean courts , Kim has sued Cha and Lee , and Lee has sued Kim .
All parties deny the accusations against them .

It is not Cha ’s first foray into controversy .
Three years after the article on prayer and fertility appeared in the Journal of Reproductive Medicine in 2001 , one of the authors pulled his name off the research , saying he had served only as an editorial advisor .
Another went to federal prison on unrelated fraud charges .
Cha continued to defend the article , and the journal did not retract it .
Cha also appears to be violating state law by using MD after his name on websites and in news releases in California .
He is not licensed to practice in the state , records show .
His resume says he received his medical training in South Korea .
“ We do n’t believe it ’s lawful for him to hold himself out in this manner , ” said Candis Cohen , a spokeswoman for the Medical Board of California .

Hollywood Presbyterian , purchased by Cha ’s medical group in 2004 , has been involved in its own scandal , the alleged dumping this month of a homeless paraplegic patient on skid row without a wheelchair or walker .
Hospital and law enforcement officials are investigating .
The plagiarism allegations have revived debate about what research journals should do in the case of alleged wrongdoing by their contributors .
Kim and some medical journal experts questioned why it took so long for Fertility and Sterility to acknowledge the problem publicly .
Kim first alerted the journal to his claims of plagiarism last March .
In July , DeCherney wrote Kim an e-mail saying the journal ’s editors “ have observed considerable overlap ” between the two articles .
But DeCherney said at the time that it was up to Kim ’s institution -- Cha ’s medical center in South Korea -- to investigate the matter and report back .

DeCherney suggested that the journal could publish an erratum saying Kim “ should have been included among the authors of the article . ”
DeCherney , chief of the reproductive biology and medicine branch at the National Institutes of Health and former chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at UCLA , defended his actions .
“ We have to depend upon the authors to have integrity , ” he said in an interview .
“ We ’re not the policemen . ”
He also said there was no need for speed in this case , because the article was about scientific observation and not clinical findings .

“ What ’s the harm ? ” he asked .
“ I ’m going to fix it , but it ’s not like somebody published that vitamin B cures infertility or vitamin B causes your hair to fall out ....
This is not Nobel Prize stuff . ”
Marcia Angell , former editor in chief of the New England Journal of Medicine , said Fertility and Sterility should have responded sooner .
“ It sounds to me like an awful , awful tangle of problems across the Pacific Ocean , ” she said .
“ Nevertheless , the journal here has got to deal with it . ”
A review of Fertility and Sterility ’s standards for authors shows that Cha ’s article violated at least one rule : Published articles may not have appeared elsewhere or be under consideration by other journals .
In addition , the rules state , listed authors must have “ participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for the content . ”

“ It ’s very shameful , ” said Kim , a South Korean national who now works in Singapore .
Cha and other authors tried to advance their careers , he said , “ using someone else ’s very junior work word - for - word .
That is a very shameful thing . ”
According to Kim , he submitted the paper to the Korean Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology on July 31 , 2003 , as he was preparing to leave the country for Singapore .
Kim said he did the vast majority of the work , but listed other authors who advised him or provided bits of assistance .
Although the work showed promise , it was based on a small sample , and Kim acknowledged that it would have to be tested and replicated by others .
In March 2006 , one of his colleagues in the U.S. alerted him to the paper published in Fertility and Sterility without his name .
Advertisement
“ Then , I searched the Internet myself and found a huge amount of articles , including major TV news , on it , ” he wrote in an e-mail .
Kim found out that Cha ’s group of authors had presented the research as their own at a meeting of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine in October 2004 .
Lee also had filed a patent on the findings .
Kim began to publicly protest , making his case on a website .
In April 2006 , lawyers for Cha ’s hospital in Seoul wrote Kim a letter accusing him of libel , divulging trade secrets and theft of study notes and data .
The letter , which The Times had translated into English , said Cha ’s institution in South Korea “ cannot take it anymore .
Please understand and take it to heart that this is a last straw . ”
Two months later , however , Lee sought to settle the matter .
“ Let ’s just forget about this thing , ” she wrote Kim .
“ I will admit to the fact that I was careless . ”
Advertisement
Because the dispute involved a well - known researcher , Kim said some colleagues began to question his legitimacy .
“ My colleagues in two countries ... were wondering if I had ‘ bought ’ an article for my PhD thesis , ” he said in an e-mail to The Times .
“ As a result , I had to convince colleagues and bosses one by one that it was done by me , and I was indeed a victim . ”

Times special correspondent Jinna Park in Seoul contributed to this report .
About a month ago , the New Yorker published Killing Habeas Corpus , Jeffrey Toobin 's profile of Senator Specter 's take on the Military Commissions Act ( aka ' The Torture Bill ' ) .
It contained a revealing fact about the Senator , a fact whose significance Toobin seemed to have missed .
Toobin quotes Specter as saying ,
Specter is hoping the courts will restore the rights of the detainees to bring habeas cases .
“ The bill was severable .
It has a severability clause .
And I think the courts will invalidate it , ” he told me .
“ They ’re not going to give up authority to decide habeas - corpus cases , not a chance . ”
Trouble is , the final version of the Military Commissions Act — the one the President signed — does n't have a severability provision , although some earlier versions did .
In theory , that usually means that the bill stands or falls as a whole — if one part of the bill is unconstitutional , the whole bill is void .
( There are exceptions , for when the courts find Congress could n't have intended that . )
So my colleague Steve Vladeck and I wrote the New Yorker a letter .
To the Editor : In Jeffrey Toobin 's marvelous profile of Senator Arlen Specter ( “ Killing Habeas Corpus , ” Dec. 4 ) , the Senator reveals that he labors under a fascinating misapprehension regarding potential judicial review of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 .
Senator Specter states that the Act contains a severability clause , and that , therefore , excision of the controversial ( and , in our view , unconstitutional ) habeas provision would have no implications for the continuing force of the rest of the Act .
In fact , as anyone who reads the Act will quickly discover , the statute as signed by the President contains no such provision .
As a result , if the Supreme Court were to strike down any part of the statute , it would have to consider whether the rest of the Act can survive the loss .
As the habeas - stripping clause was the subject of its own vote in the Senate , and the legislative history shows that the severability clause was removed during the consideration of the bill , it would be very difficult for the Court to find legislative intent supporting severability .
We draw some comfort from this observation , although not from the apparent failure of one of the bill 's coauthors to understand what he was voting for .

The New Yorker just published it , in a version that keeps the essential point but edited all the cute out of it :
Toobin 's profile reveals that Specter labors under a misapprehension regarding potential judicial review of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 .
Specter states that the Act contains a severability clause , and that , therefore , excision of the controversial habeas provision would have no implications for the rest of the Act .
In fact , the statute contains no such provision , and , if the Supreme Court were to strike down any part of the statute , it would have to consider whether the rest of the Act can survive the loss .
Since legislative history shows that the severability clause was removed during the consideration of the bill , it would be very difficult for the Court to find legislative intent supporting it .

Of course , both Steve and I have complete faith that the Supreme Court could , if it wanted , find some excuse to sever the habeas provisions of the MCA from the rest of the bill — all they'd have to do is change current severability doctrine to fit .
Whether it could be done in a principled way , on the other hand …
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - New York City symbolically banned use of the word nigger on Wednesday , the latest step in a campaign that hopes to expunge the most vile of racial slurs from hip hop music and television .
The City Council unanimously declared a moratorium that carries no penalty but aims to stop youth from casually using the word , considered by most Americans to be the most offensive in the English language .
The New York City measure follows similar resolutions this month by the New York state assembly and state senate , and supporters of the ban are taking their campaign to The Recording Academy , asking it not to nominate musicians for Grammy awards if they use the word in their lyrics .
Many rap artists and young New Yorkers toss the word around as a term of endearment or as a substitute for black , angering some black leaders who consider those who use it as ignorant of the word ’s hate - filled history in slavery and segregation .
“ This could be the beginning of a movement , ” councilman Albert Vann said .
Councilman Leroy Comrie , a sponsor of the moratorium , said the campaign against the word has gained strength since comedian Michael Richards spewed it in a racially charged tirade in Los Angeles .
The Laugh Factory club where Richards performed has since banned comedians from using the word there and the former “ Seinfeld ” television star has apologized .
“ The Michael Richards incident really brought it to another level .
It has forced people to express their outrage .
Many people had been seething quietly , ” Comrie said .
Comrie also asked TV network Black Entertainment Television to stop using the word in its shows .
Representatives of BET did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
A Grammy spokesman said he doubted the academy ’s 11,000 voting members would support any measure that might censor artists .
“ They are not going to be supportive of something that excludes someone simply because they are using a word that is offensive , ” said Ron Roecker , vice president of communication for the Recording Academy .
The city resolution calling for the moratorium traces the etymology of the word from the Latin “ niger , ” meaning black , to its first documented written use in 1786 as a term slave masters used to label their African slaves .
Use of the word by blacks exploded with the rise of rap music in recent years , and some black comedians like Chris Rock continue to use it in their routines .
“ What , is there a fine ?
Am I going to get a ticket ? ” Rock mocked in a Reuters interview when asked about the City Council move .
“ Do judges say , ‘ 10 years , nigger ! ’ ”
Rock said politicians were trying to divert attention from real problems : “ Enough real bad things happen in this city to worry about how I am going to use the word . ”
Greice Coelho , who took Mr. Paszkiewicz ’s class and is a member of his youth group , said in a letter to The Observer , the local weekly newspaper , that Matthew was “ ignoring the First Amendment to the United States Constitution , which gives every citizen the freedom of religion . ”
Some anonymous posters on the town ’s electronic bulletin board , Kearnyontheweb.com , called for Matthew ’s suspension .

On the sidewalks outside the high school , which has 1,750 students , many agreed with 15 - year - old Kyle Durkin , who said , “ I ’m on the teacher ’s side all the way . ”
While science teachers , particularly in the Bible Belt , have been known to refuse to teach evolution , the controversy here , 10 miles west of Manhattan , hinges on assertions Mr. Paszkiewicz made in class , including how a specific Muslim girl would go to hell .
“ This is extremely rare for a teacher to get this blatantly evangelical , ” said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn , executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State , a nonprofit educational association .
“ He ’s really out there proselytizing , trying to convert students to his faith , and I think that that ’s more than just saying I have some academic freedom right to talk about the Bible ’s view of creation as well as evolution . ”
Even some legal organizations that often champion the expression of religious beliefs are hesitant to support Mr. Paszkiewicz .
“ It ’s proselytizing , and the courts have been pretty clear you ca n’t do that , ” said John W. Whitehead , president of the Rutherford Institute , a group that provides legal services in religious freedom cases .
“ You ca n’t step across the line and proselytize , and that ’s what he ’s done here . ”
The class started on Sept. 11 , and Matthew quickly grew concerned .
“ The first couple of days I had him , he had already begun discussing his religious point of view , ” Matthew , a thin , articulate 16 - year - old with braces and a passion for politics and the theater , recalled in an interview .
“ It was n’t even just his point of view , it went beyond that to say this is the right way , this is the only way .
The way he said it , I was n’t sure how far he was going to go . ”
Nuclear fusion has evoked opinions in the various energy blogs ranging from “ sixty years of failure and a certain dead end ” , to “ the reason why we do not need to worry about peak oil ” .
This event was a good opportunity to gain a clearer view of what part , if any , fusion energy could play in filling the gap as oil and then gas production peak and decline .
After many years of half - hearted support there is now a surge of backing for fusion energy .
Many will have heard about the agreement to built the International Tokamak Experimental Reactor ITER .
Less well publicised have been the European Fast Track program and the bilateral agreement between the EU and Japan called ‘ the Broader Approach ’ which , amongst other things , will lead to DEMO , the first full electrical power generating reactor .
From the UK side this new found enthusiasm has been in large part due to Sir David King , the Chief Scientific Advisor to the government , who may not fully accept the imminence of peak oil , but does see an energy crisis looming and has become convinced that the possibility of fusion energy is promising enough to warrant substantial investment .
The four speakers in the seminar were senior members of the staff of the Culham Division of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority ( UKAEA ) .
The lecture was given by Dr. Frank Briscoe , operations director at Culham .
Culham has been the centre of fusion research in the UK since 1960 when the first large scale UK fusion experiment , ZETA was transferred there from Harwell .
ZETA was still there , but no longer working , when I first visited Culham from Harwell as a student in 1964 .
I have retained a personal interest in fusion since then .
Of particular interest to this forum were the Ewing lecture itself , entitled ‘ Magnetic Fusion Energy : Progress and the Remaining Challenges ’ and the seminar presentation by Dr. Derek Stork entitled ‘ Scientific and Engineering Challenges of a DEMO Fusion Reactor ’ .
Since the various contributions overlapped somewhat and some of the material was of specialised interest to those involved in magnetics , I have combined those parts of the contributions that I hope are of interest to this forum .
Dr. Briscoe started his lecture with a brief summary of how nuclear fusion works .
Fusion Basics
Atomic energy , both fission and fusion , exploits the fact that atoms weigh less than the sum of their parts .
This is because of the energy that binds them together and is released in forming the atom from its constituent protons , neutrons and electrons and would have to be expended to rip the atom apart back to these constituent parts .
The energy released in binding relates directly to the drop in mass of the atom by Einstein ’s equation E = mc² .
This loss in mass is called the mass defect and varies between the elements .
Energy can be released by either splitting very heavy atoms in two ( fission ) or joining light atoms together ( fusion ) .
Mass defect :
The mass of an atom of each element expressed as a percentage
of the mass of the protons , neutrons and electrons that constitute the atom .
The three isotopes of hydrogen plus the most common or stable isotope of
the other elements are shown .

The problem with trying to fuse atoms together is that , although there is a very strong force of attraction between the protons and neutrons in the nucleus when they are very close due to the strong nuclear force , this force drops away very rapidly with distance so that at slightly greater distances the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged protons becomes dominant .
To fuse the nuclei of two atoms , they have to be forced together hard enough to overcome this repulsion until they are close enough together for the force to become attractive .
Many different fusion reactions and many ways of bringing the atoms together have been considered .
Far and away the front runner , in terms of progress to achieve a large scale commercial electrical power plant , is the reaction between the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium when heated to a temperature such that thermal collisions between the nuclei carry enough energy to overcome the electrostatic repulsion with magnetic forces being used to confine the reactants .
The temperature required to cause the reaction is in the order of a hundred millions degrees .
At such a temperature the reactants are completely dissociated into a cloud of nuclei and electrons called a plasma .
The plasma is far too hot to confine with material walls but because the electrons and nuclei are charged and moving they can be deflected by magnetic forces and with a suitably shaped magnetic field , confined .
The fusion reaction is deuterium plus tritium gives helium plus a neutron :
2 H + 3 H —› 4 He + n
20 % of the energy released by the reaction is carried off by the helium ion as kinetic energy ( 3.5 Mev per ion ) .
Since the helium is ionised it is charged and is confined by the magnetic field .
In colliding with the rest of the plasma it gives up its kinetic energy , heating the plasma .
If the condition called ignition can be reached this will be the only source of heat needed to maintain the plasma temperature once ignited .
The other 80 % of the reaction energy will be carried off by the kinetic energy of the neutrons ( 14.1MeV per neutron ) .
Since the neutron is not charged it escapes the plasma .
In a reactor designed to generate power , a ‘ blanket ’ surrounds the plasma and the collisions the neutrons make with the material of the blanket transfers the kinetic energy of the neutron to the blanket , heating it up .
This heat , plus a little gained from absorbing the hard ultraviolet / soft gamma radiation emitted by the plasma , is transferred out of the chamber by a gas or liquid and used to heat steam , to drive a turbine , which turns an alternator to generate electricity .
Deuterium exists in enormous quantities in sea water where it forms 0.03 % by weight of the hydrogen but tritium exists naturally in only tiny amounts generated by cosmic rays , and decays away with a half life of 12.3 years , so that there is only about 3.6 kg of naturally generated tritium at any one time distributed all around the planet .
All other tritium has to be made artificially .
In a commercial reactor the blanket will also perform the function of creating tritium .
It will contain lithium in some form and this will react with the neutrons bombarding it to form tritium using the reaction :-
n + 6 Li —› 3 H + 4 He
This tritium will be collected to fuel the continuing fusion reaction .
Lithium 6 is a stable isotope and forms 7.5 % of natural lithium .
Some blanket designs require enrichment of this isotope .
The tritium breeding reaction is exothermic and increases the heat production by some 20 % .
At first sight these reactions appears to combine to give an overall reaction of : -
2 H + 6 Li —› 2 4 He
However this neat cancellation requires that every neutron from the fusion reaction reacts with a lithium atom to form a tritium atom and that every tritium atom so generated is collected and fed back into the reactor and takes part in a neutron generating fusion reaction .
In practice there are many loss mechanisms around the loop that mean that this path alone will not provide sufficient tritium to maintain operation .
To augment the tritium production a neutron multiplier is added to the lithium .
The main candidates for a neutron multiplier are beryllium and lead .
Experiments have shown that tritium self - sufficiency is possible but difficult .
To generate much in the way of a surplus is very difficult .
Dr. Stork indicated that a tritium breeding ratio of about 1.1 was all that was expected of the designs being considered .
This implies that for every 10kg of tritium fed in as fuel for the fusion reaction , 11kg of tritium will be recovered from the blanket .
The magnitude of the excess tritium available is probably the limiting factor on how fast fusion energy can spread once a prototype commercial fusion reactor has been demonstrated , as discussed below .
Magnetic Confinement
As part of his seminar presentation , Dr Tom Todd gave a fascinating review of the very varied magnetic confinement systems that have been , and are being , experimented with but again by far and away the front runner in the race to practical power systems are the toriodal systems first developed by the Russians called ‘ tokamaks&rsquo , from a Russian acronym .
The biggest and most successful tokamak so far is the European run JET system hosted in the UK at Culham .
This produced a peak of 16MW of fusion power in 1997 but many other tokamaks have been built across the world .
Critics of fusion power have categorised these experiments as so many failures because none of them have produced more output fusion power than was put in .
In truth none of them were built with the intention of achieving energy break - even .
All were intended to understand and develop ways of controlling the seething monster that a dense plasma at a temperature of many millions of degrees is .
For the most part these experiments have , after a fair bit of modification and adjustment , reached the sort of performance hoped for .
Our ability to contain the plasma at high temperature , high density and for long enough to allow a sufficient degree of reaction to take place has increased four orders of magnitude over 40 years .
This shows the progress over the years at confining a hot plasma .
The fusion product
is the plasma density in particles / m³ times the time in seconds that the plasma
can be held in these conditions , times the ion temperature in degrees Kelvin .
The requirement for this to be at least 3 x 10 28 for ignition to occur in a
deuterium / tritium plasma is one of the Lawson criteria formulated by JD Lawson 1955 .
The best results of JET and JT - 60U are close to energy break - even , Q = 1 .

There has also been great progress in predicting the performance of a plasma device as computer power has increased , so there are now fewer surprises in new experiments .

variety of conditions plus indications of where ITER and a commercial power reactor are
expected to operate by scaling the results of existing machines .

Although there is still more work to do on plasma control , we have now reached the stage where we can be reasonably confident that just scaling up the size of the reactor will produce substantially more power from fusion than is put in to create the reaction .
Such a reactor has been designed in detail and the major parts have already been prototyped .
On 21 November 2006 , after years of delay , an agreement was signed to build ITER at Cadarache in France financed by China , the EU , India , Japan , Russia , South Korea , and the USA .
Together these partners represent over half the population of the planet .
Jet and ITER :
The two reactors are shown in cut away diagrams .

Power will be feed into the ITER plasma in three main ways : by transformer action causing up to 15 million amps to flow in the plasma ; by neutral high energy beams of deuterium and tritium fired into the plasma ; and by radio frequency energy fed in from antenna patches in the walls to excite resonances in the plasma , Transformer action is very efficient but necessarily pulsed .
The other two forms of heating are less efficient but can be continuous .
ITER is expected to generate 500MW of fusion energy output , with less than a tenth of that input power ( Q>10 ) and hold that power for 400 seconds .
Also it should generate 500MW output for an hour at an input of one fifth the input energy ( Q> 5 ) .
Although it is not stated as an aim , there is the hope that it might achieve what is called ignition where enough of the fusion energy remains in the plasma to keep the reaction going without the need of external input energy ( Q = infinity ) .
This will require higher plasma densities than needed with external energy input .
Although there seems to be reasonable confidence that ITER will come at least close to the target in plasma performance this is just the start of the challenge that needs to be met to build a commercial electrical power generating station .
If all goes well ITER will produce the first plasma before the end of 2016 , but , in order to speed the development of commercial fusion power , a ‘ Fast Track ’ strategy is being adopted and in addition to the ITER agreement there has been a bilateral agreement between the EU and Japan called ‘ the Broader Approach ’ .
Studies of the DEMO reactor to follow ITER are part of this agreement .
Beyond ITER
A major hurdle to be jumped is the design the breeding blanket that lines the inside of the reaction chamber and the selection of suitable materials for it .
This blanket is required for three purposes ; to convert the energy given off by the fusion reaction to heat , to breed more tritium to fuel the reaction and to protect the superconducting coils and chamber wall from neutron irradiation
There are a variety of different blanket designs that have been proposed and all of them have some problematical features to them .
ITER will not have ( certainly not in the early years ) a full tritium breeding blanket .
Most of the reaction chamber will be lined with a simple cooled neutron and heat absorbing blanket to stop the reactor overheating .
There will however be space to fit in and remove small areas of tritium breeding blanket and it is proposed to try , in turn , a variety of different designs .
Montage of some of the proposed Test Blanket Modules .

DEMO will have a full breeding blanket to achieve tritium self - sufficiency .
The materials used to make the breeding blanket and particularly the first wall facing the plasma need to survive an extremely severe combination of conditions and retain adequate strength and other mechanical properties .
The heat flux on the first wall of the blanket will 0.1 to 0.3 MW / m² in ITER and rise to 0.5 MW / m² in DEMO .
This DEMO figure is about twice that of a PWR type fission reactor and almost the same as a fast breeder fission reactor ,
The flux of energetic neutrons means that over about 5 years every atom in the first wall will have been knocked out of place an average of about 3 times for ITER and 50 - 80 times in DEMO and perhaps twice this in a full scale commercial reactor .
Each displacement will shift the atom several tens of crystal lattice spaces from its original site .
Atomic transmutations caused by the neutron flux will leave hydrogen and helium embedded in the wall .
For DEMO this will result in 500 - 800 parts per million by atom count ( appm ) of helium and 2300 to 3600 appm of hydrogen .
For ITER it will be acceptable for the blanket to be well cooled to keep it at a fairly low temperature but in a reactor trying to generate electricity by a conventional steam cycle , it is important for high thermal efficiency that steam and hence the blanket coolant are run at as high a temperature as possible .
It is expected that the blanket structure will operate at 500 °C to 800°C
This combination of requirements mean there is almost no chance of a breeder blanket that can survive the full life of the reactor .
After a few years the material properties of the blanket structure will have degraded so much that it will have to be replaced .
The inside of the chamber will be far too radioactive for a person to go in there , and so a remote handling arm will have reach in through one of the ports , bending around the central pillar where required , and remove the old blanket , section by section and replace it , section by section with a new blanket disconnecting and reconnecting the pipework ( probably by cutting and re-welding ) without spillage .
The sections are likely to weigh several tonnes .
The blanket sections will have to have a fairly tight fit to protect all the chamber wall and coils , but the extreme service conditions mean that they will be significantly distorted at the end of their service life .
They must not jam in place or the long articulated arm will not be able to pull them out .
There is reasonable confidence that a blanket of some sort came be built to operate for some length of time but the economics of a future power station will depend heavily on how hot the blanket can run and how long it can survive before replacement and how fast it can be replaced .
The remote handling arm is a major engineering challenge .
The helium generated in the plasma by the fusion reaction and any other contaminants such as material coming off the structure under severe bombardment , need to be removed from the plasma continuously to allow the reaction to continue .
To this end , at the bottom of the reaction chamber there is a divertor structure where the magnetic field is reduced so that a small fraction of the plasma separates and is allowed to cool as it circulates to the point where it recombines to form neutral atoms before colliding with the divertor plates .
The gases can then be pumped out and the hydrogen isotopes separated for re-injection .
Although the plasma has been cooled before hitting the divertor plates the heat flux on them is still enormous .
In the DEMO reactor it will be about 15 MW / m² .
This is about 15 % of the energy generated by the fusion reaction and this energy will taken away by a coolant ( probably helium ) and will be used to generate electricity together with the heat from the blanket .
15 MW / m² is about 20 % of the power density at the surface of the sun .
There is even less chance of the divertor plates lasting the lifetime of the reactor .
In fact the lifetime may be as short as two years and these will also need to be replaced by remote handling in sections usually called cassettes .
As well as all the other requirements that must be met by the materials of the blanket and divertor , it is important that the amount of radioactivity induced in them by neutron bombardment is minimised .
This precludes the use of some elements that might otherwise be useful for alloying .
Theoretically there are no net radioactive materials produced by the main reactions of the reactor since the tritium is recycled .
However there will be radioactive waste due to side effects such as neutron activation and tritium embedded in the structure .
This will affect both the replaced parts during the reactors life time and the reactor itself when it is decommissioned .
Predicting the level of radioactivity of the waste is difficult and impurity levels will have a strong influence .
However the radioactivity has been estimated to be 2 orders of magnitude less than a fission reactor and to be short lived , so that after 100 years the level of radiotoxicity will be less than the waste from an equivalent - sized coal fired power station , Keeping the radiotoxicity low will require the tritium recovery and recycling to be achieved with extremely low leakage .
Decay with time of radiotoxicity .

The development and testing of materials to meet these very onerous requirements is crucial to the speed of deployment of fusion energy .
Because ITER will not produce a plasma for almost 10 years at best and even then will not produce a neutron flux anywhere near as intense as in DEMO and that only intermittently , it has been decided to build a special facility to reproduce , over a small area , the conditions that DEMO and following reactors will have to face .
This will be called the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility ( IFMIF ) .
This will be developed and tested in Japan as part of the Broader Approach agreement , although the final site for the installation has not yet been agreed .
At IFMIF two 40MeV linear accelerators will provide 250 mA of deuterons which will be targeted on flowing liquid lithium to produce neutrons with an energy spectrum up to 14 Mev matching that expected in DEMO .
The flux will be sufficient to produce 20 displacements per atom per year in the test samples .
Further steps that will be taken to speed up development are that the JET reactor at Culham will have its present carbon chamber lining converted back to a metal wall to provide test data on this material for ITER and DEMO and the JT - 60 tokamak will upgraded to have superconducting coils and to act as a satellite control for ITER .
A smaller UK Tokamak MAST , which has a toroidal plasma aspect ratio squeezed so tight that it is like a spherical apple with the core cut out , will also provide input to the DEMO design .

Timetable
A timetable has been proposed for the overlapping development of the various proposed devices .
It assumes that the only obstacles to its implementation are technical ones and comes with many caveats , but it sees the first commercial power station operational in 2048 .
Even if this very compressed time table is met , it does not signify the widespread availability of fusion power .
There is a limit to the rate at which the number fusion power stations can be multiplied set by the supplies of tritium .
The Fast Track timetable .

Tritium Supplies
The large scale adoption of fusion energy will see tritium used on a scale vastly greater than has ever been seen before .
Something like a 220 kg per year of tritium will be consumed for every 1GW of continuous electrical generation , assuming that 4GW thermal will generate 2GW electrical of which 1GW will be used to provide all the inputs to the system leaving 1GW of output power .
At present world - wide electrical consumption averages to a continuous 1700GW
Nearly all the worlds supply of non-military tritium comes from the heavy water used to moderate CANDU reactors and some of these will be closing down in the near future .
The supply accumulated over 40 years of operation of CANDU reactors will peak in 2027 at 27kg .
The world ’s commercially available supply of tritium before any is removed by fusion programme .

Military reactors designed for tritium production produced only a few kilograms a year at a cost of about $ 200 M / kg .
Tritium increases the yield thermonuclear warheads ( H bombs ) .
It is thought that about 4g is used in each warhead , added in a container just before launch , so that decay of the tritium does not limit the shelf life of the weapon .
There have been some hints that the latest warheads being designed will not use tritium .
The US had a number of military reactors at its Savannah River site especially designed for tritium production but the last of these was closed down in 1988 .
It is believed that over 220 kg of tritium was produced there over the years but that there was only about 73kg in 1995 which will have now decayed to about 37kg .
It is unlikely the US military will release any of this for civil fusion power .
One of the speakers said that he believed that at one time the Russians had mentioned the possibility of releasing some of their supply but had no further details .
Other civil fission reactors could produce small amounts by placing lithium inside the reactor but some back of envelope calculations that I did for a comment to previous post show that it would take at least 60 tonnes of unenriched uranium to produce 1 kg of tritium in a standard reactor and it may be much more .
Specially designed accelerators are theoretically capable of producing tritium , and have been considered for military needs , but one to generate a few kilograms per year was estimated to cost $ 4.8 to 6.1 billion in 1991 prices and would produce vast quantities of radioactive waste .
Since ITER will produce only a tiny proportion of the tritium it uses ( at least in the early years ) because the experimental test blanket modules will only cover a small area of the chamber , ITER alone will severely deplete the worlds tritium stock .
If DEMO is heavily overlapped in time with ITER the tritium supply will be very critical and it will be important to get the full blanket and tritium recovery system going as soon as possible if the programme is not to be delayed .
If fusion reactors are to proliferate , then probably near the start , and certainly after the first few , each new reactor will be relying on the small surplus tritium production from existing reactors to provide the start - up charge of tritium .
This is likely to be some tens of kilograms .
When I asked him , Dr Briscoe said that it will probably take two - and - a - half to three years from the start of one reactor for it to supply enough surplus tritium to start up another .
The estimate he gave was that even if the only obstacles were technical ones it will be 2100 before fusion can supply more than 30 % of Europe ’s electricity .
The Energy Gap
All but the most dewy - eyed optimists foresee the production of conventional oil severely curtailed by then .
If we are to get to 2100 without major economic collapse or using so much coal , tar and oil shale that the carbon dioxide will have risen to disastrous levels , we will have had to have adopted other energy sources on a major scale , as well as substantially cutting our energy consumption and finding some way of replacing liquid hydrocarbons for transport .
Fusion will then be competing in a very different environment .
Cost estimates at this stage are obviously uncertain in the extreme but most estimates put the cost of generated electricity as comparable in today ’s prices with today ’s fossil fuel generated power .
Most of the cost is in the capital cost of the plant amortised over the life of the plant .
Running , periodic replacements and decommissioning costs coming next with fuel costs less than 1 % of these and not likely to rise by depleting the richer ore , as would be the case with very widespread use of thermal fission plants .
One estimate puts the capital cost at € 14/ W electrical for DEMO falling to € 4 / W for commercial plants in serial production .
This link allows you to play with the assumptions and produce an electricity price .
These prices should be compared to today 's fission and coal plants at € 3 /W and € 1.5 / W. respectively for the plant alone .
However , the capital costs of coal plants do not include costs to mitigate environmental damage .
Wind energy capital costs are now about € 1.5 / W but rarely have a load factor of more than 30 % , whereas fusion plants after initial settling - in could have 85 % load factor .
Correspondingly more rated wind power plant would need to be installed to meet the same electrical demand .
If wind power were to supply more than 30 % of the total supply , extensive power storage would be needed and the transmission costs would be greater as many of the turbines would scattered across areas remote from demand .
The carbon dioxide emissions associated with fusion are again very difficult to estimate at this distance , but will also be dominated by that generated in building the reactor and its associated plant and the periodically replaceable parts .
The carbon dioxide generated in fuel production and preparation will be constant and low in comparison .
Fusion reactors are inherently proof against melt - down or nuclear explosion .
There simply is not enough fuel in the reactor at any one time to cause one .
Any failure of coolant , magnet supply or other major system will cause the reaction to die in milliseconds .
There is not enough heat in the system even without coolant to breach the containment vessel .
According to this report even in the worst credible accident with the release of all the tritium on site there would be no need to evacuate anybody beyond the site boundary .
They are a very much less tempting a target for attack by violent political or religious groups than thermal fission reactors , still less than fast breeder reactors .
If a large part of the energy gap world wide were to be made up by fission reactors using the present system of thermal reactors with once through use of enriched uranium we would rapidly be reduced to the use of ever lower grades of ore requiring more energy input .
Some estimates put the point at which there is no energy gain to be 0.02 % of uranium and that if nuclear energy were expanded from the present 16 % to 50 % of electrical generation we would be reduced to using such ores in 50 years .
There has been much argument over such estimates but in the long term it is clear that if we are to rely on fission for a major part of our electricity let alone total energy we will need to move to fast breeder reactors or thorium reactors .
The long development time of fusion energy may seem disheartening but that of fast breeders is not much better .
In 1946 , the year I was born , the Nobel prize winner , Sir George Thomson , working at Imperial College London applied for a patent for using a gas discharge to generate controlled thermonuclear fusion .
If the proposed timetable is kept to and if I live to be 102 I may just , in my dotage , see his dream brought to commercial reality .
I do not know which of the two is more improbable .
Peter Jackson 's long - cherished Hobbit movie appeared to be dead in the water after the director was effectively blacklisted by his former backers , New Line Cinema .
Robert Shaye , co-chairman of New Line , insisted that Jackson would never make another movie for New Line , following a fractious legal dispute over the profits from the Lord of the Rings trilogy .
" I do not want to make a movie with somebody who is suing me , " Shaye said in an interview with the Sci Fi Channel .
" So the answer is that he will never make any movies with New Line Cinema again while I 'm still working for the company . "
New Line currently controls the film rights to The Hobbit , the Tolkien fantasy that paved the way for The Lord of the Rings .
" I do n't care about Peter Jackson anymore , " Shaye added .
" He wants to have another $ 100 m or $ 50 m or whatever he 's suing us for .
He does n't want to sit down and talk about it .
He thinks we owe him something after we 've paid him over a quarter of a billion dollars ...
Cheers , Peter . "
Initially regarded as a high - risk gamble , the Lord of the Rings trilogy wound up making nearly $ 3bn at the global box office .
But Jackson 's production company launched a lawsuit against New Line following the alleged discovery of financial anomalies in a partial audit of The Fellowship of the Ring , the first film of the trilogy .
Jackson contends that the studio has refused to agree to an audit of the other two films , The Two Towers and The Return of the King .
" Fundamentally our legal action is about holding New Line to its contractual obligations and promises , " Jackson said in a statement .
" It is regrettable that Bob has chosen to make it personal . "
パターン認識入 門
1. カラー画像からグレースケール画像を作る方法
カメラに限らず、昨今コンピュータで取り扱われる画像は一般的にはカラー画像です。
パターン認識においてカラー画像をそのまま用いる場合もありますが、単にコンピュータに形を認識させたりあるいは今回のアプリケーションのように文字を認識させたりしたい場合には、カラー画像をそのまま使うよりもグレースケール画像を認識に用いた方がアルゴリズムが簡単になります。ここで言うグレースケール画像というのは、明るさの度合いのみによって構成された画像のことです。
この明るさ l は、赤、緑、青の各色成分の明るさをそれぞれ r、g、b とすると 、
で表せます。ここ で W r 、W g 、W b は各色成分の重みです 。
実際に人間の目が感じる明るさは r、g、b の値に応じ て W r 、W g 、W b も異なるのですが、通常これらを定数とします。特に 、
W r = 0.299
= 0.299 W g = 0.587
= 0.587 W b = 0.114
の値が用いられます 。
この処理の結果は、具体的には次のようになります。
2. 背景と文字の区別
紙などに印刷された文字や図形をコンピュータに認識させるためには、認識させたい対象とその周りにある背景とをコンピュータに区別させなければなりません。これを 2 値化と言います。つまり認識の対象を 1 で、背景を 0 と符号化するのです。この文字認識アプリケーションでは 2 値化に判別分析法と呼ばれる方法を採用しました。
判別分析法は、2 つの山からなる明るさに関するヒストグラムから谷の部分を探し出す手法です。因みにヒストグラムとは横軸に明るさを、縦軸にその明るさを持つ画素の数をとった棒グラフのことです。
例えば、次 の
という画像では、ヒストグラムは次のようになります。
このヒストグラムでは、左側が上の画像の黒い部分に、右側が白い部分に対応します。このヒストグラムで、明るさが
200 未満の点の明るさを全て 0 とし、逆に明るさが 200 以上の点の明るさを全て 255 としてみます。
すると、上の画像は 、
となります 。
この例の 200 という値、これを閾値と言いますが、この値を人が決めました。これをコンピュータが自分で判断するためのアルゴリズムの
1 つが、判別分析法なのです。そして、閾値で分けた後の 0 という値の代わりに 1 を、255 という値の代わりに 0 という値を用いれば、処理後の画像の黒い点が 1 で、白い点が 0 で表されることになり、結果的に文字と背景とが分離できるのです。
この判別分析法にはヒストグラムに谷が存在しなかったり、あるいは谷が複数存在しても多くの場合適切な閾値が得られるという特徴があります。
それでは判別分析法による閾値の求め方を説明します。
画像の明るさが 0 から N での数値で表現されているとします。そして、明るさが t である画素の数を f ( t ) で表すことにします。この f ( t ) こそ、ヒストグラムそのものです。
まず明るさ t を境に明るさが t 未満のものをクラス 1 、明るさが t 以上のものをクラス 2 としてヒストグラムを 2 つのクラスに分けたとします 。
クラス 1 に含まれる画素の数 n 1 ( t ) は、
です。またクラス 1 に含まれる画素が持つ明るさの平均値 μ 1 ( t ) は、
です。これからクラス 1 の明るさに関する分散 σ 1 ( t ) 2 は、
と求まります 。
同様にクラス 2 に含まれる画素の数 n 2 ( t ) 、明るさの平均値 μ 2 ( t ) 、分散 σ 2 ( t ) 2 はそれぞれ 、
となります 。
これらの値を使って、クラス内分散 σ w ( t ) 2 とクラス間分散 σ B ( t ) 2 とを次のように定義します。
ただし μ は画像全体の明るさの平均値で 、
です。
更に W(t ) を、
とします 。
0 から N までの全ての t に対して W ( t ) を計算し、 W( t ) が最大となる t = t MAX を見つけます 。
この t MAX を 2 値化の閾値と採用します。これが判別分析法です。
The 19 - year - old seems limp , and may even have been unconscious .
As the officers struggle to pick her up and drag her to a waiting police van , the teenager 's trousers fall round her ankles .
Toni Comer remembers nothing of the incident outside the Niche nightclub in Sheffield .
She is an epileptic and thinks she had a fit .
But the footage , which has been obtained by the Guardian , is now the centre of a police inquiry that will test whether the officers involved acted proportionately during the arrest , or with unnecessary force .
The video , which can be seen on the Guardian Unlimited website , has already caused concern in Sheffield among those who have seen it .
Ms Comer 's lawyers are demanding that the Independent Police Complaints Commission launches an investigation to look properly at the inconsistencies they believe are found in a statement made by PC Anthony Mulhall .
The officer has admitted he hit her but claimed he acted in self - defence and only after extreme provocation .
The struggle involving Ms Comer , now 20 , from Sheffield , took place when she was arrested outside the club last July .
She had earlier been ejected from the club and had then damaged a car belonging to a security guard in the club 's car park .
Yesterday she pleaded guilty to criminal damage and was given a conditional discharge and ordered to pay £ 250 compensation to the car owner .
Sheffield magistrates court was told by Danny Simpson , Ms Comer 's lawyer , that the arrest had caused " a great deal of distress " and an officer " punched Ms Comer five or so times until she would say she was unconscious " .
He added that it was now the subject of a complaint to the police and " may in due course be the subject of civil proceedings " .
By chance , the club 's security cameras caught the arrest .
The film shows Ms Comer and PC Mulhall at the top of a fire escape .
During a struggle , they roll down the stairs until PC Mulhall lands on top of her .
He can be seen striking her five times .
Other police officers arrive , including a dog - handler and dog , and she is dragged to a police van with her trousers down .
Ms Comer admits she had been drinking brandy and had become aggressive in the club .
She is convinced she had an epileptic fit and the officer has said he saw foam at her mouth .
She has suffered more than 20 such fits , the first when she was pregnant with her two - year - old son .
She said she was unaware of what had happened during the arrest until shown the film .
" I was shocked when I first saw the film .
I did n't think they 'd do something like that .
I did n't want to go out of the house after seeing it . "
She acknowledges the police would have been unaware of her medical condition and says that her father has told her that she can be aggressive during a fit .
" But they should be aware of those types of illnesses .
It 's shocking what the police did to me - I would n't wish it on anyone . "
Her father , Leroy Walcott , said yesterday that he had been shocked by the film .
" To see that happening to your daughter is bad enough but the fact that police officers are involved makes it doubly worse . "
In a statement after the arrest , PC Mulhall acknowledges he struck Ms Comer but said he only did so in self - defence and after extreme provocation .
" She began to kick , spit and made attempts to bite me , " he said in his statement .
" As her hands became free she tried to grab handfuls of my genitals and knee and kick me in the same place .
At this point , I struck her as hard as I was able with my right fist in an attempt to subdue her .
There was no apparent effect so I did this twice more . "
When she kept resisting , he said , he hit her again .
Trying to put her in handcuffs , he states that " I now struck her as hard as I was physically able in an attempt to deaden her arm ...
In the end I had to use brute force . "
Ms Comer , who is 5ft 6in tall and weighs nine stone , has one previous conviction for handling when she was 14 .
She was given community service .
Ruggie Johnson , coordinator of The Monitoring Group North and editor of the local magazine Wha' a gwan , first obtained the footage .
" I was absolutely shocked when I saw it .
It 's like something out of the Deep South . "
He said it reminded him of the Rodney King episode in Los Angeles when police officers were seen on camera making an arrest of a drunk driver .
A spokeswoman for the South Yorkshire force said : " A complaint has been lodged and is now being looked into . "
Peter Mahy , the lawyer handling the complaint said : " It raises very serious concerns , hence my call for it to be investigated independently by the Independent Police Complaints Commission . "

Islam in America
Pope Benedict XVI and Islam
By John L. Esposito
THE PRIMARY PURPOSE and message of Benedict XVI ’s address in Regensburg , Germany was not about Islam , referred to in only four paragraphs of his eight - page lecture .
And yet , this Papal address to a university audience turned into an occasion for an international protest across the Muslim world .
Morocco withdrew its ambassador to the Vatican , heads of state from Turkey to Indonesia voiced criticism , the sheikh of Al - Azhar commented on the pope ’s ignorance of Islam , and leaders of Muslim organizations called for a public apology .
The incident has also triggered public demonstrations , the burning of the pope in effigy in Pakistan and acts of violence against Christians and Christian churches .
The pope clearly stated that his primary purpose was to discuss the “ issue of ” ˜faith and reason . ’”
He did so reacting and responding to a major concern of his , the excesses of secularization : the triumph of secularism and increased weakness of Christianity and the Roman Catholic Church in his homeland , Germany , and in Europe in general , and attempts to exclude religion from the realm of reason .
Although the Vatican stated that the pope did not intend to offend , his remarks did in fact upset many Muslims .
Particularly offensive to Muslims was his citation of a 14th century Byzantine emperor ’s remarks about the Prophet Muhammad : “ Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached . ”
Muhammad is revered in Islam as the final Prophet of God and the model of Muslim life .
Moreover , the remark that he commanded the spread of Islam by the sword is simply inaccurate .
The Qur’an and Muhammad did recognize the right to defend Islam and the Muslim community , by fighting those Meccans who threatened and attacked Muslims .
Equally problematic is the pope ’s statement that the Qur’anic passage , “ There is no compulsion in religion ” ( Qur’an 2:256 ) was revealed in the early years of Muhammad ’s prophethood in Mecca , a period “ when Mohammed was still powerless and under [ threat ] ” but was overtaken later when he ruled Medina by “ instructions , developed later and recorded in the Koran [ Qur ’an ] , concerning holy war . ”
However , both these statements are incorrect .
Qur ’an 2:256 is not an early Meccan verse but is itself from the later Medinan period , and the Qur’an does not equatejihad with holy war .
This interpretation of jihad developed years later after Muhammad ’s death , when it came to be used by rulers ( caliphs ) to justify their wars of imperial expansion and rule in the name of Islam .
Benedict XVI is a distinguished Catholic theologian , but he is not an expert on Islam .
The Vatican in the recent past has had some first - class scholars of Islam serving the papacy as advisers .
The inappropriate references to Islam in the Regensburg address could easily have been averted .
If the pope ’s primary purpose was to address the issue of the relationship between faith and compulsion on the one hand and faith and reason on the other , Christian history offers ample examples ( the Inquisition , Galileo , and other issues he mentions , violence and extremism , holy wars ) without having recourse to passages drawn from mutual polemics .
Have Muslims overreacted to the pope ’s statement ?
Their responses need to be understood in the context of our post - 9/11 world , with its greater polarization and alarming increases in Islamophobia .
Many Muslims feel under siege .
A Gallup World Poll of some 800 million Muslims from Morocco to Indonesia indicates widespread resentment over what respondents see as the denigration of Islam and Arabs and Muslims in the West .
The cartoon controversy in Europe demonstrated both the dangers of xenophobia and Islamophobia and depths of anger and outrage .
Therefore , it is easy to understand why Muslims would express their disappointment and anger and call for an apology and dialogue , much the same as Jewish leaders strongly urged meetings with the pope or other Church leaders for offensive comments or actions .
This was the case for American Jewish leaders before the papal visit of 1987 after Pope John Paul II had met with Kurt Waldheim .
As prominent Muslim leaders noted during the European cartoon controversy and in the current situation , expressions of concern or outrage do not preclude discussion and dialogue , and certainly never justify acts of violence .
Pope Benedict has now apologized , but more can be done .
The pope could invite Muslim religious leaders and scholars to meet and discuss the issues that his statement raised and hear their concerns and responses to his specific comments about Islam , the Prophet , and jihad .
He could invite them to join with him in mutually acceptable language to express concern about violence in the name of religion and the abuse of human rights .
The pope ’s upcoming visit to Turkey could be an occasion to demonstrate in his public pronouncements his respect for Islam and Muslims and his desire to continue the major accomplishments that the Catholic Church has made since Vatican II in Catholic - Muslim dialogue .
It is now time to move on .
The pope has apologized and Muslims and Catholics ( as indeed all Christians ) must now get back on track , building on the significant accomplishments in interreligious dialogue in recent decades .
In the 21st century , critical to Catholic - Muslims relations will be how Benedict XVI ’s papacy and Catholics work with their Muslim counterparts to overcome ignorance and hostility as well as the threat from violence and intolerance globally .
John L. Esposito is University Professor of Religion & International Affairs , director of the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim - Christian Understanding at Georgetown University , and the author of What Everyone Needs to Know about Islam and Unholy War : Terror in the Name of Islam .

Django tips : A simple AJAX example , part 1
One thing that ’s come up over and over again in the Django IRC channel and on the mailing lists is the need for good examples of “ how to do AJAX with Django ” .
Now , one of my goals in life at the moment is to try to fill in the gaps in Django ’s documentation , so …
Over the next couple of entries we ’re going to walk through a very simple form , which will submit via AJAX to a Django view and handle the result without a page refresh .
If you ’d like , you can go ahead and take a look at the form we ’ll be building ; it ’s nothing fancy , but it ’s enough to cover most of the bases .
Make sure to try leaving fields blank , filling in an incorrect total in the second field , etc .
And try it without JavaScript enabled — it ’ll submit just like any “ normal ” HTML form .
Note : if you ’re already pretty handy with both Django and JavaScript , you might just want to skim this article and look at the sample code ; while I ’d like to think anybody can learn a thing or two from this , my target audience here is people who know Django but do n’t necessarily know much JavaScript , and so I ’m going to spend a little time covering basics and general best practices as I go .
Now , let ’s dive in .
First things first : think about what you ’re going to do
The single most important question to ask when you ’re thinking about AJAX is whether you should be using it at all ; whole books could be written about when to use it and when not to use it .
In general , I think AJAX is at its best for two main types of tasks :
Fetching data that needs to be regularly refreshed , without the need for manual reloads or ( worse ) meta refreshing .
Submitting forms which do n’t need to send you to a new URL when they ’re done processing ( for example : posting a comment , or editing part of a page ’s content in - place ) .
The key theme there , you ’ll notice , is that in both cases it makes sense for the browser to remain at the same URL during and after the AJAX effect ; if you need to boil this down to a single general rule of thumb , that ’s the one I ’d recommend .
Now , think about it some more
The second step , equally important , is to plan out the way your effect would work without the AJAX , because that ’s what you should write first .
In this case , it means we ’ll write a view and a template , and make sure that they work on their own , before adding any JavaScript at all .
Jeremy Keith , who ’s a man worth listening to , calls this technique “ Hijax ” , and I love that term .
So let ’s write our view to work normally first , and add the necessary AJAX support as we go ; as it turns out , that ’s going to be really easy .
A view to a form
The view is pretty simple ; we want to verify that you ’ve filled in both fields , and that you ’ve figured out the correct answer to a little math problem .
And regardless of whether you filled things in correctly or not , we want to preserve the things you entered across submissions .
Note :
If I really wanted to be pedantic in this view , I ’d do this using a custom manipulator and get all the validation for free ( remember that manipulators do n’t have to create or update instances of models , but can be used for any form you want validation on ; the login view in django.contrib.auth , for example , uses a manipulator this way ) .
But this is just a quick and dirty view to support the AJAX example and manipulators are going to be changing soon anyway , so I ’ll skip out on that for now .
So our view ( let ’s call it ajax_example ) might look something like this :
def ajax_example ( request ) : if not request .
POST : return render_to_response ( ' weblog/ajax_example.html ' , {} ) response_dict = {} name = request .
POST . get ( ' name ' , False ) total = request .
POST . get ( ' total ' , False ) response_dict .
update ( { ' name ' : name , ' total ' : total } ) if total : try : total = int ( total ) except : total =
False if name and total and int ( total ) == 10 : response_dict .
update ( { ' success ' : True } ) else : response_dict .
update ( { ' errors ' : { }} ) if not name : response_dict [ ' errors ' ] . update ( { ' name ' : ' This field is required ' } ) if not total and total is not False : response_dict [ ' errors ' ] . update ( { ' total ' : ' This field is required ' } ) elif int ( total ) != 10 : response_dict [ ' errors ' ] . update ( { ' total ' : ' Incorrect total ' } ) return render_to_response ( ' weblog/ajax_example.html ' , response_dict )
Here ’s how it breaks down :
If the request was n’t a POST , we can go straight to the template with an empty context .
If it was a POST , we grab the name and total submitted , grabbing a default value of False if they were n’t submitted .
Go ahead and stick them in a dictionary for later use in creating a context .
Make sure total is something that converts to an int ; if it does n’t , set it to False ( which will coerce to zero ) .
Do the actual checking : we make sure name and total actually had values , and if they do n’t , create error messages saying they ’re required .
And if total was submitted but was n’t 10 , add an error saying it ’s incorrect .
If everything ’s OK , add a success variable to the dictionary we ’ll be using for context .
Wrap that up in a render_to_response .
The template is pretty easy , too ; you can just view source on the example to see what it looks like .
The only thing you ca n’t see in there is that the name and total fields have {{ name }} and {{ total }} , respectively , inside their value attributes , so if the form ’s already been submitted they ’ll be pre-filled .
Also , you might notice that the error messages look suspiciously like the ones you ’d get in the Django admin ; I ’ve cribbed a little from the admin application ’s stylesheet and icons to get that effect .
Check the block of CSS at the top of the template to see how it ’s done .
Adapting the view for AJAX
We ’re going to need something on the backend which will respond to the AJAX submission , and from a logical point of view it makes sense to have it be the same view — why repeat the logic when the only change will be in the output ?
Now , there ’s no standard convention thus far in the Django world for distinguishing between “ normal ” and “ AJAX ’ submissions to a view , but in a few things I ’ve worked on I ’ve gotten into the habit of using an extra parameter in the URL called xhr ( mnemonic for “ XMLHttpRequest ” ) .
So where the form ’s “ normal ” submission URL is / examples / ajax / 1 / , the AJAX submission URL will be / examples / ajax / 1/ ?xhr .
In addition to being easy to check for from the view , this has the advantage of not requiring any changes to your site ’s URL configuration .
And once we know whether we ’re reponding to an AJAX submission or not , the response is extremely easy to generate ; a Django template context is just a Python dictionary , and a Python dictionary translates almost perfectly into JSON , which is one of the simplest possible formats for an AJAX response .
And best of all , Django includes , as part of its serialization framework , the simplejson library , which provides an easy way to convert between Python objects and JSON .
So let ’s take a look at the updated view :
from django.utils import simplejson def ajax_example ( request ) : if not request .
POST : return render_to_response ( ' weblog/ajax_example.html ' , {} ) xhr = request .
GET . has_key ( ' xhr ' ) response_dict = {} name = request .
POST . get ( ' name ' , False ) total = request .
POST . get ( ' total ' , False ) response_dict .
update ( { ' name ' : name , ' total ' : total } ) if total : try : total = int ( total ) except : total =
False if name and total and int ( total ) == 10 : response_dict .
update ( { ' success ' : True } ) else : response_dict .
update ( { ' errors ' : { }} ) if not name : response_dict [ ' errors ' ] . update ( { ' name ' : ' This field is required ' } ) if not total and total is not False : response_dict [ ' errors ' ] . update ( { ' total ' : ' This field is required ' } ) elif int ( total ) != 10 : response_dict [ ' errors ' ] . update ( { ' total ' : ' Incorrect total ' } ) if xhr : return HttpResponse ( simplejson .
dumps ( response_dict ) , mimetype = ' application /javascript ' ) return render_to_response ( ' weblog/ajax_example.html ' , response_dict )
The only thing that ’s changed here , really , is that we test for the xhr parameter in the URL and , if it ’s present , we return an HttpResponse whose content is the JSON translation of the dictionary we would have used for template context .
We use application / javascript for the response ’s Content - Type header because the default — text / html — can open up security holes .
And yes , it ’s that easy to support AJAX on the server side .
In part 2 , which will show up tomorrow or Wednesday , we ’ll walk through writing the JavaScript side of things ; go ahead and take a look at it if you ’re curious , and hopefully any questions you might have about it will soon be answered .
Nudaclick is a weblog where you can get the daily dose of fresh and funny ads .
It 's been a long time since I rapped at ya played with Guile , but holiday has given me the opportunity to get back to it .
Guile is an implementation of Scheme that 's designed to integrate well with existing C programs and libraries .
Most of the primitives that the interpreter offers are implemented in C , which means that you can access them from either language .
For example , ( hash - set ! h key val ) in Scheme is equivalent to scm_hash_set_x ( h , key , val ) in C , for suitable values of h , key , and val .
Frames
The parity between languages extends to exceptions .
Because the semantics of Scheme specify that an exception travels up the control stack , and Guile has to integrate well with C programs that already have their own control stack , Guile implements exceptions using longjmp .
Guile annotates the C stack with debugging information , such that there is one " frame " on the C stack for every block on the Scheme stack .
So , if you call scm_hash_set_x ( h , k , val ) in C , but h is not a hash table , the function will never return .
Instead , Guile starts crawling back up the C stack looking for Guile frames , stopping when there is an exception handler .
In this way it is similar to the JVM or the CLR , and unlike e.g.
Python or the Unix system call interface , which return special values and rely on the programmer to check errno or PyErr_foo .
Guile 1.7 adds explicit support for frames from C .
For example , consider the following block of code , which comes from Guile 's NEWS file :
void foo ( ) { char * mem ; scm_frame_begin ( 0 ) ; mem = scm_malloc ( 100 ) ; scm_frame_unwind_handler ( free , mem , SCM_F_WIND_EXPLICITLY ) ; /* MEM would leak if BAR throws an error .
SCM_FRAME_UNWIND_HANDLER
frees it nevertheless . */ bar ( ) ; scm_frame_end ( ) ; /*
Because of SCM_F_WIND_EXPLICITLY , MEM will be freed by SCM_FRAME_END as well .
*/ }
Guile inherits the SCM namespace from SCM , Aubrey Jaffer 's Scheme interpreter that Guile forked from about 10 years ago .
For this particular case , Guile defines scm_frame_free ( mem ) as being a shorthand for this invocation of scm_frame_unwind_handler .
There are similar shorthands for setting values of fluids and for setting the current input / output / error ports .
Additionally , to properly support continuations , Guile supports multiple non-local reentries from points that were exited via call - with - current - continuation .
That , however , is a story for another day .
Threads
Also new with Guile 1.7 is full support for OS - level threads .
As evaluation state is captured on the C stack instead of in a global interpreter state , this is easier than in most languages -- since each thread has its own stack , the threads can run concurrently ( unlike e.g. Python ) .
The only part of Guile that needed to change was the garbage collector , and those changes are a bit boring unless you 're a language nerd .
More interesting are the possibilities offered by threads to the programmer .
There are " futures " , which are similar to promises except that they begin executing immediately in another thread .
There is letpar , like the let binding construct except that it spawns threads to calculate the binding values , and par-map , similarly like map but parallelized .
There are also nestable parallelize and serialize forms , which can be used to control the threading behavior of particular blocks of code , for example to serialize access to a thread - unsafe C library .
And of course , there is the normal range of mutexen , semaphores , and condition variables .
Best of all , Guile is guaranteed not to crash under any circumstances .
( Not saying that it wo n't crash , of course , but that if it does it 's a bug in Guile . )
The culture of Scheme places a strong emphasis on the functional programming style .
Scheme programmers learn early on how to identify shared state , which is a large part of understanding concurrency .
This makes a threads - supporting Scheme like Guile an ideal language in which to learn about multiprocessing .
Other Bling
Guile 1.7 now uses gmp for its arithmetic , obsoleting the old hand - rolled implementation of bignums .
Using gmp also allows for infinity , NaN , and signed zero numeric values .
Uniform vectors -- N - dimensional , potentially sparse arrays of one data type , for example 16 - bit integers -- have long been supported by Guile .
Now their implementation conforms to the srfi- 4 standard , and is always built .
Dividing 12 by 18 will now yield the exact rational number 2/3 , completing the numeric tower of types .
Oh yes .
I 'm picking on Python a bit , but it 's all in good fun so I 'll continue : they just changed from 12/18==0 to 12/18==0.66666666666666663 , which is still inaccurate .
( And yes , I do get that 3 on the end on this machine .
Odd . )
Finally , functions to convert between SCM values and C types were made much more uniform .
No more cryptic macros in new code ( SCM_MAKINUM anyone ? ) .

Emailed images circulating since February 2006 show a pair of twin sisters — one black , the other white — born to a British couple who both had mixed - race parents .
These images are authentic .
Who Are the Black and White Twins ?
The following images credited in online news stories to freelance photographer Gary Roberts are authentic .
The subjects are real as well — twins Kian and Remee Hodgson of Nottingham , England .
According to a February 21 , 2006 , article in the London Daily Mail , Kian , who is dark - skinned and dark - haired , and Remee , who is light - skinned and fair - haired , were born in April 2005 to Kylie and Remi Hodgson , who themselves were born to mixed - race parents .
Kylie noted :
“ I did n’t see them at first .
They were both whisked away to be checked over and then the midwife came back and placed them both in my arms .
I noticed that both of them had beautiful blue eyes , but whilst Remee ’s hair was a blonde colour , Kian ’s was black and she had darker skin .
It seemed strange , but I was feeling so ill from the Caesarean that I did n’t really take it in at that stage .
All that mattered was my precious daughters had arrived safely .
But the following day , Kylee mentioned the colour difference to her mother .
“ I said to my mother that Remee ’s skin was a lot lighter , and she told me that it would get darker as she got older .
I had just assumed that both our babies would have the same skin tone as me . ”
The Biology of Mixed Race Twins
While very rare , the phenomenon is not unknown , though it does entail a very particular combination of circumstances at the moment of conception .
First , both parents must be of mixed race .
Second , the twins must be fraternal ( each conceived from a separate egg fertilized by separate sperm ) as opposed to identical ( both conceived from a single egg and sperm ) .
Third , each sperm and egg must carry the genes for a particular skin color ( i.e. , black / black or white / white ) .
The odds against it are indeed a million to one .
The Black and White Twins Today
As the twins grew , Remee ’s skin became lighter , whilst Kian ’s got darker .
Remee ’s eyes stayed blue and Kian ’s turned brown .
Despite the differences in their appearance , the girls share a very strong bond and are best friends .
More Mixed Race Twins
Another set of black and white twins were born in 1997 to a white father and a half - Jamaican mother .
Lucy Aylmer has red hair and a very fair complexion and her twin Maria has brown hair with a caramel complexion .
Sample Email About the Twins
Here 's an email contributed by Stacey B. on March 1 , 2006 :
Subject : AMAZING TWINS ... WOW !
A mixed - race British mom gave birth to twins recently - one of each .
No , not a boy and a girl .
Two girls - one black , the other white .
The odds of such a birth are about a million to one , experts said .

Rove warned in ' manuals , memos , and briefings ' to save emails Andrew Bielak
Published : Saturday April 14 , 2007 Print This Email This Further complicating the picture in White House adviser Karl Rove 's deleting of numerous e-mails , the Los Angeles Times reports today that the White House had established a policy of saving emails related to official business and warned staff not to delete them .
According to an investigation by the LA Times , the White House took pains to establish a standard email handling procedures on a number of occasions .
Among a set of employee manuals from 2001 , a memorandum from former White House counsel and current Attorney General Alberto Gonzales explains that " any e-mail relating to official business ... qualifies as a presidential record . "
Another manual reads , " If you happen to receive an e-mail on a personal account which otherwise qualifies as a presidential record , it is your duty to insure that it is saved as such by printing it out and saving it or by forwarding it to your White House e-mail account . "
Apart from revealing a standard White House policy towards saving e-mails , the manuals and memorandums shed doubt on continued claims by administration officials that the erasings were entirely accidental and resulted from poor communications .
Democrats on Capitol Hill have asserted that Rove intentionally skirted the traditional structure by using a RNC list to discuss the matter rather than the more transparent White House business account .
Robert D. Luskin , a lawyer for the powerful adviser , denied any wrongdoing , telling the Associated Press that Rove 's " understanding starting very , very early in the administration was that those e-mails were being archived . "
A column by Rob Pegoraro in today 's Washington Post sheds further light on the questionable claim by administration officials that the emails are simply missing .
" This might not seem obvious when you 're struggling to locate the e-mail somebody sent you last week , but it 's not easy to make an e-mail message vanish for good , " Pegora writes .
" A lot of the time , it 's outright impossible . "
Just another facet of the Detainee bill .
A disgraceful abuse of power .
I was going to cover another subject tonight but STR did a great job with it .
It is another bill passed that gives US Sch ools the power to strip students nakedSee here
And credit to this article here that awoke me to this new bill .
1970 : Manned space flight has become so routine that it is easy to forget that it ’s inherently dangerous to stuff astronauts inside a cramped capsule and blast them into the heavens on top of a Saturn V rocket .
The Apollo 13 mission reminds us just how vulnerable we are .
Apollo 13 , with astronauts James Lovell Jr. , John Swigert Jr. and Fred Haise Jr. aboard , was on its way to the moon to perform the third lunar landing in a planned series of seven when , about 56 hours into the mission , an oxygen tank blew up , knocking out the command module ’s electricity , light and water supply .
“ Hey , Houston , we ’ve had a problem here , ” Lovell told mission control , adding that some kind of gas was escaping outside the spacecraft .
It was oxygen , and the mission quickly shifted from landing on the moon to getting the astronauts back alive .
At the time , Apollo 13 was roughly 200,000 miles from Earth .
The crew moved into the lunar module to escape the decreasing air pressure in the service module , then prepared to make the necessary swing around the moon in order to boomerang back to Earth .
Debris from the explosion had knocked out the navigation system , so the crew used the sun to guide the crippled craft home .
It took nearly four agonizing days after the explosion before they splashed down safely in the Pacific Ocean .

UC Berkeley physics Professor Richard A. Muller finds himself suddenly popular in some surprising corners of the world .
It turns out self - starting students in 35 states and 43 countries have been watching the 90 - minute " Physics for Future Presidents " talks he gives every Tuesday and Thursday morning to a packed lecture hall of 300 undergrads on campus .
And the list is growing .
Under UC Berkeley 's recent deal with Google Video to distribute university - produced course and event video and audio files , Muller 's talks are available free and unedited , and come with his textbook and other course documents online .
The arrangement , begun in late September , highlights the Web 's potential to extend higher learning to people who can't afford it or can't get to a campus -- and to places where UC - level teaching is nonexistent .
" I think we 're onto something that could play a major role in the advancement of education in the world , " Muller said .
Google distributes about 250 hours of university - produced material , including lectures for six courses .
Videos of Cal lectures have been viewed about 400,000 times by Google users since September , said Obadiah Greenberg , Cal 's Webcast product manager .
More than 50 institutions worldwide provide academic content online for free , according to the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation , whose Open Educational Resources Initiative helped pioneer the field five years ago .
" The idea is to bring high - quality academic content on the Web for people to use and reuse , " said Catherine Casserly , a Hewlett education program officer .
" It 's the idea about knowledge being free to share for all . "
Muller 's lectures -- which are entertaining but demanding and are digestible to a wide audience because they 're largely math - free -- are Berkeley 's most popular Google - distributed videos .
The one on atoms and heat that kicked off the course has been viewed more than 26,000 times and is on the verge of breaking into the list of the top 10,000 most - watched videos on Google .
Muller recently asked during a lecture to hear from students outside Berkeley .
" Today , " wrote an e-mail correspondent who identified himself as a Tibetan boy studying math , " all day I spent watching physics lectures , wonderful lectures and ( it's a ) wonderful idea to share these with the rest of the world . "
" It 's better than getting a prize , " said Muller .
" It 's the kind of reward you do n't expect . "
A naval officer stationed in Bahrain said he listens to Muller 's podcasts while working out .
There were messages from Colombia , Slovakia and Poland .
And a businessman based in Bamako , Mali , in West Africa , wrote : " At the end of this month I will be in Timbuktu and I assure you I will have your lecture playing on my MP3 player as I plod away from the city by camel . "
" I really did n't think anybody from outside the university was going to be listening , " said Muller , 62 , who won a MacArthur " genius grant " in 1982 and a Berkeley distinguished teaching award in 1999 .
A researcher at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , he has been a student , peer and mentor of some of the world 's top physicists .
" I'm a deep believer that the way to world peace and economic progress is through education .
Here , we 're finding a way . "
Muller insists students separate fact from pseudo - fact , testable reality from wishful thinking , and he gives them no way to cut corners .
" The whole idea is to get them thinking and not just accept everything they read , " said Shawn Thorne , Muller 's head graduate student instructor .
" We 're not dumbing down the material .
The way he approaches it , this is stuff everyone should know . "
Muller 's trick is making physics easy to grasp , literally .
An amateur magician , he encourages students to buy the toy magnets , lenses , rubber balls and Slinkys that captivated him when he was 10 .
" He brings in real - life examples , " said Sophie Bridgers , a 2006 Berkeley High graduate and first - year Cal student .
" It 's exciting for me to learn this because I 've never taken physics before . "
Muller reserves the opening 10 minutes of each lecture for students ' questions -- " What 's the easiest nuclear bomb to make ? "
" Can one get electrocuted from a swimming pool light ? "
" Why does bubble gum blow bigger bubbles than regular gum ? "
And he works with current events whenever he can .
North Korea 's recent nuclear test provided a lesson in the physics of plutonium - fueled implosion bombs .
They are extremely difficult weapons to set off -- " like squeezing a water balloon without having it leak out through your fingers " -- and the small size of the North Korean blast indicated it probably was a dud , Muller said .
" Learning is one of the great pleasures in life , " Muller said .
" If you do n't believe me , tell a 10 - year - old kid he can do one of two things : have as much chocolate as you want or learn to ride a bicycle . "
The bicycle , he said , wins every time .

Last week came purported evidence that the Chinese admiral Zheng
He sailed his great fleet of junks round the world a century before Columbus , Da Gama and Magellan .
An 18th - century copy of a map dated 1418 has emerged from a Shanghai bookshop , depicting North and South America , Australia and Antarctica .
The map was bought by a Chinese lawyer , Liu Gang , and was reportedly to go on display on Tuesday in London 's Maritime Museum .
( The museum denies all knowledge of it . )
The map challenges the customary Euro- centric version of global discovery and can thus rely on a weight of political correctness in support .
It appears to stake China 's claim to have " discovered " America first .
This comes as a surprise to those of us who know for a fact that America was discovered by Prince Madoc ab Owain Gwynedd in 1170 .
He landed at Mobile , Alabama , on the orders of the family druid and asserted Wales 's claim to King Arthur 's North Atlantic empire .
Making his way across country , he settled west of the Mississippi , where the Mandan tribe were encountered in the 18th century , fair - skinned and speaking a dialect of Welsh .
Unfortunately Madoc 's arrival had been forestalled by St Brendan in the seventh century .
He sailed to America in a leather - bound coracle , as Tim Severin proved in 1977 .
The survivors of this trip remain pickled in a downtown Boston saloon to this day .
Brendan and Madoc were followed by a Scottish knight templar , Henry Sinclair , seeking refuge from the suppression of his order in 1398 .
He and his freemasons escaped with assorted treasures and holy grails to settle in Nova Scotia with the Micmac Indians ( clearly a tribe of Hiberno - Scots ancestry ) .
Sinclair 's masonic star , or " la merika " , duly gave its name to the continent and merits a Da Vinci saga all of its own .
The only blot on this glory is that everyone knows America got its name from Glamorgan 's Richard ap Meurig ( Amerik ) , a wealthy sponsor of John Cabot 's search for the north - west passage in the 1490s .
It is amazing that all these chaps never bumped into each other .
Sailors tend to chat , and nothing obsesses them so much as maps .
Zheng 's giant ships - some 400 ft long , five times the size of Columbus 's - would surely have left a chopstick or two in Manhattan .
They would have left more than a kung fu parlour in downtown LA .
As for Zheng He 's dubious British cheerleader , the author Gavin Menzies , how can he explain a detailed Chinese map of America appearing three years before his hero discovered the place , as he claims , in 1421 ?
The Chinese map is plainly a hoax .
It not only shows North and South America as massive continents , which no sailor could possibly have known .
It accurately depicts Alaska , the curve of central America and the Yucatan peninsula , not to mention the Mississippi and St Lawrence rivers .
It shows Australia and the land mass of Antarctica beneath it , and New Zealand as two islands .
Even normally chauvinistic Chinese scholars have rubbished the find .
They pointed out last week that the cartographic portrayal of the Earth as two circles on a flat sheet is European .
The most obvious " mistake " , showing California as an island , is clearly borrowed from mistakes made in 17th - century European maps .
Nor are the Chinese characters properly medieval , that for the western God postdating the arrival of Jesuit missionaries .
Zheng
He 's 15th - century travels in the Indian Ocean were indeed sensational , but they were well authenticated .
Why diminish them by faking a circumnavigation ?
Besides , since the map is a copy , there is no way of verifying any original .
I blame the internet .
It is an open house for boosting the egos of crackpot historians , though it does at least facilitate their demolition .
Map hoaxers usually fall down not on their inaccuracy but on their accuracy .
It was the correctness of the 1440 Vinland map 's outline of Greenland that for many years queried its status as the first map to show North America ( or at least Baffin Island ) .
Only after much scholarship in the 1960s was its authenticity put beyond doubt .
As the Vinland scholar RA Skelton asserted at the time , it remains " the only known cartographic delineation of American lands before the discoveries of Columbus and Cabot " .
The Vinland map 's historical origin lay in the first known settlement of modern America by outsiders , by the Viking Leif Eriksson in the early 11th century .
It is described in the sagas , and archaeological remains survive at L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland .
Since Columbus is thought to have sailed with Bristolians to Iceland and cited " the lands the Bristol captains know " in support of his own expedition , Bristol 's claim to the first " discovery " of America since the Vikings remains strong .
Yet so what ?
As theoreticians of geography point out , it all depends what you mean by discovery .
America was " found " by Siberian migrants across the Bering Strait at various times between the 30th and the 10th millennium BC .
As for later contacts , a minor industry surrounds the likelihood of Phoenicians , Portuguese and other sailors being blown across the Atlantic before Columbus and never coming back .
African and Brazilian rafts may have drifted back and forth carrying seeds , spores and genes with them .
That Chinese or other oriental sailors may have travelled down the coast of Canada is possible .
The trouble is , they never told us so .
Discovery requires more than a verifiable fact .
It requires understanding what has been discovered , being able to place this mountain , island or coast in a framework of knowledge .
That is why sceptics were right to question Columbus as the " discoverer " of America , since to his dying day he was convinced he had reached part of Asia .
The real discoverer was Amerigo Vespucci , whose later voyages revealed the new continent for what it was , and from whom it took its name .
Hence Daniel Boorstin's masterpiece of modern geography , The Discoverers , presented the Portuguese Prince Henry the Navigator as a true explorer , merely sitting in his Sagres castle at Cape St Vincent , debriefing his captains and filling the blanks on his maps .
When Europeans heard tell of the New World they were disappointed to be told by Columbus that " in these islands I have so far found no human monstrosities , as many expected " .
It was the disappointment of imagination corrected by facts .
Such discoverers were map makers not just of place but of science , society , economics , the human body and the human mind .
In the person of Einstein , Boorstin finally found geography married to physics , " when time and space came together in a single tantalising riddle " .
All scientists were geographers at heart .
That is why maps are the most sacred tools of science .
That is why those who fabricate and abuse them are a menace to the cause of knowledge .

Lunar settlements could face high - voltage sparks .
Shocking : Charged Moon dust could short - circuit equipment .
NASA
Lunar colonists could be in for a nasty shock — literally .
A team of US scientists has found that the Moon 's surface can become charged with up to several thousand volts of static electricity1 .
This charging could release sparks that disable electronic equipment — including monitors , space buggies or even the front door of a Moon base .
And it could cause dust clouds that clogs up instruments .
What 's worse , it can be caused by bad weather in space : just when astronauts need their equipment to give them warning and allow them to shelter from the radiation .
But not everyone sees the news as bad .
" I 'm overjoyed this work was carried out , " says Dale Ferguson , a scientist at NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama .
" Data about the surface charging of the Moon was sorely lacking , " he explains .
Jasper Halekas of the University of California , Berkeley and his co-workers knew that the Moon 's surface could become charged when electrically charged particles in the solar wind plough into it .
This process , they realised , could have left an imprint that the Lunar Prospector , which orbited the Moon in 1998 - 99 , might have detected .
So Halekas and colleagues scanned through the data collected by the Lunar Prospector , and found that the surface charge can get as big as 4,500 volts .
" That 's more than enough to do some damage , if the electric field only extends over small distances , " says Halekas .
Any metal equipment would be vulnerable , though an astronaut might be protected by the insulation of his or her suit .
Halekas cautions that their observations were for charging over large areas , so the strength of local fields on the lunar surface is still unknown — if the charge is very spread out , then it might not cause a shock at all .
Blame it on the sunshine ?
“ It 's more than enough to do some damage . ” Jasper Halekas
University of Californa at Berkeley
Two situations can lead to the lunar surface becoming highly charged .
The first is when the Moon passes through the Earth 's magnetotail — the magnetic wake left by the solar wind as it sweeps over our planet .
The second is during ' solar storms ' , when streams of high - energy particles are hurled from the Sun out into space .
Sunlight can dissipate the charge by knocking electrons out of the surface , so most of the charge is seen on the night side of the Moon .
But the researchers say they were surprised to find some shocking levels on the sunlit side too .
Could astronauts plan for this charging ?
The Moon 's pass through the magnetotail is predictable .
But outbursts of bad solar weather are not .
To detect or be alerted to the onset of a solar storm , astronauts need their electronic equipment .
If the lunar surface became charged to thousands of volts , electrical sparks could burn out the equipment 's circuits — just when they are needed most .
Fatal attraction
Solar storms can be disruptive on Earth .
They interfere with radio telecommunication signals and disable satellites as the charged particles hit the upper atmosphere .
In space , the effects can be even more alarming .
The rain of particles can potentially damage living cells in much the same way as radioactivity , and so astronauts would need to take shelter behind protective screens .
Staying out on the Moon 's surface during a solar storm could be fatal .
ADVERTISEMENT
Ferguson says , however , that the levels of charging seen on the Moon are similar to those found on satellites during solar storms .
And there are already techniques to avoid spark damage , he says , for example by applying special surface coatings .
A bigger problem might be what the charging does to Moon dust .
Charged dust particles would repel one another , and this could cause it to rise up in clouds .
" Levitated dust was seen on the Apollo missions , " says Halekas — and the charging might now explain it .
Moon dust is a big headache for exploration .
" It sticks to everything and is very fine , so it gets past seals , " Halekas says .
It even clogged the vacuum cleaner that the Apollo astronauts took to keep their spacecraft clean .

Kudos to PZ Myers of Pharyngula , winner of the 2006 Weblog Award for “ Best Science Blog . ”
In honor of PZ ’s elaborate , unusual and at times distressing love of all things tentacled , I hereby devote today ’s entry to the overlap between my favorite theme ( the biology of aging ) and two of his ( cephalopods and evolution , though mentioning the latter may be redundant , per Dobzhansky : “ Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution ” ) .
In order to find an article about decrepitude among the Cephalopoda , I had to go back a few years .
Octopuses and squids , despite their many admirable qualities , are apparently not considered convenient model organisms for the study of aging .
Personally , I think this should change .
I ’ve always considered cephalopods ( specifically , octopuses ) fascinating from a neuroscience perspective , ever since I found out that they could get depressed .
The last common ancestor of humans and octopuses very likely had nothing more than a ganglion or two , and certainly nothing resembling the large brains of the extant modern species , so we have an example of analogous structures whose specifics evolved independently ( ditto for the eyes of vertebrates and cephalopods ) .
Hence octopus brains allow us to study comparative evolution of brains :
What is required for the function of a brain ?
What inherent similarities and differences exist between independently evolved large brains , and do the similarities explain common syndromes like depression ?
Back to my favorite subject :
Do cephalopod brains suffer from neurodegenerative diseases as a function of aging , and do they share with mammalian brains the greater sensitivity of neurons to protein aggregation ?
But I digress .
I promised you a paper about cephalopod aging , and I shall deliver .
In 2002 , Anderson et al. penned a manuscript that fits the bill ( I should say , “ the beak ” ) : Octopus senescence :
The beginning of the end :
Senescence is a normal stage of an octopus ’s life cycle that often occurs before death .
Some of the following symptoms typify it : lack of feeding , retraction of skin around the eyes , uncoordinated movement , increased undirected activity , and white unhealing lesions on the body .
There is inter- and intraspecific variability .
Senescence is not a disease or a result of disease , although diseases can also be a symptom of it .
Both males and females go through a senescent stage before dying - the males after mating , the females while brooding eggs and after the eggs hatch .
There are many aspects of octopus senescence that have not yet been studied .
This study discusses the ecological implications of senescence .
The story of octopus senescence is a textbook example of the “ disposable soma ” theory of aging , which holds that aging results from a tradeoff between maintenance of the non-reproductive part of the body ( the soma ) and the reproductive part ( the germ line ) .
It ’s less important to live forever as an individual than to reproduce , so the resources devoted to the former will always be less than that needed to keep the somatic tissue in perfect working order for all time .
Another corollary of the theory is that deleterious traits that affect the soma only after reproduction will be masked from selection , allowing maladaptive traits to be expressed at the end of life .
In several special cases , the decline following reproduction is quite rapid : Among the cephalopods , many species of squid have massive die - offs after mating .
Closer to most of our dinner tables , salmon make a heroic journey back to their birthplaces only to squirt , undergo drastic morphological changes , and then die .
Mammals generally do n’t kick off immediately after mating ( especially females , which need to stick around to nurse and raise their young ) , but there is nonetheless evidence of age - related change in mammals that can be best explained by the disposable - soma theory ( see this example in ungulates ) .
Many symptoms of human aging can also be rationalized as the delayed expression of deleterious traits in late life .
Note a subtlety that helps test the rule : Female octopuses stick around longer , to tend to their eggs .
Even though this behavior is manifest after the simple act of reproduction , it ’s essential to the survival of the offspring ( or to put it another way , the fitness of the parent ) , and is hence subject to positive selection .
There you have it : a treatment of cephalopod aging , an homage in honor of Pharyngula ’s award .
Congratulations once again , PZ , and may you have many happy years of blogging ahead of you .
A litigious 81 - year - old New York granny has zimmered her way gently onto the " bash Grand Theft Auto " bandwagon by filing suit against the game 's manufacturer for engaging in " false , misleading and deceptive practices " , AP reports .
Florence Cohen says she bought GTA : San Andreas for her 14 - year - old grandson " without knowing it contained hidden , sexually explicit scenes " at a time when the controversial game was rated M ( Mature ) , for gamers 17 years and over .
Her suit is reported to be " on behalf of consumers nationwide " .
GTA was recently reclassified AO ( Adult Only ) following the discovery of sexually explicit scenes unlocked by a Dutch modder .
The game 's manufacturer - Take
Two - admitted it would take quite a hit in the pocket as a result of the Entertainment Software Ratings Board 's decision , but once the US media got hold of the story , major stores added to Take Two 's woes by pulling GTA completely .
Take Two is also facing a Federal Trade Commission probe into advertising for the game , and its assertion that it is now working on a new , rumpy - pumpy - free GTA will do little to convince Middle America that it is anything more than an emmissary of Satan .
Which is where Florence Cohen comes in .
She claims that she bought the game in late 2004 and - apparently realising only after getting home that it was rated M - she " directed that it be taken away from her grandson , which was done " .
Cohen 's lawyer , Laurence D. Paskowitz , said : " No parent would knowingly buy an adult - only video game for their children .
They [ Take Two ] should really make sure this does n't happen again .
The least this company can do is offer refunds . "
So , while US teenagers can , in the words of one Reg reader , " pimp hos , pop a cap in a drug dealer while driving a car stolen at gunpoint " , they may not indulge in sexually explicit acts with their virtual girlfriends because " that threatens the very fabric of American society " .
As for the sex - free version of GTA , concerned parents can rest assured that after shooting up drug dealers with a semi-automatic rifle , their wide - eyed and innocent teen gamer will in future have to wind down with warm milk and cookies rather than an explosive climax with his bitch . ®

A town is being stripped of scores of public sector jobs because its residents are " too white and British " .
The Prison Service is relocating the posts to a nearby city where there are more ethnic minorities .
The incredible decision , which could lead to an investigation by the Commission for Racial Equality , was disclosed yesterday in a leaked official letter .
See also :
• Racism and a very stupid white woman
It is the first known case of its kind , but MPs warned similar moves could secretly be taking place across the country as civil servants are under enormous pressure from ministers to boost the number of ethnic minorities working in the public sector .
The 80 office jobs are being transferred from the depressed former steel town of Corby , in Northamptonshire , to Leicester .
The Tory General Election candidate for the town , which suffers from deprivation and is in desperate need of jobs , wrote to the Prison Service to demand an explanation .
In an astonishing reply , director of finance Ann Beasley - one of Home Secretary John Reid 's top civil servants - said the town had too many white British residents .
As a result , it does not satisfy the drive to recruit more ethnic minorities .
Under the heading " key influencing factors " , the letter states : " Our ability to attract a more diverse workforce - 93.7 per cent of the population of Corby are white British , compared to 59.6 per cent in Leicester > "
Mrs Beasley also implies Corby 's residents are also too stupid to keep the jobs , which are mostly clerical posts buying equipment for the prison service .
She states that 17 per cent of people living in Leicester are qualified to degree level , compared with only nine per cent in Corby .
Furious opposition politicians were stunned by the reply and accused Labour of effectively being racist against whites .
The Conservative 's diversity spokesman , Dominic Grieve , said : " This is very worrying .
The Government should not be penalising people because of the ethnic make - up of where they live .
The Government needs to explain just how widespread this policy is . "
Louise Bagshawe , the candidate who received the letter , said : " Labour has controlled Corby council for 23 years and the town is very deprived .
We have the lowest wages in Northamptonshire .
Now locals are being told that Corby is too British for British jobs . "
She added : " I told Ann Beasley our town already has a thriving Polish immigrant community , but she ignored this .
Corby is just beginning to turn the corner , but we need good jobs .
" Gordon Brown loves to bang on about Britishness - if he means it , I call on him to reverse this disgraceful policy and tell Corby people they are n't too " white British " for Government jobs . "
Kettering 's Tory MP Philip Hollobone , whose constituents are also facing job losses , added : " People will be hugely offended that a decision like this is being made on racial grounds . "
The Home Office last night stood by the letter , saying that attracting a " more diverse workforce " was a " key factor " in moving the jobs .
Discriminating against somebody on the grounds of race is outlawed by the Race Relations Act 2000 .
But the Act does allow public bodies to take " positive action " to meet recruitment targets .
In this instance , it would be illegal to say that the jobs must be filled by ethnic minority recruits , but moving to an area where they are more likely to apply for the posts is not illegal .
Staff based at the Crown House building in Corby will lose their jobs on March 19 when the building closes for regeneration work .
It had been assumed the Prison Service would find a new office in the town - which has an above average unemployment rate of 5.7 per cent , compared with 5.2 per cent nationwide .
But officials , keen to fall in with Labour 's " diversity agenda " , seized the opportunity to move jobs to Leicester , one of the UK 's most ethnically - mixed cities .
Staff have been given the option of transferring , but few - if any - are expected to agree to the lengthy commute .
A spokesman for the Commission for Racial Equality said that if they receive a complaint from any of the workers involved , they will start a full investigation .
A Prison Service spokesman said : " The potential sale of the property has given Her Majesty 's Prison Service the opportunity to look at what provides the best option for the Prison Service and therefore the taxpayer in the medium to longer term .
" The key factors that influenced our decision to relocate to Leicester were the closer proximity to a greater number of prison establishments , better transport links , the ability to recruit professional staff and the ability to attract a more diverse workforce . "

Chuck Hagel tells ABC that impeachment is an option for a monarchy ...
Download Download ( h/t Scarce )
ABC supplies the transcript :
HAGEL : Well , any president who says , I do n't care , or I will not respond to what the people of this country are saying about Iraq or anything else , or I do n't care what the Congress does , I am going to proceed -- if a president really believes that , then there are -- what I was pointing out , there are ways to deal with that .
This is not a monarchy .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
It is clear to me that you are angry about this , and you also gave an interview to Esquire magazine this month , the April edition of Esquire magazine , where you were quoted as saying , " The president says , ' I do n't care . '
He 's not accountable anymore .
He 's not accountable anymore , which is n't totally true .
You can impeach him .
And before this is over , you might see calls for his impeachment . "
STEPHANOPOULOS :
And you think that would be appropriate in this case ?
HAGEL : I 'm sorry ?
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You think that would be appropriate in this case ?
HAGEL : I did n't say that , I did n't call for it , I did n't predict it .
What I was saying , I was laying out options here .
No president can dictate to this country , nor should he .
This is a constitutional form of government .
We have three equal branches of government .
No president is bigger than the other two .
There are three co-equal branches of government .
Article I of the Constitution is not the presidency ; it 's the Congress .
So what I was pointing out , George , is that there are ways to deal with it .
And I would hope the president understands that .
I mean , his comments this weekend , yesterday in his radio address , were astounding to me .
Saying to the Congress , in effect , you do n't belong in this , I 'm in charge of Iraq .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You 're talking about the U.S. attorney controversy .
HAGEL : No , I 'm talking about what he was referring to specifically in his radio address , about what the House of Representatives did on Friday .
STEPHANOPOULOS : On Iraq , OK .
HAGEL : On Iraq , and essentially dismissing them .
Now , he can disagree , of course .
I understand that .
That 's his responsibility .
But to dismiss them -- the Congress , by saying , you do n't have a role in this , you 're irrelevant to this -- he 's getting some bad advice , and I would suggest they all go back and re-read the Constitution .
My first essay , Prop 87 : Deceptively Marketed , addressed 3 specific claims coming from the proponents , and then I offered up my predictions .
In the second essay , I went directly after a number of irresponsible claims that Vinod Khosla made in his second essay .
Mr. Khosla is essentially betting people 's lives by making the claims he is making .
If , ten years down the road , it becomes clear that he can't deliver , we will have lost ten precious years in which we could have embarked upon a massive effort to deal with Peak Oil .
But as long as there are Vinod Khoslas out there , naively making promises that everything will be OK , that massive effort will be delayed .
Our energy policy is far too important , so I believe Mr. Khosla 's promises should be vigorously challenged .
Since there is likely to be little overlap in the readership of TOD and VentureBeat , the TOD staff thought it would be topical material for cross-posting here .
Therefore , below is the text of my rebuttal to Vinod Khosla 's claims , which can be found in essays that he wrote for VentureBeat and The Huffington Post .
Please note that I am not arguing for a " No " vote , nor am I making a blanket defense of the oil industry .
I am responding to Mr. Khosla 's claims .
-------------------------------------
Apparently some Proposition 87 proponents have never heard the adage " People in glass houses should n't throw stones . "
They complain about slimy tactics , while engaging in plenty of slimy tactics and hypocrisy themselves .
In this essay , I will address Mr. Khosla 's second essay and show that his glass house is vulnerable to my pile of stones .
This is also why I become concerned when people with expertise in one field try to influence policy in another .
My dentist is a great guy , and very good at what he does , but I would n't let him remove my appendix .
And while he should certainly be involved in the discourse , he should n't receive undue influence on energy policy just because he is a good dentist .
I explained in my previous essay who I am , and that I am not campaigning against Proposition 87 .
My interest is in raising the level of political discourse with respect to energy policy .
My criticisms are aimed at the " Yes on 87 " campaign , because much misinformation is being directed at my own industry .
I find it very ironic that those who are flying around the country to decry the " evil oil industry " are doing so using jet fuel supplied by the oil industry .
They enjoy many conveniences as a result of oil and gas production , but have deluded themselves into believing their lifestyle could be maintained if we all switched to alternative energy .
I do n't live in California and have never seen an ad from either side , but I have seen a number of " Yes " essays in the mold of Mr. Khosla 's latest missive .
So let 's dissect his latest entry for some examples of hypocrisy , misinformation , and faulty logic .
Mr. Khosla 's comments are in quotes .
Given the current oil situation the ONLY way oil prices will go down is if we have alternatives to oil .
Since it does n't benefit any big business interests , conservation , probably the most valuable " alternative " out there , is mostly overlooked in this debate .
Mr. Khosla :
Given the massive profits they make on oil they would n't want a cheaper alternative in the marketplace .
I covered profit margins in my previous essay , and noted the hypocrisy coming from an industry that sees double the profit margins of the oil industry .
But " they would n't want a cheaper alternative " is misinformation .
The entry barrier for ethanol production and biodiesel is quite low .
If ethanol is ultimately a cheaper option , oil companies will start making ethanol .
Right now , most do not see that it is clearly viable in the long - term without subsidies .
In fact Mr. Khosla was recently quoted in Red Herring : " Contrary to what you might believe , I think it 's extremely unlikely that in 20 years we will be using any ethanol in cars . "
I think the oil industry shares this view , which is why they are n't rushing out to build ethanol plants .
However , oil companies have made big investments into solar , wind , and biofuels .
In fact , Iogen , a company running a large scale cellulosic ethanol trial , is receiving major funding from Shell .
Of course this puts oil companies in a " damned either way " position .
If they invest in alternatives , critics say it is a token effort , or just for public relations .
If they do n't , then they are standing in the way of progress .
It is also unfair if they use their political clout to wrangle billions of dollars of subsidies from American taxpayers .
Given that the ethanol industry receives billions in direct subsidies and you are trying to secure even more with Prop 87 , I am going to call this a bit of hypocrisy .
The ethanol industry is the recipient of $ 0.51 gallon in direct ethanol subsidies .
However , the subsidy is per gallon of ethanol produced , as opposed to actual net energy produced .
If the ethanol energy return is 1.3/1 , then it takes 3.3 gallons produced to net the energy equivalent of 1 gallon of gasoline .
The website Zfacts , strongly supportive of alternative energy , concludes that when all the subsidies are added in , displacing a single gallon of gasoline costs $ 7.24 in ethanol .
Furthermore , the ethanol industry depends on fossil fuels to drive their trucks and tractors , so any oil " subsidy " is also an indirect ethanol subsidy .
Many ethanol advocates claim that the $ 0.51 / gallon subsidy actually benefits the oil industry .
Without going into a detailed analysis of why this claim is wrong ( it essentially allows ethanol producers to charge $ 0.51 / gal more than market conditions would warrant ) , ask yourself why it is the ethanol / farm lobby who is fighting to keep this subsidy , and oil interests who are speaking out against it .
Note that the executive vice president of the American Coalition for Ethanol vigorously defends the subsidy .
Is this a case of oil company benevolence ?
And they often make us pay for their R&D .
As compared to making your competitor pay for your R&D ?
I will admit , it is a brilliant move to force your competitor to fund your own research , but the above statement really takes hypocrisy to a whole new level .
The world uses about 12 billion gallons of ethanol today .
If that was removed form the market , oil prices would spike up .
If we produce more , oil prices will decline as supply increases .
This one is just faulty logic .
Ethanol production in the past few years has exploded .
Did oil prices decline ?
A few token projects to " sound green " are thrown in but almost no money goes into finding real alternatives to oil .
As I stated earlier : " Damned either way . "
Even the small technology oriented Silicon Valley company can spend 20 % of its revenue on R&D .
I have an idea then .
Since Silicon
Valley is so innovative , and we know that companies there are quite profitable , why do n't we tax them to fund this measure ?
That seems like a real win -win solution .
The people who most strongly support this proposition will be the ones who will both pay for it , and " benefit " from it .
The oilies are scare mongering with their massive dollars .
We actually prefer our pejoratives to be capitalized .
But this is an example of the need to raise the political discourse .
Also - and feel free to correct me if I am wrong - the proponents are spending tens of millions of dollars to push this measure , and they are doing it with tactics that have been more along the lines of hate mongering .
President Clinton has said ethanol is 33 % cheaper .
I know it is cheaper to produce , even with the subsidies oil currently manages to get .
Ignoring the repeated hypocrisy over the subsidies , let 's talk about economics .
Now , I may not be well - versed in Silicon Valley economics , but here 's what I think .
If I have a product that I can make for cheaper than the competitor , why would I need mandates , subsidies , and an extortion tax on my competitors in order to compete ?
I do n't really think I would need this , if indeed the claim is true .
So , that leaves me to believe that either the claim is n't true , or ethanol companies are worse than oil companies at " ripping people off . "
Let 's consider the following graph from the official Nebraska government website :
A 25 - Year Price Comparison
This is a comparison of the average annual rack price of ethanol versus mid-grade gasoline for the past 25 years .
Ethanol , with lower energy content , has been more expensive than gasoline in each of the past 25 years .
So there is a track record over a long period of time that suggests that not only do ethanol prices rise and fall in response to gasoline prices ( putting a damper on the argument that ethanol is going to drive down gasoline prices ) but the price differential is actually greater since most people do n't buy the more expensive mid-grade .
Now , if Mr. Khosla is correct , and it is in fact cheaper to produce ethanol than gasoline , it suggests that 1 ) .
Ethanol profit margins are far higher than gasoline profit margins ; 2 ) .
Ethanol producers are " ripping us all off " ; and 3 ) .
Ethanol producers should have no problem funding their own growth .
I hope that Mr. Khosla can see that his glass house is quite vulnerable .
I call on him to raise the level of discourse on our energy policy - regardless of the outcome of the vote .
SF supes vote to ban plastic bags in stores
San Francisco Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi hands out canvas shopping bags , Tuesday , March 27 , 2007 , in San Francisco .
San Francisco's Board of Supervisors on Tuesday is to consider passing an ordinance that would require large supermarkets and pharmacies in the city to replace non-biodegradable plastic bags with reusable or recyclable bags , a move that would make San Francisco the first city in the U.S. to introduce such a ban .
Mirkarimi , who sponsored the original version of the ordinance , said the proposal has the support of most supervisors , the city 's garbage disposal contractor , and even many smaller retailers , who wo n't have to comply with the ban .

SAN FRANCISCO -- San Francisco's Board of Supervisors voted 10 - 1 this afternoon to make the city the first in the nation to prohibit petroleum - based plastic checkout bags in large markets and pharmacies .
On the first of two votes needed for final passage , supervisors approved legislation sponsored by Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi that would mandate the use of biodegradable plastic bags or recyclable paper bags .
The legislation would take effect in about six months for some 50 large markets in San Francisco and would apply in about 12 months to large drugstore chains such as Walgreen 's and Rite - Aid .
" Hopefully , other cities and states will follow suit , " said Mirkarimi .
Mirkarimi introduced his legislation earlier this year after the collapse of an agreement between the California Grocers Association and the city .
That agreement was supposed to reduce by 10 million the estimated 180 million plastic bags distributed to shoppers in 2006 .
The grocers association said it cut use of the bags by 7.6 million but the city said those figures were unreliable .
Aside from the petroleum required to manufacture them , plastic bags are blamed for gumming up recycling machines , taking up space in landfills and killing or sickening marine mammals .
The grocers association argues that it already has plastic bag recycling centers operating in many large markets and that new compostable bags could confuse recycling efforts .
Supervisor Ed Jew , who said he has heard from constituents wondering why supervisors have spent so much time on the issue of plastic bags , was the only member to vote against the legislation .
Re : Web application design : the REST of the story
This document is the result an e-mail conversation between Marco Baringer and Dave Roberts .
The conversation started with Dave Roberts ' blog posting talking about REST in the context of web applications .
Marco Baringer 's writing is enclosed in boxes like this one , while Dave Roberts ' writing is enclosed in boxes like this .
On REST
In short :
The REST camp is right , but our definition of " web application " is too wide .
The term " web application , " in its common use , appiles to two radically different things whcih both travel over HTTP : databases interfaces ( amazon is the classical example but sites such as lexus nexus and ebay fit in here as well ) .
These are systems where someone is asking a server for information .
applications which just happen to use the browser for the GUI .
( what you called interactive applications ) .
I 'd argue that REST is the perfect ( and only ) tool for the first category , while continuations work great for the second .
I 'd also argue that most " web sites " are a mix of both .
Take amazon for example , when I use amazon there are two independant things i want to do 1 ) browse for books and 2 ) buy books .
the browsing part should follow the REST principles , however the buying part should not , purchasing a book is an inherently statefull operation which requires the server to maintain some of the client 's state .
The order of operations in purchasing a book is complex and , imnsho , much easier to express using continutations .
At the same time writing the code to show book details is much easier when you just transalte a url into an sql query and show the resulting rows .
I 'm not totally convinced that the checkout portion can't be made REST as well .
The REST crowd actually thinks so .
Clearly , there is state , but they would say that the state should either return with the next request or should be stored on the server side in the database , not carried in the web server .
That may be bending the rules on REST , though .
i'm not going to argue that i can't , only that it should n't .
The application , and its underlying database , have a certain state which is global and shared by everyone .
Then there is the state of GUI , this information ( what page we 're looking at , what the navigation history is , etc. ) may be implemented in the DB but it's not application state , its GUI state .
When the REST guys start sending this GUI state in the response objects they run into a number of obstacles ( since they need to send all of the GUI state for every response ) : 1 ) object marshalling , 2 ) malicious clients 3 ) request / response size limits .
Continuation based apps need only send : 1 ) a key ( generally a random string a few tens of characters long ) specifying the session and the point in the sesion history , 2 ) what 's changed in the user interface .
Right .
I would agree that it 's much easier to just use standard session data like most web servers provide today .
The REST guys would just argue that it 's less scalable .
And they 're right , too .
The big question is , does it only matter for sites like Amazon or EBay which are massive , or does it come into play at lower levels of scalability , too .
The REST guys are against sessions ?
I do n't think that 's what they meant ; how else would you ever implement anything personalized ?
Yep , they 're against sessions and consequently generally down on personalization .
Their answer is that this is n't REST .
I should probably qualify it , though .
* In the context of REST * , they are down on those concepts .
I think you 'd find many people that would say , " Sure , the only way to implement personalization is with sessions , and that 's fine when you want to go that way , but realize that you are now stepping out of a REST architecture style and you 're going to pay that penalty "
This is one reason why I think REST is most applicable to web applications that would otherwise use SOAP ( i.e. " web services , " not something interactive ) .
Maybe this is just another case of distinguishing between web apps as " collections of resources named by urls " and web apps as " applications which happen to use the browser for a GUI " Yes , indeed .
This does n't mean that you can't shoe - horn the statefull part of the application into REST but it does mean that REST is not the best option for this ( and vice versa ) .
Right .
The question really is , what penalty are you paying when you move outside the REST style , and can you afford that .
In some cases , you probably can .
My big question is , how much is the penalty for continuations ?
If it 's small , then no biggie .
If large , then you really have to think about it .
I could see continuations being very large , depending on how they were implemented , and that would definitely push you to larger and larger server front - ends with all the consequent headache .
when you talk about continuations and web apps ( interactive applications with a web GUI ) there are ( mainly ) two places where the continutaions come into play : writing the code - we ( some of us at least ) would like to write our code sequentially , even though it will be executed asynchronously and certain parts of it may be executed multiple times ( think back button and window cloning ) .
there is no penalty here if the contiuations are implemented by a compile time code transformation ( as ucw does ) .
[ well , there is a slight penalty since we introduce an oscene number of lambda calls , but its basically 0 compared to reading / writing the requests / response ( trust me on this ) ] .
Even when you use " full " built in continuations ( as SeaSide and PLT scheme do ) the overhead is still little more than a couple function calls and some memory ( stact ) manipulation .
The only thing I was worried about was the memory allocation , not the time to render the page .
As you say , either style 's speed difference is swamped by the cost of the I/O .
Again , my main issue is how much memory I 'm sucking up with all those various continuations hanging around .
And remember that I have multiple continuations per page ( every link , right ? ) .
That could easily be many KB per continuation .
Depending on how much back - button saving state I want to hang around , I could literally have MBs per user .
If my policy is to let that stuff hang around until a timeout of some sort or an explicit logout / finish purchase point , I have to worry about how many people abandon their session , etc .
You get the idea .
a ucw session object consists of : a 40 character id string a last - access time ( a fixnum ) an object table ( an eql hash table ) a list of session - frame objects each session frame object consits of : a 20 character id string a component object ( which may contain other component objects ) .
a hash table mapping action - ids ( 10 character strings ) to closures .
a hash table mapping callback - ids ( 10 character strings ) to closures .
a list of ( value . ucw : place ) .
a value is a lisp object , ucw : place is an object with 3 closures ( one for getting the current value , one for setting and one for copying ) .
what you ( and i ) should be worried about are all those closure objects .
a closure consists of two things : 1 ) a code vector and 2 ) an environment .
the code vector is shared across all closures in all sessions , so all we 're really worried about is the environment .
the environment is bascially a ( constant size ) vector of objects , assuming has a page has ten links each with an action ( in ucw the actions are generally simple forms which call some function on the srever ) we 'll have a couple objets in the environment .
each of these objects is however shared across all the closure in the page .
in all honesty i do n't think the cost of memory is such an issue , i did some quick math and came up with about 400 bytes per session + 700 bytes per request / response iteration ( assuming you backtrack about 10 objects per request / response and assuming each " slot " is 4 byte wide ( immediate objects are saved in the slot , non immediates require some memory for the data as well ) .
would this be a big issue for sites like amazon and ebay ?
yes . is this an issue for 99 % of the web apps out there ?
considering how the cost of 1GB of RAM , no .
what is a much bigger issue is farming out sessions .
if you do n't want to get swamped in serializeng / deserializng objects and sending them over the network you really need to leave a session on the same machine for its entire life , while dobale ( i should have a client who will fund this work in a few months ) it 's not immediate and you still run the risk of having one machine at 100 % CPU and another idle .
This is pretty easy and done all the time .
That 's why load balancers implement a sticky policy to keep a given client bound to the same front - end web server .
The issue then becomes how critical that data is in the event of a server failure , but the scalability model has been conquered .
saving the state - when the user clicks on a link we want to make sure that the state of the app as the _user_ saw it on the page corresponds to the state on the server , even when the user has used the back button .
in this case you , developer , have to tell the framework what state shoud be saved and restored based on the user 's request and what state is global and does n't change even though the user has " undone " some pages .
generally we save the state regarding the GUI ( values of forms , what the " current " page is , state of the navigation menu ) and do n't save the general application state ( user data , db manipulations , etc. ) how much you save is up to the developer .
i'd like to point out that this penalty ( saving and restoring GUI state ) is taken even by REST apps ( if they want to do things right ) , it 's just that 's its done by hand .
Yes , agreed .
State is state .
You have to store it somewhere and then restore it when you get another request .
the difference is who has to deal with that job .
in a continuation based system you usally end up with a framework where the saving and restoring is done by the framework itself , all you ( developer ) have to do is use tha data .
in the rest frameworks i've seen you have to do this work yourself .
Right , agreed .
The explicit model forces you to do more work .
The continuation model makes this seamless , but could hand you a huge scalability problem if you are n't conscious about what 's happening behind the scenes .
Like any high - level paradigm ( language , for instance ) , they can make some things seem really easy , but that can mask performance problems if you are n't careful .
The problem most people face is that you never hear about applications - which - use - browser - for - a - GUI , what you see 99 % of the time are regular old web applications whose underyling paradigm has n't changed since 1992 .
Those real world applications ( # 2 above ) are usually deployed on an intranet and neither look nor feel ( nor are considered ) different from a regular desktop application .
How do you mean that you never hear about those ?
Can you give me an example of an application that you know about that works that way ?
i've developed a document management systems for a law office and various patient management systems for hospitals , i've worked on buisness intelligence and e-learning tools .
None of these apps were ever accessable to the public nor did they ever have to deal with more than 50 simultaneous users , though they did have extremly complex user interactions .
Ah , got it .
I guess that 's the sort of app that I think that continuation - based methods would work well on .
If the user count is low and the scalability does n't have to go higher than those sorts of numbers , I see no reason not to use almost whatever technique is most expedient ( continuation , REST , or something else ) .
Rep . Henry Waxman announced today that he 'll consider issuing four subpoenas in a meeting this coming Wednesday , April 25 .
In a letter to one subpoena target , the Oversight Committee Chairman complained that a former White House Chief of Staff appeared on Comedy Central 's ' The Daily Show , ' but has so far refused to testify before his committee .
" On April 16,2007 , you appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and discussed the leak of [ former covert CIA Agent Valerie Plame ] Wilson 's identity , " Waxman ( D - CA ) wrote to Andrew Card , the former White House Chief of Staff .

Adobe Photoshop was once the most essential ingredient in every photographer 's digital toolbox , but it 's looking increasingly like a dinosaur in a new era of digital photography that rewards speed and convenience over polish .
On Tuesday , Adobe introduced a major upgrade of Photoshop , its powerhouse photo- editing tool and the flagship product in its Creative Suite 3 collection of digital media applications .
The upgrade , the first in three years , will be available in April .
Just five years ago , anyone who owned a digital camera also needed a copy of Photoshop if they were to do more than resize images and remove red eye .
But Adobe 's once - killer app has been rendered largely obsolete by a new breed of applications built exclusively for the vast and growing legions of digital photographers .
" Photoshop has been an essential part of my workflow , " said Lane Hartwell , a pro photographer .
" But actually I use less of it now .... I can do most everything I want without opening Photoshop . "
The declining prices of high - end digital cameras and the popularity of online photo - sharing websites like Flickr and Photobucket have resulted in an explosion of digital photography hobbyists .
These serious camera hounds are constantly snapping pictures , but unlike their analog brethren of yesteryear who built darkrooms under the stairs , they 're not printing out and framing the results .
Instead , they 're sending their snaps straight to the web .
The post - processing requirements of images bound for Flickr are significantly less than those being prepped for print work , which demands high image resolution , complicated color matching and other fine adjustments .
This lower threshold for detailed tweaking means that web photographers have less of a need for Photoshop 's post - production might .
Newer workflow management tools like Adobe 's Bridge and Photoshop Lightroom , as well as Apple 's Aperture – all of which allow photographers to prep batches of multiple image files quickly – better suit the needs of today 's shutterbug .
" We 've recognized for a long time that we need to evolve in the direction of being much more multiple - image savvy , " acknowledges John Nack , Adobe 's senior product manager for Photoshop .
To that end , Adobe recently launched Lightroom , a competitor to Aperture , that is built exclusively for the digital photographer 's work flow .
It only handles image files and includes database - driven sorting and organizing tools not found in Photoshop 's Bridge .
" A lot of photographers are going to come to spend the bulk of their time , in terms of selecting images and also editing them , in Lightroom , " says Nack .
Noah Kalina , a professional photographer whose Everyday photo montage video is one of the most viewed clips on YouTube , says the number one reason to upgrade to Creative Suite 3 has nothing to do with Photoshop .
" The real improvement is Bridge , " he says .
" It 's much faster , and the camera raw conversion is much better . "
Given the rise in popularity of photo - sharing websites , it 's surprising that neither Bridge nor Photoshop ships with any built - in online sharing tools .
However , Bridge does have a revamped plug - in architecture that will allow outside developers to build tools to leverage online services – much like the Flickr plug - in for Apple 's Aperture .
Laughing Squid's Scott Beale , one the web 's consummate shutterbugs , says he works almost entirely in Aperture .
" It saves me a lot of time , " he says .
" I can process my images and upload directly to the web with the Flickr export plug - in . "
" There 's no need for Photoshop unless you 're doing a tremendous amount of post - processing , " says Beale .
Adobe sees Bridge and Photoshop as complimentary .
Bridge handles basic edits , batch processing and organizational tasks , while Photoshop is the more refined editing program for those who want to go further with their images .
Indeed , Photoshop has always been developed and marketed as the ultimate toolbox for digital imaging professionals .
The application will continue to serve this need , even if it 's being used less and less by photo enthusiasts shooting exclusively for the web .
" There are plenty of cases where people really want to fine - tune an image , " says Nack .
" That 's where Photoshop really shines . "

The only thing that may be worse than a guy who avoids commitment is one who is lost without it
You probably know the type — in fact , you may have dated him a dude who moves from one megaserious relationship to another without taking a breather .
If this brand of love behavior had a poster boy , it surely would be actor Chad Michael Murray .
He split from his wife of five months , Sophia Bush , last September , and by April , he already was engaged to 18 - year - old Kenzie Dalton .
Ben Affleck , Tom Cruise , and Brad Pitt 's romances have also had a 0 to 60 trajectory .
Cosmo decided to get to the heart of why some men seem to have a hopeless addiction to love .
Surprisingly , experts say , love has little to do with it .
" Some men are codependent and insecure and need the personal affirmation and stability that comes with being in a relationship , " explains Jay Carter , PsyD , author of Nasty Men .
More often though , serial monogamists are thrill seekers who get off on the rush of new romances .
" They get caught up in initial feelings of lust and infatuation … and put their partners on a pedestal , " says Carter .
When reality sets in and they realize their new mates have flaws like everyone else , these guys can't get out of the relationship fast enough .
Then they leap headfirst into yet another union to keep their romance high going .
While in hot pursuit of this early - love buzz , these guys do n't take the time to measure their true compatibility with a partner .
And worse , when the relationship inevitably falls apart , they do n't pause to figure out why it did n't work .
So what do you do if you fall for a guy who has all the signs of a loveaholic ?
Bob Berkowitz , PhD , author of What Men Wo n't Tell
You but Women Need to Know , says to tread carefully .
" If he 's had a slew of back - to - back serious relationships , there 's a good chance you 'll end up being another one on that list . "
After a relationship ends , these guys do n't pause to figure out why it failed .

A plastic cup that can be reused without washing it , simply because contamination has no chance to stick to the surface ?
A self - cleaning surface like that of the leaf of a Lotus plant is ideal for many applications and consumer products .
These ideal natural properties can be imitated remarkably well now .
Structuring a plastic or other surface is now possible by using an ultra fast femtosecond laser .
PhD student Max Groenendijk of the Applied Laser Technology Group of the University of Twente ( Netherlands ) presents remarkable results with this new technique .
The secret of the Lotus leaf can be found in numerous tiny pillars with a wax layer on top .
Water drops are lifted by these pillars , get into a spherical shape and can simply not cover the surface .
Dirt gets no chance to stick to the surface via water .
The spherical drops roll off and take dirt particles with the , Again , nature proves to be a source of inspiration for the laser scientists of the University of Twente : they aimed at creating similar surfaces , but without having to use wax .
They succeeded in that using an ultra fast femtosecond laser .
The light pulses are so short that they can be seen as light ‘ bullets ’ with which the surface is bombed .
Max Groenendijk applies the laser in two separate steps .
During the first step , the surface gets a fine ripple structure .
This is caused by a special self organizing effect that works for almost all kinds of surfaces .
Whenever the laser removes some material , a pattern of ripples is formed at the bottom .
It is possible to influence this pattern with parameters like speed , intensity and polarization .
The second step is writing a pattern of perpendicular lines .
What remains is an array of pillars .
These pillars then already have the fine pattern caused by the first step .
This double structure replaces the need to have wax on the pillars , and makes the surface highly hydrophobic .
Treating surfaces directly would be to expensive , but by using a mold , series can be produced in an economic and easy way .
Silky feeling
Even for materials that are quite hydrophobic by themselves , the structure can improve the properties drastically , Groenendijk concludes .
Unlike in the unstructured , smooth situation , where droplets can still smear a little , the structured surface gives the spherical drops known from the Lotus plant .
The ‘ look and feel ’ of the material also changes , especially the ‘ feel ’ : a surface that has been treated , feels like silk .
This could be an added unique selling point , especially for trendy products .
To mimic the Lotus effect , several alternatives are available as well .
It is possible to use a coating to make materials self cleaning , but an unstructured coating will never be as good as the new laser technique .
Structured coatings could be an alternative , but applying a coating to a structured surface is another one Groenendijk is currently investigating , together with scientists of the Membrane Technology group .
Both groups are part of the Institute for Mechanics , Processes and Control Twente ( IMPACT ) of the University of Twente : www.impact.utwente.nl

Explore further Enhanced liquid repellence through flexible microstructures
When EPA advisory committee member Richard Sustich walked into his house on a stormy July morning , he was soaking wet .
He had just checked to see how the lake near his home in Lake Zurich , Illinois , was holding up in the deluge .
He dried himself off and brewed a fresh cup of coffee before sitting down to discuss another of the projects he works on .
A retired Water Reclamation District employee , Sustich already made a 30 - year career out of addressing water issues , but he just ca n’t seem to stay away .
Now he works towards finding ways to clean water using the tiniest technology available : nanotechnology .
Essentially nanoscale science and engineering , nanotechnolgy is driving scientists to look to the submicroscopic world — the molecules of water in a lake and pores in a filter , for example — to understand the properties of these tiny parts and to find ways to apply them to big problems .
Nanotechnology is already used in many electronic applications and in biological research , but now scientists are exploring the possibility of using nanotechnology to purify public water supplies .
The availability of clean water may not seem like a problem in most areas of our country .
But according to Sustich and other experts , even places with an abundance of drinkable water today may soon run out .
Within the next decade , the suburbs of Chicago might find their supply running dry .
“ Here you are within a 30 minute drive from the Great Lakes , and in the foreseeable future we wo n’t have clean water , ” he says .
Some of the reasons for this problem include population growth and an aversion to water reuse .
But the solution , he says , could be nanotechnology .
In some areas of the country , people already feel the pressure of limited water supplies .
In those places , local water companies either try to find ways to desalinate the water or they consider other sources — like wastewater .
The City of Aurora , Colorado , is spending $ 800 million on a major water reuse project .
“ Where water is already limited , you have people who are already making capital investments , ” says Sustich .
Nanotechnology could make water reuse a more feasible alternative , because it could be used to identify and remove contaminants that conventional technology cannot .
When attacking problems like water availability , nanotechnology is an attractive option because it has the potential to alleviate water woes worldwide .
According to the World Health Organization , as many as 35 percent of all deaths are due to contaminated drinking water .
Sustich says that nanotechnology could lower these death rates .
Dr. Mamadou Diallo , the Director of Molecular Environmental Technology at the California Institute of Technology , agrees .
A recipient of an EPA grant for nanotechnology research , Diallo sees nano - water purification methods as the wave of the future .
“ We envision that nanomaterials will become critical components of industrial and public water purification systems , ” he writes in a paper published in the Journal of Nanoparticle Research .
When it comes to cleaning and filtering water the traditional way , “ we ’ve gotten as far as we can go on the larger scale , ” says Sustich , who currently works at The Center of Advanced Materials for the Purification of Water with Systems , or WaterCAMPWS .
Water purification methods and chemicals in use today can be miniaturized and used to clean water and prevent illness .
In a smaller form , these chemicals could identify impurities and clean water more efficiently .
For example , titanium dioxide , a chemical used in sunscreen , reacts with UV light .
On the nanoscale , the chemical could be used to decontaminate bacteria - ridden water .
When water comes in contact with titanium dioxide and is exposed to light , the chemical breaks down bacterial cell membranes , killing bacteria like the ubiquitous E. coli .
Another way WaterCAMPWS , which is run through the University of Illinois and funded by the National Science Foundation , hopes to improve water quality with nanotechnology is through better filtration .
Over time , filtering leaves a residue on one side of the screen .
Although it can be washed , the filter will never reach full efficiency again , explains Sustich .
But by thinking on the nanoscale , scientists could study how individual molecules sit on filters and then design filter systems that are less likely get clogged .
Using similar logic , scientists can also look at how the molecules and the surface interact so that when a filter does need to be cleaned , scientists know when and how aggressively to do it .
“ The more you delve into it and see the capabilities at the nanoscale of what is already out there , your mind just starts to rush , ” says Sustich .
“ Your mind goes crazy . ”
Sustich says that some of the technologies may be implemented within the next five to 10 years .
Titanium dioxide technology is being tested and presented to industry right now .
The Department of Energy ’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory ( PNNL ) is also researching and developing nanotechnology to remove metals from contaminated water .
“ These novel materials are ready to be commercialized , ” PNNL writes on its website .
But this commercialization could also bring unintended consequences .
Scientists do n’t quite understand how nanotechnology might negatively affect human health , but they do think that inhaled nanoparticles could penetrate deep into the lungs .
“ It ’s not black and white , ” says Diallo .
“ No one wants to drink nanoparticles with their water . ”
Some non-profit agencies like the Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) and Environmental Defense caution that nanotechnology could hurt the environment and human health .
The NRDC ’s website states that if there is no government oversight and the public is not involved , “ we will be allowing the nanotechnology industry to conduct an uncontrolled experiment on the American people . ”
In order for NRDC to fully support using nanotechnology to purify water , “ there would have to be new research , ” says Amy Greer , a spokesperson for the agency .
Physicist Andrew Maynard , chief science advisor to the Woodrow Wilson Center ’s Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies , also calls for greater government oversight .
Maynard recently wrote a report titled “ Nanotechnology : A Research Strategy for Addressing Risk , ” which recommends that the government spend $ 100 million to investigate the risks of nanotechnology over the next two years .
That would equate to $ 40 million more per year than the government is currently spending .
Even if scientists find that nanotechnology can be used to purify water without any negative health affects , implementing the technology may be difficult .
The water industry is typically conservative and risk adverse , so convincing its employees that nanotechnology is the next best thing could be difficult , says Sustich .
Since most water companies are publicly owned , they are n’t allowed to make a profit .
And if something went wrong , the water company could be held responsible for a public health crisis , he says .
Despite the obstacles , Diallo and Sustich stand behind their belief that nanotechnology will ultimately help a growing world that uses water more quickly than the earth can replenish it .
“ I ’m still a positivist , I think that we are at the beginning of finding out where nanotechnology can take us , ” says Sustich .
Until the nanotechnologies being developed are put in place , Sustich will continue to work on improving water systems with the EPA , at WaterCAMPWS , and at home .
“ If it was n’t fun and it was n’t going to go anywhere , I have the luxury of saying it ’s time to move on to other things like protecting my little lake , ” he says .
Suddenly reminded of his local project , Sustich excuses himself .
There ’s another band of rain clouds on the way , and another round of observation close at hand .
Ed. note :
When initially published , the third paragraph incorrectly referred to nanotechnology as “ micro - scale science and engineering . ”

An extra 25,000 Glastonbury tickets will be going on sale this year
Photo tickets for the legendary music event will be non-exchangeable and ticket holders will be denied entry if they do not match the picture .
The £ 150 tickets go on sale on 1 April but everyone will have to pre-register during February .
An extra 25,000 tickets will be available this year .
Organiser Michael Eavis said he was " determined to wipe out ticket touts " .
Hopefully this ploy will be successful - it could really put the ticket touts out of business
Michael Eavis
" This is just not fair for the people who want to come along and enjoy the music .
" Technology has improved so much that we can now include a picture of the purchaser on the ticket and if you do n't match the picture at the gate you wo n't get in .
" Hopefully this ploy will be successful and catch on at other venues as it could really put the ticket touts out of business . "
Mr Eavis has promised the line - up will be the " best ever " but refuses to disclose who will be performing .
" I 'm really excited about the festival , there 's a real buzz about it this year , " he said .
Headline speculation
According to Music
Week magazine , Chumbawamba , famous for 1997 hit single Tubthumping , are the first band to be confirmed .
Rumours are circulating that bands like the Chemical Brothers , Kasabian , Razorlight , Scissor Sisters and The Who could headline the main stage .
There is also speculation The Police may reform and put in an appearance .
But Kylie Minogue , who had been due to headline in 2005 before being diagnosed with breast cancer , will not be appearing this year .
This year 's event is due to be held from 22 - 24 June on Mr Eavis ' Somerset farm , subject to receiving a licence .
This is a great question ... there 's a lot to love about free air conditioning !
It certainly would be an easy system to build .
All you need is a big insulated container ( probably in the form of a hole in the ground ) with some coiled tubes at the bottom .
You would run a chilled water circuit from the container to a radiator inside the air conditioner ( see How Air Conditioners Work for details ) .
You would need a small pump to pump the water in the chilled water loop , but that 's it .

So let 's make a couple of assumptions :
Let 's assume that your air conditioner runs for 12 hours a day for three months out of the year .
Let 's assume that your house has a 5 - ton air conditioner ( 60,000 BTU -- British thermal units ) .
Let 's assume that we can store the snow and ice with 50 percent efficiency .
That is , over the course of the summer we will lose half of it to melting , inefficiencies in our system , etc .
To cool the house , you therefore need :
60,000 BTU / hr * 12 hours / day * 90 days = 64,800,000 BTU
Multiplying by our 50 percent efficiency rating , let 's call it 130 million BTU .
If you have a gram of ice at 32 degrees Fahrenheit ( 0 degrees Celsius ) , it will absorb 80 calories of energy converting from ice to liquid water .
There are 252 calories in a BTU .
So we need 3.15 grams of water to absorb 1 BTU of heat .
The assumption here is that we are going to rely on the phase change from ice to water to power the air conditioner .
Once all the ice melts , the water will warm up quickly .
So we need :
130,000,000 BTU * 3.15 grams / BTU = 409,500,000 grams of ice
That 's about 410,000 liters of ice , or 410,000 kilograms ( 902,000 pounds ) of ice that you must store to cool your house all summer .
That 's a cube measuring 740 centimeters ( 24.26 feet ) on a side .
Very roughly speaking , you would have to dig a hole as big as your house and insulate it well , and then in the winter you would have to shovel it full of nearly a million pounds of ice .
But if you do that , you can cool your house for free !
( The value of the equivalent electricity to cool the house , at 7.5 cents per kilowatt - hour , would be about $ 1,500 . )
Scorsese 's latest film , The Departed , topped the US box office
His latest movie , The Departed , cost $ 90 m ( £ 48.5 m ) and topped the US box office , but Scorsese says he is finding it harder to make films in Hollywood .
" When there are very big budgets there is less risk that can be taken , " he said at the Rome Film Festival .
The director said his next project would be a " small - scale " adaptation of Japanese novel The Silence .
Written by Shusaku Endo , the book tells the story of two 17th century Portuguese missionaries .
" I have wanted to do it for 15 years , " Scorsese told reporters .
Career high
The Departed is a remake of the Hong Kong drama Infernal Affairs , and stars Jack Nicholson , Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon .
Nicholson plays a crime boss in Boston who plants a mole inside the city 's police force , just as his own organisation is being infiltrated by an outsider .
The film gave Scorsese the strongest opening weekend of his career , taking $ 27 m ( £ 14.4 m ) at the US box office .
The director said film studio Warner Brothers had been supportive during the shooting of " an experimental film like The Departed , which we only finished three weeks ago " .
" But I do n't know how much longer that can hold out , with regard to what kind of movie they - the major studios - would like to make and the kind of film I 'd like to make " .

The squirrel uses body language and movement to communicate
There are few things more intrusive than a mobile phone ringtone .
Yet , despite the existence of answer phones and voice mail , a ringing phone remains impossible to ignore .
Whether we are having a private conversation , snowed under with work , or just not in the mood to speak to anyone , the phone keeps ringing .
MIT research student Stefan Marti may have the answer : ditch your mobile phone , and get a squirrel .
Specifically , an animatronic desktop squirrel which deals with your calls for you .
The squirrel answers phone calls , works out if you are busy or asleep , evaluates how important the incoming call is and takes messages .
When it wants to alert its owner to a call , it waves and moves about rather than making a sound .
And , it is ridiculously cute .
Emotional intelligence Currently , the squirrel prototype needs to communicate with a computer and so is tied to a physical location , but there is no reason that the technology could not eventually fit into something the size of a mobile phone .
HOW THE SQUIRREL WORKS
See how the cellular squirrel deals with calls
In pictures
In previous incarnations , the device has been a bunny and a parrot .
The idea , says Mr Marti , is to dress the technology up as something which we would be happy talking down to .
" If you have a less intelligent metaphor that you base your interface on , humans are less likely to be disappointed with the limits of the interaction , " he told the BBC News website .
The key principle behind the Autonomous Interactive Intermediary ( AII ) , or " cellular squirrel " , is that machines should display what psychologists call social or emotional intelligence .
In other words , a computer should be able to communicate information in a way which is responsive to the social situations around it .
Mobile phones were the perfect candidate for this approach , says Mr Marti .
" Since we are using it on the go , our social settings are changing continuously , but our mobile communication devices do not adapt . "
Everyday stress
Technology generally is getting more demanding and taking greater advantage of our day to day reliance on the its functions .
Increasing use of computers at work has lead to greater stress
On a PC ,
If a program wants to attract our attention , it will flash at us relentlessly until we look at it .
Digital TVs pester us with instructions to press red buttons .
The result of this is higher stress , shorter fuses , anger and even resentment towards the machines we use every day .
Technology was supposed to make our life easier , faster and smarter .
And while the power of technology has increased , the way it fits into our lives has barely changed .
Mr Marti thinks the future will see us levelling the playing field , and interacting with the technology around is in the same way we interact with each other .
To achieve this , future technology needs to " have a deeper understanding of how humans like to interact , what humans want , and eventually what humanity stands for , " he said .
" This includes our immediate context , our thinking and our goals , but also our morals and ethics . "
Sensible interaction Mobile phone use is a major cause of stress on holiday Sooner or later , Mr Marti suggests , either technology will disappear completely into our lives , or get so complex that the only sensible interaction with it is through agents such as the cellular squirrel .
But there are still technologies , he argues , which just do not need to be improved , such as the lift or elevator .
" Although we have had speech recognition for some time now , elevators still have push buttons .
It just does n't make any sense to introduce a more complex interface when what we have is already completely appropriate . "
" You can make it behave in a socially intelligent way , such as speeding up for emergencies , slowing down when the conversation in the elevator seems to be interesting , stopping at the usual floors for passengers - all things that are technically possible today . "
" For some tasks , though , pressing a button to initiate a certain procedure is better than getting involved in a philosophical discussion with a wise - ass elevator about who is most important in the lift and needs to get where first . "

It has long been known that fewer than 10 percent of any swarm of mosquitoes in the wild will transmit malaria .
The conventional wisdom has been that this is just chance : a female must first bite a human unlucky enough to be infected already , then it takes about 14 days for the parasites to develop in her gut and migrate to her salivary glands , from which they exit into her next victim .
Mosquitoes have short lives , and a female is usually infectious for only her last few days .
This study makes it clear that genetics play a part , too , and that mosquitoes are not just passive squirt guns for malaria parasites .
Plasmodium parasites do hurt mosquitoes , Dr. Vernick and Dr. Wirth said .
They damage salivary tissue , make the mosquitoes fly less vigorously and lay fewer eggs and , to gain a toehold in the insect , may depress its immune system .
" The mosquito does n't want to be infected , so it has responded with this very powerful mechanism , " Dr. Vernick said , referring to what he called the " resistance island " on the mosquito genome .
By a very different route , the fungus also weakens mosquitoes ; they fly badly and bite less , and many die within 14 days .
For unknown reasons , it weakens plasmodium - carrying mosquitoes more than it does others , Dr. Vernick said , so if a strain of the fungus just strong enough to kill off old , weak , malarial mosquitoes could be developed , it could " tip the balance , " he said .
It would suppress the malaria - susceptible mosquitoes without creating mutation pressure on all mosquitoes to evolve a fungus - resistant form , as DDT created pressure to evolve pesticide - resistant forms .
For the study , scientists from the University of Minnesota , the University of Bamako in Mali , the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and Princeton University collected wild anopheles gambiae mosquitoes , the species most likely to spread malaria in Africa , in villages in Mali .
They let each produce a generation of offspring , then let them suck malaria - infected blood ( drawn from a villager , but fed through a plastic membrane ) .
A week later , they dissected them to see where the parasites grew .
They were surprised to find that 22 percent had no parasites at all , and that many others had low numbers .
Then they compared mosquito genomes and narrowed the search with a gene they named APL1 .
When they disabled it , they found that parasites grew well .
Scientists in the working group say the evidence for such impacts during the last 10,000 years , known as the Holocene epoch , is strong enough to overturn current estimates of how often the Earth suffers a violent impact on the order of a 10 - megaton explosion .
Instead of once in 500,000 to one million years , as astronomers now calculate , catastrophic impacts could happen every 1,000 years .
The researchers , who formed the working group after finding one another through an international conference , are based in the United States , Australia , Russia , France and Ireland .
They are established experts in geology , geophysics , geomorphology , tsunamis , tree rings , soil science and archaeology , including the structural analysis of myth .
Their efforts are just getting under way , but they will present some of their work at the American Geophysical Union meeting in December in San Francisco .
This year the group started using Google Earth , a free source of satellite images , to search around the globe for chevrons , which they interpret as evidence of past giant tsunamis .
Scores of such sites have turned up in Australia , Africa , Europe and the United States , including the Hudson River Valley and Long Island .
When the chevrons all point in the same direction to open water , Dallas Abbott , an adjunct research scientist at Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades , N.Y. , uses a different satellite technology to look for oceanic craters .
With increasing frequency , she finds them , including an especially large one dating back 4,800 years .
So far , astronomers are skeptical but are willing to look at the evidence , said David Morrison , a leading authority on asteroids and comets at the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View , Calif .
Surveys show that as many as 185 large asteroids or comets hit the Earth in the far distant past , although most of the craters are on land .
No one has spent much time looking for craters in the deep ocean , Dr. Morrison said , assuming young ones do n’t exist and that old ones would be filled with sediment .

Conclusion
Haskell has higher - order functions , and lazy evaluation , but not macros .
Does Haskell need macros ?
For the purpose of this , I 'm talking about macro in the " a little piece of code that expands out " sense , rather than the conditional compilation that macros quite often get used for in C ++.
If Haskell needs macros then there must be some benefit to adding them .
The reason that a lot of languages need macros is because they have strict evaluation .
Consider trying to write a function that selects one of two arguments , based on the first condition variable - some sort of if : iff a b c = if a then b else cYou can write this in Haskell .
You can also write this in VB ( and it is pre-defined ) , but it does n't do what you might expect in VB .
Haskell 's lazy evaluation is a big win here , opening up entirely new opportunities .
So what are the reasons to add macros ?
This is just a silly argument .
First off , a pure function can always be inlined away , so performance is not an issue .
A compiler might choose not to inline a function , but you can usually persuade it that it should with pragma 's etc .
And finally , there is the real possibility that you ( the author of code ) does n't have a clue what should be inlined and is actually throwing away speed for premature optimisation .
One thing that macros can do is to generate definitions , functions can be used to generate expressions ( essentially a function is an expression with some pre-defined structure ) .
You can't define a Haskell function that takes some data , and generates classes / instances etc .
For example , imagine that you want to define lots of constructors for binary operations .
Instead of : data Expr = Add Expr Expr| Mul Expr Expr ...
Here a macro might let you write something like : data Expr = binary ( Add ) | binary ( Mul ) ... Of course , this is something you really can't do with Haskell as it stands .
However most of the ways you might use a macro like this are covered by Haskell .
There are type synonyms , which may actually let you do the above trick with GADT 's ( I have n't tried , but its certainly feasible they could work like that , even if they currently do n't ) .
Classes has defaults which is another situation where otherwise this functionality might be required .
For most purposes generating code with macros is not about doing clever stuff , but about cutting out repetitive stuff .
Haskell has ( by design ) cut out most of the repetitive tasks , so no longer requires macros .
For truly repetitive tasks , Template Haskell can be used , or things like Drift and Scrap Your Boilerplate .
All of these techniques reduce the number of places where macros might otherwise be required .
One place where expressions are present , but functions are not allowed is on the left hand side of a pattern match .
For example : f 3.14159265358979 = 2.71828182845905
Of course , it 's silly to write this using hardcoded values , what if either of these constants change ? f pi = exp 1
U nfortunately without macros , this is not allowed in Haskell since pi is a function ( a constant arity function , but still a function ) .
You 'd instead have to write : f x | pi == x = exp 1 Not too painful , but what if you are trying to match a LHS with a free variable in it : f ( Neg ( Neg ( Neg a ) ) ) = Pos $ Pos $ Pos aHere you are matching a deeply nested constructor , and on the right have to explicitly bracket the terms .
However on the right you are able to use the function ( $ ) which due to precedence issues removes the need for brackets .
One thing you can't do however is : f ( Neg $ Neg $ Neg a ) = Pos $ Pos $ Pos a If ( $ ) was a macro , this would be valid however .
Haskell has no feature here that can reduce the redundancy in the pattern match .
But while macros would be useful here , how far would standard C style macros take us ?
Let 's consider defining a useful auxiliary : apply 0 f x = xapply n f x = f ( apply ( n - 1 ) f x ) Now we can rewrite this as : f ( Neg ( Neg ( Neg a ) ) ) = apply 3 Pos xBut we really can't write : f ( apply 3 Neg a ) = apply 3 Pos xHowever , its entirely possible to come up with a consistent semantics for this , so maybe one day this might be something people decide is useful .
For the moment the lack of macros on the LHS is occasionally annoying , but generally is not a feature that anyone is crying out for .
The LHS is rarely sufficiently complex for macros to show great benefit .
While standard Haskell ( mainly , ignoring MR and seq - for those who care ) has the fold and unfold law , i.e. you can inline a function and then contact it back , once you introduce rank - 2 types you loose this property .
Unfold still holds , but fold does n't .
This leads to lots of typing problems for things like runST which present rank - 2 types to the user .
While macros would paper over the cracks here , the real solution probably lies in the type system , which I believe GHC has in various flavours of impredictive polymorphism .
The other solution is not to use rank - 2 types , something I have been happily avoiding for years now .
Despite macros being useful in languages like Lisp , in Haskell their usefulness is probably minimal .
Lazy evaluation is often a substitute for macros , and where other languages require macros to define domain specific languages , Haskell solves these problems naturally .
Macros are quite a painful cost to a language , they reduce the assumptions that people can make and require people to play hunt the macro .
Haskell really does n't need them !

How does one explain all the misguided , unwise , sometimes outright boneheaded things the Bush administration has done since taking over nearly five years ago , and continues to do on a pretty much daily basis ?
How is it possible for a group of supposedly intelligent , experienced individuals to take this many wrong turns ?
Would n't you think that once in a while , even by accident , that George W. Bush and his advisers would make a decision that made sense ?
Can this much mismanagement happen totally at random ?
Would the occupants of the Bush White House have us believe that all these things , these missteps , these miscalculations , these attempts to deceive , that they all , you know , just kind of happened ?
I 'm not so sure .
And I 'm not the only one starting to ask questions .
More and more , it seems unlikely that mere human beings could make this many mistakes without some sort of misguiding force , a kind of supernatural entity that has trouble remembering where it put its car keys .
That 's where unintelligent design comes in .
Once one embraces the concept of unintelligent design - a kind of doofus - like cosmic force - it becomes much easier to get your head around the operations of the Bush administration .
I mean , making executive decisions randomly would still probably result in doing the right thing 50 per cent of the time .
So how does one explain such consistent goofiness , like invading a nation based on evidence that the administration knew did n't exist in the first place ?
Or exposing a CIA employee 's identity just to settle some personal scores ?
Ignoring international trade agreements you 've signed on to ?
Adopting a head - in - the - sand approach to the connection between human activity on the planet Earth and global warming ?
Letting the boss be photographed on the ranch , golfing and cutting brush and chilling out and generally having a good ol ' time while young Americans die overseas ?
Not having the media savvy to have that same boss take a stroll down the driveway and chat with a woman whose son was one of those young Americans ?
Doing an end run around the Senate to send a loose cannon to the U.N. , while supposedly promoting democracy abroad ?
Not firing a defence secretary who totally misjudged how many troops would be needed to secure Iraq ?
Giving rich folks back home huge tax cuts while soldiers go without adequate body armour ?
Looking upon scientific and medical innovations like they 're some sort of voodoo and letting other nations take the lead in these areas for the first time ?
You can't tell me that some magnificently dumb force , more confused and baffled than all the members of the Bush administration put together , did n't have a hand in this .
But I know what some of you skeptical types are thinking .
You 're thinking , hey pal , where 's your proof ?
Where 's the actual evidence , the cold , hard facts , to support my contention that unintelligent design has played a role in the decisions of the Bush administration ?
Well , that 's easy .
I have none .
Not one shred of solid evidence .
But let me ask you this .
What evidence do you have that I 'm wrong ?
My theory explaining Bush White House screwups is , by its very nature , impossible to disprove .
And if you can't disprove it , then you do n't have much choice but to consider it as an alternative .
That 's why I 'm pushing to have universities start teaching my unintelligent design theory in their political science courses .
Sure , these know - it - all professors may be teaching that Bush and his ilk do what they do because they 're captives of their own ideology , that they 're pandering to baser instincts and popular prejudices to shore up support among certain constituencies , that they 're willing to put their own political interests ahead of those of regular Americans .
Yeah , well , maybe .
But my theory does n't take as long to explain on the final .

Theodore Peckler lives in Monrovia , California , and is one of the 1.5 million people in the US who uses Voice over Internet Protocol ( VoIP ) systems to make cheap phone calls via his cable modem connection .
But last year , after five months using the VoIP service from the US provider Vonage without problems , he noticed an abrupt deterioration .
" The line was choppy , very choppy and you could not understand any words spoken , " he recalls .
Puzzled , Peckler ran pingplotter - a program to detect problems such as packet loss and latency ( delays in sending over the separate " packets " of internet traffic ) .
It revealed major latency between his cable modem and local internet service provider ( ISP ) .
" I contacted the ISP and was told it did not support third party VoIP , " explains Peckler .
" Vonage ran a test .
It seems the ISP was blocking the cable modem when the Vonage adapter went into use .
I ran a test of my own .
I ran pingplotter for 10 minutes : no blockage , then I picked up my Vonage phone and placed a call : immediately there was a 100 % blockage on the cable modem .
This was a continuous loss as long as the phone was used . "
Peckler is not alone .
Users on VoIP online forums in the US and other countries , including Qatar and Mexico , have been noting similar problems since last year .
For while VoIP ( often pronounced " voype " ) might seem like a great deal for the average person , entrenched interests in the telecoms industry see it differently - and are taking action against it .
Consultation
Mindful of what has happened in other countries , the UK telecoms regulator Ofcom took the unusual step in February of announcing that it will look at the growing VoIP market , and report next month on whether new laws are needed to protect it .
The consultation document says : " VoIP service providers have expressed concern that their ability to provide a reliable service may be impacted by internet access providers ( ISPs ) selectively degrading or blocking their VoIP traffic . "
Ofcom says it has no evidence this is happening in the UK ; only about 500,000 customers use it .
But the forecast is for that to rise by 3 m in the next six months .
And VoIP blocking happens in other countries , often those where there is still only a single telecoms company .
In Saudi Arabia , for instance , national carrier Saudi Telecom is using software from US supplier Narus to block all VoIP calls .
Telcos in the US and other countries are reluctant to have their bandwidth encroached on by traffic from which they earn no revenue , and have been challenged over similar alleged incidents of VoIP blocking .
Blocking VoIP traffic is technically difficult , but not illegal , and blocking specific types of internet traffic is on the increase .
Luxembourg - based VoIP provider Skype , now owned by eBay , has been particularly controversial .
Skype is used by 75 m people .
But not everyone wants
Skype on their network .
Skype is considered by many to pose a potential security threat because it opens an encrypted tunnel out of the network and forms supernodes that sit on a network and set up VoIP calls .
There is considerable debate about how much bandwidth such supernodes eat up .
US blogger Paul Kedrosky ( http://tinyurl.com/mjelx) noted a major impact on his main office PC , and links to warnings that in supernode mode , Skype may even saturate a 100 Mbps line .
" Skype calls can be very scary for the owners of the networks over which they run , " says Steve Bannerman , vice president of marketing at Narus .
Bandwidth
Skype says its software does not put undue pressure on bandwidth .
" Users who have become ' supernodes ' will not be able to notice any performance decreases on their computers , " says Kurt Sauer , head of Skype 's security operations .
" A supernode will use approximately a tenth of the bandwidth of a user listening to radio on the internet .
There are companies blocking or attempting to block Skype , but we believe they are making a mistake . "
There 's a lot of divided feeling about Skype , says Louise Cooke , managing director of Blue Coat Systems , whose ProxySG software can block Skype .
" Some IT managers detest it , " she says .
" They do n't want their network becoming a super - hub for Skype .
But others see it as something that may have business benefits .
We use it all the time . "
VoIP blocking is often a function added to network or security management software , such as Narus's IP Platform , Verso Technologies ' NetSpective 2.0 and SonicWall 's enterprise appliances .
Other providers with software capable of blocking VoIP include Bitek International , Packeteer , iPoque and Blue Coat Systems , and the list is growing .
One UK organisation that has blocked Skype is Brunel University .
" We had a number of concerns about uncontrolled traffic , " says Simon Furber , Brunel 's network manager .
" Skype is unpredictable because of its uncanny ability to become a supernode , so ... we shut the front door . "
This is still Brunel 's official policy .
" But this is a balancing act : a lot of people use Skype and asked us why we were blocking it , " explains Furber .
" And Skype just finds another way out of the network . "
So Brunel has now partitioned off its Skype traffic , using Packeteer 's Packetshaper software .
" We have corralled it so we can keep an eye on it and see what impact it is having , " says Furber .
How blocking works
Blocking specific types of traffic over an IP network is usually done by blocking " ports " - equivalent to boarding up doors ( if you imagine a network as a house with 65,536 doors ) or denying access to specific IP addresses ( equivalent to turning away particular people ) .
But Skype traffic is hard to identify , because Skype uses proprietary protocols , is encrypted and spreads from peer to peer , using a random combination of IP addresses and ports that defeats traditional port - blocking filters .
That means it can be blocked only by investigating the headers of every internet packet crossing the network to find the " Skype " ones .
The challenge is to do this quickly enough so that other services are n't degraded .
Narus claims its software can do this , and a major European customer confirms this .
A proxy appliance , widely used to apply controls to web traffic , can also be used to block specified unwanted traffic , including voice calls , if necessary .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Exam supervisors at a German university stuck to rules so rigidly that a man with a bladder dysfunction had to urinate in a bottle in front of 120 fellow students because they would not let him go to the toilet .
Overseers at the University of Freiburg in southwestern Germany told the 27 - year - old , whose bladder control was impaired in an accident that left him on crutches , that he would be failed if he left the room during the exam .
None of the three supervisors would accompany the man to the toilet despite other students ’ protests .
Eventually one female student emptied her water bottle so the man could go to a corner of the room and relieve himself .
In a letter written on Wednesday and seen by Reuters , university deputy head Karl - Reinhard Volz apologized to the student , saying the supervisors ’ behavior was completely unjustified and “ lacking in any normal human sensitivity . ”

Autogenics
Training :
Introduction LTHOUGH one of the most simple and easily learned techniques for relaxation is Progressive Muscle Relaxation ( PMR ) , autogenics , while requiring considerable time and discipline to learn , has more far - reaching benefits than simple muscle relaxation .
Composed of auto- ( from the Greek autos , self ) and - genous ( a suffix meaning produced by , and reflecting the word genesis , creation ) , the word was chosen by Johannes Schultz , [ 1,2 ] a German doctor , to describe his original discovery first published in 1932 .
Today , autogenics training [ 3 ] teaches you to self - produce a feeling of warmth and heaviness throughout your body , thereby experiencing a profound state of physical relaxation , bodily health , and mental peace .
Once you become proficient at it , you can use autogenics to overcome addictions ( such as smoking or gambling ) , change unwanted behaviors ( such as nail biting ) , resolve phobias ( such as fear of flying ) , and mitigate symptoms of physical ailments ( such as high blood pressure ) . [ 4 ]
If you tend to be a nervous or anxious person , autogenics can help you find an inner place of calmness and emotional peace .
If you are a highly sensitive person , with autogenics you can learn to cope with environmental stimulation by dismissing it from your attention rather than feel overwhelmed by it .
In fact , you can use autogenics to help overcome just about any psychological or physiological problem ; the results will vary according to the severity of the problem and according to your own discipline and confidence .
Be advised , however , that there is nothing mystical about this training .
It s pure physiology .
But it can be a first step to real spiritual healing .

c o m / a u t o g e n . h t m About
the
Training
Time
This training sequence takes about
Three Months .
If you decide to pursue it , it will be one of the most important investments of time you will ever make .
Moreover , if you do make the investment of time , please send
a donation to this website to express your gratitude for what you have received here .
What is the point of success  if your heart is stained with ingratitude ?
Gratitude is joy to the heart .
The training presented here does not take much actual time each day ; it is based on discipline over time .
You can find dozens of other websites on the Internet that make autogenics and healing itself seem simple and easy , so , as I say throughout this website , take your choice : the right way , or the easy way .
Remember : the only escape from darkness is to seek the light .
Some people ask about audio recordings for this training .
But recordings only miss the point .
Autogenics is not passive hypnosis ; it requires much conscious effort to learn how to communicate with your body so as to take personal responsibility for your life .
Keep in mind that this is not a training that can be rushed .
So , please remember that even if you complete any phase ( or part of a phase ) according to the specified repetitions , if you dont actually feel the results of what you are saying , then take the time to repeat the phase ( or the item of the phase ) .
Maybe it will take you four months instead of three .
So what ?
The idea is not to finish the training but to learn the material .
If you compare the initial extra work to the ultimate benefits over a lifetime , the burden will seem light indeed .

G u i d e T o P s y c h o l o g y .
c o m / a u t o g e n . h t m Suggestions
for
Practice H ere are some suggestions for practice :

Practice in a quiet place , alone .
If you prefer , you may use soft environmental sounds or classical instrumental music of a largo ( very slow ) tempo .
Avoid all other music because your physiological responses will be unconsciously influenced by the melody and rhythm of the music .

Keep your eyes closed while practicing .
Although you will need to open your eyes to read the instructions , just close your eyes again while you practice . 
Although it can help the initial training to lie flat on your back on a carpeted floor , so as to enhance your ability to feel the heaviness of your arms and legs , you may sit in a reclining chair if you prefer .
After you have mastered the complete training sequence , you can use your autogenic routine under any other circumstances you like , whether sitting , standing , walking , or lying down . 
Avoid eating , smoking , or drinking before practice .
It s best to practice before meals rather than after , because the digestive processes interferes with the relaxation process .
Never practice after using any intoxicants . 
If you fall asleep during a session , repeat that routine in your next session . 
You may practice in bed at night , but plan on falling asleep before you complete your cycle .
Therefore , consider a practice session at night , in bed , to be in addition to your basic practice . 
When you finish a session , relax with your eyes closed for a few seconds , and then get up slowly .
( Orthostatic hypotension a sudden drop in blood pressure due to standing up quickly can cause you to faint . )
Before you get up , you might want to count backwards from 5 to 1 , timed to slow , deep breathing , and then say ,  Eyes open .
Supremely calm .
Fully alert . 
During the training , you will be focusing intently on your inner experiences , to the exclusion of external events .
Therefore , it is possible that you might encounter some kinds of hypnagogic ( i.e. , dream - like ) dissociative experiences in which bodily perceptions seem distorted .
In general , just ignore these things and they will pass .
If you find them exceptionally troubling , then you might want to consult with a psychologist to try to understand the particular meaning of these symptoms for you .

G u i d e T o P s y c h o l o g y .
c o m / a u t o g e n . h t m The
Breathing
Warm - up The Breathing Warm - up
Use this Warm - up before every autogenics practice session , even after you have become proficient at the more advanced exercises .
Begin a process of deep breathing , exhaling to a mental count that is twice as long as you inhale .
With each breath cycle , increase the duration .
For instance , inhale counting ,  One ,  exhale counting ,  One , Two . 
Inhale counting ,  One , Two ;  exhale counting ,  One , Two , Three , Four . 
Go up the scale to six counts in , twelve counts out .
Then reverse : six counts in , twelve counts out ; five counts in , ten counts out ; and so on , down to one count in , two counts out .
w w w .
G u i d e T o P s y c h o l o g y .
c o m / a u t o g e n . h t m Phase 1 : Heaviness Phase 1 : Heaviness After the Breathing Warm - up , begin this Phase 1 practice with your right arm .
( But if you are left - handed , begin , in this as in all other exercises , on your left side . )
Breathe deeply , one count in , one count out , and silently repeat the following formula the first half of each phrase ( the part before the  / ) as you inhale , the second half ( the part after the  / ) as you exhale :
My right arm is getting / limp and heavy 8 times
My right arm is getting / heavier and heavier 8 times
My right arm / is completely heavy 8 times I feel / supremely calm 3 times Practice this routine two or three times a day , for three days .
After that , continue with the same basic routine structure but with the following substitutions : 
My left arm is getting / limp and heavy , etc.  3 days 
Both my arms are getting / limp and heavy , etc.  3 days 
My right leg is getting / limp and heavy , etc.  3 days 
My left leg is getting / limp and heavy , etc.  3 days 
Both my legs are getting / limp and heavy , etc.  3 days 
My arms and legs are getting / limp and heavy , etc.  3 days The Phase 1 routine takes 21 days of practice .
At the end of the 21 days , your last cycle of this routine will temporarily be known as your final Heaviness Formula :
My arms and legs are getting / limp and heavy 8 times
My arms and legs are getting / heavier and heavier 8 times
My arms and legs are / completely heavy 8 times I feel / supremely calm 3 times w w w .
G u i d e T o P s y c h o l o g y .
c o m / a u t o g e n . h t m Phase 2 :
Warmth Phase 2 : Warmth Begin with the Warm - up breathing exercise .
Do the final Heaviness Formula with all the repetitions .
( Heaviness and the muscular relaxation it represents is critical to the rest of the training .
So you need to master it well right from the start . )
At the end of the Heaviness Formula add this exercise for warmth :
My right arm is getting / limp and warm 8 times
My right arm is getting / warmer and warmer 8 times
My right arm / is completely warm 8 times I feel / supremely calm 3 times Practice this routine ( the Heaviness Formula combined with the warmth exercises ) two or three times a day , for three days .
After that , continue with the same routine structure but with the following substitutions ( remembering to do the Warm - up breathing exercise and the Heaviness Formula at the beginning of each practice session ) : 
My left arm is getting / limp and warm , etc.  3 days 
Both my arms are getting / limp and warm , etc.  3 days 
My right leg is getting / limp and warm , etc.  3 days 
My left leg is getting / limp and warm , etc.  3 days 
Both my legs are getting / limp and warm , etc.  3 days 
My arms and legs are getting / limp and warm , etc.  3 days The Phase 2 routine takes 21 days of practice .
At the end of the 21 days , you may use a final Heavy / Warm Formula to sum up the first two exercises :
My arms and legs are getting / limp and heavy and warm 8 times
My arms and legs are getting / heavier and warmer 8 times
My arms and legs are / completely heavy and warm 8 times I feel / supremely calm 3 times Practice this Heavy / Warm Formula ( beginning with the Warm - up breathing exercise ) two or three times a day for one week .
w w w .
G u i d e T o P s y c h o l o g y .
c o m / a u t o g e n . h t m Phase 3 : A
Calm
Heart Phase 3 : A Calm Heart Do the Warm -up .
Then begin the following routine which incorporates your previous work ( the Heavy / Warm Formula ) and adds the calm heart exercise :
My arms and legs are getting / limp and heavy and warm 3 times
My arms and legs are getting / heavier and warmer 3 times
My arms and legs are / completely heavy and warm 3 times I feel / supremely calm 3 times
My chest feels / warm and pleasant * 8 times

G u i d e T o P s y c h o l o g y .
c o m / a u t o g e n . h t m Changing
Unwanted
Behavior I n general , changing unwanted behavior involves three basic steps :
1 . To know how ugly the behavior is and how much damage it causes to yourself and to others .
2 . To know the damage caused by the behavior .
3 . To know the benefits of new and different behavior .
It is nt sufficient , however , that you know  these things intellectually ; it is important to know them by feeling them in the depths of your heart .
Autogenics can be helpful in changing unwanted behavior because you can use your autogenics skills to work through each of the three basic steps of change by actually feeling the elements of each step with the help of autogenic visualization and suggestion .
Of course , some long - standing personality problems have roots deep in unconscious conflicts , so you may need professional psychotherapy rather than autogenics .
Still , even in these cases , the autogenics approach can be worth a try .
So heres how to do it .
First , enter a state of relaxation by practicing your condensed autogenics formula .
This is important because the next two steps ( if done properly ) will arouse considerable anxiety , and you need to be able to reduce that anxiety again with your autogenics skills .
Second , create a negative mood state in which you visualize the harmful and disgusting effects of the unwanted behavior .
For example , if you bite your fingernails , see the ugly , raw nails ; notice how uncomfortable and embarrassed you feel ; see your fingers getting scarred and deformed .
If you smoke cigarettes , smell the stench of the smoke on your clothes and body ; see the stains on your fingers and teeth ; notice your shortness of breath and coughing ; visualize the poisons coating your lungs and other internal organs .
After the intense negativity of this mood has been felt fully , reduce the anxiety with relaxation .
Third , contemplate how miserable and wretched your life will be if you do not change your behavior .
For example , if you bite your fingernails , see yourself socially inhibited , fearful , and lonely , hiding your hands from view everywhere you go .
If you smoke cigarettes , see yourself wheezing for breath and dying of cancer .
Imagine your children suffering from their own addictions because of your negative influence .
After the intense negativity of this mood has been felt fully , reduce the anxiety with relaxation .
Fourth , create a positive mood state in which you visualize the beneficial effects of new , healthy behavior , all the while your anxiety from the previous step begins to dissolve .
For example , if you now bite your fingernails , see yourself as you could be with beautiful nails , moving your hands gracefully and without embarrassment .
If you now smoke cigarettes , see yourself as you could be , calm and confident , relaxed and able to concentrate , free of frustration and tension , a positive influence on others .
Fifth , reinforce your positive mood with positive statements of validation .
Repeat them several times .
Create your own , or select from the following examples .
Be careful , though , not to tell yourself lies .
If you try to claim that you have the most brilliant mind imaginable , that you will trample all competition underfoot , or that you will become the greatest such - and - such the world has ever seen , then such grandiosity will lead you right into self - destruction and psychological doom .
But if you complete the autogenics training successfully , all the statements below are honest and humble reflections of the discipline , patience , and respect for your body that the training requires .

My confidence is strong and steady .
I can deal with everything as it happens .
I have no need for [ cigarettes , coffee , alcohol , drugs , etc ] .
Substances no longer control me . 
My [ fingernails , hair , thumb ] are [ / is ] an important part of my body , so I will care for them [ / it ] with kindness .
I have no need to harm them [ / it ] or [ bite , twist , pull , suck , etc. ] them [ / it ] . 
I have no need to rush or be concerned about my speech .
I can talk slowly and clearly .
Just as I can take one calm breath after another , I can speak calmly , one articulate syllable at a time .
I have no need to stutter .
 I can work calmly and confidently .
My mind will not wander .
My self - confidence will not be bothered by small mistakes .
I can meet all obstacles with confidence .

I approach all tasks with a calm focus on the matter at hand .
I do not lose my concentration by distractions .
I act with discipline and resolve .  I listen to and respect my own body .
I can present myself to others with respect and dignity .
I will listen to and respect others .

I can remain calm , relaxed , and composed in any situation .
 I can dissolve tension and anxiety before it builds .

All cravings will pass within 10 minutes .
I have the patience to remain calm and to wait .

My calmness and patience can result in compassion and understanding .
I can get along well with anyone .
I will return kindness to any insult . 
My experience of peace and calm is not threatened by anything outside myself .
I have no need for rivals ; I have no use for jealousy .
I wish good to all persons . 
There are no good days or bad days .
I can do what needs to be done at all times .
I uphold my promises and value my word .
In my relaxation , an unlimited source of ideas is available to help me .
Sixth , conclude with a simple closure to the relaxation session .
Take a few deep breaths and affirm that  I feel / supremely calm . 

4 . Relaxation practice can help to alleviate a persons anxiety about the developing symptoms of any disease , and that s good because if a person stays calm , then anxiety wont fan the flames of the symptoms .
This doesnt mean that relaxation practice can cure a disease , but relaxation can delay the progress of a disease and minimize the symptoms .
Nevertheless , its always possible that a person of strong belief can use autogenic suggestions to so minimize the negative effects of the symptoms that the person does not become incapacitated to such an extent as other persons without such relaxation practice .
Therefore , its well worth the tryand not just for the specific symptoms of a disease , but especially because Autogenics practice could promote a generally enhanced quality of life .
All that matters is that you believe in the depths of your heart that there will be benefits .

The first principle is that you must not fool yourself -- and you are the easiest person to fool .
-- Richard Feynman , California Institute of Technology physicist and Nobel laureate
I violated Feynman 's first principle during a recent book tour .
I traveled daily through congested airports , crowded jets and crammed bookstores amid sneezing , coughing , germ - infested multitudes .
One day , while squeezed into the sardine section of coach , with the guy behind me obeying the command of the germs in his lungs to go forth and multiply , I cursed myself for having forgotten my Airborne tablets , an orange - flavored effervescent concoction of herbs , antioxidants , electrolytes and amino acids that fizzles into action in a glass of water .
In the logic - tight compartments of my brain , my magic module had trumped my skeptic module .
I had not given this product any thought until , much to my chagrin , the host for one of my tour stops , a Menlo Park , Calif. , Internet venture capitalist and science blogger named David Cowan , mentioned that recently he had debunked Airborne on his blog ( http://whohastimeforthis.blogspot.com).
A science - savvy investor , Cowan was quick to spot the clever marketing technique of suggesting that Airborne prevents or cures colds without actually saying so .
" Take at the FIRST sign of a cold symptom or before entering crowded environments , " the instructions say .
Then " repeat every three hours as necessary . "
In the ( really ) fine print , however , is this : " These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration .
This product is not intended to diagnose , treat , cure , or prevent any disease . "
Even more troublesome is how the company turned a liability into an asset .
Most drugs are developed by Big Pharma -- Brobdingnagian corporations with vast teams of scientists who have , to date , failed to cure the common cold .
Airborne 's creator is " Knight - McDowell Labs " -- Victoria Knight - McDowell is a schoolteacher and her husband , Rider McDowell , is a scriptwriter .
Instead of hiding their lack of credentials , they boast about them on their Web page ( www.airbornehealth.com): CREATED BY A SECOND - GRADE SCHOOL TEACHER !
" As any confidence artist knows , " Cowan explains in his blog , " disclosing unflattering facts up front wins the target 's trust . "
And $ 100 million in annual sales is all the data the lab needs .
As for real scientific evidence on Airborne , the Web page used to provide a link to " clinical results " ( no longer there ) .
When Cowan wrote to the company for the information , he received this reply : " The 2003 trial was a small study conducted for what was then a small company .
While it yielded very strong results , we feel that the methodology ( protocol ) employed is not consistent with our current product usage recommendations .
Therefore , we no longer make it available to the public . "
Why ?
The company CEO , Elise Donahue , told ABC News : " We found that it confused consumers .
Consumers are really not scientifically minded enough to be able to understand a clinical study . "
ABC News looked into the clinical trial and discovered that it was conducted by GNG Pharmaceutical Services , " a two - man operation started up just to do the Airborne study .
There was no clinic , no scientists and no doctors .
The man who ran things said he had lots of clinical trial experience .
He added that he had a degree from Indiana University , but the school says he never graduated . "
In one final lunge at product verisimilitude ( dang it , that zesty taste feels like it works ) , I consulted Harriet Hall , a retired U.S. Air Force flight surgeon and family physician who studies alternative medicine .
Hall looked up Airborne 's ingredients in the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database and found no evidence that any of the ingredients prevents colds .
Worse , vitamin A is unsafe in doses greater than 10,000 units a day , and Airborne contains 5,000 units per tablet and recommends five pills a day or more .
The only positive finding was for vitamin C , for which some evidence indicates that taking high doses may shorten the duration of cold symptoms by one to one and a half days in some patients .
But the large amounts needed may cause side effects .
" There 's more evidence for chicken soup than for Airborne , " Hall told me .
" In the absence of any credible double - blind studies to support the claims for Airborne , I 'll stick to hand washing . "
Chicken soup for the traveler 's soul .
We can't think of a president who has gone to the American people more often than George W. Bush has to ask them to forget about things like democracy , judicial process and the balance of powers -- and just trust him .
We also can't think of a president who has deserved that trust less .
This has been a central flaw of Mr. Bush 's presidency for a long time .
But last week produced a flood of evidence that vividly drove home the point .
DOMESTIC SPYING -- After 9/11 , Mr. Bush authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on the conversations and e-mail of Americans and others in the United States without obtaining a warrant or allowing Congress or the courts to review the operation .
Lawmakers from both parties have raised considerable doubt about the legality of this program , but Attorney General Alberto Gonzales made it clear last Monday at a Senate hearing that Mr. Bush has n't the slightest intention of changing it .
According to Mr. Gonzales , the administration can be relied upon to police itself and hold the line between national security and civil liberties on its own .
Set aside the rather huge problem that our democracy does n't work that way .
It 's not clear that this administration knows where the line is , much less that it is capable of defending it .
Mr. Gonzales 's own dedication to the truth is in considerable doubt .
In sworn testimony at his confirmation hearing last year , he dismissed as " hypothetical " a question about whether he believed the president had the authority to conduct warrantless surveillance .
In fact , Mr. Gonzales knew Mr. Bush was doing just that , and had signed off on it as White House counsel .
Atkins is easy to follow
The Stanford University study , of more than 300 women , rated Atkins ahead of three other popular diets .
Those who followed Atkins for a year lost the most weight , and recorded the most beneficial effect on their cholesterol and blood pressure levels .
However , the Journal of the American Medical Association study did not look at possible long - term health problems .
It seems to be a viable alternative for dieters
Dr Christopher Gardner
Stanford University
Critics of low - carbohydrate diets say they can store up problems for the future .
The Stanford team found no evidence of such problems emerging after a year on the Atkins diet - but admitted potential long - term problems could not have been identified in a 12 - month study .
They also accept that several basic vitamins and minerals can be difficult to get in adequate amounts from a very - low - carbohydrate diet .
However , researcher Dr Christopher Gardner said : " Many health professionals , including us , have either dismissed the value of very - low - carbohydrate diets for weight loss or been very sceptical of them .
" But it seems to be a viable alternative for dieters . "
The researchers randomly assigned 311 women to one of four diets :
Atkins diet : the lowest carbohydrate diet
The Zone diet : also low - carbohydrate , focuses on a 40:30:30 ratio of carbohydrates to protein to fat , a balance said to minimize fat storage and hunger
The LEARN diet : Low in fat and high in carbohydrates
The Ornish diet : Very high in carbohydrates and extremely low in fat
The study was set up to mimic real - world conditions .
The participants attended weekly diet classes for the first eight weeks , and received a book outlining how to follow their specific diet .
They were then left to their own devices to follow the diets as best they could .
Easy to follow
At the end of the year , the 77 women assigned to Atkins had lost an average of 10.4lbs ( 4.7kg ) .
Our concern about low - carbohydrate diets is that they severely limit the amount of healthy wholegrain foods that people can eat
Dr Frankie Phillips
British Dietetic Association
The LEARN group lost an average of 5.7lbs ( 2.6kg ) , the Ornish group 4.8lbs ( 2.17kg ) , and the Zone group 3.5 lbs ( 1.59kg ) .
The Atkins group also registered larger decreases in harmful cholesterol , and blood pressure levels , and a larger rise in beneficial cholesterol levels .
However , the Atkins group were also more likely to shed weight quickly , but begin to put some of it back on towards the end of the study .
Dr Gardner said the key could be that the Atkins diet was the easiest to follow .
" It 's a very simple message , " he said .
" Get rid of all refined carbohydrates to lose weight . "
He said the fact that people following Atkins tended to eat higher levels of protein also helped , as this was likely to make them feel full more quickly .
Dr Frankie Phillips , of the British Dietetic Association , said it was not surprising that Atkins led to weight loss , as it was a very prescriptive diet , which was likely to lead to a reduction in calorie intake .
However , she said many other diets were likely to achieve the same effect , and the long - term health impact of Atkins remained unclear .
" Our concern about low - carbohydrate diets is that they severely limit the amount of healthy wholegrain foods that people can eat , " she said .
" If a diet excludes particular food groups then people should consider whether it is likely to provide all the nutrients the body needs to function properly . "
Tell me what do you think about this people .
English as a Quasi -Official Language of China
When I got back from Manchester , two guest posts from Victor Mair were waiting in my inbox .
Here 's Victor 's first note :
In an earlier post , I observed the ubiquity of English - language teaching in Chinese schools , in most cases starting from the elementary grades .
More evidence for the growing importance of English is its usage instead of Chinese at international conferences , meetings , and diplomatic events , and even more prominently in business with other countries .
Attached hereto is a photograph that accompanies an article about the signing of an agreement between China and Cambodia concerning cultural preservation .
Wen Jiabao , the Premier of the PRC , is seated just to the left of center .
The signing took place in Phnom Penh on April 8 , 2006 .
I 'm only coming across this now as I go through some of the back issues of Zhongguo Wenwu Bao ( China Cultural Relics News ) that I brought back from a recent trip to China .
This report appeared on the front page of the April 12th issue .
Note that the Kampuchean hosts permitted the use of the older English spelling of the name of their country as " Cambodia . "
Click on the pictures below for larger versions .
One comment : since the event took place in Phnom Penh , would n't the banner have been prepared by the Cambodian hosts ?
And in that case , is n't this a question of Chinese diplomats permitting the use of English , and not insisting on Chinese being displayed as well , rather than a case in which the Chinese government itself prepared an English - and - Khmer sign for a bilateral meeting ?
But it 's certainly striking to see the Chinese premier signing a bilateral agreement with his Kampuchean counterpart under a banner in English and Khmer .
[ Update 11/27/2006 -- Josh Jensen writes :
I 'm catching up on the recent LL posts , and I just read this one .
It reminded me of a conversation I had with a Chinese young woman last year , a guide for our adoption agency group in Guangzhou , China .
She complained that when she 'd visited South Korea , there were n't enough English - language signs .

** How do you uniquely identify a person , without divulging the identity of that person ?
** For example , given a set of personal artifacts , how would I arrange the set of artifacts grouped by the person to which they belonged ?
The answer is quite easy , is n’t it ( especially given the title of this blog post and the image to the right ) ?
You can look at the fingerprints on the items .
Unless you happened to have a file that mapped the fingerprints to individuals , you wo n’t know who the comb and mirror belong to , for example , only that they do belong to the same person and not to the person who owns the scissors .
** The analogous structure in the world of information theory and computer science is the digital fingerprint , often created via a ** hash function .
MD5 and SHA1 are two of the most commonly used hash functions .
A hash function is a one way algorithm for converting data into a number which for the most part can be used to identify the data without revealing the data .
This is why it is common to hash passwords before storing them in a database .
In order to authenticate a user , I do n’t need to know the user ’s password , I just need to know that the hash I ’ve stored corresponds to the password you typed .
Don Park recently invented a system for representing IP Addresses without divulging the actual IP Address via a system of glyphs , which he calls Identicons .
This serves as a nice means of identifying commenters on a blog , without divulging their actual IP address , which could be a privacy concern .
The following image are some examples of identicons .
What ’s interesting to me about identicons is that they have wider uses beyond representing IP addresses .
As Don states ,
I think identicons have many use cases .
One use is embedding them in wiki pages to identify authors .
Another is using them in CRM to identify customers .
I can go on and on .
It ’s not just about IP addresses but information that tends to move in ’ herds ’ .
One way to look at identicons is that they are a visual representation of a hash value .
They sort of add even more weight to the fingerprint analogy by being visual like a real fingerprint .
For example , for security reasons , many free software providers provide an MD5 checksum of their software binaries .
You can see an example of this from the PuTTY download page .
The next screenshot shows some actual hash values of exes .
Looking at the first listing , we can see that for pageant.exe , the hash value is 01d89c3cbf5a9fd2606ba5fe3b59a982 , kind of a mouthful , right ?
Another way that could be represented is via an Identicon , which would be more readily recognizable .
Of course , in this situation , the security minded person would use an automated MD5 checksum checker rather than manually confirming the binary .
But do you trust your md5 checksum checker ?
A quick visual confirmation would be a nice additional vote of confidence in this scenario .
If you ’re interested in playing with Identicons in .NET , I recommend taking a look at this .NET port of Don Park ’s implementation written by Jeff Atwood and Jon Galloway .
Halliburton will maintain a corporate office in Houston , but the company will be controlled from its office in the United Arab Emirates , company spokeswoman Cathy Mann explained .
" Halliburton is opening its corporate headquarters in Dubai while maintaining a corporate office in Houston , " Ms. Mann said in an email to the Associated Press .
" The chairman , president and CEO will office from and be based in Dubai to run the company from the UAE . "
She clarified " he will work from and his office will be in Dubai . "
For a company that gets such a significant portion of its income from the US government , this is quite a stunning move , to say the least .
Unless it means that they expect that this revenue stream will end soon - or that there is so little oil left in the USA that this is no longer where business will be ?
Or that it is suddenly becoming safer to stay away from US law enforcement authorities ?
Last year , more than 38 % of Halliburton 's $ 13 billion oil field services revenue stemmed from sources in the eastern hemisphere , where the firm has 16,000 of its 45,000 global employees .
Mr. Cheney was Halliburton 's chief executive from 1995 - 2000 and the Bush administration has been accused of favoring the giant firm with lucrative no -bid contracts in Iraq .
Federal investigators said last month that Halliburton was responsible for $ 2.7 billion of the $ 10 billion in contractor waste and overcharging in Iraq .
Last month , Halliburton announced a 40 % decline in fourth - quarter profit , despite heavy demand for its oil field equipment and personnel .
Yeah .
Better stay away from these federal investigators .
Similarly , John Radsan , an assistant general counsel at the C.I.A. from 2002 to 2004 and now a law professor at William Mitchell College of Law in St. Paul , said , “ The C.I.A. is not supposed to have any law enforcement powers , or internal security functions , so if they ’ve been issuing their own national security letters , they better be able to explain how they do n’t cross the line . ”
The Pentagon ’s expanded intelligence - gathering role , in particular , has created occasional conflicts with other federal agencies .
Pentagon efforts to post American military officers at embassies overseas to gather intelligence for counterterrorism operations or future war plans has rankled some State Department and C.I.A. officials , who see the military teams as duplicating and potentially interfering with the intelligence agency .
In the United States , the Federal Bureau of Investigation has complained about military officials dealing directly with local police — rather than through the bureau — for assistance in responding to possible terrorist threats against a military base .
F.B.I. officials say the threats have often turned out to be uncorroborated and , at times , have stirred needless anxiety .
The military ’s frequent use of national security letters has sometimes caused concerns from the businesses receiving them , a counterterrorism official said .
Lawyers at financial institutions , which routinely provide records to the F.B.I. in law enforcement investigations , have contacted bureau officials to say they were confused by the scope of the military ’s requests and whether they were obligated to turn the records over , the official said .
Companies are not eager to turn over sensitive financial data about customers to the government , the official said , “ so the more this is done , and the more poorly it ’s done , the more pushback there is for the F.B.I . ”
The bureau has frequently relied on the letters in recent years to gather telephone and Internet logs , financial information and other records in terrorism investigations , serving more than 9,000 letters in 2005 , according to a Justice Department tally .
As an investigative tool , the letters present relatively few hurdles ; they can be authorized by supervisors rather than a court .
Passage of the Patriot Act in October 2001 lowered the standard for issuing the letters , requiring only that the documents sought be “ relevant ” to an investigation and allowing records requests for more peripheral figures , not just targets of an inquiry .
Some Democrats have accused the F.B.I. of using the letters for fishing expeditions , and the American Civil Liberties Union won court challenges in two cases , one for library records in Connecticut and the other for Internet records in Manhattan .
Concerned about possible abuses , Congress imposed new safeguards in extending the Patriot Act last year , in part by making clear that recipients of national security letters could contact a lawyer and seek court review .
Congress also directed the Justice Department inspector general to study the F.B.I. ’s use of the letters , a review that is continuing .
The mundane simplicity of the lottery only reinforces the attraction .

Because it is pure luck , the lottery is easy to grasp and allows for plenty of perfectly loopy — and very enjoyable — number superstitions .
Your birthday digits never won you a dime ?
Try your marriage date ; your favorite psalm verse ; the day your bullying father - in - law died .
Or , perhaps , reverse the order .
In studies , psychologists have found that ticket holders are very reluctant to trade their tickets for others , precisely because they have an illusion of control from having picked magical numbers .
This sense of power infuses the waiting period with purpose .
And the hope of a huge payoff , however remote , is itself a source of pleasure .
In brain - imaging studies of drug users , as well as healthy adults placing bets , neuroscientists have found that the prospect of a reward activates the same circuits in the brain that the payoffs themselves do .
“ It ’s not just winning the money but anticipating winning the money that is exciting , and the two experiences are similar neurobiologically , ” said Christine Reilly , executive director of the Institute for Research on Pathological Gambling and Related Disorders , in Medford , Mass .
People who gorge on lotto tickets , buying 100 at a time even after years of luckless playing , are no less rational than anyone else making big bets .
And lottery odds are neutral and fair , after all , not biased toward any social elite .
Seeing a Georgia truck driver win proves that in players ’ minds .
Large rewards make most people reckless , whether they ’re on the winning or losing end .
A 2003 University of Vermont study found that lottery players who said they preferred to receive potential winnings in annuity payments — generally thought to be safer than receiving the money all at once , in a lump sum — often changed their minds when they actually won .
And the higher the jackpot , the more likely people were to prefer a lump - sum payout , the researchers found .
( Mr. Nabors chose a lump sum . )
This week , we celebrate the fourth anniversary of the war in Iraq .
I still remember the start very well .
Time for a calculation .
1 . The newspaper today states one minute of war in Iraq costs US $ 380,000 .
A calculation made by Joseph Stiglitz , a US Nobelprize winning economist .
That is almost double the cost of the war in Vietnam .
2. According to WFP , the UN's food aid organisation , it costs US$ 0.19 to feed a child for a day .
Nineteen cents .
20,000 children die of hunger every day .
The time it took you to read this post , already 15 died .
3 . Taking those two figures together , one minute of war in Iraq would feed 2,000,000 children for a day .
One day of war in Iraq would feed 8,000,000 children for a year .
4 . There are 800 million hungry in the world .
Three - four months of war in Iraq would feed all hungry in the world .
Three - four months of war , we have done before .
Many times .
But we have never fed all the hungry in the world .
I do not understand .
Somewhere the calculation does not make sense .
Otherwise all intelligent people in the world would have cried foul .
Would n't we ?
... Would n't we ?

Update March 18 : I received a lot of queries about " the 19 cents / day " it costs to feed a child .
Here you find more detailed info .
Justice Department officials said Monday that they had only learned recently about Mr. Sampson ’s extensive e-mail and memos with Ms. Miers about the prosecutors .
The communications were discovered Thursday when Mr. Sampson turned over the material to officials who were assembling documents in response to Congressional requests .
The documents did not provide a clear motive for the firings .
Some suggested that department officials were dissatisfied with specific prosecutors , but none cited aggressive public corruption inquiries or failure to pursue voter fraud cases as an explicit reason to remove them .
On Dec. 4 , 2006 , three days before the dismissals , Mr. Sampson sent an e-mail message to the White House with a copy to Ms. Miers outlining plans to carry out the firings
“ We would like to execute this on Thursday , Dec. 7 , ” Mr. Sampson wrote .
Because some United States attorneys were still in Washington attending a conference , he planned to postpone telling them they were being fired .
He wrote , “ We want to wait until they are back home and dispersed to reduce chatter . ”
Mr. Sampson predicted that dismissals might stir debate .
“ Prepare to Withstand Political Upheaval , ” he wrote in describing what to expect as a result of the firings .
“ U.S Attorneys desiring to save their jobs aided by their allies in the political arena as well as the Justice Department community , likely will make efforts to preserve themselves in office .
You should expect these efforts to be strenuous . ”
Mr. Rove ’s role in expressing concerns about prosecutors had emerged in recent days .
The White House acknowledged Sunday that Mr. Rove had passed on complaints to Mr. Gonzales and Ms. Miers about David C. Iglesias , who was dismissed as the United States attorney in New Mexico .
Mr. Rove ’s role surfaced after the McClatchy Newspapers reported that a Republican Party official in New Mexico had complained to Mr. Rove in 2005 and again a year later about Mr. Iglesias ’s failure to indict Democrats in a voter fraud investigation .
Concern about voter registration fraud turned political in several states in 2004 where there were close elections , including some lost narrowly by Republican candidates .
In New Mexico , for example , complaints from Republicans poured in , including some from Representative Heather Wilson and Mr. Domenici , after President Bush narrowly lost to Senator John Kerry that year , and some voters claimed that they had been unable to participate because someone had illegally voted on their behalf .
The narrow loss by a Republican in the Washington State governor ’s race in 2004 produced similarly politically pointed charges .
Heilt Autismus nicht !
Ich bin kein Freund von Gruppen wie " Cure Autism Now " ( Heilt Autismus jetzt ) oder " Defeat Autism Now " ( Besiegt Autismus jetzt ) und ihrem beachtlichen Anhang an Eltern autistischer Kinder .
Sie nehmen wohl an , dass jedermann ihre Vorstellung teilt , Autismus sei etwas Schreckliches und dass es für jeden klar sei , dass Autismus ausgerottet gehört .
Damit irren sie aber .
Wie viele andere autistische Betroffene , betrachte ich Autismus nicht als etwas Schreckliches .
Das heißt aber nicht , dass ich mit den Heilt - Autismus - Leuten nichts gemeinsam hätte .
Genau wie sie möchte ich , dass das Leiden , dass mit Autismus verbunden sein kann , aufhört .
Ich möchte , dass alle Kommunikationsprobleme , der Mangel an Selbsthilfefähigkeiten und die Unfähigkeit , eigenständig zu leben , aufhören .
Dieses Ziel ist dasselbe wie bei den genannten Gruppen .
Warum also betrachte ich sie dennoch als Gegner ?
Nun , die Antwort ist eigentlich ganz einfach .
Man findet sie , wenn man hinschaut , im Namen der Gruppen .
Würden sie uns wirklich akzeptieren , als gleichwertige Individuen , dann würden sie nicht versuchen , uns zu heilen oder uns zu bekämpfen .
Ob sie das so meinen oder nicht , aber so interpretiere ich ihre Anstrengungen und ich bin mit diesem Gedankengang nicht alleine .
Autistisch zu sein ist etwas Wesensimmanentes - es ist Teil dessen , was jemand ist und es kann von ihm nicht entfernt werden ( wenn es denn eine Heilung gäbe ) , ohne die Persönlichkeit desjenigen irreparabel zu schädigen .
Mich zu heilen heißt : mich zu zerstören und mich durch jemand anderes zu ersetzen ... jemand Normaleres , jemand , den die Klasse der engstirnigeren normalen Leute besser tolerieren kann .
Autismus zu kurieren heißt : Menschen wie mich von der Erde verschwinden zu lassen ... meine Sorte Mensch ganz auszulöschen .
Ich betrachte das als eine Art Völkermord .
Ich betrachte die Auslöschung von Menschen meiner
Art nicht als die " Endlösung " der Probleme , die Autismus mit sich bringen kann .
Von Autismus zu reden als sei es eine Krankheit , ist für sich schon problematisch .
Krankheiten sind schließlich schlecht und solange man Autismus als eine solche sieht , werden die Leute immer an die Notwendigkeit einer Heilung glauben .
Würde man " Schwarzsein " ( also der schwarzen , negroiden Rasse anzugehören ) als eine Krankheit ansehen , würde es wohl auch eine Diskussion um eine Heilung davon geben .
Die Leute könnten darauf hinweisen , dass schwarze Menschen in der Regel ärmer und weniger gut ausgebildet sind und ein weniger angenehmes Leben leben als " normale " Menschen ( das wäre dann jede Gruppe , die groß genug ist , um ihre Lebensweise zur einzig korrekten erklären zu können ) .
Dasselbe , was man über das Leiden aufgrund des Autistischseins sagen kann , lässt sich auch über das Leiden aufgrund einer bestimmten Rasse sagen .
Sicher sind die Probleme , die schwer betroffene autistische Menschen haben , weit größer als die Probleme aufgrund der Rasse , aber der Punkt ist der , dass man diese Probleme , und nicht Autismus selbst , als den " Gegner " sehen sollte .
Man male sich den Aufruhr aus , den es geben würde , wenn man sich an eine Kampagne zur " Bekämpfung des Schwarzseins " machen würde .
Selbst wenn die Motivation dazu ein humanitärer Wunsch zur Beendigung der negativen Aspekte des Schwarzseins wäre , glauben Sie , die schwarzen Menschen würden ein solches Ziel unterstützen ?
Natürlich nicht .
Sie würden zu den Waffen greifen und das mit Recht .
Der Irrsinn , der hinter der Idee steckt , eine ganze Gruppe auslöschen zu wollen , um das Leiden , das manche von ihnen erdulden müssen , zu beenden ( und ebenso die Belastung , die sie für die Mehrheit darstellen , die sich lieber nicht mit ihnen auseinandersetzen möchte ) , wird offensichtlich , wenn man dieses Beispiel verwendet .
Ich behaupte , dass es beim Autismus nicht anders ist .
Viele normale Menschen können nicht zwischen dem unterscheiden , was den eigentlichen Autismus ausmacht und dem , was mit dem Autismus zusammenhängt , aber selbst nicht Teil des Autismus ist .
Die Grenze zwischen beiden ist den meisten Autisten , mit denen ich gesprochen habe , klar ; wenn man es sehen will , ist es auch ganz offensichtlich .
Die unangenehmsten Züge , die man an Autisten beobachtet , gehören in der Regel nicht zum eigentlichen Autismus .
Diese mit dem Autismus verbundenen Symptome erscheinen bei einigen Autisten , aber nicht bei allen , und sie sind kein Bestandteil der Diagnose .
Zu diesen Symptomen zählen geistige Zurückgebliebenheit , Wahrnehmungsstörungen , Verdauungsprobleme , Überempfindlichkeit , selbstverletzendes Verhalten , etc. Manche Leute sehen diese Symptome , sehen das Leiden , das sie sowohl für den Betroffenen , wie für seine Pfleger verursachen und sie schließen daraus , dass Autismus eine schlimme Sache sei .
Es ist wahr , dass diese Aspekte zum weiteren Kreis des autistischen Syndroms gehören , aber sie gehören nicht zum eigentlichen Autismus selbst .
Ich wünschte , man würde die Heilungsanstrengungen gegen diese Aspekte richten .
Es gibt Autisten , die keine dieser Probleme haben .
Wäre es nicht besser , statt die Autisten auslöschen zu wollen , diese Aspekte auszulöschen ?
Das wäre für mich das Vernünftigste .
Unter Schwarzen gibt es eine höhere Anfälligkeit für bestimmte Krankheiten , am bekanntesten ist die für Sichelzellenanämie .
Statt die gesamte schwarze Rasse auszurotten , um ihr das Leiden an solchen Krankheiten zu ersparen , wäre es da nicht besser , man kümmerte sich um die spezifischen Krankheiten selbst ?
Das Problem ist , dass viele normale Menschen nicht über ihr eigenes Konformitätsbedürfnis und ihre Herdenmentalität hinausdenken können und dass sie nicht erkennen , dass Autisten , so merkwürdig sie ihnen erscheinen , ebenso gleichwertige Menschen sind wie sie selbst und keine Heilung oder Besserung brauchen .
Sie sehen die negativen Aspekte des Autismus , sehen das damit verbundene Leiden , und unterscheiden nicht zwischen diesem und dem " merkwürdigen " Verhalten , das vom Autismus verursacht wird .
Sie unterscheiden nicht zwischen den Aspekten , die zu Behinderungen führen und den Aspekten , die einfach nur zu Anderssein führen .
Für sie ist es insgesamt ein Problem , das geheilt gehört .
Das ist kurzsichtig und es hätte am Ende fatale Konsequenzen für die ganze Menschheit , für den normalen Teil ebenso wie für den anderen .
Es ist offensichtlich , dass viele große Denker der Menschheit genug autistische Symptome hatten , um sich ernsthaft zu überlegen , ob es nicht einen Zusammenhang zwischen Autismus und Genialität gibt .
Der Zusammenhang zwischen " Exzentrität " und Genialität ist gut dokumentiert ; diese " Exzentrität " aber ist nun in vielem dem so genannten Asperger - Syndrom sehr ähnlich .
Ein überproportional großer Anteil an großen Denkern , Wissenschaftlern , Erfindern und Reformern in der Geschichte hatten , wie in historischen Aufzeichnungen dokumentiert ist , genug autistische Symptome , um die Annahme zu begründen , dass sie zum autistischen Spektrum gehörten .
Es stellt sich heraus , dass viele Züge des Asperger - Syndroms genau das ausmachen , was Voraussetzung ist , um ein Reformer und Denker einer Gesellschaft zu werden .
Autismus zu kurieren würde auch diese Menschen normaler machen , aber wollen wir das wirklich ?
Ein Genie normal zu machen heißt : ihm seine Gabe zu nehmen und damit das , was diese Genies der Gesellschaft zu geben haben .
In der Fachliteratur findet man die Angabe , dass rund 80 % der Autisten geistig zurückgeblieben seien , aber das ist absolut nicht wahr .
Man schätzt , dass unter allen Autisten vier von fünf das Asperger - Syndrom haben .
Heute geht es nicht mehr um die Frage , ob Autismus etwas mit dem Asperger - Syndrom zu tun hat ; heute weiß man , dass beides auf demselben Spektrum liegt und dass in Wahrheit beides nur unterschiedliche Schweregrade derselben Störung sind .
Man hat auch beobachtet , dass Menschen mit dem Asperger - Syndrom in der Regel durchschnittliche , ja oft deutlich über dem Durchschnitt liegende Intelligenz besitzen .
Damit ist Autismus keine Störung , die im Regelfall geistige Zurückgebliebenheit verursacht ; nur 16 % der Betroffenen auf dem Spektrum sind geistig zurückgeblieben .
Unter den 80 % , die zu der Asperger - Gruppe gehören , gibt es eine überproportional große Gruppe von Menschen mit einem IQ im Bereich von Genies .
Da aber das Asperger - Syndrom und Autismus nur zwei Erscheinungsformen einer einzigen Störung sind , würde die Auslöschung des Autismus auch die Auslöschung des Asperger - Syndroms bedeuten .
Autismus zu " heilen " oder auszulöschen , um die Probleme , die 16 - 20 % der Autisten haben auszulöschen und dabei das Risiko einzugehen , dass der Gesellschaft dadurch ein hoher Prozentsatz an großen Denkern verloren geht , wäre schrecklich kontraproduktiv .
Bedenkt man , dass die schwerer betroffenen Autisten dieselbe genetische Ausstattung haben wie die Asperger - Autisten ( wie man an Zwillingsstudien sehen kann , wo unter eineiigen Zwillingspaaren sowohl Autismus als auch das Asperger - Syndrom auftreten ) , dann scheint es viel vernünftiger zu sein , zu erforschen , warum manche schwerer beeinträchtigt werden und zu fragen , ob es nicht eine Möglichkeit gibt , dies zu verhindern .
Niemand will , dass Menschen wegen ihrer Wahrnehmungsprobleme leiden oder wegen ihrer Unfähigkeit , zu kommunizieren oder weil sie nicht in der Lage sind , ohne ständige Hilfe zu leben , wie das bei vielen Autisten ein Leben lang der Fall ist .
Das bedeutet aber nicht , dass die gesamte Gruppe , und damit notwendigerweise auch begabtere Autisten wie ich , ausgelöscht werden muss .
Die Lösung erscheint für mich so offensichtlich : man lösche die schlimmen Aspekte , die mit dem Autismus verbunden sind , aus und rühme und anerkenne den wunderbaren Beitrag , den der Unterschied zwischen normalen und autistischen Menschen zur Gesellschaft beisteuert .
Führt keinen Krieg gegen den Autismus , denn wenn ihr ihn gewinnt , das heißt , wenn ihr den Autismus tatsächlich besiegt , dann verliert die Gesellschaft als Ganze .
Lasst uns stattdessen den Autismus rühmen und autistischen Menschen dabei helfen , ihr Potenzial auszuleben .
Wir werden es dann anerkennen und die Gesellschaft wird davon profitieren .

These are tumultuous times for lisp .
Once the bastion of language academics and hackers and shunned by those of industry , it 's received much lip service from successful dot commers , most notably Paul Graham .
Lisp has been around a long , long time ( its the second oldest language still in use , behind fortran ) , and its gotten very mature in that time .
Industry languages continue to steal features from lisp , and some modern languages like python and ruby are more lisp than C. Still , lisp does not have the popularity one might expect .
What is it that 's holding it back while python prospers ?
Lets start with what it gets right .
It is said that lisp is very expressive , allowing extremely complicated ideas to be expressed succinctly ( and hopefully quickly ) by those fluent in the language .
That 's a rather heady idea , especially considering it is being applied to a practical industry .
What this means in practice is that a great programmer is less limited by lisp than C++ or Java .
This is really important because there are no natural limits on the productivity of a programmer .
Unlike artisans and construction workers , there are no physical processes that limit how fast he can accomplish a task .
The best person of another trade might be hundreds of times better than the novice , but they are limited by nature .
Take away that limitation , and a handful of the best people could accomplish amazing things .
What makes lisp expressive are n't complex features like Object Orientation , but powerful simple ones like closures .
The simplicity of these features let you build new complex ones as times change .
Aspect Oriented Programming was part of the original Object Oriented lisp system based on closures .
Continuations are a great way to deal with the non-linear flow of web applications .
Many of these powerful features have been adopted by new languages : Python can generate closures and has list comprehensions .
Still , they do n't contain all of lisp 's power , and yet a search for open - source lisp applications on sourceforge returns 345 results to python 's 6,571 .
Where are the hordes of elite programmers looking to change the world ?
Its easier to write things in lisp , right ?
What lisp is getting wrong , opening the door for other lisp - like languages , is the new user experience .
This means documentation , discoverability , sample code , libraries , and books .
Its forums with solutions and smiling people .
Unfortunately the lisp community is confident that their horse will win in the end , and they 're just not willing to put in the effort .
Other languages whose success is not so certain are more motivated to please .
Python is one guy 's foolish attempt to change the world , and you know that he spent a lot of time working to that end .
What lisp needs is is dedicated people behind it , laying the foundation of what people want .
Specifically , people who are not currently lisp users .
Given a python executable , some syntax , and knowledge of " import " , " dir " , and " help " , anyone can learn python .
Lisp should also be easy for newbies ; there is even less syntax !
SLIME is a great package , but please , stop hurting the cause ... people who do n't use Emacs are terrified by it .
Even the first step of a newbie has too many decisions : picking a lisp interpreter .
There are simply too many of them , and their features are often inconsistent and incomplete .
Perl , python , and ruby all managed to get one interpreter running on many platforms fairly uniformly .
I do n't worry about the networking or threading model inconsistencies between python on my mac and python on my linux server .
They also all have package managers that just work .
This is a critical feature that just needs to work .
CPAN really set the bar for package mangers in general .
Asdf - install is okay , but it can be inconsistent across runtimes and packages do n't always install correctly .
There are simple things as well .
I am constantly irritated by the lack of prompt features in lisp interpreters .
I 'm lucky if they even recognize control characters ... command history is a blessing .
I have n't seen one that has any manner of auto - complete ( something based on list - all - packages and do - symbols would be fine , thank you ) .
Its the unfortunate nature of lispers to work on the really long term things which are totally useless to their contemporaries .
While I really appreciate that Paul Graham has decided to work on his own version of the language , I suspect that his lisp oriented incubator company would benefit more from a simple , usable IDE for sbcl and openmcl .
Ultimately , I am hopeful .
Lisp is something that I believe in , and I 'll keep trying to do more with it .
If any language is ready to transcend old habits , this one is .
Most things have already been tried in it once ( distributed computing , hardware implementation , graphical editing ) , the next big thing is probably already in there somewhere waiting to be harnessed .
Yakov Sadchikov , co-founder and CEO of Quintura , got in touch to tell me about his company ’s new search engine for kids called ( duh ) Quintura for Kids .
There are other kid-friendly search engines out there ( summed up in 2005 by Danny Sullivan on Search Engine Watch ) , but what I especially like about Quintura is the clickable tag cloud that appears as a supplement to the search term .
For example , I searched for “ elephant , ” and in addition to a list of relevant links , this lovely cloud appeared , presenting me with a trail of related terms I could follow to find out more .
This design at the same time both narrows and broadens the search , allowing for both specific research and general exploration .
The interface is clean and friendly , with the simplicity of Google ’s single text box ( even though the search itself rests on top of Yahoo ! Kids ) on an engaging graphical backdrop .
Seems like a nice way to introduce kids to online research .
Anything to add on the topic of search engines for kids ?

You should check the level of your anti-freeze , oil , transmission fluid , power steering fluid , and brake fluid regularly .
A good time to do so is when you refuel .
Even if your car does n't leak fluids at the moment , one can occur at any time and you can identify it by checking the fluid levels often .
You should also check the color of some of these fluids .
Some of these have see - through plastic tanks that you can look through , and some have dipsticks .
Anti-freeze should be either pink , green , or yellow ( Pink for newer cars with " Dex - Cool " , green for old cars with plain Ethyl - Glycol , and green or yellow for cars that have been flushed and filled with universal antifreeze ... brown antifreeze should always be flushed , it either has rust or a lot of dirt in it , probably both .
Also , never mix different kinds of antifreeze ; if you do n't know what color antifreeze your car has , buy a universal brand .
Oil will normally be slightly clear ( when new ) to brown .
Oil that looks white and milkshake - like may be contaminated with antifreeze / coolant or very rarely , just a large amount of condensation .
You should take your vehicle in for service soon if this is the case .
Transmission fluid should be bright red , and should not smell burnt .
If it looks or smells burnt , have your transmission fluid flushed .
Letting it get too bad can damage your transmission .
There 's also a chance that you may have an internal transmission problem , especially if you are having problems with shifting or engaging in gears .
Sun ’s ZFS is truly a remarkable filesystem .
A while back I had read that it was going to be integrated with FreeBSD .
And apparently that integration of ZFS into FreeBSD is now essentially complete .
I was also reading some time ago that a port of ZFS to Dragon Fly BSD was being considered .
So with Solaris and future releases of FreeBSD supporting ZFS , it ’s no doubt in my mind that it will become widely used .
Many of us already have worked with ZFS on Solaris .
Mark Round is one such person , and he has written a very interesting analysis of the caching of ZFS .
I think his article is a must - read for those of us who deal with ZFS .
And for those who have not yet started to become familiar with ZFS , I suggest that you do .
With major server operating systems like Solaris and soon FreeBSD offering support , it will become commonplace .
And knowing its performance habits will be essential for any system administrator .
You may not completely agree with the answer , however the answers are polar opposites and you must choose which end of the spectrum you best relate to
Question 1 :
You ’ve just been given a complex task to code .
What are you most likely to do ?
Get straight into the task by putting in the initial code and prototyping the task .
Get everyone ’s feedback on the problem , discuss all the possible options , then decide the best way to approach the problem given the current situation .
Question 2 :
Comments should be placed :
To explain anything that may seem
ambiguous .
Only when a programmer is n’t good enough to explain themselves in variable and function names .
Question 3 :
Where do you spend most of your time ?
Moving registers around or doing pointer arithmetic ( or creating functions )
Drawing UML diagrams ( or making objects )
Question 4 :
Who is a ‘ better ’ programmer ?
Someone who went to university / college and has at least a masters in their field .
They should read as many books on a subject as they can find before starting on it .
Someone who has been coding since they were 5 and simply goes by raw talent alone .
Question 5 :
Which is the ‘ best ’ way to program ?
In assembly or straight C. I ’m in complete control of what the program ’s going to do .
Java or any .net language .
Why waste valuable time on memory management and re-inventing the wheel when someone ’s handled it for you !
Question 6 :
Approximately what % of a project should be spent in planning ?
~ 25 % – The best way to complete a task is to plan as you go .
~ 75 % – The more planning , the less code you need to write .
By the time you code , you should simply be filling in stubs .
Question 7 :
If something needs to be done properly :
Get the team together and discuss the best way of solving the problem .
Then break it up and give each piece based on people ’s strengths .
Do it yourself .
Question 8 :
The ‘ perfect ’ language will :
Allow anybody in the world to program .
Allow me to make the best use of systems resources .
Question 9 :
You ’ve been given a task to do that will take one man month , how big is the optimal team ?
5
1
Question 10 :
When you program you :
Shut the door and the rest of the world out .
Share a desk with a peer and have group meetings often to discuss what to do next .
Question 11 :
White space should be :
Used sparingly
Used everywhere
Question 12 :
What is the ‘ better ’ implementation :
int main ( ) { printf ( " 5+6= %d " , 5+6 ) ; return 0 ; } 1 2 3 4 5 int main ( ) { printf ( " 5+6= %d " , 5 + 6 ) ; return 0 ; }

This section gives brief answers to a number of general questions concerning functional programming languages , and some pointers to relevant literature and internet resources .
What is a " functional programming language " ?
Opinions differ , even within the functional programming community , on the precise definition of what constitutes a functional programming language .
However , here is a definition that , broadly speaking , represents the kind of languages that are discussed in comp.lang.
functional :
Functional programming is a style of programming that emphasizes the evaluation of expressions , rather than execution of commands .
The expressions in these language are formed by using functions to combine basic values .
A functional language is a language that supports and encourages programming in a functional style .
For example , consider the task of calculating the sum of the integers from 1 to 10 .
In an imperative language such as C , this might be expressed using a simple loop , repeatedly updating the values held in an accumulator variable total and a counter variable i :
total = 0 ; for ( i=1 ; i< =10 ; ++i ) total += i ;
In a functional language , the same program would be expressed without any variable updates .
For example , in Haskell , the result can be calculated by evaluating the expression :
sum [ 1..10 ]
Here , [ 1..10 ] is an expression that represents the list of integers from 1 to 10 , while sum is a function that can be used to calculate the sum of an arbitrary list of values .
The same idea could also be used in ( strict ) functional languages such as SML or Scheme , but it is more common to find such programs written with an explicit loop , often expressed recursively .
Nevertheless , there is still no need to update the values of the variables involved :
SML : let fun sum i tot = if i=0 then tot else sum ( i - 1 ) ( tot+i ) in sum 10 0 end Scheme : ( define sum ( lambda ( from total ) ( if ( = 0 from ) total ( sum ( - from 1 ) (+ total from ) ) ) ) ) ( sum 10 0 )
It is often possible to write functional - style programs in an imperative language , and vice versa .
It is then a matter of opinion whether a particular language can be described as functional or not .

Are functional programming languages useful in education ?
Functional languages are gathering momentum in education because they facilitate the expression of concepts and structures at a high level of abstraction .
Many university computing science departments now make use of functional programming in their undergraduate courses ; indeed , a number of departments teach a functional language as their first programming language .
Further information about the use of functional programming languages in education ( including links to relevant conferences and workshops ) is available on the web from :
This section gives brief answers to a number of technical questions concerning functional programming languages , and some pointers to relevant literature and internet resources .
What is a " purely functional " programming language ?
This question has been the subject of some debate in the functional programming community .
It is widely agreed that languages such as Haskell and Miranda are " purely functional " , while SML and Scheme are not .
However , there are some small differences of opinion about the precise technical motivation for this distinction .
One definition that has been suggested is as follows :
The term " purely functional " is often used to describe languages that perform all their computations via function application .
This is in contrast to languages , such as Scheme and Standard ML , that are predominantly functional but also allow `side effects ' ( computational effects caused by expression evaluation that persist after the evaluation is completed ) .
Sometimes , the term " purely functional " is also used in a broader sense to mean languages that might incorporate computational effects , but without altering the notion of `function ' ( as evidenced by the fact that the essential properties of functions are preserved . )
Typically , the evaluation of an expression can yield a `task ' , which is then executed separately to cause computational effects .
The evaluation and execution phases are separated in such a way that the evaluation phase does not compromise the standard properties of expressions and functions .
The input / output mechanisms of Haskell , for example , are of this kind .
" What is a purely functional language " , Amr Sabry , Journal of Functional Programming , 8 ( 1) :1 - 22 , Cambridge University Press , January 1998 .
What is " currying " , and where does it come from ?
Currying has its origins in the mathematical study of functions .
It was observed by Frege in 1893 that it suffices to restrict attention to functions of a single argument .
For example , for any two parameter function f( x , y ) , there is a one parameter function f ' such that f'(x ) is a function that can be applied to y to give ( f ' ( x ) ) ( y ) = f ( x , y ) .
This corresponds to the well known fact that the sets ( AxB -> C ) and ( A -> ( B -> C ) ) are isomorphic , where " x " is cartesian product and " - > " is function space .
In functional programming , function application is denoted by juxtaposition , and assumed to associate to the left , so that the equation above becomes f' x y = f( x , y ) .
Apparently , Frege did not pursue the idea further .
It was rediscovered independently by Schoenfinkel , together with the result that all functions having to do with the structure of functions can be built up out of only two basic combinators , K and S . About a decade later , this sparked off the subject of combinatory logic , invented by Haskell Curry .
The term " currying " honours him ; the function f ' in the example above is called the " curried " form of the function f .
From a functional programming perspective , currying can be described by a function :
curry : ( ( a , b ) -> c ) -> ( a -> b -> c )
The inverse operation is , unsurprisingly , refered to as uncurrying :
uncurry : ( a -> b -> c ) -> ( ( a , b ) -> c )

This work also contains many references to earlier work by Curry , Church , and others .
What is a " monad " , and what are they used for ?
The concept of a monad comes from category theory ; full details can be found in any standard textbook on the subject .
Much of the interest in monads in functional programming is the result of recent papers that show how monads can be used to describe all kinds of different programming language features ( for example , I/O , manipulation of state , continuations and exceptions ) in purely functional languages such as Haskell :

How can I write a " parser " in a functional programming language ?
A parser is a program that converts a list of input tokens , usually characters , into a value of the appropriate type .
A simple example might be a function to find the integer value represented by a string of digits .
A more complex example might be to translate programs written in a particular concrete syntax into a suitable abstract syntax as the first stage in the implementation of a compiler or interpreter .
There are two common ways to write a parser in a functional language :
Using a parser generator tool .
Some functional language implementations support tools that generate a parser automatically from a specification of the grammar .
See : Happy : a parser generator system for Haskell and Gofer , similar to the tool `yacc ' for C. Available on the web from : http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/fp/software/happy/.

Included with SML / NJ , available by ftp from : Host : ftp.research.bell-labs.com ; Directory : / dist / smlnj .
Using combinator parsing .
Parsers are represented by functions and combined with a small set of combinators , leading to parsers that closely resemble the grammar of the language being read .
Parsers written in this way can use backtracking .
See : " How to replace failure with a list of successes " , Philip Wadler , FPCA '85 , Springer Verlag LNCS 201 , 1985 .

What does it mean to say that a functional programming language is " strict " or " non-strict " ?
Here 's one ( operational ) way to explain the difference :
In a strict language , the arguments to a function are always evaluated before it is invoked .
As a result , if the evaluation of an expression exp does not terminate properly ( for example , because it generates a run-time error or enters an infinite loop ) , then neither will an expression of the form f( exp ) .
ML and Scheme are both examples of this .
In a non -strict language , the arguments to a function are not evaluated until their values are actually required .
For example , evaluating an expression of the form f( exp ) may still terminate properly , even if evaluation of exp would not , if the value of the parameter is not used in the body of f.
Miranda and Haskell are examples of this approach .
There is much debate in the functional programming community about the relative merits of strict and non-strict languages .
It is possible , however , to support a mixture of these two approaches ; for example , some versions of the functional language Hope do this .
What is the performance of functional programs like ?
In some circles , programs written in functional languages have obtained a reputation for lack of performance .
Part of this results from the high - level of abstraction that is common in such programs and from powerful features such as higher - order functions , automatic storage management , etc .
Of course , the performance of interpreters and compilers for functional languages keeps improving with new technological developments .
Here are a selection of references for further reading :

This section gives a brief overview of a number of programming languages that support aspects of the functional paradigm , and some pointers to relevant literature and internet resources .
The table below classifies the languages into strict / non - strict and sequential / concurrent , and may be useful when searching for suitable languages for particular applications .
Some of the languages have multiple versions with different classifications ( see the language overviews for further details ) , but for simplicity only the most common version of each language is considered in the table .
ASpecT is a strict functional language , developed at the University of Bremen , originally intended as an attempt to provide an implementation for ( a subset of ) Algebraic Specifications of Abstract Datatypes .
The system was designed to be as user - friendly as possible , including overloading facilities and a source - level debugger .
For reasons of efficiency , the system uses call - by - value evaluation and reference counting memory management .
Over the years more and more features have been added , including subsorting , functionals , and restricted polymorphism .
The ASpecT compiler translates the functional source code to C , resulting in fast and efficient binaries .
ASpecT has been ported to many different platforms , including Sun3 , Sun4 , Dec VAX , IBM RS6000 , NeXT , Apple A / UX , PC ( OS/ 2 , Linux ) , Amiga and Atari ST / TT .
The ASpecT compiler is available by ftp from :
The most important application of ASpecT to date is the interactive graph visualization system daVinci ; currently ( September ' 96 ) , version 2.0.x is composed of 34.000 lines of ASpecT code , 12.000 lines of C code and 8000 lines of Tcl / Tk code .
daVinci is an X11 program , and is available for UNIX workstations from Sun , HP , IBM , DEC , SGI , and for Intel PCs with a UNIX operating system .
Further information about daVinci is available on the web from :
Caml is a dialect of the ML language developed at INRIA that does not comply to the Standard , but actually tries to go beyond the Standard , in particular in the areas of separate compilation , modules , and objects .
Two implementations of Caml are available :
The older implementation , Caml Light , is distinguished by its small size , modest memory requirements , availability on microcomputers , simple separate compilation , interface with C , and portable graphics functions .
It runs on most Unix machines , on the Macintosh and on PCs under Ms Windows and MSDOS .
The current version at the time of writing is 0.71 .
A more ambitious implementation , Objective Caml ( formerly known as Caml Special Light ) , is also available .
It adds the following extensions to Caml Light : Full support for objects and classes , here combined for the first time with ML - style type reconstruction ; A powerful module calculus in the style of Standard ML , but providing better support for separate compilation ; A high - performance native code compiler , in addition to a Caml Light - style bytecode compiler .
Objective Caml is available for Unix and Windows 95 / NT , with the native - code compiler supporting the following processors : Alpha , Sparc , Pentium , Mips , Power , HPPA .
Both implementations of Caml are available by ftp from :

It has the usual features of many modern functional programming languages , including a Hindley / Milner type inference system , algebraic types and definitions with clauses and pattern matching , and list comprehensions .
J was designed and developed by Ken Iverson and Roger Hui .
It is similar to the language APL , departing from APL in using using the ASCII alphabet exclusively , but employing a spelling scheme that retains the advantages of the special alphabet required by APL .
It has added features and control structures that extend its power beyond standard APL .

Miranda was designed in 1985 - 6 by David Turner with the aim of providing a standard non-strict purely functional language , and is described in the following articles :
" Miranda : a non-strict functional language with polymorphic types " , D.A. Turner , Proceedings FPLCA , Nancy , France , September 1985 ( Springer LNCS vol 201 , pp 1 - 16 ) .
" An overview of Miranda " , D.A. Turner , SIGPLAN Notices , vol 21 , no 12 , pp 158 - 166 , December 1986 .
Miranda was the first widely disseminated language with non-strict semantics and polymorphic strong typing , and is running at over 600 sites , including 250 universities .
It is widely used for teaching , often in conjunction with " Introduction to Functional Programming " , by Bird and Wadler , which uses a notation closely based on Miranda .
It has also had a strong influence on the subsequent development of the field , and provided one of the main inputs for the design of Haskell .
The Miranda™ system is a commercial product of Research Software Limited .
Miranda release two ( the current version at the time of writing ) supports unbounded precision integers and has a module system with provision for parameterized modules and a built in " make " facility .
The compiler works in conjunction with a screen editor and programs are automatically recompiled after edits .
There is also an online reference manual .
Further information about Miranda is available on the web from :
Miranda is not in the public domain but is free for personal and educational use .

NESL is a fine - grained , functional , nested data - parallel language , loosly based on ML .
It includes a built - in parallel data - type , sequences , and parallel operations on sequences ( the element type of a sequence can be any type , not just scalars ) .
It is based on eager evaluation , and supports polymorphism , type inference and a limited use of higher - order functions .
Currently , it does not have support for modules and its datatype definition is limited .
Except for I/O and some system utilities it is purely functional ( it does not support reference cells or call / cc ) .
The NESL compiler is based on delayed compilation and compiles separate code for each type a function is used with ( compiled code is monomorphic ) .
The implementation therefore requires no type bits , and can do some important data - layout optimizations ( for example , double - precision floats do not need to be boxed , and nested sequences can be laid out efficiently across multiple processors . )
For several small benchmark applications on irregular and / or dynamic data ( for example , graphs and sparse matrices ) it generates code comparable in efficiency to machine - specific low - level code ( for example , Fortran or C. )
The current implementation of NESL runs on workstations , the Connection Machines CM2 and CM5 , the Cray Y- MP and the MasPar MP2 .

The language OPAL has been designed as a testbed for the development of functional programs .
Opal molds concepts from Algebraic Specification and Functional Programming , which shall favor the formal development of large production - quality software that is written in a purely functional style .
The core of OPAL is a strongly typed , higher - order , strict applicative language that belongs to the tradition of Hope and ML .
The algebraic flavour of OPAL shows up in the syntactical appearance and in the preference of parameterization to polymorphism .
OPAL is used for research on the highly optimizing compilation of applicative languages .
This has resulted in a compiler which produces very efficient code .
The OPAL compiler itself is entirely written in OPAL .
Installation is straightforward and has been successfully performed for SPARCs , DECstations , NeXTs , and PCs running LINUX .
Further information about OPAL is available by ftp from :

Pizza is a strict superset of Java that incorporates three ideas from functional programming :
Parametric polymorphism ;
Higher - order functions ;
Algebraic data types .
Pizza is defined by translation into Java and compiles into the Java Virtual Machine , requirements which strongly constrain the design space .
Thus Pizza programs interface easily with Java libraries , and programs first developed in Pizza may be automatically converted to Java for ease of maintenance .
The Pizza compiler is itself written in Pizza , and may be used as a replacement for Sun 's Java compiler ( except that the Pizza compiler runs faster ) .
Pizza was designed by Martin Odersky and Philip Wadler , and implemented by Odersky .
The design is described in the following paper :

Scheme is a dialect of Lisp that stresses conceptual elegance and simplicity .
It is specified in R4RS and IEEE standard P1178 .
Scheme is much smaller than Common Lisp ; the specification is about 50 pages .
Scheme is often used in computer science curricula and programming language research , due to its ability to simply represent many programming abstractions .
Further information about Scheme is available on the web from :
There is an unmoderated usenet newsgroup , comp.lang.scheme , for the discussion of topics related to Scheme .
A list of frequently asked questions ( which includes details of the many books and papers concerned with Scheme ) for this newsgroup is available by ftp from :
Sisal ( Streams and Iteration in a Single Assignment Language ) is a functional language designed with several goals in mind : to support clear , efficient expression of scientific programs ; to free application programmers from details irrelevant to their endeavors ; and , to allow automatic detection and exploitation of the parallelism expressed in source programs .
Sisal syntax is modern and easy to read ; Sisal code looks similar to Pascal , Modula , or Ada , with modern constructs and long identifiers .
The major difference between Sisal and more conventional languages is that it does not express explicit program control flow .
Sisal semantics are mathematically sound .
Programs consist of function definitions and invocations .
Functions have no side effects , taking as inputs only explicitly passed arguments , and producing only explicitly returned results .
There is no concept of state in Sisal .
Identifiers are used , rather than variables , to denote values , rather than memory locations .
The Sisal language currently exists for several shared memory and vector systems that run Berkeley Unix ( tm ) , including the Sequent Balance and Symmetry , the Alliant , the Cray X / MP and Y / MP , Cray 2 , and a few other less well - known ones .
Sisal is available on sequential machines such as Sparc , RS / 6000 , and HP .
Sisal also runs under MS - DOS and Macintosh Unix ( A/ UX ) .
It 's been shown to be fairly easy to port the entire language system to new machines .
Further information about Sisal is available on the web from :

This is part five in my series of posts designed to help managers and employers who simply do n’t understand why their IT staff hate them so much .
Lacking the power to send the Clue Fairy around to smack clueless managers upside the head , I have been posting these tips which are the product of 15 years experience in IT .
This group of posts is based around the idea that there are three key areas of job satisfaction ; a good environment , interesting / fulfilling work , and compensation .
Part One , Part Two , Part Three and Part Four provided an overview and covered the first two points .
This part will explore the pay and benefits that make up the compensation package for IT workers .
On the surface , pay rates should be completely straightforward .
Supply and demand dictate the average rate for a given skill set and in individual cases the employee pushes for as much as they can get and the employer pushes for the minimum they can get away with .
In truth , pay rates are a minefield .
A lot of people measure their self - worth according to their pay packet , hence this topic can become very emotional very quickly .
One of the most important things to consider when looking a pay rates is the motivation of both parties involved .
The Cabal Of Disaffected and Exploited Information Technology ( CODE - IT ) workers tend to be quite conflicted on the issue of pay .
Most CODE - IT workers are working in IT because if they do n’t actually love it , they at least have a very strong affinity for it .
If you read stories from the early days of the PC revolution , most of the early employees of Microsoft and Apple ( for example ) could hardly believe they were being paid anything at all to work on a hobby they were passionate about .
Having said that , the majority of CODE - IT workers are highly trained , highly intelligent and possess specialised skills .
As IT has become more and more indispensable to business , pay rates have gone up .
If you work in the IT department of a non -IT company ( i.e. a company whose business is not IT software or hardware but needs an IT department to support it ) then it is quite common to be earning 50 % or more above other ( non - IT ) employees of equivalent seniority .
This translates in many people ’s minds that CODE - IT workers are overpaid and should shut the hell up with their complaining about pay rates .
In certain cases this might be true but broadly speaking , pay rates for CODE - IT workers are self - correcting .
In a boom market , if employers are n’t paying their CODE - IT legions enough , they will leave for somebody willing to pay them more .
Then it will cost more to replace the staff who have defected meaning , as often as not , that employers are poaching their replacements from other workplaces and so the cycle feeds on itself and pay rates go up and up .
Eventually the job market will crater and the pendulum swings the other way .
There is less work available and employers realise they can get away with paying their CODE - IT workers less ( particularly contract workers ) because their options are limited .
Pay rates spiral down until the next upswing and it starts all over again .
From my limited experience , the pendulum tends to swing too far each way in the peaks and troughs .
It basically seems that when the power relationship changes , the party gaining the upper hand wants some payback for how they were screwed when things were stacked against them .
Around 1999 - 2000 pay rates for the majority of CODE - IT workers were going through the roof .
Graduates in some disciplines were getting starting salaries that most people had to wait 10 years for .
Unscrupulous recruiting agencies sprang up like mushrooms to grab their slice of the pie and there were many cases of grossly underqualified and inexperienced workers being slotted into high - paying roles .
The inevitable happened around 2001 – the IT job market crashed .
Hard .
Many companies had blown several years ’
IT budget on Y2 K readiness , dot - com bubble mania and ( in Australia ) GST readiness .
Also , I think more than a few employers woke up to just how much they had been getting screwed on pay rates for the previous few years .
Hell , I think I ’m worth more than I ’m paid but some contract rates in particular had been pushed to ridiculous levels .
Several workplaces I knew cut contract rates in half and people were happy to stay because it was still more than they had been making a few years previously .
So much for the preamble and disclaimers ; what should you actually pay CODE - IT workers ?
There ’s no absolutely right answer regarding the amount , but there is a right way to approach the decision .
Be aware of how your offer compares to industry averages , highs and lows ( because the applicant definitely will be ) and be absolutely open about why you have chosen to make your offer .
Unless your reasoning is that you want to screw potential employees as much as possible and pay them the minimum you can get away with and to hell with them if they do n’t like it .
Stop reading now if that ’s your attitude , you wo n’t learn anything useful here .
Plus , if that ’s your attitude it will be blindingly obvious to the applicants as well .
Unless they ’re very stupid .
So all your employees will be stupid , low achievers , desperate and / or criminals .
Good luck .
You deserve each other .
Pay is not the only motivator , or at least it should n’t be .
If pay is the only thing motivating your staff you are on very precarious ground .
In this situation the only way you can increase or even maintain your staff ’s motivation is to pay them more which is going to hit a limit unless you ’re Google .
And if you ’re Google , the one thing you do n’t need from me is lessons on recruiting staff .
Also , it becomes very easy for a competitor to poach your staff if they have no attachment to their work .
Simply offer them more money and they ’ll jump ship .
Having said that , the pay rates you offer send a very clear message .
For those who ca n’t guess , in simplest terms if you are paying above average you are saying you want above average staff or you value your staff above average .
If your pay rates are average , you are aiming for staff who are , well , average .
Hardly inspiring .
If if you are paying below average …
Possibly the worst mistake an employer can make regarding pay rates is applying some arbitrary rule instead of judging each situation on its merits .
With a new hire , you have three basic choices ; offer them more than they were getting previously , offer them the same as they were getting previously or offer them less than they were getting previously .
In different scenarios , any of these three options might be the right option for all parties concerned , or at least be an acceptable option .
Make a call based on the current market , the value that person can bring , the value that person has compared to other potential candidates and the cost to your company and / or department of NOT hiring this person .
Pay rates should always be a considered value judgement .
The idea that some managers have that pay rates are set objectively rather than subjectively is so opposed to reality that it boggles the mind .
Every decision about pay rates is a value judgement and even if you delude yourself that this is n’t the case for you , the person on the receiving end is in no doubt .
You have quite literally made a judgement about their value .
At least have the decency to do so in a conscious and open manner .
Most of this post has focused on pay decisions for new hires but really , the thinking holds true when considering pay rises for existing staff .
One additional piece of advice for judging what ’s adequate for pay rises : if an employee ’s pay rate is going up slower than inflation , they are literally worse every day they continue working for you .
If you think this is n’t an important consideration for your permanent staff , well , enjoy your voyage on the good ship Titanic .

Victoria Crater on Mars

Coloring credit : B. Braun et al. ; Color image reprinted courtesy : Aviation Week and Aviationnow.com
Explanation : Scroll right to see the largest crater yet visited by a rover on Mars .
Reaching the expansive Victoria Crater has been a goal for the robotic Opportunity rover rolling across Mars for the past 21 months .
Opportunity reached Victoria last week , and is cautiously probing the stadium - sized crevice .
It is hoped that Victoria Crater will show a deep stack of layers uncovered by the initial impact , and hence new clues into the ancient surface history of Mars .
Visible in the distance of the above image mosaic is the far rim of Victoria Crater , lying about 800 meters away and rising about 70 meters above the crater floor .
The alcove in front has been dubbed Duck Bay .
Victoria crater has about five times the diameter of Endurance Crater , which Opportunity spent six months exploring .
If a safe path is found , Opportunity may actually attempt to enter Victoria Crater .
The senior developers at Fog Creek are spending much of this week evaluating the 400 + applications we received for our five available summer internships .
We got about half as many applications as last year .
This is mainly because we were careful to keep our job listings off of Monster.com and eRecruiting .
I ’m not 100 % sure of this , but it seems like when you post an internship to Monster or eRecruiting , candidates can apply for that job simply by clicking one link .
As a result , last year we got flooded with seriously unqualified candidates .
This is not just Joel Being an Elitist Snob .
I ’m talking about people whose only experience was working at Dunkin ’ Donuts and who had no programming experience .
We did get a lot more good applications .
Really good applications .
Not just kids from Indiana .
Students from all over .
Illinois .
Missouri .
Well , OK , maybe not Missouri .
Missouri is crazy talk .
During the first stage of evaluating resumes , we go through looking for six objective things ( I wo n’t tell you what they are ) that we think are good predictors of success .
Each candidate gets a letter code indicating which of these six things they have , for example , ADF or BCF or ABCDEF .
Again , these are all just things that you can tell objectively from a cover letter and resume , so there ’s not too much controversy at this stage .
The system is designed to be flexible , so we do n’t just rule people out because they did n’t go to the right school or get the right grades .
When we find a candidate who is officially missing something , but who looks like a great candidate for some other reason , we add some + signs … someone who does n’t have E or F but who has a really good excuse and looks “ smart / gets things done ” might get ABCD ++.
That said , we ’re not going to tell a student with perfect grades from MIT or Stanford or Rose Hulman to take a hike just because “ grades are n’t everything . ”
When we finished that process this afternoon it looked like we had 60 candidates with either 5 or 6 scores ( which we consider “ equivalent within a margin of error ” ) .
So the next stage is whittling down that list of 60 to about 30 that we can phone interview .
For this whittling phase , each cover letter and resume is scrutinized by three senior developers .
They assign a score of +1 ( “ I want this person ” ) , - 1 ( “ Unlikely to work out ” ) , or 0 ( indifferent ) to each candidate .
Here it ’s a lot more subjective , but when you ’re looking at a small pile of resumes sometimes you just know who the great ones are and who the good - on - paper ones are .
When we add up all the scores for each candidate , they end up with a number between - 3 and 3 and we simply sort by that number and then work down the list in numerical order until about 15 have passed a phone screen .
The phone screen stage takes between half an hour and an hour .
Anyone who gets through that gets flown out to New York City , all expenses paid including up to three nights in a luxury hotel , and goes through the wringer in person .
Elitist , Arrogant Bastard
Some people feel like our process is elitist , or arrogant , or overkill .
I ’ve heard comments along the lines of “ why do you need such superstars for writing a [ holding nose ] bug tracking application ? ”
Well , part 1 .
It ’s not my fault that 400 people applied .
Well , OK , it is my fault : we have free housing , lunches , Broadway shows , unlimited free subway passes , high salaries , a boat trip , a Yankees game , two parties and a walking tour .
But once all those students applied , it ’s the least we can do to consider each application with the utmost care and fairness , and give the internships to the people we think have the best chance of working out well , for them and for us .
Part 2 , if you think Fog Creek is still about bug tracking applications , you ’ve lost the plot somewhere .
Last summer ’s interns developed Copilot.com , pretty much all by themselves .
Copilot is our fastest growing business .
Our FogBugz team spends a lot of their time these days doing Ajax development .
Our newest hire Stefan is developing a pretty shockingly sophisticated automatic testing system and actually needs Don Box books to get his work done .
When you work on FogBugz you ’re just as likely to be working on Thistle , our Java - based VBScript compiler ( which now emits two things : PHP and a form of VBScript with tracing information built in for testing code - coverage tracking ) .
And finally part 3 , when you hire superstars you make a lot of money in terms of revenue - per-employee .
That means we can have cushy private offices and high - end workstations and Aeron chairs without running out of money .
But
… I ’m still not happy with the traditional “ cover letter / resume ” system , because it discriminates against the non-traditional , and many of the most brilliant programmers and software developers I know just look awful on paper .
Adam Bosworth likes to make fun of me , because he majored in , oh , I do n’t remember , History ?
Whatever , and he says to me “ you never would have hired me , or Anders Hejlsberg , etc … ” because supposedly Adam and Anders are lacking in the “ ABCDEF ” qualifications on my list , but actually , that ’s kind of absurd , because of course we would hire Adam and Anders to work on our stinkin’ bug trackin ’ application if they wanted to , and in fact , when we started Fog Creek , one of our actual real - life business goals was “ to create a company where someone like Adam Bosworth would want to work . ”
He ’s at Google , now , by the way .
I do n’t really think we can reinvent the application process .
A couple of years ago we asked interns to submit writing samples ( like a paper from any class ) , recommendations from professors , and transcripts , but we found that they gave us no additional information we did n’t already have .
Carl Sagan ’s new article can be found in the March / April 2007 edition of Skeptical Inquirer .
It is titled “ Science ’s Vast Cosmic Perspective Eludes Religion . ”
Well , okay .
As you know , Carl Sagan died of pneumonia in 1996 .
This “ new ” article was actually prepared by Ann Druyan , based on lectures Sagan gave in 1985 .
Sagan begins the article by pointing out that there are more galaxies in the universe than there are stars in the Milky Way .
This , he finds , is “ a useful calibration of our place in the universe . ”
Nonetheless , virtually no religion has taken into account “ this vast number of worlds [ or ] the enormous scale of the universe . ”
If , as Sagan argues , life is commonplace throughout the universe , “ it must follow that there is massive destruction , obliteration of the whole planets , that routinely occurs , frequently , throughout the universe .
. . [ T ] hat is a different view than the traditional Western sense of a deity carefully taking pains to promote the well - being of intelligent creatures . ”
Sagan concludes by arguing that the God portrayed by traditional religions “ is too small .
It is a God of a tiny world and not a God of a galaxy , much less of a universe . ”
Sagan suggests that science is , “ at least in part , informed worship . ”
Further , curiosity and intelligence , to the extent provided by a God , would be gifts , which we must use .
This passage reminds me of a humorous drawing I posted a few days ago .
Even if a traditional God does not exist , “ then our curiosity and our intelligence are the essential tools for managing our survival in an extremely dangerous time . ”
I found Sagan ’s article compelling .
God ’s own book forgot to tell us that the universe is almost unimaginably large .
In light of well - published findings of modern astronomers and biologists , it would be nonsensical to doubt that life abounds throughout the universe .
Nonetheless , most religions avoid discussion of this possibility of the universe as A ) existing and B ) constituting a fertile field for large number of sentient life forms .
It ’s just much easier to talk about an artificially contained story involving a man , woman and the serpent in an earthly garden .
To the extent that fundamentalists ( and even more “ liberal ” religions ) focus only on Earth , however , the rest of the universe is a very big elephant in the room .
If many believers have their way , 99.99999 … % of the universe is dispensible frivolous scenary for the only show in town , everything worthwhile allegedly occurring on a single tiny blue speck .
Sagan ’s point might just be the best reason of all for demonstrating the arrogance , ignorance and silliness of the inerrancy crowd .
The economist rarely uses the words “ glut ” and “ shortage ” without adding : at some price .
Other scholars are not equally wise .
A free market theory of pricing rests on the supposition that gluts and shortages are temporary phenomena .
Prices adjust so as to clear a market .
If this does not take place , the free market economist goes looking for evidence of state intervention .
Consider the problem of excess inventory .
It is better to get something for unused and unwanted inventory than to pay for storage .
So , selling prices adjust downward .
This eventually eliminates the glut .
The unpleasant experience also warns the producer not to do this again .
Why does a glut exist ?
Because of an error in prior forecasting .
Suppliers believed that there would be buyers at a specific price .
It turned out that there was an insufficient number of buyers at that expected price .
Then why does a glut persist ?
One answer : ignorance on the part of suppliers .
But why should this ignorance persist ?
Why do n’t suppliers get the picture ?
Experienced sellers do get the picture .
The problem is a continuing supply of new sellers who are unfamiliar with the market and ignorant of the past supply - demand conditions .
Or , as has been said so often , there ’s a sucker born every minute .
There is no evidence that P. T. Barnum ever said this , but it is nonetheless true .
In the worldwide suckers ’ market , gamblers are the only people who are slower to learn than young adults with masters ’ degrees .
Bright graduate students possess a pair of non-marketable skills : the ability to write term papers and the ability to take academic exams .
They are also economic illiterates and incurably naïve .
So , they become the trusting victims of the professorial class .
THE ECONOMICS OF THE PROFESSORATE
No one ever sits down and tells a newly minted college graduate about the economics of the professorate .
No one tells the student about the crucial and neglected work of the person who first blew the whistle on the economics of the Ph.D. , David W. Breneman .
He is the Dean of the Curry School of Education at the University of Virginia .
He wrote his Ph.D. dissertation on the economics of the Ph.D.
It was accepted in 1970 by the University of California , Berkeley .
It was based on research completed in 1968 , the year prior to the beginning of the Ph.D. glut .
Its title : “ The Ph.D. Production Process : A Study of Departmental Behavior . ”
Of all Ph.D. dissertations ever written , this is the only one that one that should be read by every college student who is contemplating graduate school .
Of course , no one tells him .
Few people have ever heard of it .
I read it in 1970 .
I do not recall how I came across it .
I was completing my Ph.D. , so I was facing the Ph.D. glut personally , which had begun in the fall of 1969 .
It had been predicted for the sciences by Allan Cartter of New York University in 1964 .
Sometime around 1966 , Clark Kerr , President of the University of California , had mentioned this looming problem to a group of us in an elite student organization called the California Club .
But I was naïve .
I figured , “ It wo n’t happen to me . ”
Ha !
As they say in those late - night Ronco ads , “ Here ’s how it works ! ” Academic departments grow in terms of the number of students enrolled .
We know from Parkinson ’s Law that growth is an institutional imperative .
Administrators advance their careers by expanding the number of subordinates in their department .
So , every academic department wants more students — students of a special kind .
Students are not of equal value to a department .
The lower - division student ( freshman or sophomore ) does not rate highly in the currency of academic resource allocation : the full - time enrollment , or FTE .
The FTE figure is what justifies the hiring of a full - time faculty member .
The lower the ratio , the better .
It may take 15 lower - division students to generate one FTE .
It may take only eight Ph.D. - level graduate students to generate an FTE .
The more Ph.D. students a department can attract , the faster the growth of that department .
This is the iron law of academia .
All other economic laws are sacrificed for it , as the economist says , other things being equal .
This fact of academic economic life creates an incentive for departments to enroll lots of graduate students .
It also rewards those departments that persuade M.A. students to go into the Ph.D. program .
Also , the brightest graduate students may be asked to do unpaid or grant - paid research for senior professors .
The professors then publish the results of this research under their own names , thereby advancing their careers .
It ’s the division of labor at work .
“ GLUT ? WHAT GLUT ? ”
The Ph.D. glut has existed ever since the fall of 1969 .
The number of entry - level full - time professorial positions has remained stagnant .
Few new universities have been constructed .
Legislatures have resisted additional funding .
This has led to a reduction of the number of tenure - level positions .
Universities and community colleges have been able to staff their entry - level positions with inexpensive instructors .
Those few Ph.D.s who receive a full - time position at a university find that they are paid much less than tenured members of the department .
They are assigned the lower - division classes , which are large — sometimes 200 to 1,000 students .
These mega - classes require lecturing skills that most professors do not possess .
Those untenured faculty members who perform well in mega-classes are kept on until the day of reckoning : the decision to grant them tenure , usually eight years after they go on the payroll .
They are usually not re-hired unless they have published narrowly focused articles in professional journals .
But mega - class professors do not have much time to do the required research .
The assistant professor is now 35 years old or older .
He has not made the cut .
He is now relegated to the academic underworld : the community colleges .
But here there is fierce competition .
Community colleges hire part - time instructors at $ 10 to $ 15 an hour .
These people seek a full - time position at the community college .
They need that initial foot in the door : night school courses for worn - out adults who are trying to earn an A.A. degree .
Their natural enemies are the newly dismissed assistant professors from universities .
Who gets an entry - level position at Boonsdocksville State University , which in 1960 was a public schools teacher training college ?
New graduates with Ph.D.s from the two - dozen major universities .
Then what happens to graduates with Ph.D.s issued by Boonsdocksville State ?
They go straight into the community college circuit .
This has been going on ever since the fall of 1969 .
It is great for community college administrators , who have a never - ending supply of optimistic Ph.D. - holding graduates of all but the top two - dozen universities , plus a never - ending supply of burned - out , terrified assistant professors from top universities who did not receive tenure .
If you want to understand this process , watch Ghostbusters : the scene after the parapsychology team has been dismissed from the university .
Dan Ackroyd speaks for tens of thousands of Ph.D. - holding rejects who did not make the cut .
For over three decades , all it has taken to generate 1,000 applicants was this ad in a professional journal in the humanities :
Tenure - track position Ph.D. requiredTeach 12 hours of the freshman course
The salary has been almost irrelevant : not more than the average salary of the average American worker with a high school diploma .
If the ad said “ Ph.D. or ABD required , ” it would generate 2,000 applicants .
ABD stands for “ all but dissertation . ”
Graduate students do not learn about supply and demand , and it does not pay senior professors to teach them .
Here is evidence .
In response to the ever - growing glut of Ph.D. ’s , the American university system turned out about 30,000 Ph.D. graduates per year , 1969 to about 1975 .
Since then , it has increased the output .
In 1980 , it was 33,615 .
In 1990 , it was 38,371 .
In 2000 , it was 44,808 .
In 2003 , it was 46,024 .
( Statistical Abstract of the United States , 2006 , Table 290 . )
Despite this , we read on a website devoted to selling “ how to get higher learning degrees ” materials ,
The Bureau of Labor Statistics currently predicts that the job outlook for postsecondary teachers ( a job commonly sought by Ph.D. graduates ) should be much brighter than it has been in recent years .
Employment in that area is expected to grow by almost 40 percent by 2012 , whereas overall employment is expected to grow by only 15 percent !
So , if you ’re just starting down the track to a Ph.D. and hope to take root in the world of academia , your timing may be just right !
There ’s one born every minute . . . and two who will relieve him of his funds .
STATE SUBSIDIES
Most degree - granting universities are funded by taxpayers .
A university used to be an institution of higher learning that was authorized by a college - accrediting agency to grant the Ph.D. Employees of all but the most prestigious four - year colleges want to be called a university .
So , title inflation has matched degree inflation and grade inflation over the last 35 years .
The supply of college graduates with ever - lower academic abilities is funded by money coerced from taxpayers .
The American higher education system is structured by the professorate to reward those professors who teach small classes of graduate students .
So , year after year , decade after decade , the supply of Ph.D. - holding students increases , despite an academic market that does not hire most of them , and hires a minority at wages that do not compensate them for the money and time invested in earning their degrees .
They cannot teach at the high school level because their advanced degrees force the school districts to pay them too much .
A teacher with a B.A. is paid a fraction of what a Ph.D. or Ed.D. is paid .
The teacher unions have negotiated payment so that existing employees who attend night school and summer school at Boonsdocksville State can work their way up within the system .
Being tenured , they can not be fired .
Earning a graduate degree is a guaranteed way to earn a larger salary .
But no district goes looking for Ph.D.s to hire .
That financial affliction is entirely generated from inside the union - dominated , tax - funded public schools .
HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL
Ph.D. students are a lot like gamblers .
They expect to beat the odds .
The gambler personifies odds - beating as Lady Luck .
The Ph.D. student instead looks within .
“ I am really smart .
These other people in the program are n’t as smart as I am .
I will get that tenure - track job .
I will make the cut .
I will be a beneficiary of the system . ”
If wishes were horses , beggars would ride .
Also , if ego were marketable , all Ph.D. graduates would get tenure .
Why does any Ph.D. student at any but the top graduate schools believe that he will get tenure at any university ?
The odds are so far against him , and have been for a generation , than he ought to realize that he is about to waste his most precious resource — time — on a long - shot .
Investing five or more years beyond the B.A. degree , except in a field where industry hires people with advanced degrees , is economic stupidity that boggles the imagination .
Yet at least 200,000 graduate students are doing this at any time .
Of the 46,000 who earned a Ph.D. in 2003 , an equal number ( or more ) got to ABD status and quit .
Probably more than half of the others quit before they got to ABD status .
At $ 20,000 or more per year in tuition and living expenses , plus the $ 35,000 + not earned in the job market , trying to earn a Ph.D. is a losing proposition .
In some departments , the years invested are horrendous .
Breneman ’s dissertation went into the grim details , department by department .
Anyone seeking a degree in philosophy was almost doomed to failure , yet the Ph.D. degree took on average over a decade beyond the B.A. to earn .
There were almost no college teaching jobs when they finished .
That was before the glut .
CONCLUSION
Earning a Ph.D. may pay off if your goal is status , although I do n’t understand why anyone regards a Ph.D. as a status symbol that is worth giving up five to ten years of your earning power in your youth , when every dime saved can multiply because of compounding .
If the public understood the economics of earning a Ph.D. , people would think “ naïve economic loser ” whenever they hear “ Ph.D . ”
A word to the wise is sufficient .

A POINT OF VIEW
By Harold Evans
After so many years of Social Darwinism , Hurricane Katrina could reawaken the American people 's appetite for compassion in government .
It takes a lot to shake America to the core - 9/11 did it four years ago this weekend ; the war in Iraq still has not .
It 's 70 years since the satirist Eric Linklater noted in his novel Don Juan that life in America was spread over so vast an area that any number of strange and sinister interludes could be enacted without upsetting the national equilibrium .
Desperate times Hurricane Katrina is one of those rare interludes which has upset the national equilibrium .
While 9/11 made Americans angry , the fate of New Orleans has gone beyond that .
In varying degrees the whole population is angry , ashamed , and fearful .
Angry at the incompetence and buck - passing between inept local , state and federal authorities ; ashamed at those relentlessly recycled pictures of the abandoned black underclass ; and fearful to see that the country is still unprepared to cope with a major terrorist attack .
There will be hell to pay for Katrina .
In my view , it is likely to have as traumatic an impact on American political life as the Great Depression of the 1930s .
That catastrophe ushered in two decades of Democratic presidents - but even more , it reversed America 's entrenched dedication to laissez faire Social Darwinism , a philosophy embraced by both major parties for 150 years .
Natural selection Social Darwinism was a doctrine of individualism invented in England by the 19th Century philosopher Herbert Spencer , a friend of Charles Darwin's .
It was Spencer who first coined the famous phrase " the survival of the fittest " and he did so nine years before the great man himself published his Origin of Species .
I do not believe that the power and duty of the General Government ought to be extended to the relief of individual suffering
President Grover Cleveland , 1877 Social Darwinism never infiltrated politics as much in Britain as it did in America where it was brilliantly propagated by a Yale polemicist named William Graham Sumner .
Interventions by government to regulate housing , public health , factories , and so on , were wrong , he argued , because they impeded individual enterprise that alone created wealth .
My mind , said the steelmaster Andrew Carnegie , was illuminated in a flash by Sumner 's theorem that mankind progresses through the " ceaseless devouring of the weak by the strong " .
Politicians of all colours agreed .
It was a Democratic president - Grover Cleveland - who epitomized the philosophy in a memorable decision in 1887 .
Asked to release $ 10,000 of surplus seed for drought - stricken farmers in Texas , he declared : " I do not believe that the power and duty of the General Government ought to be extended to the relief of individual suffering ...
The lesson should constantly be enforced that though the people support the Government , the Government should not support the people . "
BBC NEWS : AUDIO Hear A Point of View in the BBC Radio Player America has long been entranced by stories of fortunes made by hard work and perseverance without help from government .
More tellingly many of them come true , truer in America than anywhere else .
It is just that they are not the whole story .
When people fail it leaves , exposed as a raw nerve , the question of moral duty in a civilized society .
So Social Darwinism has remained in the American psyche , sometimes submerged in the current , sometimes coming to the surface like a log in a fast - flowing river .
Cleveland 's sentiments might have popped up any time in the 1980s on Ronald Reagan 's teleprompter .
His remark that " government is not the solution to our problem , government is the problem " was an echo of Cleveland and many presidencies thereafter .
The log came clearly into view again when turbulence in the wake of 9/11 led to the re-election of George W Bush .
His instinct for low taxes and small government has been neatly encapsulated by the evangelical tax cutter Grover Norquist : " I do n't want to abolish government .
I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub . "
Judgement day
My judgment is that the log of Social Darwinism will disappear again under the toxic flood waters of New Orleans .
The corpses floating face down in the muddy overflow from broken Mississippi levees are too shocking a sight for Americans of all classes and parties .
They are too kindly a people .
They will look once again for vigour and compassion in government , even at the price of higher taxes .
Poor and huddled masses Before Katrina , America 's greatest natural disaster was another Mississippi flood - that of 1927 - which made half a million homeless .
At the time Republican President Calvin Coolidge refused even to recall Congress to vote emergency money .
He was so inactive that when Dorothy Parker , a few years later , was told he was dead , she asked , " How do they know ? "
Two hundred people had drowned in the 1920s before the federal government intervened .
It did so in the person of the Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover .
Only three died after Hoover got involved .
He waded in - literally up to his knees in floodwater - galvanizing everyone in six endangered states .
His vigour standing on the tottering levee amid the raging floods helped to win him the Republican nomination and then the presidency .
He was called " the great engineer " .
So why then is Hoover almost a dirty word in the history books ?
It is because faced with a bigger challenge than the floods - the Great Depression with 13 million out of work - he refused to recognise the responsibility of government to relieve individual suffering .
Watching the crash at Wall St He believed that economic depressions , like natural disasters , were acts of God that must run their course .
He expected voluntary acts of compassion by business and good neighbours would be enough , as they mostly had been in his humanitarian work in World War I .
But the Depression affected so many millions it was too big and complex for that .
So slow was Hoover to respond that the shanty towns of the unemployed became known as Hoovervilles .
He refused to believe that anyone was starving .
Of the men selling apples in the streets , the symbol of the depression , he said , " many persons left their jobs for the more profitable one of selling apples . "
It was not a joke .
He had a tin ear , rather like George Bush .
When GW belatedly visited the flooded region , he reminisced about his good - time days in New Orleans .
His intentions were good but his off - the - cuff remark was as unfortunate as his rhapsody to the homeless about how the former Republican majority leader Trent Lott of Mississippi was going to build a " fantastic new house " .
Brother can you spare a dime ?
And Bush , like Hoover , has found it hard to confront reality .
He has said nobody expected the levees to break - thereby flying in the fact of scores of predictions in official reports , science journals and newspapers .
Back in the 30s , clinging to the log of Social Darwinism did not save Hoover .
He was swept away by a riptide of anger and fear like that which may threaten the Republican ascendancy today .
In 1932 Hoover lost both his reputation and the presidency in a landslide to his Democratic challenger Franklin Roosevelt .
The New Deal FDR ushered in - signing 15 bills in his first 100 days - almost drove a stake through the heart of Social Darwinism .
Never before had government so directly shored up the lives of individual Americans at every social level and class .
It was the foundation of a welfare state - a ringing reaffirmation of America 's commitment to huddled masses yearning to share in the great American Dream .
Your comments : I doubt a single " Katrina " would be enough to fell social Darwinism ingrained so deeply in the America psyche , and promulgated by evangelical ' free - marketers ' of all creeds and shades .
Indeed , the ' Norquistodors ' keep exploiting the tragedy to beam their anti-government mottos .
It would take more , a great depression plus a personality , like FDR , to shake it off , and replace with a civilized order .
Besides any advance into civilization is shaky and can be easily swatted by any GW - type buffoon .
Even now , in the face of great losses and government failures the republican congress did n't take off the table the lavish give - away to rich ( call in their parlor ' death tax ' ) .
I wo n't be a bit surprised if it sails through unhindered ( after commotion is over ) .
A great depression is badly needed here , but it wo n't come until Chinese communists would stop subsidizing our absurdly wasteful and unsustainable way of life , and some western European liberals assisting in our promiscuous adventures abroad under the guise of ' democratization ' .
David G. , Cleveland , USA Point of Information :
It was the power of the Workers ' Councils that compelled Roosevelt to enact the WPA .
His strategy was motivated more by political necessity than social compassion .
He was obliged to over the grass roots organizations -- incorporate them into benign government agencies , essentially -- lest they become a nationally recognized -- and hence threatening -- political force .
America may be compassionate , but the Workers Councils brought socialism and communism too close to a popular front .
They were , by the way , the ones behind the soup kitchens ; they were the ones who fed the starving when government forces were all too keen to shoot at their own .
These days , we Americans are totally ignorant of our own political and social history .
As long as we can get colour TVs , a working refrigerator , plenty of booze , drugs , and anti-depressants , I truly doubt we 'll ever see the scale of social and governmental reform that Roosevelt ushered into office -- however needed .
Remember , the " most powerful nation in the world " still can't manage to assure full literacy .
Pamela Sears , Austin , Texas
The only thing missing from this excellent review of the failed Social Darwinism policies of the Bush administration is the telling and callous remarks of Bush 's mother , Barbara Bush , who , on viewing evacuees in Texas , claimed that they were now better off since they had been underprivileged anyway .
Eileen Bach , Ithaca , NY USA
That 's PRESIDENT George Bush , not GW .
We do not refer to your Queen as Elizabeth and I would like to see the same respect shown for our leader .
Kim Wells , Oklahoma American tax payers have spent 4 trillion that 's Trillion dollars on social welfare programmes over the past 35 years .
Spent 3 trillion dollars during the cold war defending Europe 100 Billion in 2005 dollars rebuilding Europe after WW2 is this not Compassion .
Gary Blackall , Tallahassee I do not believe that countries that subscribe to a more socially redistributing form of governance would have handled the aftermath of Katrina any better :
The mere magnitude of the storm was overwhelming and federal aid agencies around the world are known for their bureaucratic shortcomings .
Admittedly , there is a large spread between the haves and have - nots in the US , but the space between them can still be crossed through merit , whereas most other industrialized countries squeeze their citizens into a depressingly stagnant amalgamation of middle class .
Lastly , US American enthusiasm is a one - of - its - kind phenomenon .
It alone would suffice to enable the reconstruction and healing progress , including the necessary changes to emergency response agencies .
The drastic difference that this ( US ) system depicts is people helping other people , instead of people waiting for government intervention .
Sebastian , Santa Clara , CA Although I 'm from the States , I 've had to read about the Katrina devastation from abroad ; so my perception may be a bit off .
However , the major difference you might find in the impact of the two disasters Evans mentions -- the Great Depression and Hurricane Katrina -- is first - hand experience vs the influence of removed empathy .
Americans are devastated by what Katrina has revealed about our own country , but Bush has the good ole ' boy charm that Hoover never had .
In the short - term , it will undoubtedly lead to a few reforms , but I question the long - term impact on the " social Darwinism . "
I can only hope that the administration will not be able to so craftfully slip out , free of blame , from this obscenely mishandled catastrophe -- like they have so many times before .
I guess it all depends on your ability to have faith in the American tenet that proclaims open arms for the poor and huddled masses .
Susannah , Houston , USA I hope that America will stop being " the land of a few that can afford to be free . "
Yes , in America you have to work hard for yourself , but after a disaster or in a depression , everyone , including the government , needs to work together to see it thru .
chris , cincinnati , ohio I hope you 're right .
Much of what the world perceives as wrong with the US hinges on an election won by only a few votes -- then repeated because of an unclear action on Iraq .
Many of us did our best to prevent it , but it happened anyway .
We are still working .
Larry , Louisville , CO , USA Commentaries like this from abroad truly astound me .
Indeed , while I think the general inclination is correct and applicable to Katrina , the wider simplistic discussion about Social Darwinism is completely off - base .
You might as well toss in Libertarianism , Meritocracy or any other modernistic - ism which one wants to criticize .
This PROTESTANT ETHIC focus on individual merit has roots well beyond 19th century academic debates about social Darwinism in the halls of Yale .
This commentary sounded good , but misses the mark by not really understanding American culture beyond this simplistic intellectual history .
That said , indeed , I think it hits something vital in considering Katrina as a potential turning point in American political sentiment .
I just do n't think it deserves so much credit at this time .
Jude , New York Hurricane Katrina will have a greater impact on America than the Great Depression of the 1930s ?
What a joke .
September 11th did not have as big an impact as the Depression and if you think it did , my guess is you have been reading some pseudo - political science books and then writing an entire article talking about President Hoover in the 1930s .
If you are unable to convince an audience of your point with a significant event in their own lifetime at least , just keep that thought to yourself .
Americans love to site around and talk about what happened 70 years ago - yeah right .
Most of the evacuees will receive some sort of aid from the good people around the nation who donated , doing their ' good deed ' of the day .
The question after that will be , " What is our government going to change to be ready in case that happens to MY city ? "
Neal Tesseyman , Austin , TX
We already can not afford the social security system that came to be , I pray that we will not succumb further into the welfare state you predict .
Theresa Tompkins , Houston , Texas USA
We have been in a sad state of affairs for quite some time .
I really do not know what Bush meant when he described himself as a compassionate conservative .
We have so many internal problems is this country .
I do agree that this event can sway us away from social Darwinism , but at the same time I fear that we will swing too far in the other direction .
America like extremes .
It surprises me that the word moderate is found in our dictionaries .
Many poor in this country are trapped by the social programs designed to help them .
Welfare was a great program that led to a sad imbalance of dependence .
Sarc , New York , USA Amen !
Though in the short term I am not so certain , there are many Americans rather satisfied with the status quo and not too keen on asking serious questions about the role of the individual , the responsibility of the state , the meaning of public policy in a new millennium that will require dialogue and cooperation if mankind is able to survive .
filip s , warsaw , poland
This editorial is absolutely silly .
At almost every turn there is a point made that is far from conclusively supported by events , present or historic .
It is really nauseating to see that Europeans take this as an opportunity to make the most clumsy sort of appeals for their preference for heavy government involvement .
We are not like you , we do not share all of your preferences , etc .
Get over it .
Hoping that hurricane Katrina will make us like you is as silly as us believing that the force of arms will make Iraqis just like Americans .
Peter , North Carolina
Evans builds a straw man , and even then can't quite knock it down .
There are many justifications in the US political tradition for wanting less government , not just " social Darwinism " .
Bush 's tax cut programme has nothing whatever to do with social Darwinism , and everything to do with the belief that such cuts will spur the economy and create jobs .
As such its explicit justification is precisely to help the people , not let them battle each other for survival .
Now , I happen to believe this logic is deeply flawed , but it is not social Darwinist logic .
Evan 's quoting of Grover Cleveland is inadvertently humorous , since in the 20th century the Federal Government has done exactly the opposite : shovel aid with abandon at people who choose to live in flood plains , in hurricane paths , and on top of earth quake zones .
Hardly social Darwinism .
Niall , Los Angeles I wish I had your faith in my country .
Unfortunately if I 've learned anything in the face of our recent disasters its that we will be shaken only as long as we can not go back to our normal lives .
After that I fear we will resume our disbelief as we have on so many other occasions and return to Social Darwinism and anything else that keeps the government and its supporters feeling safe and confident .
, Arlington , VA USA Excellent - - well thought out , researched , and insightful as to the basis of this country -- may it be widely read .
I hope the American population will be reminded / rediscover the good values we once had here .
Our sincere thanks for this to you 'across the pond . '
c s khalsa , Austin , Tx , USA Despite Harold Evans fevered imagination the whole population of the United States is not angry , ashamed or fearful and we will never be ready to embrace the long slow death that is European Socialism .
We will rebuild and we will move on to the next challenge and our optimism will not diminish .
J. Young , Atlanta , USA From one so entrenched in American journalism ( or lack thereof ) reading the BBC is a breath of fresh air .
In times like these , the American press has not the backbone to do honest journalism such as this .
I commend your news organization for upholding the ideals that first created your station .
bob carpenter , Chicago USA
An excellent piece , so good to see writing with a sense of history and context for a change .
Let 's hope that the flood of Katrina will sweep away so much more than the victims .
Pete cook , Bristol I am reminded of a cartoon in the New Yorker Magazine sometime in the late 60's .

Karl Johnson , Arlington , Virginia , USA
These " experts " from England come over here , do a superficial turn around small areas of the country then developed a simplistic theory that they feel explains all that is " wrong " in the United States .
They then pontificate about their own social system that only serves to reveal the inferiority of that very same system .
Physician heal thyself !
You have an old saying that I feel covers it well , what a load of codswallop !
Ron Knief , Bessemer , MI I sincerely hope that you are right .

In anticipating long - term affects from the pitiable images in the media , one should not underestimate the countering affect from images of looting , lawlessness and , for lack of a better term , ingratitude .
Americans suppress our comments about anything that sounds politically incorrect , but those images have left a greater impression than is evident from our media coverage .
Such impressions shore up , rather than diminish , our referenced tendency toward ¿ social Darwinism . ¿
Arthur , Kansas Harold Evans needs to lay off the propaganda .
He uses the term Social Darwinism to attack the concept of individual liberty and property rights .
Americans are extremely generous , we just prefer to give through the private sector .
Witness over $ 700 million dollars raised in less than two weeks for Katrina .
Greg Burton , Atlanta , GA USA
The question is , do Americans want it differently .
The health system ( not the available care ) is a disgrace to the country yet a logical explanation for them not doing anything about it is that they have not known anything better .
For many years the American system worked because the energy of the industrial system had produced jobs and the competition ie Europe and the far East had been set back by wars and power struggles .
With jobs now being outsourced by American companies and the resurgence of other worldwide industries to supply to the USA the prognosis for the American is not good .
The spirit of we can get the job done ( often by working far more hours a day than other countries ) will continue as a matter of national pride .
Americans are very friendly , very hospitable and a great and resourceful nation .
They have to see that there is a softer ( dare I say more social ) way of life of a better quality than the one they have which should be available to all Americans .
In all sincerity , God bless America .
Geoff , Copperopolis , CA , USA
As much as I admire your premise , I believe you are engaged in wishful thinking on a grand scale .
You are correct that American society rests on a foundation of social Darwinism .
I just do n't see what , in the current circumstances , warrants your belief that the tragedy in Louisiana and Mississippi will alter that .
Millions of Americans ( especially in the South ) are deeply convinced that the federal government is a bloated , ineffective and culturally alien institution .
The track record of the past month will do nothing to convince them to invest any further confidence in it .
John A. , Washington DC , USA
Hoover won support by walking into the floodwaters and speaking from the levees .
GWBush wo n't even touch the ground anywhere near the flood .
Hmmm . GWB did give speeches from the 9/11 site .
What changed ?
I guess he figured that he can't be re-elected any more .
9/11 brought out our compassion , but also brought out an ugly angry isolationist sort of patriotism which has done quite a lot of harm .
I hope that the compassionate reaction to the tsunami last winter combined with our reaction to Katrina ( and a lack of an enemy in both cases ) will last long enough to make a lasting change for the better .
I have my doubts , but I will keep hoping .
Keith Murray , Stamford , Connecticut , USA

As the magma deep underground rises to the surface , it crystallises with the reduction in pressure and the water forms bubbles .
The magma releases heat , and its temperature rises from 900C to 1000C .
When the molten rock reaches the surface , the combination of water bubbles and temperature increase blows out the magma with explosive force , much like champagne spurting from a bottle when it is uncorked .
" By looking in great detail at the erupting rock , we 've been able to show that , as the magma ascends beneath the volcano prior to an eruption , it crystallises in response to the drop in pressure and it also gets hotter , " said Professor Jon Blundy of Bristol University , who led the work , published today in Nature .
" This work is now being used to gauge the direction of current volcanic activity at Mount St Helens in the US and could be applied to any active volcano for which monitoring and petrological records are available . "
The magma can increase in temperature by about 100C in just a few years .
This provides a trigger for an eruption without the need for an outside heat source , such as hotter magma below .
Scientists normally monitor active volcanoes by measuring how the ground around them deforms and how the gases they release change over time .
Local earthquakes can also provide clues on how magma is moving under a volcano .
Explosive volcanic eruptions are caused by the escape of gases from magma stored in underground reservoirs .
Monitoring magma has been difficult because it is so far below the Earth 's surface .
" What we 've done is study little droplets of volcanic liquid that are trapped inside the magma as it rises to the surface , " said Madeleine Humphreys of Cambridge University , speaking yesterday at the British Association festival of science in Norwich .
By measuring the water and chemical content of these droplets , called melt inclusions , the researchers were able to tell how the magma was moving underneath the volcano and what condition it was in .
If the magma is at high pressure under the volcano , it will contain a lot of water and can form a lot of bubbles .
" The sort of material that 's ejected by a volcano during its precursory activity could hold the clues to what 's going on underground and might indicate what might happen in the future , " said Prof Blundy .
" More bubbles , more explosive eruptions .
If the magma is stored at a low pressure , [ there is ] potential to form bubbles and less explosive potential . "
In their study , the researchers looked at the lava thrown out of Mount St Helens in the US and Shiveluch in Kamchatka , Russia .
Mount St Helens erupted in May 1980 because of sudden decompression of the magma under the volcano .
Prof Blundy said the release of pressure was like smashing the top off a bottle of champagne after giving it a vigorous shake .
Mount St Helens lay dormant until 2004 , when large columns of magma started erupting from the top of the volcano .
Analysis of current eruptions shows that it is unlikely to explode soon , Prof Blundy said .
Combining the analysis of melt inclusions with traditional observations of volcanoes was the " holy grail of modern volcanology , " he said .
CBS brought the tumultuous weeklong crisis over racially insensitive remarks by the radio host Don Imus to an end late this afternoon when it canceled the “ Imus in the Morning ” program , effective immediately .
The move came one day after MSNBC , which has simulcast Mr. Imus ’s radio program for the past 10 years , removed the show from the cable network ’s morning lineup .
The two moves together mean that Mr. Imus , who has been broadcasting his program for more than 30 years , no longer has a home on either national radio or television .
Mr. Imus received the news in a telephone call to his home .
Many of his listeners learned of it during the afternoon radio show “ Mike and the Mad Dog , ” which announced it on WFAN , the same New York station owned by CBS that carried Mr. Imus ’s program .
The CBS chairman , Leslie Moonves , held a meeting this afternoon with the Rev. Al Sharpton , one of the leaders in what became a national movement to have Mr. Imus removed from the air in the wake of comments in which he disparaged members of the Rutgers University women ’s basketball team .
On his program of April 4 , Mr. Imus referred to the women on the team as “ nappy - headed hos . ”
Philip Morris has adopted the role of good citizen these days .
Its Web site brims with information on the dangers of smoking , and it has mounted a campaign of television spots that urge parents , oh so earnestly , to warn their children against smoking .
That follows an earlier $ 100 million campaign warning young people to “ Think .
Do n’t Smoke , ” analogous to the “ just say no ” admonitions against drugs .
All this seems to fly against the economic interests of the company , which presumably depends on a continuing crop of new smokers to replace those who drop out or die from their habit .
But in practice , it turns out , these industry - run campaigns are notably ineffective and possibly even a sham .
New research shows that the ads aimed at youths had no discernible effect in discouraging smoking and that the ads currently aimed at parents may be counterproductive .
That disturbing insight comes from a study just published in The American Journal of Public Health by respected academic researchers who were supported by the National Cancer Institute , the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation .
Using sophisticated analytical techniques , the researchers concluded that the ads aimed directly at young people had no beneficial effect , while those aimed at parents were actually harmful to young people apt to see them , especially older teenagers .
The greater the teenagers ’ potential exposure to the ads , the stronger their intention to smoke and the greater their likelihood of having smoked in the past 30 days .
Just why the costly advertising campaigns produce no health benefits is a rich subject for exploration .
The ads are fuzzy - warm , which could actually generate favorable feelings for the tobacco industry and , by extension , its products .
And their theme  that adults should tell young people not to smoke mostly because they are young people  is exactly the sort of message that would make many teenagers feel like lighting up .
( Trial testimony has made it clear that the goal of Philip Morris ’s youth smoking prevention programs is to delay smoking until adulthood , not to discourage it for a lifetime . )

Many Americans were horrified to learn that US - grown technology firms are complying with the Chinese government 's demands to control information .
But the mistake some observers make is to equate the power of corporations with the power of governments .
Though Google 's success stems from its birth in a free country , that does n't mean the company is strong enough to enforce freedom around the world .

I 'm digging deeper into this Carol Lam / White House / Duke Cunningham story .
Very odd stuff .
Check out the following from the LA Times .
Now , keep in mind that MZM was the firm bribing Cunningham , and the firm that Cunningham was directing the federal contracts to .
The thing is , MZM had no revenue yet in 2001 , but somehow from somewhere they had $ 100,000 to pay off Cunningham at the same time .
Also , MZM had never had any federal contracts .
But somehow they get on the preferred vendor list and their first contract is with Dick Cheney 's office in the White House .
And the amount of money Cheney 's people pay MZM is the exact amount of money that is needed to buy Duke Cunningham 's boat .
How and why did Dick Cheney 's office help this nobody suddenly get rolling ?
MZM Inc. was incorporated in 1993 but had not posted any revenue as late as 2001 .
Still , the company began paying for Cunningham 's expenses , according to court documents .
In November 2001 , a company check for $ 12,000 paid for three nightstands , a leaded - glass cabinet , an antique washstand and four armoires .
In December 2001 , a $ 50,000 company check was sent to a mortgage banker , who in turn made out a check to Cunningham for the same amount .
In January 2002 , the company 's American Express card was used to purchase a leather sofa and a sleigh bed for Cunningham .
In all , more than $ 100,000 in cash and furnishings were given to Cunningham even before MZM had posted its first revenue .
Although MZM had no experience with government contracts , the General Services Administration in May 2002 placed the company on a list of approved information technology service providers , a key step for the company to get business from federal agencies .
The first contract , worth $ 140,000 , came from the White House — to provide office furniture and computers for Vice President Dick Cheney .
Two weeks later , on Aug. 30 , 2002 , Wade purchased a yacht , later christened " Duke - Stir , " for $ 140,000 , according to court documents .
Cunningham used the yacht , docked at the Capital Yacht Club , as his home in Washington — and the scene of parties for lobbyists and others .
The money and gifts MZM gave Cunningham were a small price to pay for the ultimate prize .
In September 2002 , the General Services Administration signed a so - called blanket purchase agreement with MZM totaling $ 250 million over five years .
Under the agreement , specific computer services for the Pentagon would be contracted to MZM without competition .

Patrick and Susan did not know each other as children
Interview with couple
They share a small flat in an east German tower block on the outskirts of the city .
It looks like an ordinary family scene , but Patrick is Susan 's brother and they are lovers .
" Many people see it as a crime , but we 've done nothing wrong , " said Patrick , an unemployed locksmith .
" We are like normal lovers .
We want to have a family .
Our whole family broke apart when we were younger , and after that happened , Susan and I were brought closer together , " he said .
Patrick , who is 30 years old , was adopted and , as a child , he lived in Potsdam .
He did not meet his mother and biological family until he was 23 .
He travelled to Leipzig with a friend in 2000 , determined to make contact with his other relatives .
This law is out of date and it breaches the couple 's civil rights
Lawyer Endrik Wilhelm
" When I was younger , I did n't know that I had a brother .
I met Patrick and I was so surprised , " said Susan , who is 22 .
She says she does not feel guilty about their relationship .
" I hope this law will be overturned , " Susan said .
" I just want to live with my family , and be left alone by the authorities and by the courts , " she went on , in a hardly audible voice .
Jail sentence
Patrick and Susan have been living together for the last six years , and they now have four children .
The authorities placed their first son , Eric , in the care of a foster family , and two other children were also placed in care .
" Our children are with foster parents .
We talk to them as often as possible , but the authorities have taken away so much from us , " said Susan .
" We only have our little daughter , Sofia , who is living with us , " she said .
All but one of the couple 's children have been taken into care
Incest is a criminal offence in Germany .
Patrick Stuebing has already served a two - year sentence for committing incest and there is another jail term looming if paragraph 173 of the legal code is not overturned .
The couple 's lawyer , Endrik Wilhelm , has lodged an appeal with Germany 's highest judicial body , the federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe , in order to overturn the country 's ban on incest .
" Under Germany 's criminal code , which dates back to 1871 , it is a crime for close relatives to have sex and it's punishable by up to three years in prison .
This law is out of date and it breaches the couple 's civil rights , " Dr Wilhelm said .
" Why are disabled parents allowed to have children , or people with hereditary diseases or women over 40 ?
No - one says that is a crime .
" This couple are not harming anyone .
It is discrimination .
And besides , we must not forget that every child is so valuable , " said Dr Wilhelm .
We would like society to recognise us , as any other normal couple
Patrick Stuebing
The couple 's case is controversial and it has prompted a heated debate in the media .
" We need this law against incest in Germany and in the whole of Europe , " said Professor Juergen Kunze , a geneticist at Berlin 's Charite Hospital .
" It is based on long traditions in Western societies , and the law is here for a good reason , " said Prof Kunze .
" Medical research has shown that there is a higher risk of genetic abnormalities when close relatives have a child together .
When siblings have children , there is a 50 % chance that the child will be disabled , " he said .
Patrick and Susan say they have no other choice but to fight the current law .
" I have read that some doctors claim that children born to siblings could be disabled , but what about disabled parents who have children , or older parents ? " asked Patrick .
" People have said that our children are disabled , but that is wrong .
They are not disabled , " said Patrick .
" Eric , our eldest child , has epilepsy , but he was born two months premature , he also has learning difficulties .
Our other daughter , Sarah , has special needs , " Patrick said .
Ruling soon
The couple claim they have received a lot of support from friends and neighbours .
" When we go out to the supermarket , people recognise us and many have told us that they support our legal challenge , " said Patrick .
" We would like society to recognise us , as any other normal couple , " he said .
In 2004 , Patrick voluntarily underwent a vasectomy .
" It 's legal for the couple to live together , and to share a bed .
But they are breaking the law once they have sex .
If there are no more children , then who will be able to prove that they are a couple ? " asked their lawyer .
Dr Wilhelm said a ruling was expected in the next few months .
" We 've already heard that the vice - president of the Constitutional Court said that there will be a ' fundamental discussion ' about this issue in Germany , " said Dr Wilhelm .
" Many criminal law experts say that we are right and I 'm confident that my clients will win their case .
The law against incest is based on very old moral principles .
The law was abolished in France , it 's about time it should be scrapped here in Germany as well . "
The State of IT infrastructure - the hidden Viaduct .
A rant .
[ Mar. 15th , 2007 | 10:09 am ] dunsany
All right , a post about my career and observations of my nearly twenty years in it ; this came to me in the middle of the night in a stroke of midnight clarity .
IT infrastructure is like the Alaska Way Viaduct .
For those of you who live out of Washington State , we are embroiled in an insipid mess about a large traffic causeway that feeds downtown Seattle .
It 's too old , too narrow and quite ugly .
Because of earthquakes and other damage , it 's been patched and re-patched to remain functional .
But it 's on its last legs , and probably wo n't survive much longer .
Beginning to see the analogy ?
It gets better .
The mayor of Seattle wants to replace the Viaduct with an expensive new tunnel ( think Boston 's Big Dig ) .
Others want to rebuild it with a new , better ( but still over ground ) Viaduct .
Other factions want to rip it down altogether and just use expanded surface streets .
All of these options will mean seriously diminished service during the transition at an astonishingly high cost .
The governor punted and called for a vote .
The vote just failed - with a " No ! " for both the tunnel and the elevated structure .
No one 's really too keen on the surface street option - no way our streets could handle the increased load or an expansion .
And it 's just plain not feasible to have businesses and citizens change the way they commute without ancillary measures ( like better mass transit ) in place .
If you 're in IT , the analogy should really hit home .
IT infrastructure is a layered sandwich of decrepit parts , Scotch - taped together and sagging under increasing demand .
Every time a hint of abnormal activity happens - network worm , blackout , major upgrade - the whole thing falls over .
But , IT can't work on the infrastructure because everyone depends on it .
Every day .
For everything .
And oh , nevermind , we have no money , anyway .
Too important to lose , too expensive to fix .
Catch 22 .
How about the corporate leadership ?
Same as the Viaduct .
Same players , different names .
The CTO wants to forklift the infrastructure with a fancy new technology ( SOA is the hot one of the moment ) .
But no , the CFO wo n't pay for it .
The CEO hurms and haws , passing the buck to committees and consultants to debate .
And what is the result ?
Status quo - we 'll fix it next fiscal , when we have more money and a better technology .
And next fiscal becomes next - next fiscal .
And so on .
Of course , the solution is for someone to make a half - way decent decision and ramrod it through .
Take ownership as well as all the thrown daggers as the project rolls forward , over - budget and past deadline ( again , like Big Dig and every IT project I 've ever been on ) .
The result will be painful to reach but we 'll probably be better off for it .
Sadly , leadership and courage are lacking both in politics and in IT management .
Now imagine my job : making all that sagging infrastructure safe and secure , while maintaining its usefulness and cost effectiveness .
I think I 'll become a full - time cartoonist instead .
Software : The Next Generation
The Interface is the Program , and it ai n't Agile
by James O. Coplien
December 4 , 2006
Summary
Good user interface design is one of the most poorly taught disciplines in software education .
Such poor foundations follow programmers all the way to their positions of leadership in the industry , and the Agile Manifesto authors are no exception .
Here , I post my thoughts on a recent posting in Håkan Reis ' ' blog , whose views struck a chord with me .
Advertisement
A recent ' blog by Håkan Reis picked up on some things I said in my keynote at Øredev 2006 about common pitfalls of Agile practitioners , and in particular those that contribute to bad user interfaces .
My points were that : 1 . Test - driven development without architecture emphasizes a procedural architecture rather than the kind of good object - oriented architecture than supports the direct manipulation metaphor , which in turn is one foundation of a good user interface ; and 2 .
That the Agile Manifesto leaves usability at the side of the road .
Here are the comments I added to that ' blog .
The Manifesto is by and large brilliant , but in retrospect one does find it blind , so to speak , to our users ' perspective .
Most of it is about solving our problems as programmers .
Even customer engagement ends being a problem for us , because we get relatively quick feedback if there is a requirements mismatch , and that stings .
So the manifesto has a heavy user - story focus because that 's what its authors knew .
It 's a baby - and - bathwater problem , one more time with feeling .
Usability and maintainability are long - term issues .
I think that most Agile organizations adopt short - term postures .
Long - term underpinnings are necessary to short - term agility : You must be fit to be Agile .
Getting into shape , developing the right architectural posture , takes time and effort .
( That was the first point I emphasized in my keynote , referenced in one of the links above ) .
Too many Agile practitioners ignore this foundational discipline because they confuse Agile with instant ( programmer ) gratification , under the excuse of rapid customer delivery ( which is a good thing ) and quick feedback from the customer ( which can also be a good thing ) .
So I 've seen a lot of Agile projects crash and burn after about their third external iteration for lack of good architectural foundations .
It does n't take much architecture to shape the whole -- just enough to keep Conway 's Law happy and to lay a foundation for the interface -- but it takes much more than Ron Jeffrie 's fabled " ten minutes of design . "
Maybe a sprint 's worth is enough to get started .
If an interface is unproductive or inhumane , users notice it only after a long enough time has elapsed for habit formation to be a factor .
You do n't notice such things when you test drive the program ; the clumsiness is hidden behind the familiar Redmond look - and - feel or behind some graphic artist 's sugar coating .
Some users never get beyond their awe of such sugar coating to understand that they system is costing them dearly in time .
( I think it 's Beyer and Holtzblatt who make the point that it takes much longer using Word to type a letter and envelope than it does using a typewriter . )
Those users who do ultimately become conscious of the inefficiency of their interface , do so long after leaving the store where they bought it .
Unlike bugs -- which are more black and white -- usability concerns are difficult to convey to the vendor .
They often must be substantiated by data , studies , analyses , measures , and comparisons .
Most users do n't have the tools or even vocabulary to develop such critiques of the interfaces they use .
Curiously enough , neither do most vendors , and most Agile projects are changing the software too rapidly to undertake such studies .
The most that a user is likely to say is that an interface is " clumsy " or " awkward , " and it 's hard for a typical vendor to do anything with that .
An insightful vendor will of course do some dutiful usability work .
I just worked with a client a month ago who quickly ( agile -ly ! ! ) responded to static from their users about usability problems .
The users were right , and we made a lot of progress .
Things seldom go so well .
There is a close relationship between the structure of one 's domain , the structure of one 's interface , and the architecture of one 's software .
The most superficial understanding of OOD and MVC together bear this out .
Those structures evolve more slowly than user stories do , and must be nurtured with care .
Agile has a poor history of being patient or of dealing with long - term stable structures , or recognizing the feedback loops that reflect problems in those structures .
There is no user story for usability nor for maintainability .
So , in fact , I think the problem goes much deeper and is much more serious than you point out here .
As you said in your previous ' blog , it 's only when developers start taking this to heart that things will change .
That goes back to how universities educate their students , and how corporations value investment in the user interface .
In the mean time , we follow a blind manifesto .
A blind manifesto can type code quick and in an Agile way , but it has difficulty working its way across the busy street of the market place .

UPDATE : It turns out The Vagina Monologues is playing in town .

" Ever since I was eight ... "
Checks on 50,000 personal statements found 5 % had borrowed material .
Its study , by CFL Software Development , was done after the 15 October deadline for Oxbridge , medicine , dentistry and veterinary science applications .
Almost 800 drew on three example medicine statements on a free website , including a story about burnt pyjamas .
The Ucas application form includes a personal statement for people to detail their interests and say why they want to study their chosen course .
CFL , which makes detection software Copycatch , found :
370 sentences contained a statement beginning : " a fascination for how the human body works ... "
234 contained a statement relating a dramatic incident involving " burning a hole in pyjamas at age eight "
175 contained a statement which involved " an elderly or infirm grandfather " .
Feasibility
The pyjamas incident features in the top-rated personal statement for medicine applicants on the studential .com advice site :
" Ever since I accidentally burnt holes in my pyjamas after experimenting with a chemistry set on my eighth birthday , I have always had a passion for science . "
Among the advice , the website states clearly about example material : " The first thing to remember is do n't directly copy any of it - not even a single sentence !
" The reason is , copying statements is plagiarism , and if an admissions tutor sees a statement they recognise they will probably reject you instantly . "
Ucas said the proliferation of advice sites , some of which charge a fee for writing tailored statements , is what prompted its inquiry .
It was not planning to take action against the individuals who had apparently been caught copying , a spokesman said .
This was a feasibility study and it was going to consult universities on the best way forward .
He said individual institutions needed to assess applications to see whether there was anything " fishy " about them .
" Very few are .
Most of those are just borrowing some material then adapting it .
" There 's a difference between copying , and using the web to get advice on how to write the best personal statement - there 's nothing wrong with that . "
Integrity
Part of Ucas ' message in publicising its findings is to stress to youngsters that the personal statement is their opportunity to stand out from the crowd , to differentiate themselves from others with similar grades .
Borrowed material is most likely to appear at the end of the statement or where an applicant describes why they want to study a subject .
Ucas chief executive , Anthony McClaran , said : " We are pleased to see that plagiarism is not rife in applications and that few applicants are paying to plagiarise .
" We take the integrity of applications very seriously and commissioned this work to investigate the potential for screening applications for borrowed material in the future .
" As part of our ongoing commitment to maintaining integrity standards we will shortly be doubling the size our verification unit , which is responsible for identifying fraudulent applications . "
The research also looked for similarities in applications from the same school , but found " very little evidence " of this .
Iraqi Informant Admits New York Subway Threat Was A Hoax
It gets worse and worse for the Bush Administration ’s terror alert capabilities .
The terror alert against New York ’s subway system , which was given to New York mayor Bloomberg over the first weekend this month and then held at the request of the federal government until last Thursday , was a hoax .
Both the FBI and the DHS thought the threat was questionable , even though it was the CIA and the Pentagon that gathered the information from the Iraqi informant in the first place .
A local TV news station had the information on Tuesday , the 4th , but held it at the request of federal officials until Thursday .
I ’d like to think that the federal officials wanted the story held until they could check it out , but with the sorry track record of this administration in manipulating terror threats for political advantage , who knows why the threat was held until after a string of bad political news came out last week ?
Bloomberg , in the middle of a reelection campaign , went with the information .
There are a number of ways to look at this .
First , it could be Al Qaeda toying with us once again , just to see how they can make us jump .
Second , what kind of credibility does military intelligence and the CIA have left after this , especially since the military had deemed this informant to be reliable ?
Third , props to Michael Chertoff ’s Department of Homeland Security folks and the FBI who never signed on to this from the start .
And do n’t all of these guys report to John Negroponte , when it comes to intelligence ?
And if so , what the hell has this major reorganization of our Intel efforts got us if we can still be had by a con man in Iraq ?
I guess we should ask Chalabi and " Curveball " that last question .
Update : Interesting .
The story has been pulled off CNN 's website now .
Update # 2 : Now CNN , as John says , has it back on their site .
Optimizing Page Load Time
It is widely accepted that fast - loading pages improve the user experience .
In recent years , many sites have started using AJAX techniques to reduce latency .
Rather than round - trip through the server retrieving a completely new page with every click , often the browser can either alter the layout of the page instantly or fetch a small amount of HTML , XML , or javascript from the server and alter the existing page .
In either case , this significantly decreases the amount of time between a user click and the browser finishing rendering the new content .
However , for many sites that reference dozens of external objects , the majority of the page load time is spent in separate HTTP requests for images , javascript , and stylesheets .
AJAX probably could help , but speeding up or eliminating these separate HTTP requests might help more , yet there is n't a common body of knowledge about how to do so .
While working on optimizing page load times for a high - profile AJAX application , I had a chance to investigate how much I could reduce latency due to external objects .
Specifically , I looked into how the HTTP client implementation in common browsers and characteristics of common Internet connections affect page load time for pages with many small objects .
I found a few things to be interesting :
IE , Firefox , and Safari ship with HTTP pipelining disabled by default ; Opera is the only browser I know of that enables it .
No pipelining means each request has to be answered and its connection freed up before the next request can be sent .
This incurs average extra latency of the round - trip ( ping ) time to the user divided by the number of connections allowed .
Or if your server has HTTP keepalives disabled , doing another TCP three - way handshake adds another round trip , doubling this latency .
By default , IE allows only two outstanding connections per hostname when talking to HTTP / 1.1 servers or eight - ish outstanding connections total .
Firefox has similar limits .
Using up to four hostnames instead of one will give you more connections .
( IP addresses do n't matter ; the hostnames can all point to the same IP . )
Most DSL or cable Internet connections have asymmetric bandwidth , at rates like 1.5 M bit down / 128 Kbit up , 6 M bit down / 512 Kbit up , etc. Ratios of download to upload bandwidth are commonly in the 5:1 to 20:1 range .
This means that for your users , a request takes the same amount of time to send as it takes to receive an object of 5 to 20 times the request size .
Requests are commonly around 500 bytes , so this should significantly impact objects that are smaller than maybe 2.5 k to 10 k .
This means that serving small objects might mean the page load is bottlenecked on the users ' upload bandwidth , as strange as that may sound .
Using these , I came up with a model to guesstimate the effective bandwidth of users of various flavors of network connections when loading various object sizes .
It assumes that each HTTP request is 500 bytes and that the HTTP reply includes 500 bytes of headers in addition to the object requested .
It is simplistic and only covers connection limits and asymmetric bandwidth , and does n't account for the TCP handshake of the first request of a persistent ( keepalive ) connection , which is amortized when requesting many objects from the same connection .
Note that this is best - case effective bandwidth and does n't include other limitations like TCP slow - start , packet loss , etc .
The results are interesting enough to suggest avenues of exploration but are no substitute for actually measuring the difference with real browsers .
To show the effect of keepalives and multiple hostnames , I simulated a user on net offering 1.5 M bit down / 384 K bit up who is 100 ms away with 0 % packet loss .
This roughly corresponds to medium - speed ADSL on the other side of the U.S. from your servers .
Shown here is the effective bandwidth while loading a page with many objects of a given size , with effective bandwidth defined as total object bytes received divided by the time to receive them :
Interesting things to note :
For objects of relatively small size ( the left - hand portion of the graph ) , you can see from the empty space above the plotted line how little of the user 's downstream bandwidth is being used , even though the browser is requesting objects as fast as it can .
This user has to be requesting objects larger than 100 k before he 's mostly filling his available downstream bandwidth .
For objects under roughly 8 k in size , you can double his effective bandwidth by turning keepalives on and spreading the requests over four hostnames .
This is a huge win .
If the user were to enable pipelining in his browser ( such as setting Firefox's network.http.pipelining in about : config ) , the number of hostnames we use would n't matter , and he'd make even more effective use of his available bandwidth .
But we can't control that server - side .
Perhaps more clearly , the following is a graph of how much faster pages could load for an assortment of common access speeds and latencies with many external objects spread over four hostnames and keepalives enabled .
Baseline ( 0 % ) is one hostname and keepalives disabled .
Interesting things from that graph :
If you load many objects smaller than 10 k , both local users and ones on the other side of the world could see substantial improvement from enabling keepalives and spreading requests over 4 hostnames .
There is a much greater improvement for users further away .
This will matter more as access speeds increase .
The user on 100 meg ethernet only 20 ms away from the server saw the biggest improvement .
One more thing I examined was the effect of request size on effective bandwidth .
The above graphs assumed 500 byte requests and 500 bytes of reply headers in addition to the object contents .
How does changing that affect performance of our 1.5 M bit down / 384 Kbit up and 100 ms away user , assuming we 're already using four hostnames and keepalives ?
This shows that at small object sizes , we 're bottlenecked on the upstream bandwidth .
The browser sending larger requests ( such as ones laden with lots of cookies ) seems to slow the requests down by 40 % worst - case for this user .
As I 've said , these graphs are based on a simulation and do n't account for a number of real - world factors .
But I 've unscientifically verified the results with real browsers on real net and believe them to be a useful gauge .
I 'd like to find the time and resources to reproduce these using real data collected from real browsers over a range of object sizes , access speeds , and latencies .
Measuring the effective bandwidth of your users
You can measure the effective bandwidth of your users on your site relatively easily , and if the effective bandwidth of users viewing your pages is substantially below their available downstream bandwidth , it might be worth attempting to improve this .
Before giving the browser any external object references ( < img src= " ... " > , < link rel=" stylesheet " href= " ... " > , < script src= " ... " > , etc ) , record the current time .
After the page load is done , subtract the time you began , and include that time in the URL of an image you reference off of your server .
Sample javascript implementing this :
< html > < head > < title >...</ title > < script type =" text / javascript " > <!-- var began_loading = ( new Date ( ) ) .getTime ( ) ; function done_loading ( ) { ( new Image ( ) ) .src = ' /timer.gif?u= ' + self.location + ' &t= ' + ( ( ( new Date ( ) ) .getTime ( ) - began_loading ) / 1000 ) ; } // --> </ script > <!--
Reference any external javascript or stylesheets after the above block .
// --> </head > < body onload= " done_loading ( ) " > <!--
Put your normal page content here .
// --> </body > </html >
10.1.2.3 - - [ 28/Oct/2006:13:47:45 -0700 ]
" GET /timer.gif?u=http://example.com/page.html&t=0.971 HTTP/1.1 " 200 49 ...
This will produce web log entries of the form :
in this case , showing that for this user , loading the rest of http://example.com/page.html took 0.971 seconds .
And if you know that the combined size of everything referenced from that page is 57842 bytes , 57842 bytes * 8 bits per byte / 0.971 seconds = 476556 bits per second effective bandwidth for that page load .
If this user should be getting 1.5 M bit downstream bandwidth , there is substantial room for improvement .
Tips to reduce your page load time
After you gather some page - load times and effective bandwidth for real users all over the world , you can experiment with changes that will improve those times .
Measure the difference and keep any that offer a substantial improvement .
Try some of the following :
Turn on HTTP keepalives for external objects .
Otherwise you add an extra round - trip to do another TCP three - way handshake and slow - start for every HTTP request .
If you are worried about hitting global server connection limits , set the keepalive timeout to something short , like 5 - 10 seconds .
Also look into serving your static content from a different webserver than your dynamic content .
Having thousands of connections open to a stripped down static file webserver can happen in like 10 megs of RAM total , whereas your main webserver might easily eat 10 megs of RAM per connection .
Load fewer external objects .
Due to request overhead , one bigger file just loads faster than two smaller ones half its size .
Figure out how to globally reference the same one or two javascript files and one or two external stylesheets instead of many ; if you have more , try preprocessing them when you publish them .
If your UI uses dozens of tiny GIFs all over the place , consider switching to a much cleaner CSS - based design which probably wo n't need so many images .
Or load all of your common UI images in one request using a technique called " CSS sprites " .
If your users regularly load a dozen or more uncached or uncacheable objects per page , consider evenly spreading those objects over four hostnames .
This usually means your users can have 4 x as many outstanding connections to you .
Without HTTP pipelining , this results in their average request latency dropping to about 1 / 4 of what it was before .
When you generate a page , evenly spreading your images over four hostnames is most easily done with a hash function , like MD5 .
Rather than having all < img > tags load objects from http://static.example.com/, create four hostnames ( e.g. static0.example.com , static1.example.com , static2.example.com , static3.example.com ) and use two bits from an MD5 of the image path to choose which of the four hosts you reference in the < img > tag .
Make sure all pages consistently reference the same hostname for the same image URL , or you 'll end up defeating caching .
Beware that each additional hostname adds the overhead of an extra DNS lookup and an extra TCP three - way handshake .
If your users have pipelining enabled or a given page loads fewer than around a dozen objects , they will see no benefit from the increased concurrency and the site may actually load more slowly .
The benefits only become apparent on pages with larger numbers of objects .
Be sure to measure the difference seen by your users if you implement this .
Possibly the best thing you can do to speed up pages for repeat visitors is to allow static images , stylesheets , and javascript to be unconditionally cached by the browser .
This wo n't help the first page load for a new user , but can substantially speed up subsequent ones .
Set an Expires header on everything you can , with a date days or even months into the future .
This tells the browser it is okay to not revalidate on every request , which can add latency of at least one round - trip per object per page load for no reason .
Instead of relying on the browser to revalidate its cache , if you change an object , change its URL .
One simple way to do this for static objects if you have staged pushes is to have the push process create a new directory named by the build number , and teach your site to always reference objects out of the current build 's base URL .
( Instead of < img src= " http://example.com/logo.gif " > you 'd use < img src= " http://example.com/build/1234/logo.gif " >.
When you do another build next week , all references change to < img src= " http://example.com/build/1235/logo.gif " >. )
This also nicely solves problems with browsers sometimes caching things longer than they should -- since the URL changed , they think it is a completely different object .
If you conditionally gzip HTML , javascript , or CSS , you probably want to add a " Cache - Control : private " if you set an Expires header .
This will prevent problems with caching by proxies that wo n't understand that your gzipped content can't be served to everyone .
( The Vary header was designed to do this more elegantly , but you can't use it because of IE brokenness . )
For anything where you always serve the exact same content when given the same URL ( e.g. static images ) , add " Cache - Control : public " to give proxies explicit permission to cache the result and serve it to different users .
If a caching proxy local to the user has the content , it is likely to have much less latency than you ; why not let it serve your static objects if it has them ?
Avoid the use of query params in image URLs , etc .
At least the Squid cache refuses to cache any URL containing a question mark by default .
I 've heard rumors that other things wo n't cache those URLs at all , but I do n't have more information .
On pages where your users are often sent the exact same content over and over , such as your home page or RSS feeds , implementing conditional GETs can substantially improve response time and save server load and bandwidth in cases where the page has n't changed .
When serving a static files ( including HTML ) off of disk , most webservers will generate Last - Modified and / or ETag reply headers for you and make use of the corresponding If - Modified - Since and / or If - None - Match mechanisms on requests .
But as soon as you add server - side includes , dynamic templating , or have code generating your content as it is served , you are usually on your own to implement these .
The idea is pretty simple :
When you generate a page , you give the browser a little extra information about exactly what was on the page you sent .
When the browser asks for the same page again , it gives you this information back .
If it matches what you were going to send , you know that the browser already has a copy and send a much smaller 304 ( Not Modified ) reply instead of the contents of the page again .
And if you are clever about what information you include in an ETag , you can usually skip the most expensive database queries that would 've gone into generating the page .
Minimize HTTP request size .
Often cookies are set domain - wide , which means they are also unnecessarily sent by the browser with every image request from within that domain .
What might 've been a 400 byte request for an image could easily turn into 1000 bytes or more once you add the cookie headers .
If you have a lot of uncached or uncacheable objects per page and big , domain - wide cookies , consider using a separate domain to host static content , and be sure to never set any cookies in it .
Minimize HTTP response size by enabling gzip compression for HTML and XML for browsers that support it .
For example , the 17 k document you are reading takes 90ms of the full downstream bandwidth of a user on 1.5 M bit DSL .
Or it will take 37ms when compressed to 6.8 k .
That 's 53 ms off of the full page load time for a simple change .
If your HTML is bigger and more redundant , you 'll see an even greater improvement .
If you are brave , you could also try to figure out which set of browsers will handle compressed Javascript properly .
( Hint : IE4 through IE6 asks for its javascript compressed , then breaks badly if you send it that way . )
Or look into Javascript obfuscators that strip out whitespace , comments , etc and usually get it down to 1/3 to 1/2 its original size .
Consider locating your small objects ( or a mirror or cache of them ) closer to your users in terms of network latency .
For larger sites with a global reach , either use a commercial Content Delivery Network , or add a colo within 50ms of 80 % of your users and use one of the many available methods for routing user requests to your colo nearest them .
Regularly use your site from a realistic net connection .
Convincing the web developers on my project to use a " slow proxy " that simulates bad DSL in New Zealand ( 768 K bit down , 128 Kbit up , 250 ms RTT , 1 % packet loss ) rather than the gig ethernet a few milliseconds from the servers in the U.S. was a huge win .
We found and fixed a number of usability and functional problems very quickly .
To implement the slow proxy , I used the netem and HTB kernel modules available in the Linux 2.6 kernel , both of which are set up with the tc command line tool .
These offer the most accurate simulation I could find , but are definitely not for the faint of heart .
I 've not used them , but supposedly Tamper Data for Firefox , Fiddler for Windows , and Charles for OSX can all rate - limit and are probably easier to set up , but they may not simulate latency properly .
Use Firebug for Firefox from a realistic net connection to see a graphical timeline of what it is doing during a page load .
This shows where Firefox has to wait for one HTTP request to complete before starting the next one and how page load time increases with each object loaded .
YSlow extends Firebug to offer tips on how to improve your site 's performance .
The Safari team offers a tip on a hidden feature in their browser that offers some timing data too .
Or if you are familiar with the HTTP protocol and TCP / IP at the packet level , you can watch what is going on using tcpdump , ngrep , or ethereal .
These tools are indispensable for all sorts of network debugging .
Try benchmarking common pages on your site from a local network with ab , which comes with the Apache webserver .
If your server is taking longer than 5 or 10 milliseconds to generate a page , you should make sure you have a good understanding of where it is spending its time .
If your latencies are high and your webserver process ( or CGI if you are using that ) is eating a lot of CPU during this test , it is often a result of using a scripting language that needs to recompile your scripts with every request .
Software like eAccelerator for PHP , mod_perl for perl , mod_python for python , etc can cache your scripts in a compiled state , dramatically speeding up your site .
Beyond that , look at finding a profiler for your language that can tell you where you are spending your CPU .
If you improve that , your pages will load faster and you 'll be able to handle more traffic with fewer machines .
If your site relies on doing a lot of database work or some other time - consuming task to generate the page , consider adding server - side caching of the slow operation .
Most people start with writing a cache to local memory or local disk , but that starts to fall down if you expand to more than a few web server machines .
Look into using memcached , which essentially creates an extremely fast shared cache that 's the combined size of the spare RAM you give it off of all of your machines .
It has clients available in most common languages .
( Optional ) Petition browser vendors to turn on HTTP pipelining by default on new browsers .
Doing so will remove some of the need for these tricks and make much of the web feel much faster for the average user .
( Firefox has this disabled supposedly because some proxies , some load balancers , and some versions of IIS choke on pipelined requests .
But Opera has found sufficient workarounds to enable pipelining by default .
Why can't other browsers do similarly ? )
The above list covers improving the speed of communication between browser and server and can be applied generally to many sites , regardless of what web server software they use or what language the code behind your site is written in .
There is , unfortunately , a lot that is n't covered .
While the tips above are intended to improve your page load times , a side benefit of many of them is a reduction in server bandwidth and CPU needed for the average page view .
Reducing your costs while improving your user experience seems it should be worth spending some time on .

This morning I blogged an article from the Guardian connecting the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko with the trade in poorly guarded nuclear materials from the former Soviet Union .
Given the half - life of Polonium , over the course of the day as the situation was dicussed further in the media , this scenario was beginning not to seem very plausible .
The New Scientist reports a different possible source of the lethal dose of Polonium , remarking that Polonium is usually made by bombarding the element Bismuth with neutrons :
To poison someone , polonium would most likely have been chemically combined in some type of dissolvable salt , for example polonium nitrate , experts told New Scientist .
In this form the material could easily have been added to his food and ingested .
Polonium is a radioactive element that is used industrially as an anti-static material .
It is difficult to get hold of and not used regularly by research scientists , but very small traces of it occur naturally .
The metal is usually made by bombarding the element bismuth with neutrons .
" To poison someone , large amounts of polonium - 210 are required and this would have to be manmade , perhaps from a particle accelerator or a nuclear reactor , " said Dudley Goodhead at the UK's MRC Radiation and Genome Stability Unit .
The online description of a 1972 article , Investigation of the purification of black bismuth from polonium , gives a little more detail :

Sounds like something not to try at home .
( For starters , where are you going to keep your particle accelerator ?
In the fridge ?
Next to the sushi , right ? )
Interestingly , the IAEA notes circa 2004 produced and recovered polonium by irradiating bismuth as a component of Iraq 's nuclear program .
The report does not give a time frame for this .
There have also been more recent reports that Iran is producing Polonium 210 at the Lavizan II military site .
AN ODD BUT IRRELEVANT DETAIL : Polonium apparently has a special significance for Creationists .
