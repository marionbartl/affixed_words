Sorry , Anti-Feminists : There ’s No Such Thing as Misandry August 30 , 2009
Posted by FCM in authors picks Tags : anti feminists
its a modern , made - up word that makes you look stupid .
and its misogynist as fuck .
so stop using it .
“ misandry ” is a word that doesnt represent any real thing , a kind of a placeholder in our consciousness for an experience that does not , and indeed cannot , exist .
so why have i been accused of perpetrating it about a million times in the last month ?
i have come to see the word “ misandry ” as a euphemism for feminism , and “ misandrist ” as a euphemism for feminist , rather than anything that actually exists in real life , to any troubling degree , or in any meaningful way .
while anti-feminists and misogynists bandy the terms about with glee , in reality , its just another flaccid jab at feminism , and feminists , by privileged men whose perverse denial of reality leads them to believe ( or pretend to believe ) that they are on the receiving end of institutional sexism as much as they benefit from it .
and that they suffer relational abuse just as frequently as they dish it out .
heres an excerpt from the very excellent analysis in ‘ adonis mirror ‘ :
While men have long enjoyed attacking ungrateful women as “ man haters , ” the epithet seems more than a little bit silly when transposed onto the printed page — something demanded by the burgeoning market for so - called Men ’s Studies materials .
It certainly lacks the gravitas required to reflect the widespread injury and social disadvantages that many white males believe they endure on a daily basis .
Thus a more scientific - sounding term was needed for “ the hatred of men ” and antifeminists crafted one out of their own perverted imagination of antiquity : misandry .
( link ) .
as the author notes , only an anti-feminist would think to define misogyny ’s ‘ opposite ’ as the hatred of men : more reasonably , woman - hating would be opposed to woman - loving , would it not ?
but leave it to a misogynist to define all things in relation to mens experience : they wouldnt think to define anything without evoking a male image , and considering ( even imagining , with no basis in reality ) not whether but how that “ thing ” would affect men .
and whether misandry even exists is entirely beside the point , isnt it ?
in fact , whether an inversion of the word “ misogyny ” was even necessary appears to be irrelevant .
its striking that power - grabbing and reclaiming behaviors are triggered whenever privilege is challenged , and that the power - grabbing often takes the form specifically of creating made - up words .
privileged males have historically held power over the rest of us through language , including of course the written word and literacy , but also the making of language itself .
they have historically chosen how certain issues are framed , by the way they are referred to , by words .
referring to sexual intercourse as the man “ penetrating ” instead of the woman “ enveloping ” for example .
more broadly , those who have traditionally benefitted from social and political privilege coined the new , made - up term “ politically correct ” to undermine and denigrate those doing the questioning .
the intellectual dishonesty is dizzying , truly .
theres a lot of great reading in the adonis mirror article , but the thing it does exceptionally well is to put the word “ misandry ” and those who use it in their proper historical and social context .
whats revealed is that its a very recent invention , and an entirely gratuitous and unnatural inversion of an existing term that really has no corresponding “ opposite ” used to evoke a decidedly modern sense of , literally , terror .
heres another excerpt :
As words , misandry and homicide - bomber have everything in common .
Both are attempts to deliberately reframe an existing concept : neither makes any empirical sense without prior knowledge of “ misogyny ” and “ suicide - bomber ” as a reference point .
Both attempt to invert power structures through their rhetoric : women and developing nations are seen as cowardly oppressors who refuse to honorably fight , and lose , on an uneven footing .
Both are also tied to specific political groups : antifeminists and American conservatives .
Yet while one term is a laughing stock of the liberal community , misandry has been making significant headway .
see the discussion on newsvine here .
its an excellent , excellent piece that i plan to link to , every time the subject is broached .
which is pretty much every day , if you are a feminist , or a bitch .
when this word is used here or anywhere , i invite readers to put it in its correct context , and to identify the anti-feminist and misogynist agenda thats being pushed .
there are those who will push back with made - up bullshit when their privilege is questioned , and its our responsibility ( and my delight ) to push the fuck back .
( Mental Floss ) -- Students , we know you may not be all that ecstatic about seeing your teachers -- and the homework they assign -- as the school year starts up .
Pay attention in class , though ; you never know what hidden talents your teachers might have .
Just look at all of these famous former teachers :
After teaching and performing music , Gene Simmons is now starring in his own reality show , " Family Jewels . "
Gene Simmons :
The tongue - flicking bassist of Kiss taught sixth grade in Harlem before he became the world 's most famous bass - playing demon .
Simmons later revealed in interviews that his superiors canned him for replacing the works of Shakespeare with Spiderman comics , which he thought the students were more likely to actually read .
Alexander Graham Bell :
The telephone pioneer got his start teaching Visible Speech at the Boston School for Deaf Mutes .
He developed a bond with a student named Mabel Hubbard , and when she was 19 the two married .
Sting : Before he became a star with The Police , Sting taught English , music , and soccer at St. Catherine 's Convent School .
Sting later said of working at a convent school , " I was the only man on the faculty .
In fact , I was the only teacher not in a habit . "

Robert Frost : Like King , Frost worked as a teacher to supplement the income from his fledgling literary career .
Frost worked as both a farmer and teacher at the Pinkerton Academy in Derry , New Hampshire .
His students called him " the Hen Man " because the poet was afraid of chickens , and Frost allegedly had trouble remembering to milk the school 's cows on time .
Lyndon Johnson :
The future president got his start as a principal at the Mexican - American Welhausen School in Cotulla , Texas .
He later finished his teaching degree and landed gigs teaching public speaking at Pearsall High School in Pearsall Texas and Sam Houston High in Houston .
The debate team he coached at Sam Houston lost the Texas state championship by a single point ; Johnson supposedly had to vomit backstage before he could bring himself to congratulate the winners .
Art Garfunkel :
We can't speak for Paul Simon , but at least half of Simon and Garfunkel was really , really good at math .
Garfunkel nearly earned a doctorate in the subject and was teaching math at the Litchfield Preparatory School in Connecticut when " Bridge Over Troubled Water " soared to the top of the charts .
John Adams :
The second president of the United States spent a few years working as a schoolteacher in Worcester , Massachusetts .
Teaching did n't suit Adams , who thought his students were nothing more than a " large number of little runtlings , just capable of lisping A , B , C , and troubling the master . "
He eventually gave up the job to go to law school .
Mr. T : It was hard for Chicago students to be fools when it came to gym class in the mid-1970s .
You 'd pay attention if Mr. T told you to do jumping jacks , would n't you ?
Sylvester Stallone : Did you know you were watching a matchup of tough - guy teachers when Stallone and Mr. T battled in " Rocky III ? "
When Sly was attending the American College in Switzerland during the 1960s , he worked as a gym teacher to earn extra spending money .

J.K. Rowling : The Harry Potter author worked as an English teacher in Portugal as she plotted out the early adventures of her young wizards .
Andy Griffith : Before he was a sheriff , before he was Matlock , Andy Griffith was a teacher .
After graduating from the University of North Carolina , Griffith taught English at Goldsboro High School .
Billy Crystal :
The comedian worked as a junior high substitute teacher on Long Island while he waited for his career to take off .
Among the classes he subbed for : girls ' gym , which must have been a great source of material .
Kris Kristofferson :
The country star was a Rhodes Scholar who studied literature at Oxford before joining the Army and rising to the rank of captain .
Towards the end of his tour of duty , Kristofferson took a job as an English teacher at West Point , but he decided against the professorship at the last minute .
Instead of heading to New York , he resigned his commission and moved to Nashville in 1965 .
Stephen King :
Although he initially had to work in an industrial laundry after his college graduation , the horror master eventually found a teaching job that paid a cool $ 6400 a year at the Hampden Academy in Hampden , Maine .
King wrote " Salem 's Lot " while living in a trailer and working this job during the day .
Mental Floss : Mojave Desert 's airplane graveyard
Sir William Golding :
The author 's experiences as a teacher helped inform the novel that made his career .
He once allowed a class of boys to debate with complete freedom , and the classroom quickly devolved into such disorder that it inspired Golding to write " Lord of the Flies . "

Making your own Star Trek uniform is a great way to get the authentic style and the correct fit for a convention or party .
There are a number of sewing patterns on the market that can help you achieve the perfect look , whether you 're going for the era of the original series , The Next Generation , Deep Space Nine , or one of the shows or movies .
Most require a little sewing experience to work with the stretch fabrics , but you do n't have to be an expert for these patterns .
Star Trek Costume Patterns from the Original Series
The original Star Trek TV series featured the following uniform colors , so you 'll want to consider these options in choosing fabric for your costume :
Command and helm - lime green , which often looked yellow or gold on film
Science and medical personnel - blue
Operations , security , and engineering - red
Women 's Skant or Short Dress
In the original series , women crew members wore " skants " or short dresses .
These were very much inspired by the fashions of the late 1960s .
You can find a good , though somewhat challenging , skant pattern from Roddenberry Shop .
It fits sizes four through 20 and takes about three yards of fabric .
This pattern retails for about $ 20 .
According to reviews by people making this costume on the Star Trek Uniforms and Costumes message board , you may face some challenges with this pattern .
People who have made it have found that it 's best to go up one size larger than what the pattern sizing recommends .
They also note that an 18 - inch zipper is appropriate if you use a stretch fabric , but if you 're using velour or another thick , rigid fabric , you should stick with a 23 - inch zipper .
It 's also very important to add three or more inches to the bottom of the dress , since the pattern ends up being short even by 1960s standards .
Men 's Wrap Uniform
The wrap uniform was a standard men's look in the original series , and you can re-create this costume using a pattern from Roddenberry .
This pattern is quite a bit simpler than the skant , although you 'll still need to measure carefully to get an accurate fit .
This uniform pattern is available in sizes small through extra -extra large .
This pattern retails for about $ 20 .
There are n't any reviews of this specific pattern ; however , there are some things you can do to make the process go more smoothly .
Start by choosing stretch fabrics , which are more forgiving of discrepancies in fit .
This close - fitting garment needs to be snug to look authentic .
Make a mock - up using an inexpensive fabric with the same characteristics as the one you plan to use in your final design .
This will help you identify and fix problem areas .
Men 's Starfleet Officer Uniform Shirt
The traditional men's uniform shirt is an important staple for any Star Trek costume , and you can find a great pattern on Star Trek Memorabilia .
This uniform pattern is based on the original design used in the TV show , so it 's about as accurate as you can get .
It fits sizes small through extra -extra large and retails for about $ 20 .
Reviews of this pattern on Amazon.com state that it does not fit true to size .
It 's best to go up one size to ensure the finished product will have a comfortable fit .
However , the end result has an authentic , quality look .
Patterns for Costumes from The Next Generation
Star Trek :
The Next Generation also had specific uniform color combinations that indicated the character 's rank , so you may want to consider these options in choosing fabric for your costume :
Command - red
Engineering - gold
Science and medical - blue
Startfleet Jumpsuit Uniforms for Men and Women
When the series first began airing , both men and women wore one - piece jumpsuits .
These jumpsuits require some skill to construct , since they are n't quite as forgiving as a two - piece outfit .
At Roddenberry Shop , you can find a jumpsuit pattern for men as well as the women 's jumpsuit pattern both in sizes extra small through extra -extra large .
Each pattern retails for $ 20 .
There are n't any reviews of these patterns , but they will both require some sewing experience .
For best results :
Choose a thick fabric with two - way stretch , such as a ponte knit .
Measure carefully , and double - check the measurements of the pattern pieces to make sure they are correct .
You may want to allow extra length at the sleeves and cuffs , which you can adjust and hem as required later .
In addition , it 's always a good idea to make a mock - up of the uniform first before cutting into your more expensive fabric .
Starfleet Uniform Trousers
Later in the series , the show replaced the uncomfortable jumpsuits with two - piece uniforms .
These featured separate pants and jackets for both men and women .
If you 're interested in re-creating this look , you can use your own black pants or make a pair using this unisex Starfleet uniform trousers pattern from Roddenberry .
This pattern fits sizes extra small through extra -extra large and retails for about $ 15 .
Although there are no reviews of this pattern , you 'll likely have better luck if you choose a thick fabric and make a mock - up of the final design .
Pants are one of the trickiest clothing items to sew , since they are less forgiving of problems in fit .
The stretch fabric should help a lot with this issue , and you may also want to make the pants slightly longer than the pattern suggests .
This will give you flexibility with the inseam so that they will fit a person of any height .
Next Generation Uniform Jackets
Xscape Props has a men's Starfleet uniform jacket pattern that is based on the original wardrobe of the show .
This quality pattern includes everything you need to make the men's jacket in sizes small through extra -extra large .
This pattern retails for about $ 20 .
Once again , there are not any reviews of this pattern , but it will be a tricky design for someone without sewing experience .
It really needs to fit perfectly in the shoulders to have the right effect .
Try this fitting process to get the look you have in mind :
For the best results , make a mock - up of the design using an inexpensive fabric .
Then turn the mock - up inside out and adjust the seams to give it the perfect fit .
Trim the seams and take the mock - up apart .
Use the pieces of the mock - up instead of your pattern to create the actual garment .
Next Generation Dresses and Skants
Although the women of Next Generation often wore jumpsuits and pants , they also donned skants and longer dresses from time to time .
Roddenberry Shop has patterns for a counselor 's dress uniform .
It fits sizes extra small through extra -extra large .
Both patterns retail for $ 20 .
Hello Cosplay offers the skant pattern in sizes extra-small to extra-large .
You can also choose to have it custom made , and it retails for around $ 50.00
According to reviews on the Starfleet 1701st Star Trek Uniform Club message board , there are some problems with the counselor dress pattern where the skirts meet the bodice .
You 'll need to take in the bodice waist for an appropriate fit .
The entire pattern also tends to run big , so double - check your measurements against the pattern pieces .
Patterns for Costumes from Deep Space Nine and Voyager
Deep Space
Nine ushered in a new uniform style featuring an open - necked jumpsuit .
Voyager used the same uniform style .
Deep Space Nine and Voyager Women 's Jumpsuits
You can purchase a Deep Space Nine Jumpsuit pattern from XScape Props .
It retails for around $ 25 .
There are n't any reviews specific to this pattern , but the women 's jumpsuit from Deep Space Nine and Voyager is a bit simpler than the jumpsuits from Next Generation .
The open neck makes this style more forgiving to fit issues in the shoulders .
However , you 'll still want to measure carefully , especially where height is concerned .
Leaving a little extra fabric length on the cuffs and sleeves can help with potential fit issues as well .
Deep Space Nice and Voyager Men's Jumpsuits
Bad Wolf Costumes has a good pattern for the men's Deep Space Nine Jumpsuit .
It fits sizes small through extra large and retails for about $ 30 .
Perfect Costume from Any Era
A sewing pattern can help you create the perfect Star Trek costume from any era .
If you work carefully and take your time , you 'll end up with an outfit you 'll be proud to wear to any convention or costume party .
Dr. ElBaradei has long been reluctant to adopt a confrontational strategy with Iran , an approach he considers counterproductive .
Responding to calls for the report ’s release , he has raised doubts about its completeness and reliability .
Last month , the agency issued an unusual statement cautioning it “ has no concrete proof ” that Iran ever sought to make nuclear arms , much less to perfect a warhead .
On Saturday in India , Dr. ElBaradei was quoted as saying that “ a major question ” about the authenticity of the evidence kept his agency from “ making any judgment at all ” on whether Iran had ever sought to design a nuclear warhead .
Even so , the emerging sense in the intelligence world that Iran has solved the major nuclear design problems poses a new diplomatic challenge for President Obama and his allies as they confront Iran .
American officials say that in the direct negotiations with Iran that began last week , it will be vital to get the country to open all of its suspected sites to international inspectors .
That is a long list , topped by the underground nuclear enrichment center under construction near Qum , that was revealed 10 days ago .
Iran has acknowledged that the underground facility is intended as a nuclear enrichment center , but says the fuel it makes will be used solely to produce nuclear power and medical isotopes .
It was kept heavily protected , Iranian officials said , to ward off potential attacks .
Iran said last week that it would allow inspectors to visit the site this month .
In the past three years , amid mounting evidence of a possible military dimension to its nuclear program , Iran has denied the agency wide access to installations , documents and personnel .
In recent weeks , there have been leaks about the internal report , perhaps intended to press Dr. ElBaradei into releasing it .

Technology reporter , BBC News
Nasa has until 29 October to launch the Ares I -X A rocket designed to replace the aging space shuttle is set for its first test - flight , despite questions over the future of the programme .
The 100 m - long Ares I - X has a four - hour launch window for blast - off from Nasa 's Kennedy Space Center .
The two - minute flight will allow Nasa to test technology crucial for the development of the manned Ares I craft .
A high - profile report has cast doubt on the future of the Ares rocket , which is intended to enter service in 2015 .
The Augustine panel , which had been asked to review the US human spaceflight programme , published its report last Thursday just days before the scheduled launch .
Although the panel supported the Ares I - X test flight , it questioned the need to develop the Ares I rocket , part of the Constellation programme commissioned by the previous administration and intended to return the US to the Moon by 2020 .
[ We wanted ] to use as much existing technology as possible
Robert Ess , Ares I - X mission manager
In particular , the panel queried the cost and design of the craft as well as its development time .
" With time and sufficient funds , Nasa could develop , build and fly the Ares I successfully , " the report said , " the question is , should it ? "
The $ 450 m ( 300 m euros ; £ 275 m )
Ares I - X is what Nasa describes as a " pathfinder " vehicle .
" It is a chance for the agency to remind itself what it takes to build a vehicle , " explained Robert Ess , Ares I - X mission manager .
Nasa has not designed a new launch vehicle for more than three decades and has lost much of the expertise in the area , according to some critics .
" Ares I - X is all about information ; about gathering data , " Mr Ess told BBC News .
" We have a lot of computer models that we think show it all works .
We 're very confident we can do it but the proof is actually doing it for the first time . "
The Ares I - X is the longest , thinnest vehicle ever designed and built by the US space agency .
Its shape has been determined by the design of its solid rocket booster - itself a modified version of the units used to lift the shuttle into orbit .
" [ We wanted ] to use as much existing technology as possible , " said Mr Ess .
" Given that we have the space shuttle booster and given that it is 14 - and - a - half - feet in diameter , we did n't want to change that .
That architecture drives the length of it . "
The final Ares I design calls for the shuttle booster to be upgraded from four to five segments for the first stage of the rocket .
The Ares I - X , though , will fly with just four segments and an additional unit that merely simulates an extra portion of booster .
Engineers saw value in flying the more limited configuration to get engineering flight data as soon as possible rather than wait the extra year or two before a five - segment booster became available .
The I - X vehicle is 100 m ( 320 ft ) tall and has been designed to be as close as possible to the eventual Ares I rocket .
However , the top half of the launcher , like the fifth segment of the booster , is a dummy .
What would be an upper - stage , with a crew capsule and its emergency escape mechanism , are mock - ups made to the correct shape and weight .
" We have been building the simulators for over two years now .
It has been a very long and very intense process , " explained Jonathan Cruz , deputy project manager for the Ares I - X crew module and launch abort system .
" [ They ] are incredibly accurate .
One reason why it has been so difficult and taken so long to build this is because we are building this to exact tolerances . "
Shaky design
The test launch - scheduled for Tuesday between 1200 and 1600 GMT ( 0800 and 1200 EDT ) - will take place from Kennedy Space Center in Florida .
If weather delays the flight , the team has a four - hour launch window each day until 29 October .
When given the go - ahead , the rocket will blast off from pad 39B , a space shuttle launch site that has been modified to handle the slender rocket .
" It has a little higher thrust - to - weight ratio than the space shuttle , so you 'll see it come off the pad a little quicker than you 're used to , " explained Mr Ess .
The flight will last for 120 seconds and will see the demonstrator climb to about 40 km ( 25 miles ) .
At that point , the lower and upper stages will separate .
" After the separation we basically do a kick manoeuvre , " Mr Ess told BBC News .
Motors will be used to make the lower - stage spin , creating drag and helping the booster slow down enough to allow it to deploy its parachutes so that it can be recovered .
" The front part of it just carries on going and splashes into the ocean . "
The vehicle has also been wired with sensors from top to bottom , allowing engineers to monitor all aspects of the flight , including pressures , accelerations and temperatures .
I look at it as a suicide launch vehicle
Charles Vick
Aerospace analyst
The team is particularly interested to see how such a slender and flexible vehicle behaves during flight .
" Our flight control team has spent a long time designing a flight control system that can handle it , " said Mr Ess .
" So being able to do a test flight and prove that a concept is going to work the way we think it is going to is a big one .
That is our primary objective . "
In addition , the team is keen to gather data on so - called " thrust oscillations " .
The solid rocket booster is known to shake towards the end of its burn , which might cause problems if the Ares ever becomes a manned space vehicle .
" Getting some actual data on that phenomenon during Ares I - X is going to help those designers know how much of an attenuation system they are going to need for Ares I , " said Mr Ess.
Crucial test
These oscillations are just one of the problems with Ares I and the I - X , highlighted by critics of the design .
" I look at it as a suicide launch vehicle , " said Charles Vick , an aerospace analyst , " I would not fly on that vehicle . "
He added : " The upper - stages and spacecraft are essentially alright but it's that first stage that bothers everybody - it 's entirely too tall , " he continued .
Mr Vick said there were a number of options that could replace Ares I and provide a safer vehicle .
These included designs using technology more heavily derived from the shuttle or the Saturn V rockets of the Apollo programme , he said .
Other technology or vehicles could be adapted from the Delta IV rockets currently used to loft satellites into orbit , he argued .
" The reality of it is that there are many other alternatives , " he claimed .
The Augustine panel has examined many of these different approaches , including a design dubbed Ares V Lite .
Under current plans ,
Ares I would be used to carry astronauts into orbit , whilst a heavy - lift Ares V rocket would loft hardware .
The Ares V Lite would be a smaller version of the freight carrier , capable of carrying astronauts .
Crucially , the design would use the solid rocket booster flown on the Ares I - X , meaning years of costly engineering and testing would not be wasted .
However , the decision on the future of the Ares I and the rest of the Constellation programme now rests with President Barack Obama who is expected to give a response in the coming weeks .
According to Mr Vick , the success , or otherwise , of the Ares I - X test flight could have a significant bearing on his decision and the future of the programme .
" I really think everybody is waiting to see what happens with this flight - a lot is dependent on that flight , " he said .

House Ethics Panel to expand its investigation into Charlie Rangel
As the House Ethics Panel continues to investigate Charlie Rangel ’s tax fraud they continue to expand their investigation .
It just keeps getting worse for Charlie Rangel as today the panel has unanimously voted to expand the investigation yet again .
This investigation has gone on for almost two years now and it is time for Charlie Rangel to step down from the House Ways and Means Committee , if not permanently than at least until the investigation has ended .
This man is in charge of the committee that writes the tax laws and he is under investigation for tax fraud .
How can this man still be the head of the House Ways and Means committee ?
When will the Democrats finally turn on him ?
Or will the continue to blindly support this hypocrite ?
John Boehner once again has summed up the situation perfectly :
Given the expanded investigation announced today , it is past time for Speaker Pelosi to insist that Chairman Rangel step aside until the ethics committee completes its work , ” Mr. Boehner said .
“ The American people wont stand for having a chairman of the Houses tax - writing committee who is under investigation for not paying his taxes .
What more has to happen before Speaker Pelosi does the right thing ?
I guess that I do n’t entirely blame Charlie Rangel for his decision to stay on as the head of the House Ways and Means committee , after all the Democrats appear perfectly willing to let him stay , but in the long run you would think that it would be better for the Democrats if Charlie Rangel were to step down .
Certainly the American people would be better off .
There is a huge double standard in Washington , we all know that , you do n’t need to look any further than the politicians who tell us that we have to sacrifice to stop global warming while they are flying around the world in private planes to see the double standard , and this is just another example of Washington ’s hypocrisy .
During the last two election cycles the Democrats ran against the culture of corruption in the Republican party , claiming that they would run the most ethical government in recent history .
But when you see people like Charlie Rangel and John Murtha both being investigated and you see the Democrats blindly stand behind them you begin to realize that the more things change the more they stay the same .
John Boehner is right , it is beyond time for Charlie Rangel to step down .
If he will not step down it becomes the Democrat ’s responsibility to remove him .
The American people deserve at least that much .
A senior British government source insisted , though , that Washington would lend its voice to the British - led protest in coming days .
" This will be raised at the G8 , " he said .
" The US are being helpful and we expect a bit more language in the days to come .
Our priority is to ensure that we get the release of this guy .
The fear is that he is being made a scapegoat . "
CALGARY -- A slice of Syncrude Canada Ltd. may soon be up for grabs , and the logical – and self - professed hungry – buyer is Canadian Oil Sands Trust , industry experts say .
ConocoPhillips Inc. , which in early October said it is looking to offload about $ 10 - billion in assets , Wednesday pinpointed its 9.03 % stake in Syncrude as potential property it may put on the block .
“ [ Syncrude ] is a good investment , but we think that there is plenty of interest , ” Jim Mulva , ConocoPhillips ’ chief executive , said during his company ’s third - quarter conference call .
Randy Ollenberger , a Calgary - based analyst at BMO Capital Markets , is among those betting Syncrude ’s largest stake holder will snap up ConocoPhillips ’ stake .
“ Canadian Oil Sands is the logical buyer , ” he said .
“ [ It ] could raise equity , plus take on additional debt , to acquire the stake . ”
ConocoPhillips ’ interest in the oil sands mining operation , based on Canadian Oil Sands ’ stock price , is worth about $ 3.6 - billion .
Phil Skolnick , an analyst at Genuity Capital Markets in Calgary , calculates Canadian Oil Sands , at its current share price , would have to issue about 100 million shares to get the deal done .
And it may have to tinker with its net debt targets should it seek loans .
Mike Tims , chair of Peters & Co. , a Calgary - based investment bank , believes that while sovereign wealth funds and other entities may angle for the stake , existing Syncrude partners make the most sense .
“ Canadian Oil Sands and Imperial [ Oil Ltd. ] would particularly leap out , ” he said .
Imperial Oil , however , may take a pass because it has its plate full with its new Kearl oil sands project .
Suncor Energy Inc. , which became a 12 % owner in the rival project when it absorbed Petro - Canada , also has a number of expensive opportunities among the assets it owns .
Imperial , controlled by Exxon Mobil Corp. through its 69.6 % stake in the Canadian outfit , owns 25 % of Syncrude and operates the project .
Imperial declined to comment , as did Canadian Oil Sands .
Canadian Oil Sands , which owns 36.74 % of Syncrude , has picked up stakes off former partners in the past .
It paid $ 475 - million for a 1.25 % interest from Talisman Energy Inc. in 2007 , and bought almost 14 % from EnCana Corp. through two deals in 2003 .
“ We have consolidated some interests in the past , and we would generally have an interest in new ones coming up , ” Marcel Coutu , Canadian Oil Sands ’ chief executive , told Bloomberg news two weeks ago .
State - owned oil companies from China and South Korea both have Canadian energy deals going through the regulatory process .
While it is clear these countries are prowling for opportunity , Mr. Tims thinks they may take a pass on the Syncrude stake .
“ I strongly suspect they will prefer assets where they can actually be in control , ” he said .
“ But there may be other kinds of more investment - oriented entities that would buy it purely on the economics – there are lots of sovereign wealth funds in the world . ”

This applies to the US as much as anyone , he said , adding that " there is no plan B " , and that agreement cannot be deferred beyond the UN - sponsored Copenhagen conference .
There are fears that Barack Obama does not have the political capital to reach a deal in Copenhagen and will instead use a visit to China next month to reach a bilateral deal that circumvents the UN .
Downing Street is also concerned that there is no agreement on how to finance a climate change package in developing countries .
The prime minister delivered his warning to a meeting of environment ministers brought together under the umbrella of the Major Economies Forum .
The 17 countries in the forum are responsible for 80 % of greenhouse gas emissions .
Brown told them : " In every era there are only one or two moments when nations come together and reach agreements that make history , because they change the course of history .
Copenhagen must be such a time .
There are now fewer than 50 days to set the course of the next 50 years and more .
" If we do not reach a deal at this time , let us be in no doubt : once the damage from unchecked emissions growth is done , no retrospective global agreement in some future period can undo that choice .
By then it will be irretrievably too late . "
Brown said that , according to estimates from the intergovernmental panel on climate change , an extra 1.8 bn people – a quarter of the world 's population – could be short of water by 2080 as a result of climate change .
And the threat was not confined to people in the developing world , Brown said .
" The extraordinary summer heatwave of 2003 in Europe resulted in over 35,000 extra deaths .
On current trends , such an event could become quite routine in Britain in just a few decades ' time , " he said .
" And within the lifetime of our children and grandchildren the intense temperatures of 2003 could become the average temperature experienced throughout much of Europe .
In Britain we face the prospect of more frequent droughts and a rising wave of floods . "
Brown said that he thought a deal at Copenhagen was possible .
But negotiators were " not getting to agreement quickly enough " , Brown went on , which was why he was appealing for leaders to get involved personally .
" We cannot compromise with the earth , we cannot compromise with the catastrophe of unchecked climate change , so we must compromise with one another , " he said .
" I urge my fellow leaders to work together to reach agreement amongst us , recognising both our common and our differentiated responsibilities – and the dire consequences of failure . "
Ed Miliband , the climate change secretary , yesterday highlighted signs of movement , pointing out that last month India said it was ready to set itself non-binding targets for cutting carbon emissions , while China said it would curb the growth of its emissions by a " notable margin " by 2020 , although it did not specify further .
The US special envoy for climate change , Todd Stern , said developing economies must boost their efforts to curb emissions , warning it was " certainly possible " that no deal would be agreed in Copenhagen .
" What we need to have happen is for China and India and Brazil and South Africa and others to be willing to take what they 're doing , boost it up some , and then be willing to put it into an international agreement , " he said .
Introduction
Today we are making a cool & simple login / registration system .
It will give you the ability to easily create a member - only area on your site and provide an easy registration process .
It is going to be PHP driven and store all the registrations into a MySQL database .
To add the needed flair , we are using the amazing sliding jQuery panel , developed by Web - kreation .
Note :
This tutorial is quite old and does n't work in PHP7 and above .
We are keeping it online only as a reference .
Step 1 - MySQL
First we have to create the table that will hold all the registrations .
This code is available in table.sql .
table.sql
-- --
Table structure for table `tz_members` -- CREATE TABLE `tz_members` ( `id` int ( 11 ) NOT NULL auto_increment , `usr` varchar ( 32 ) collate utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL default '' , `pass` varchar ( 32 ) collate utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL default '' , `email` varchar ( 255 ) collate utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL default '' , `regIP` varchar ( 15 ) collate utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL default '' , `dt` datetime NOT NULL default ' 0000-00-00 00:00:00 ' , PRIMARY KEY ( `id` ) , UNIQUE KEY `usr` ( `usr` ) ) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_unicode_ci ;
Notice that we 've defined the id as an integer with auto_increment - it is automatically assigned to every site member .
Also , we 've defined usr as an unique key - no two users with the same usernames are allowed .
We later use this in the registration to determine whether the username has been taken .
After you create the table , do not forget to fill in your database credentials in connect .
php so you can run the demo on your own server .
Step 2 - XHTML
First , we have to incorporate Web - kreation 's form into our page .
demo.php

</p> < h2 > A Big Thanks </ h2 > < p class = " grey " >
This tutorial was built on top of < a href = " http://web-kreation.com/index.php/tutorials/nice-clean-sliding-login-panel-built-with-jquery " title = " Go to site " > Web - Kreation < / a >'s amazing sliding panel .
</ p> </div > <? php if (!$ _SESSION [ 'id ' ] ) : //
If you are not logged in ?> < div class = " left " >
<!-- Login Form --> < form class=" clearfix " action= " " method= " post " >

If you are logged in ?> < div class = " left " >
< h1 > Members panel</h1 > < p >
You can put member - only data here </p> < a href=" registered.php " >
View a special member page </ a> < p >- or -</p> < a href= " ?logoff " > Log off </ a> </div > < div class = " left right " > </div > <? php endif ; //
Closing the IF - ELSE construct ?> </div> </div> <!-- /login --> <!--
The tab on top --> < div class = " tab " > < ul class = " login " > < li class = " left " >
</ li > < li> Hello <? php echo $ _SESSION [ 'usr ' ] ?
$ _SESSION [ 'usr ' ] : ' Guest ' ; ?>!</li> < li class = " sep " >| </ li > < li id =" toggle " > < a id =" open " class = " open " href= " # " ><? php echo $ _ SESSION [ 'id ' ] ?'

Close Panel </ a> </ li > < li class = " right " >
</li > </ul > </div > <!-- / top --> </div> <!-- panel -->
At several places in this code , there are some PHP operators that check whether $ _SESSION [ 'usr ' ] or $ _SESSION [ ' id ' ] are defined .
This is true only if the page visitor is logged in the site , which allows us to show specific content to site members .
We will cover it in detail in a moment .
After the form , we put the rest of the page .
< div class= " pageContent " > < div id =" main " > < div class=" container " > < h1 > A Cool Login System </h1 > < h2 > Easy registration management with PHP & jQuery </ h2 > </div> < div class=" container " > < p > This is a ...</p> < div class= " clear " ></div > </div > </div >
Nothing special here .
Lets continue with the PHP backend .
Step 3 - PHP
It is time to convert the form into a complete registration and login system .
To achieve it , we will need more than the usual amount of PHP .
I 'll divide the code into two parts .
If you plan to add more code , it would be a good idea to split it into several files which are included when needed .
This aids the development of large projects and allows code reuse in different parts of a site .
But lets see how we 've done it here .
demo.php
define ( ' INCLUDE_CHECK ', true ) ; require ' connect.php ' ; require ' functions.php ' ; //
Those two files can be included only if INCLUDE_CHECK is defined session_name ( 'tzLogin ' ) ; // Starting the session session_set_cookie_params(2*7*24*60*60 ) ; // Making the cookie live for 2 weeks session_start ( ) ; if ( $ _SESSION [ 'id ' ] && ! isset ( $_COOKIE [ 'tzRemember ' ] ) && !$ _SESSION [' rememberMe ' ] ) { //
If you are logged in , but you do n't have the tzRemember cookie ( browser restart ) // and you have not checked the rememberMe checkbox : $ _SESSION = array ( ) ; session_destroy ( ) ; // Destroy the session } if ( isset ( $_GET [ ' logoff ' ] ) ) { $ _SESSION = array ( ) ; session_destroy ( ) ; header ( " Location : demo.php " ) ; exit ; } if ($_POST [' submit ' ] ==' Login ' ) { //
Checking whether the Login form has been submitted $ err = array ( ) ; //
Will hold our errors if (!$ _POST ['username ' ] || !$ _POST [' password ' ] ) $ err [ ] =
' All the fields must be filled in !' ; if (!count ( $err ) ) { $ _POST ['username ' ] = mysql_real_escape_string($ _POST[' username ' ] ) ; $ _POST [' password ' ] = mysql_real_escape_string($ _POST [' password ' ] ) ; $ _POST [' rememberMe ' ] = ( int ) $ _POST [' rememberMe ' ] ; //
Escaping all input data $ row = mysql_fetch_assoc(mysql_query ( " SELECT id , usr FROM tz_members WHERE usr= '{$ _POST [' username ' ] } ' AND pass= '" .md5($ _POST [' password ' ] ) . " ' " ) ) ; if ( $row [ 'usr ' ] ) { //
If everything is OK login $ _SESSION [ 'usr ' ] =$ row [ 'usr ' ] ; $ _ SESSION [ 'id ' ] = $ row [ 'id ' ] ; $ _SESSION [' rememberMe ' ] = $ _POST [' rememberMe ' ] ; //
Store some data in the session setcookie( 'tzRemember ' , $ _POST [' rememberMe ' ] ) ; //
We create the tzRemember cookie } else $ err [ ] =' Wrong username and / or password !' ; } if ( $err ) $ _SESSION [ 'msg ' ] [ ' login - err ' ] = implode ( '< br />' , $err ) ; //
Save the error messages in the session header ( " Location : demo.php " ) ; exit ; }
Here the tzRemember cookie acts as a control whether we should log - off users that have not marked the " remember me " checkbox .
If the cookie is not present ( due to browser restart ) and the visitor has not checked the remember me option , we destroy the session .
The session itself is kept alive for two weeks ( as set by session_set_cookie_params ) .
Lets see the second part of demo. php .
else if ($ _POST [' submit ' ]==' Register ' ) { //
If the Register form has been submitted $ err = array ( ) ; if ( strlen ( $ _POST [ ' username ' ] ) < 4 || strlen ( $ _POST [ ' username ' ] ) > 32 ) { $ err [ ] =' Your username must be between 3 and 32 characters ! ' ; } if ( preg_match ( '/[ ^a-z0-9\-\_\. ]+/i', $ _POST ['username ' ] ) ) { $ err [ ] =' Your username contains invalid characters ! ' ; } if(!checkEmail($ _POST [ ' email ' ] ) ) { $ err [ ] =' Your email is not valid ! ' ; } if (!count ( $err ) ) { //
If there are no errors $ pass = substr ( md5 ( $_SERVER [ ' REMOTE_ADDR '].microtime ( ) .rand ( 1,100000 ) ) ,0,6 ) ; // Generate a random password $ _POST [ ' email ' ] = mysql_real_escape_string($ _POST [ ' email ' ] ) ; $ _POST ['username ' ] = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST[' username ' ] ) ; // Escape the input data mysql_query ( " INSERT INTO tz_members(usr , pass , email,regIP , dt ) VALUES ( '" .$ _POST ['username ' ] . " ' , '" .md5 ( $ pass ) . " ' , '" .$ _POST [ ' email ' ] . " ' , '" .$ _SERVER [' REMOTE_ADDR ' ]. " ' , NOW ( ) ) " ) ; if ( mysql_affected_rows ( $ link ) ==1 ) { send_mail ( ' [ email protected ] ' , $ _POST [ ' email ' ] , ' Registration System Demo - Your New Password ' , ' Your password is : '.$ pass ) ; $ _SESSION [ 'msg ' ] [ ' reg - success ' ]
=' We sent you an email with your new password ! ' ; } else $ err [ ]
=' This username is already taken !' ; } if ( count ( $err ) ) { $ _ SESSION [ 'msg ' ] [ ' reg - err ' ] = implode ( '< br />' , $err ) ; } header ( " Location : demo.php " ) ; exit ; } $ script = '' ; if ($_SESSION [ 'msg ' ] ) { //
The script below shows the sliding panel on page load $ script = ' < script type = " text / javascript " > $ ( function ( ) { $ ( " div#panel " ) . show ( ) ; $ ( " #toggle a " ) .toggle ( ) ; } ) ; </ script >' ; }
We store all the encountered errors in an $err array , which is later assigned to a $ _SESSION variable .
This allows it to be accessible after a browser redirect .
You may have noticed on some sites , that when you submit a form and later refresh the page , the data is sent all over again .
This could become problematic as it could lead to a double registrations and unnecessary server load .
We use the header function to prevent this , by redirecting the browser to the same page .
This starts a fresh view of the page , without the browser associating it with a form submit .
The result is that , on page refresh , no data is sent .
But as we use $ _SESSION to store all the encountered errors it is important that we unset these variables , once we show the errors to the user .
Otherwise they will be shown on every page view ( the highlighted lines on the XHTML part of the tutorial ) .
Also notice how we create an additional script ( lines 60 - 70 of the second part of the PHP code ) which shows the panel on page load , so that the messages are visible to the user .
Now lets take a look at the CSS .
Step 4 - CSS
The sliding panel comes with its own style sheet .
This means we are only left with creating the page styles .
demo.css
body , h1 , h2 , h3 , p, quote , small , form , input , ul , li , ol , label{ /*
The reset rules */ margin:0 px ; padding : 0 px ; } body { color : #555555 ; font - size : 13 px ; background : #eeeeee ; font - family : Arial , Helvetica , sans - serif ; width : 100 % ; } h1{ font - size : 28 px ; font - weight : bold ; font - family : " Trebuchet MS " , Arial , Helvetica , sans - serif ; letter - spacing : 1 px ; } h2{ font - family : " Arial Narrow " , Arial , Helvetica , sans - serif ; font - size : 10 px ; font - weight : normal ; letter - spacing : 1 px ; padding - left : 2 px ; text - transform : uppercase ; white - space : nowrap ; margin - top : 4 px ; color : #888888 ; } #main p{ padding - bottom : 8 px ; } .clear{ clear : both ; } #main{ width : 800 px ; /* Centering it in the middle of the page */ margin:60 px auto ; } .container{ margin - top:20 px ; background : #FFFFFF ; border : 1 px solid # E0E0E0 ; padding : 15 px ; /* Rounded corners */ - moz - border - radius :20 px ; - khtml - border - radius : 20 px ; - webkit - border - radius : 20 px ; border - radius : 20 px ; } .err{ color: red ; } .success { color :#00CC00 ; } a , a:visited { color : #00 BBFF ; text - decoration : none ; outline : none ; } a:hover { text - decoration : underline ; } .tutorial - info{ text - align : center ; padding : 10 px ; }
Step 5 - jQuery
The sliding panel comes with its own jQuery files .
demo.php
< script type =" text / javascript " src= "
http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3.2/jquery.min.js "></script> <!-- PNG FIX for IE6 --> <!--
http://24ways.org/2007/supersleight-transparent-png-in-ie6
--> <!--[ if lte IE 6 ] > < script type =" text / javascript " src=" login_panel/js/pngfix/supersleight-min.js "></script > <![ endif ] --> < script src=" login_panel/js/slide.js " type =" text / javascript " ></ script > <? php echo $ script ; ?>
First we include the jQuery library from Google 's CDN .
Later comes a special fix for IE6 PNG transparency issues and lastly the panel 's script is included .
At the bottom of the page is the $ script variable - it shows the panel on page load if needed .
With this our cool login system is complete !
Conclusion
Today we learned how to use a fantastic form component and turn it into a functional log in / registration system .
You are free to built upon this code and modify it any way you see fit .

Wireless technology is exploding as the hardware becomes cheaper and uses less power .
Chances are good that the upward trajectory will continue over the next few years , as companies are betting that smart devices and remote controls that use the short - range IEEE 802.15.4 protocol will find a place on the market .
Now , researchers have used one of the features that provides that protocol with robustness against noise in order to track the movements of people around a room they could n't otherwise see into .
IEEE 802.15.4 is a short - range wireless standard that allows simple , low bandwidth transmission .
Because it 's extremely low power and resistant to interference , it has been adopted by Zigbee - compatible smart grid devices , and there are companies hoping it will replace the infrared transmitters in remote controls .
Even though it operates in the same unlicensed frequency band as Bluetooth and some forms of WiFi , 802.15.4 avoids interference and crowding in part by sending its transmissions along multiple paths , ensuring that data can find its way around potential sources of interference .
This feature of 802.15.4 is what some researchers latched on to in order to probe a room that acted as a black box .
Their work has n't been through peer review , but it has been placed in the arXiv preprint system , where it was spotted by Technology Review .
The basic idea behind the work is the assumption that transmissions between any two IEEE 802.15.4 devices travel within an ellipse centered on a straight line between those points .
It 's not possible to know which path a given transmission took , as different paths will be subject to different interference conditions .
But it is possible to figure out when something along the paths changes position , because the signal strength of a subset of the paths will change as a result of the altered interference .
On its own , this sort of signal would have atrocious resolution .
But the authors suggest that positional information could be provided by a mesh of wireless nodes : each transmitter / receiver pair would provide a distinct slice across the room , and allow the position of the motion to be reconstructed in much the same way a CAT scan reconstructs three - dimensional information from a series of image slices through a sample .
Not surprisingly , this requires some fairly sophisticated math .
In short , the authors divide the room into a series of voxels ( volume pixels ) , figure out which transmitter / receiver pairs are likely to send signals through each , and then look for correlated variations among those pairs .
( For the curious , the authors rely on a technique called Tikhonov regularization to relate the movement to wireless signals , and a Kalman filter to track linear motion within the room . )
In theory , the end result of the math should be a map of which voxels appear to have something moving in them .
Not satisfied with theory , however , the authors went out and built an example , using an addition to a house that contained a single room that was roughly 20 feet square .
They arranged a 34 node IEEE 802.15.4 network around the periphery of the room , and programmed the hardware to transmit signals in a regular order , so that they could track the sources of signals .
The processing of the resulting data was done on a laptop .
The system was able to pick up a blob , about five foot in diameter , whenever a person was walking around the room .
It was possible to tweak some of the parameters to provide the algorithms with a reasonable tracking speed of a few feet per second ; otherwise , the error rates were quite high .
In a separate experiment , the researchers were able to identify the location of a person who was instructed to move around within a couple of feet of a single point on the floor .
Obviously , these are very much best - case scenarios : a square room , occupied by a single individual who moves at a regular pace .
Still , the authors suggest that there are some ways to improve the accuracy .
The authors suggest that a system of dedicated hardware that 's equipped with GPS and designed to provide better positional information could find uses in law enforcement , emergency services , or the military .
Each of those occupations present their personnel with situations where they have to enter a potentially unsafe room with no idea of what might be inside .
But the obvious worry is that , at least in dense urban settings , every room is becoming host to a mesh of wireless signals that might provide a well - equipped eavesdropper with significant information about their neighbors ' comings and goings .
Of course , they could probably get that same information by pressing their ears against the walls .
Plan to Audit Fed Gathers Support Across Spectrum
By Christopher J. Petherick
Lately , at a time of growing divisions , there is one issue , above all others , that is bringing liberals and conservatives together :
The plan to audit the privately owned and controlled central bank of the United States , the Federal Reserve .
A new report in Baltimore ’s daily Examiner highlights the bipartisan nature of Rep. Ron Paul ’s Audit the Fed bill ( H.R. 1207 ) .
“ The groundswell to audit the Fed has made strange bedfellows , with Republicans , Democrats , Independents , and Libertarians throwing their support behind H.R. 1207 , ” writes reporter Steve Cauley .
“ Democrat Eliot Spitzer , the former governor and attorney general of New York , recently called the Fed ‘ a ponzi scheme ’ on MSNBC . ”
Juxtapose that with House minority leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) , writes Cauley .
In a recent entry on his web site , Boehner blasted the Fed for its “ lack of transparency and accountability ” in regard to the federal dollars it has committed by the Fed and Treasury Department .
The money the central bank and the U.S. agency have handed out raise “ serious concerns ” and make the audit that much more critical .
Other prominent liberals and conservatives who support auditing the Fed include populist activist Ralph Nader , conservative actor Chuck Norris and Liber tarian talk show host Glenn Beck , to name but a few .
Paul ’s legislation is currently held up in the 71 - member House Committee on Financial Services .
But , every day , it gains new support ; it is up to 282 cosponsors now .
Paul characterizes this as the “ most important step ” in the evolution of his landmark measure .
“ Now more than ever , we need to know what the Fed has been doing in secret , ” Paul told Cauley .
“ I am pleased that all of my Republican colleagues in the House , as well as many Democrats , understand the need for this kind of transparency . ”
Now it is up to Paul , Boehner and others to keep pushing to make an audit of the Fed a reality .

( Issue # 34 , August 24 , 2009 )
In frank and candid terms , Raiders coach Tom Cable addressed on Monday the decision to yank quarterback JaMarcus Russell from Sunday ’s loss to the Jets for Bruce Gradkowski , per David White of the San Francisco Chronicle .
The basic problem ?
Failure of execution .
On the team ’s first play from scrimmage , Cable dialed up a deep ball .
And Cable said that , despite days of preparation , Russell did n’t get the offense lined up properly , he ignored the check - down option when the deep routes were covered , he took a sack , and he fumbled the ball .
“ You would n’t expect to have that kind of mental error on the first play of the game , ” Cable said .
Ouch .
Cable also called out Russell for his two interceptions .
As to the first one , Cable said “ [t ] here was n’t anybody there to throw the ball to . ”
Ouch again .
On the second , Russell seemed to blame receiver Todd Watkins for failing to catch a ball thrown behind him .
“ It ’s not up for the coach and the quarterback to debate this in the media , ” Cable said , “ but when you see it on film , it ’s pretty obvious that would have been a tough play for Superman . ”
And . . . ouch .
Russell ’s side of the story has not been told publicly ; he ’s scheduled to address the media on Thursday .
But it ’s clear that the Raiders are taking a new approach with the first overall pick in the 2007 draft .
If public humiliation generated by his head coach wo n’t force the light to finally come on , then it ’s fair to conclude that there ’s simply no switch .
“ That actually sounds more or less accurate , ” I said .
“ Of course it ’s accurate , ” he said .
“ Do n’t get me wrong : the guys from the lower third of the class who went to Wall Street had a lot of nice qualities .
Most of them were pleasant enough .
They made a good impression .
And now we realize that by the standards that came later , they were n’t really greedy .
They just wanted a nice house in Greenwich and maybe a sailboat .
A lot of them were from families that had always been on Wall Street , so they were accustomed to nice houses in Greenwich .
They did n’t feel the need to leverage the entire business so they could make the sort of money that easily supports the second oceangoing yacht . ”
“ So what happened ? ”
“ I told you what happened .
Smart guys started going to Wall Street . ”
“ Why ? ”
“ I thought you ’d never ask , ” he said , making a practiced gesture with his eyebrows that caused the bartender to get started mixing another martini .
“ Two things happened .
One is that the amount of money that could be made on Wall Street with hedge fund and private equity operations became just mind - blowing .
At the same time , college was getting so expensive that people from reasonably prosperous families were graduating with huge debts .
So even the smart guys went to Wall Street , maybe telling themselves that in a few years they ’d have so much money they could then become professors or legal - services lawyers or whatever they ’d wanted to be in the first place .
That ’s when you started reading stories about the percentage of the graduating class of Harvard College who planned to go into the financial industry or go to business school so they could then go into the financial industry .
That ’s when you started reading about these geniuses from M.I.T. and Caltech who instead of going to graduate school in physics went to Wall Street to calculate arbitrage odds . ”
“ But you still have n’t told me how that brought on the financial crisis . ”
“ Did you ever hear the word ‘ derivatives ’ ? ” he said .
“ Do you think our guys could have invented , say , credit default swaps ?
Give me a break !
They could n’t have done the math . ”
Image Credit ... Illustrations by Enid Noten
“ Why do I get the feeling that there ’s one more step in this scenario ? ” I said .
“ Because there is , ” he said .
“ When the smart guys started this business of securitizing things that did n’t even exist in the first place , who was running the firms they worked for ?
Our guys !
The lower third of the class !
Guys who did n’t have the foggiest notion of what a credit default swap was .
All our guys knew was that they were getting disgustingly rich , and they had gotten to like that .
All of that easy money had eaten away at their sense of enoughness . ”
“ So having smart guys there almost caused Wall Street to collapse . ”
“ You got it , ” he said .
“ It took you awhile , but you got it . ”
While digging through Usenet , I stumbled on these three unidentified tracks that pick apart three of the Beatles ’ original multitrack masters , isolating and highlighting pieces from “ She ’s Leaving Home , ” “ A Day in the Life , ” and “ Come Together . ”
It ’s an astounding , and very listenable , glimpse into their recording process .
Update : Removed the downloads , see update below .
Multitrack Analysis of She ’s Leaving Home
Multitrack Analysis of A Day In the Life
Multitrack Analysis of Come Together
Unfortunately , I do n’t have any information about the source .
In the “ Come Together ” one , they mention one of the narrators is named “ Steve . ”
Beyond that , I have n’t had any luck finding where they came from .
Can anyone identify them ?
I ’d love , love , love to hear more .
Update :
It ’s from a BBC Radio 6 program called The Record Producers , hosted by Richard Allinson and Steve Levine , that aired last month .
Unfortunately , the original BBC broadcast is no longer available on their site .
January 16 , 2012 : I was politely contacted by Steve Levine , creator of The Record Producers , who politely asked me to remove the sound clips .
The BBC was granted permission to broadcast the sensitive Beatles master recordings with strict limitations : they could license it for only seven days after broadcast , and with the condition that they actively prevent non-authorized sources from making them available .
Unfortunately , there does n’t seem to be any legal way to purchase or listen to these recordings , and likely wo n’t for some time .

Taylor over at cnet ’s Android Atlas has a few reliable sources who have been providing a steady stream of fresh Android intel .
Â
If you have n’t had a chance to visit the , we definitely recommend it .
Â
Today ’s crop of goodies include a pair of pics that show how the new Android Market refresh will look .
According to the tipster , this is how the market should look on the Motorol Sholes .
Â
For those new to Android , the Sholes handset is expected to be launched on Verizon with Android 2.0 as the OS . Â
As of right now , the two pics are how the Android Market will end up looking .
Â
No word on how old the images are or what has changed ( if anything ) since they were snapped .
Â
Notice the filters to free and paid apps on the main screen .
Â
No longer will users have to hit menu and then change the view in order to sort them by those two parameters .
Â
There ’s also a “ Just In ” radio button to select which presumably filters to show the latest apps added to the market .
We ’re a big fan of all the added color .
Â
The market now looks more in line with the rest of Android ’s apps and not so dullsville .
Â Â
The search icon looks like it will be at the top of all pages within the Android Market as it too gets moved out from under the menu button .
Â
Another feature to note is the listing of a few app titles under each category .
The photo below is of Elie Wiesel in the Buchenwald concentration camp .
He 's in the second row from the bottom , seventh from the left ( next to the wood support ) .
Holocaust survivor and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel criticized a Teabagger protester in Washington , DC this week who held up a sign showing dead bodies from the Dachau concentration camp stacked in a pile , and compared this to the Democrats ' health care reform plan .
Here are a few of the Teabaggers ' responses to Weisel ,
Rothschilds nothing !
Everyone knows that Obama is George Soros sock puppet .
Was n't Soros Jewish once upon a time ?
May the Schwartz be with you .
The jews need to clam up and accept the fact that they are in a Chritian country .
This hollowcost thing is totally overblown by the jewish .
Eli Wiesel should just go back to Indonesia .
I do n't see him condemnig the terrorist shooter at Fort Hood .
Elie is a whiner .
She should stop her whining .
You did n't not complane when the libs were calling Bush Hitler .
You know what ?
The fact is that at a time in history , The Rosthchild family controlled practically everything .
This is a fact .
Not anti semitic .
I resent the Jewish outrage at everything .
I am a tea partier .
obama is a Marxist and takes his orders from George Soros ... it is similar and these people need to get a life . ,
Why any Jew would support the Obama administation is a mystery anyway .
He is a Muslim sympathizer and the greatest threat to Israel ever to sit in the White House .
Wake up Jewish community .
Take off the blinders .
Rothschild sign ?
Well its factually true .
They were one of the primary families involved in founding the Federal Reserve and are still in it up to their necks .
Obama , Bush , and every president since Wilson have done as the Fed told them .
Since it a valid historical fact that this family was involved in creating and still has ownership of a substantial piece of the Federal Reserve ( but nobody seems to know how much ) , I guess its now Anti- Semitic to discuss anything a Jew does critically ?
This guy is a Hebrew Al Sharpton .
Elie , how did that whole Madoff thing work out for you ?
KABUL , Afghanistan — President Hamid Karzai bowed to international pressure on Tuesday and announced that Afghanistan would hold a runoff election on Nov. 7 .
The voting , which comes after weeks of mounting allegations of voter fraud , will pit Karzai against the second - place finisher and former foreign secretary , Abdullah Abdullah .
Flanked by the cream of the international diplomatic corps and a foreign dignitary or two , the Afghan president beamed as he hailed the decision as a victory for the democratic process .
“ We welcome the decision as legitimate , legal and according to the constitution , ” said Karzai .
“ It will strengthen the process of democratization .
It will be an historic period we are waiting to go through . ”
The decision the Afghan president was referring to was a rather grudging press release issued by the Independent Election Commission just minutes before Karzai ’s press conference .
“ The Independent Election Commission … has determined that his Excellency Hamid Karzai has received 49.67 percent of the total valid votes and is recognized as the leading candidate …
Although the IEC has some reservations regarding the decisions of the Electoral Complaints Commission … considering time constraints , the imminent arrival of winter and existence of problems in the country , announces that the second round of the elections will be held on 7th November of this year . ”
The Electoral Complaints Commission ( ECC ) yesterday ordered the IEC to disqualify some 1.3 million votes , which brought Karzai under the 50 - percent - plus - one threshold needed to avoid a runoff .
Up until the ECC decision , Karzai was claiming a first - round victory with some 55 percent of the vote .
According to the ECC report , Abdullah received 31 percent of the vote .
Standing shoulder - to - shoulder with the Afghan president were U.S. Senator John Kerry , U.N. Special Representative Kai Eide , and the ambassadors of the United States , the United Kingdom and France .
It was a ringing endorsement for a president who up until a few hours before the event was seen as intransigent and obstructionist in the face of overwhelming evidence that the victory he claimed had been the result of fraud .
He had staunchly resisted calls for a runoff , necessitating frantic international diplomacy by Kerry , among others .
“ [ The president ] has shown statesmanship by deciding to move forward , by embracing the constitution and the rule of law , ” said Kerry , warmly shaking hands with Karzai in front of the cameras .
“ [ This ] will allow the government to lead with legitimacy . ”
Kerry acknowledged that he had spent many hours with the Afghan president in recent days , and that the “ deliberations were lengthy and sometimes difficult . ”
But in the end , he said , “ the Afghan people have taken a significant step towards a better future . ”
Curiously absent from the speeches of the principals was any reference to the reason the election process has been so long and contentious : the massive fraud that the ECC determined had taken place throughout the country , particularly in the south .
Indeed , Karzai went out of his way to question those findings and to challenge the ECC , hinting at future retribution for those who questioned the first - round results .
“ The Afghan elections have been defamed , ” he said .
“ There were 1.3 million votes called ‘ suspicious , ’ most of which were in the south .
The people ’s votes are not blamed .
We must deeply investigate why the people ’s votes were disrespected .
But this is not the time for investigations .
This is the time for stability and national unity . ”
Karzai also refused to give up his claim to have won outright in the Aug. 20 elections .
His decision to hold a runoff was due entirely to his concern for the Afghan people , he said .
“ We will leave it to the Afghan people to decide who the winner was [ in the first round ] , ” he said .
“ Whether I was the winner or not , I prefer the interests of Afghanistan to my own personal interests . ”
Kai Eide expressed his pride in the U.N. ’s efforts during the election , which , he said , without a hint of irony , “ have led us to where we are today . ”
The U.N. in general , and Kai Eide in particular , have been the focus of a tremendous amount of controversy over the past weeks .
Eide ’s deputy , Peter Galbraith , publicly accused Eide of covering up fraud in the elections to benefit Karzai .
Galbraith was sacked by Eide in late September , and has been conducting a loud and bitter campaign against his former boss since his departure from Kabul .
Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai , the distant fourth - place runner - up in the elections , had few good words to say about the U.N. in his talk before the Atlantic Council in Washington , D.C. , on Oct. 15 .
“ No one is going to call [ the first election ] fair or legitimate , ” he said .
“ The United Nations dropped the ball and a group of Afghans stole the election .
Lessons to be learned in the future is that the United Nations cannot be trusted to conduct free and fair elections . ”
This is unfortunate , since the same bodies who oversaw the first round of elections will have to cobble together a second vote in just over two weeks .
Ballot papers have already been printed , and some preparations have been made .
Kerry emphasized several times during the press conference that the international community and ISAF stood ready to guarantee security .
But everyone skirted around the issue of fraud .
One election expert expressed serious doubt that the runoff would accomplish its unstated but widely understood purpose : to erase the stigma of illegitimacy that hung over Karzai after the first election .
“ It could well be even worse , ” he said , speaking on condition of anonymity .
“ There will be few or no international observers , the turnout will be miniscule , security could be terrible and , in the end , Karzai will win anyway . ”
There is little doubt of Karzai ’s eventual success , especially in the higher reaches of the diplomatic community .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told CNN just days ago that “ the likelihood of [ Karzai ] winning a second round is probably pretty high . ”
It remains to be seen how many Afghans will go to the polls on Nov. 7 .
Disaffection is rampant among voters , many of whom have observed the past two months of wrangling with something close to disgust .
“ The foreigners will decide everything anyway , ” said one young journalist , watching the panoply of dignitaries surrounding Karzai at Tuesday ’s press conference .
But there are some who see the runoff as the only way to redeem democracy in the eyes of ordinary Afghans .
“ I think a second round is good for democracy in my country , ” said Asar Hakimi , a young journalist in Kabul .
“ Power will be in the hands of the people , not warlords and ethnic leaders . ”
LOTRO Expansion To Change Mount System , Making A Difference
by Brian Bentley [ Wednesday , 7th of October 2009 - 07:53 PM ]
To me , the mount system in LOTRO has always felt a bit tacked on .
Your mount was an item , shoved into your bag , and once you started using it , you could do nothing else .
You had to get off your mount to do anything : talk to NPCs , toggle skills , go through doors , etc .
All this and more will change in the new expansion .
The mount system is being completely redesigned and changed from an item you use to a skill you have .
You 'll be able to use some items like food , potions , and your map home item .
Using limited skills while mounted is beneficial , though mounted combat is definitely out of scope for this change .
The features that are most striking to me are being able to speak to NPCs while mounted and being allowed to toggle skills .
It 's small , but extremely annoying to get on your horse , start riding and realize that you forgot to " track mines " in order to pick up a little ore on your trip .
You then have to get off , turn on the skill you want and re-mount .
The addition of mount names , emotes and health are nice touches .
All in all , this enhancement , along with the skirmish mode and a few others , have really begun to make this expansion shine for the $ 20 price tag .
Being a lifetime subscriber , that means I get all this , shared storage , more character slots and a mount for that same price .
Turbine is slowly winning me over with this expansion and now I 'm getting excited for the December release .
This is insane .
The guys at Conservapedia ( aka , “ the trustworthy encyclopedia ” ) have decided to retranslate the Bible in what they ’re calling the Conservative Bible Project , because “ liberal bias has become the single biggest distortion in modern Bible translations . ”
And you thought liberal bias was limited to the evil mainstream media .
Apparently the early Church fathers had their own problems , because the Conservapediacs are particularly intent on scrubbing the Bible of “ liberal ” passages they say were inserted into the original canon and therefore should n’t be considered sacred .
Passages like the story of the adulteress whom Jesus saved from being stoned with the famous line : “ Let he who is without sin cast the first stone . ”
Conservapedia complains that liberals have used this story to argue against the death penalty .
Plus , this Jesus character sounds like a radical moral relativist .
Also among the goals of the project : replace liberal words like “ labor ” with preferred conservative terms ; use concise language instead of “ liberal wordiness ” ; and –my favorite –“ explain the numerous economic parables with their full free - market meaning . ”
Jesus talks about economics more than any other secular subject in the Bible , so they ’ve got their work cut out for them .
I look forward to learning the free - market meaning of “ It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God . ”
( h/t Rod Dreher , who wonderfully skewers the effort as “ mak[ing ] sure the Lord does n’t go all wobbly on us . ” )
On the heels of the Apple TV 3.0 software update Thursday , Apple also updated iTunes to version 9.0.2 , bringing compatibility with the updated set top box and again nixing sync capabilities with the Palm Pre .
With the latest update , iTunes will be able to communicate with the new Apple TV 3.0 software update for both Windows and Mac users .
The new iTunes update also adds an option for a dark background for Grid View , and improves support for accessibility .
The 88.5 MB update is available via Software Update or direct from Apple .
It requires Mac OS X 10.4.11 or later , Windows Vista 64 , Windows XP SP 2 or later , and Windows 7 .
Continuing the back - and - forth battle between Palm and Apple , the latest update also reportedly disables the ability of the Pre to sync with iTunes , according to Precentral.net .
With the latest update , iTunes will allegedly launch when a Pre is connected to a computer via USB , but the handset does not show up as a device in the sidebar .
Apple and Palm have battled for months in a cat and mouse game , as Palm has updated its phones to trick iTunes into syncing music , and Apple has updated iTunes to disable it .
Both have released numerous updates since the Palm Pre was released this summer .
Palm believes that Apple 's prevention of non-sanctioned devices from communicating with its iTunes media software is unfair , and it appealed to the USB Implementers Forum in an effort to have the iPhone maker 's practices reversed .
But the USB - IF instead sided with Apple in September , noting that iTunes ' method of identifying Apple devices was within the consortium 's rules .
The USB -IF also reprimanded Palm for violating the group 's rules by improperly using Apple 's USB vendor ID to have iTunes recognize the Pre as an iPod .
So those of you not in Canada might not be aware of this , but there 's an event going on right now called A Dare to Remember .
Basically , people across the country are being sponsored ( dared , really , but with MONEY ) to do outrageous things , with the money going to help communities in Africa affected by AIDS .
Some librarian friends of ours have decided to make a huge ' I Love Librarians ' sign , and get all sorts of strangers to be photographed holding it .
Here 's me looking happy with the sign !
If you 'd like to put a few dollars towards the librarians ' campaign , please go here to help out !
I know you love some librarians , ain't no use hiding it ...
For the past few years I ’ve wanted to do what most programmers dream of doing : design my own programming language .
Do everything right what others have done wrong , find the perfect mix of Java , Python and Ruby .
It was going to have dynamic with optional static typing , a super flexible syntax and meta programming facilities that would make Ruby look like a toy .
However , the first decision you have to make when undertaking such a project was already problematic : what language am I going to implement this in , C ?
I do n’t C that well , and frankly , I do n’t really want to spend my time managing memory and chasing down pointers .
So my best bets are the JVM ( Java Virtual Machine ) and the CLR ( .NET ) .
I have to choose .
It ’s really a decision I do n’t want to make .
But how can I make two implementations ?
I do n’t have the resources to do that .
Another area I ’m interested is databases , specifically non-relational databases ( or NoSQL databases ) .
Many such systems start to appear : CouchDB , SimpleDB , Google ’s BigTable .
A few months ago , the people from FriendFeed described how they built such a system on top of MySQL .
A fascinating idea , I thought .
I decided to experiment with this idea and implement such a library in Python .
After a while , when I got more into Java I ported it to Java .
But I was not happy with it , I wanted to write a library that was language agnostic , that could be used from Java , Python , but also from PHP and Ruby .
For the past two years , me and my colleagues have been working on WebDSL , a domain - specific language for rapidly building web applications .
The application written in WebDSL is compiled to Java code and can then be deployed on any Java application server .
It ’s a cool project , but rather uninteresting for people who do not have access to Java hosting , as is the case for many amateur programmers , a group that I care about , because I was one of them for so long .
So , during the summer of last year I started to work on a Python Google AppEngine back - end for WebDSL , which generated Python code that worked with AppEngine , rather than Java code .
It tooks some effort , but I got it to work .
Cool !
WebDSL was now much more accessible to people , because you can use a free AppEngine account to host your applications !
Sadly , maintaining a separate Python back - end for WebDSL turned out to be a tedious job .
At the moment there are two people who spend much of their time making changes to the Java back - end of WebDSL , while I work on different things .
This means that in addition to my usual work , I also have to replicate all changes they make to the Java back - end to the Python back - end .
In practice this did n’t happen , which rapidly led the Python back - end to be out of date .
Similarly , the language that we use to implement WebDSL , Stratego / XT , can now also generate two languages : C and Java .
However , these back - ends also have to be maintained .
The parser that we use , SGLR , also has two implementations : C and Java , that also have to be maintained .
See the pattern ?
Certain types of applications , libraries and code generators are conceptually platform - independent , but since we typically choose one platform to implement them for / on , we exclude all potential users that use different platforms .
Ideally , we would abstract from software platforms such as Java , .NET , PHP , Ruby , Javascript or Objective - C.
Ideally , we ’d write code in only one language , and magically translate programs written in this language to any other software platform out there .
This is exactly what PIL attempts to do .
PIL stands for Platform Independent Language .
It ’s a language mainly intended to be used by DSL compilers to more easily maintain multiple platform back - ends , but can also be used as an implementation language for building portable libraries and ( parts of ) applications .
To kick this off , let ’s have a look at “ Hello world ! ” in PIL :
void main ( Array < String > args ) {
println ( “ Hello world ! ” ) ;
}
As you can see , PIL is a Java - style language and that ’s on purpose .
Java is a well - known language and PIL ’s syntax and semantics are based on Java .
We made some changes , however , to simplify and improve it here and there .
The PIL compiler can currently generate programs for three platforms : Java , Python and PHP 5 .
Soon , more languages will be added .
We plan to add at least C# and Objective - C , but also others such as Javascript .
But already you can write a library in PIL and generate a Java , Python and PHP implementation from it , which is pretty cool .
So let ’s assume you installed the PIL compiler and you use it on the “ Hello world ! ” program I just showed :
$ pilc - i hello.pil -d php-out — php
[ pilc | info ]
Now compiling : hello.pil
[ pilc | info ]
Done with hello.pil
If we look in the php - out directory now , we will see one file : main.
php :
<? php
require_once “ pil/builtin.php ” ;
function main ( $ args )
{
pil_println ( “ Hello world ! ” ) ;
}
?>
Now let ’s invoke it with the Java back - end :
$ pilc - i hello.pil -d java - out — java
[ pilc | info ]
Now compiling : hello.pil
[ pilc | info ]
Done with hello.pil
Now we end up with a java - out / application / Main. java file :
package application ;
public final class Main
{
public final static void main ( String [ ] args )
{
System.out.println
( “ Hello world ! ” ) ;
}
}
And last but not least for Python :
$ pilc - i hello.pil -d python - out — python
[ pilc | info ]
Now compiling : hello.pil
[ pilc | info ]
Done with hello.pil
and the result : python- out / main.py
import sys
import pil.builtin
import sets
import datetime
import time
def main ( args ) :
print str( “ Hello world ! ” )
Of course , this is just a trivial example , but it works on real - life applications as well .
I implemented a simple parser and interpreter for my dynamic programming language in PIL and both the Java and Python versions worked ( the compiler could not generate PHP code then ) .
Similarly I ported my FriendFeed - inspired layer on top of MySQL to PIL and got it to work with Java and Python as well .
For WebDSL there is an experimental PIL back - end that can generate code for any PIL - supported platform .
In practice , porting an code written in PIL to a new platform is a bit more work than simply changing the — java switch to — php .
Typically you also need a certain amount of platform APIs that are not built into the PIL base library of types .
You need IO functionality , or database access for instance .
To accomplish this you can use external classes .
Here is a sample Database , external class ( in the pil : : db namespace / package ) :
external class pil::db:: Database {
new ( String hostName , String username , String password , String database ) ;
pil ::db:: Connection getConnection ( ) ;
}
For each platform , e.g. PHP , Java , Python you now need to make an implementation of this class , typically wrapping an existing API on that platform .
I wo n’t go into the details here , but you can find more information and examples on the PIL website .
I ’m sure you ’re all excited right now and want to start playing with this immediately .
There is a simple tarball available that includes the PIL compiler running on Java ( 5 + ) .
It also includes a number of wrapper scripts that enable you to use the PIL compiler as if it were an interpreter .
The pil - java script , for instance , generates Java code for a given .pil file , compiles and then executes it .
Similar scripts are included for Python and PHP .
Do n’t get confused here .
The compiler needs Java to run , but can generate code in 3 different languages .
There is also a native C version of the PIL compiler , which is faster , but also a little bit more complicated to install .
The PIL compiler will also run on windows , but the wrapper scripts that are included will not ( unless you run them in cygwin ) , but the scripts are simple so this should not be an issue .
The PIL manual is under construction .
It is not nearly complete , but already contains a lot of useful information about the language .
For support you can join our IRC channel at irc.freenode .
net channel #pil , or e-mail me .
Of course , PIL also has a twitter account .
After refactoring our build system a little bit and improving the PHP back - end to use the __autoload feature , I am going to work on an Objective - C back - end .
Yes , we want to start generating iPhone applications .
Objective - C is a bit of a challenge because on the iPhone it does not support garbage collection , which PIL assumes as a feature of its target platforms .
But if I get it done , PIL and the DSLs we ’re going to build on top of it may be a viable alternative to the ugly Objective - C language you have to use now .
I ’ll keep you posted on that .
The leader of the BNP , Nick Griffin , found himself the victim of an extraordinary attack from his own supporters last night following his controversial appearance on the BBC's Question Time .
As a public postmortem into one of the most divisive broadcasts in the corporation 's history attempted to gauge its impact on the party 's fortunes , Lee Barnes , the BNP 's legal officer , accused Griffin of " failing to press the attack " during the televised debate , which was watched by a record 8 million people .
Others sympathetic to the BNP 's views expressed dismay at Griffin 's flustered attempts to appeal to the mainstream .
The BNP 's critics were quick to use the comments as proof of deep divisions within the party 's membership over how it should position itself with the electorate .
Griffin has claimed that he has dragged the party into the political mainstream .
But the resulting backlash from those on his own side suggests many are uncomfortable with the BNP 's attempts to cloak itself in more moderate terms .
Barnes complained on his personal website that Griffin " should have stood up to these whining , middle - class hypocrites that use the race card for self - enrichment – and thrown the truth right back into their fat , sanctimonious , hypocritical , self - serving faces " .
He accused his party 's leader of " failing to press the attack " on the " ethnic middle class " for " taking up the best jobs while still playing the bogus race card for every opportunity " .
And in a move that is likely to reinforce concerns that Griffin 's appearance will spark violence , Barnes used his personal website to suggest that " perhaps there needs to be a few ' white riots ' around the country a la the Brixton riots of the 1980s before the idiot white liberal middle class and their ethnic middle - class fellow travellers wake up " .
A spokesman for the anti-fascist organisation Searchlight said : " This strips away once and for all Nick Griffin 's pretence that the BNP is a non-violent organisation .
Lee Barnes is not just another BNP member , he is the organisation 's legal officer , and here he is talking about riots in the streets .
The BNP hoped the Question Time appearance would mark their entry to the political mainstream , but instead they have pushed themselves back to the violent , extremist political fringe where they belong . "
Labour MP Jon Cruddas said : " If this is the view expressed by Griffin 's legal officer , imagine the views among the hardcore BNP membership . "
Griffin's performance on Question Time , in which he was ambivalent about incendiary comments he had made in the past , admitted to links with the Ku Klux Klan , attacked Islam and appeared sweaty , smirking and evasive , has been widely derided in the media and by politicians from all the main parties .
But the party 's sympathisers are also joining the attack .
Negative comments from BNP supporters were posted on the party 's website yesterday , but many were quickly taken down .
One comment read : " Maybe some coaching could of been done so that Mr Griffin could of answered any questions articulately . "
And in far - right internet chatrooms , the mood last night was one of a missed opportunity .
In the Stormfront online forum , a BNP sympathiser said : " It was quite a bad performance by Griffin in comparison to his other TV appearances .
Though he managed to get one or two things over ( despite the constant interruptions and barracking ) that would appeal to the majority , he did seem overawed by the occasion and was not , for the most part , at his best . "
Another said : " It 's almost like Nick went on expecting a normal episode of Question Time , it was always going to be a hatchet job and he should have been fully prepared for questions relating to his past .
This lack of preparedness left him open to attack and flustered when asked to provide a reply . "
Another commented : " I 'm starting to think this appealing to the mainstream approach is the wrong direction .
I would rather have seen George Lincoln Rockwell [ founder of the American Nazi party ] on the panel , there would have been a riot . "
The emerging splits within the BNP 's core support over Griffin 's performance came amid claims that Question Time had acted as a recruiting agent for the far - right party .
A poll for the Daily Telegraph published yesterday suggested that 22 % of the electorate would " seriously consider " voting BNP , while the party claimed thousands had registered for information following Griffin 's appearance .
" By the end of the night 9,000 new people had signed up as registered potential members or on our mailing lists , " Simon Bennett , the BNP 's webmaster , declared .
" In the Euro elections , we gained 40,000 enquiries , but spent £ 500,000 to do so – on Question Time we spent peanuts but gained almost 25 % of the Euro election total in eight hours !
We had to upgrade our server capacity enormously , which allowed us to cope with extra traffic . "
The claims seemed to reinforce concerns expressed by the Welsh secretary , Peter Hain , who had opposed Griffin 's appearance on Question Time .
" The BBC has handed the BNP the gift of the century on a plate and now we see the consequences , " Hain said .
" I 'm very angry . "
The BNP – and indeed the entire far - right movement – is no stranger to infighting and claims of splits will be dismissed by its high command .
Griffin , a former key player in the National Front , assumed control over the party only after ousting its founder , John Tyndall .
Since then he has shored up his position , surrounding himself with a core of lieutenants and taking control of party finances .
This has led to concerns that Griffin has become too powerful .
Several senior BNP members quit after he overhauled the constitution to make his position as leader practically unassailable .
In far - right chat rooms yesterday many were asking whether the Question Time appearance was a watershed .
" Griffin carries too much baggage to act as spokesman for the BNP , " one said .
" I lost count of the number of times past quotes came back to haunt him . "

Down is the new up : Canadians suddenly like Stephen Harper , but for the wrong reasons .
Michael Ignatieff 's announcement on Monday that his Liberal party will not " actively seek to defeat " the Conservatives " by proposing their own confidence motions , " was an almost direct contradiction to his resounding cry in September that Harper 's " time is up " .
The Liberal threat to dismantle the Tory government is now effectively dead , and many Canadians could n't possibly care less .
We like Harper now .
Unfortunately , it will get us nowhere .
The biggest political story of October has n't been Ignatieff 's troubles or the widening poll gap between the Tories and Liberals , or even some Tory MPs slapping their names or their party logo on government ( read : taxpayer ) stimulus cheques .
Instead , it 's been Harper 's performance of the Beatles song With a Little Help From My Friends at a gala benefit at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa .
It sparked an immediate response and softened some of his harshest critics .
The media cooed , and Harper – formerly known for his wax - like public persona – became a YouTube hit .
Only days earlier , Harper had stood in a Tim Horton 's coffee shop and proudly told Canadians ( and the world , who had expected him to address the UN ) that the Tim Horton 's head office had returned to Canada .
With that came the reminder : " The United States is a great place to visit , but let 's face it , there is no place like our home and native land , there is no place like Canada . "
In a recent column for the Globe and Mail , John Ibbitson speculated on the chances of a Canadian election in the near future .
He concluded :
One way or another , the opposition parties will have to find some way to keep this government alive through the rest of the year or face the consequences at the polls .
Parliament will then recess until the end of January .
And with February comes the Olympics , and who wants an election during the Olympics ?
For 17 days , Canadians will become Americans – fiercely patriotic , waving the flag with abandon , cheering on our athletes and celebrating what everyone hopes will be a magnificent games that will make all Canadians proud to be Canadian .
It 's mostly true , except the part about becoming Americans .
We should be so lucky to have such a vibrant – although obviously at times overly vitriolic – public discourse .
While our neighbours to the south struggle with issues that strike at the heart of their national values , Canadians are talking coffee .
Why ?
Because with Barack Obama , anything seems like it might be possible .
With Harper , barely anything does .
Harper 's schmaltzy publicity stunts are only striking a chord because , thanks to the way his government has framed Canada 's current objectives , there 's nothing else that can .
" Our priority is the Canadian economy .
Nothing takes precedence over the economy , " said Harper 's representative , Dimitri Soudas , after the Tim Horton 's appearance .
Granted , Canada must recover now in order to spend money later , but focusing only on economic recovery limits discussion by omitting other topics .
It also frames discourse in such a way that future policy ideas – even important ones like those on climate change or healthcare – are discussed solely based on their current price tag , not their potential future benefit .
In other words , challenging the framework is political poison .
Any suggestion of future government spending that is n't in the form of a stimulus cheque seems immediately outrageous , and makes people like Ignatieff look crazy .
Conversely , it allows Harper to appear all the more in control , because essentially , there are no future plans .
And the more Harper appears to be in control , the more Canadians can relax .
Under Harper , there is no pressure on Canadians to make decisions about the future , apart from what we 'll wear to the Olympics .
We just get our money .
Under Ignatieff , with a more extensive outlook , all bets appear to be off – he is uncertainty personified .
Harper 's popularity might be on the rise , but it 's not because of his piano playing or aw - shucks coffee shop patriotism .
It 's because he allows us to be apathetic .
And the less we care , the better he 'll look .
Medical researchers in Philadelphia have conducted a study which indicates - according to their interpretation - that carrying a gun causes people to get shot more often .
" People should rethink their possession of guns , " say the medics .
“ This study helps resolve the long - standing debate about whether guns are protective or perilous , ” says University of Pennsylvania epidemiology prof Charles Branas .
The Penn announcement is headlined " Gun Possession [ is ] of questionable value in an Assault " , so it 's pretty clear which way he 's leaning .
The Penn researchers carried out their study by randomly selecting 677 people in Philadelphia who had been shot in " assaults " .
Apparently five people sustain gunshot wounds every day in the City of Brotherly Love , so there were plenty to choose from .
According to the profs , six per cent of the shooting victims were packing heat when they got plugged .
They compared that to a control sample of Philadelphians who had not been shot , and concluded that " people with a gun were 4.5 times more likely to be shot in an assault than those not possessing a gun " .
The research techniques used were the same as those previously used " to establish links between such things as smoking and lung cancer or drinking and car crashes " .
The message is : you smoke , you 'll get cancer ; you drive drunk , you 'll crash your car ; carry a gun , you 'll get shot .
There did n't seem to be any account taken of the fact that people with good reason to fear being shot - for instance drug dealers , secret agents etc - would be more likely to tool up than those with no such concerns .
The profs ' reasoning , however , would seem to be that if someone sticks you up in the street and you have n't got a gun , you 'll just hand over your valuables and so escape with a whole skin .
If you 've got a gat , however , you might try to draw it and so get shot .
Tactically , of course , it might be wiser to first hand over your wallet and then craftily backshoot the robber as he departed , but no matter .
" On average , guns did not protect those who possessed them from being shot in an assault , " conclude the study authors .
" Although successful defensive gun uses occur each year , the probability of success may be low for civilian gun users in urban areas .
Such users should reconsider their possession of guns or , at least , understand that regular possession necessitates careful safety countermeasures . "

Whisper it quietly .
Contrary to popular opinion , the west has won the war in Afghanistan .
How do I know this ?
Because Barack Obama says the aim of the war is to " disrupt , dismantle and defeat " al - Qaida in Afghanistan – a strategy endorsed by our very own Gordon Brown .
If that 's the case , then let me spell it out to the president and the prime minister : there are no Afghans in al - Qaida , and no al - Qaida in Afghanistan .
So why not declare victory and bring the troops home ?
That 's not just my humble view – that 's the view of one of the world 's leading counter - terrorism experts , Dr Marc Sageman , of the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia :
We 've won .
It was critical , after 9/11 , that we went into Afghanistan to destroy the terrorist training camps that the plotters had attended … and we 've done that : there are no camps left in Afghanistan , and all of the terror plots now come out of Pakistan .
Dr Sageman has impeccable credentials : a forensic psychiatrist , sociologist and scholar - in - residence with the New York police department , he served as a CIA case officer in Islamabad in the late 1980s , working closely with the Afghan mujahedin .
His most recent book , based on an analysis of more than 500 terrorist biographies , convincingly argues that Bin Laden and his ilk have ceased to function as an organisational or operational entity and that the " present threat has evolved from a structured group of al - Qaida masterminds , controlling vast resources and issuing commands , to a multitude of informal local groups trying to emulate their predecessors by conceiving and executing operations from the bottom up .
These ' homegrown ' wannabes form a scattered global network , a leaderless jihad . "
Earlier this month , in both oral and written testimony at a congressional hearing on the war , convened by Senator John Kerry 's foreign relations committee and sadly ignored by much of the mainstream media , Dr Sageman demolished many of the myths and claims that have infused , confused and distorted the debate over Afghanistan .
First , the claim that fighting a war in Afghanistan protects the streets of New York and London from terrorist attack .
The crux of Dr Sageman 's argument , and empirical research , is that , since 2002 , there has not been a single terrorist plot in the west that can be traced back to Afghanistan .
" The few that have any link to a transnational neo - jihadi terrorist group are linked to Pakistan , " he told me .
These include the 7/7 attacks and the more recent liquid bomb plot – in fact , as Gordon Brown himself conceded in December 2008 , three - quarters of the terrorist plots investigated by British authorities can be traced back to Pakistan – and not Afghanistan .
Second , the claim that a resurgent Taliban poses a threat to the west .
Dr Sageman is adamant that the prospect of " deeply divided " Taliban forces retaking Kabul and returning to power in Afghanistan is " not a sure thing " .
Nor would a Taliban return to power " mean an automatic new sanctuary for al - Qaida . "
The relationship between the two organisations , he says , " has always been strained … indeed , al - Qaida has so far not returned to Taliban controlled areas in Afghanistan . "
It is a view shared , incidentally , by a senior member of the Obama administration , the national security adviser , General James Jones , who told CNN that " the al - Qaida presence [ in Afghanistan ] is very diminished .
The maximum estimate is less than 100 operating in the country .
No bases .
No ability to launch attacks on either us or our allies . "
Third , the claim that Afghanistan will benefit from an Iraq - style " surge " of western troops .
This was Sageman 's testimony on Capitol Hill :
Let me answer that with an old Middle Eastern proverb .
' It 's me and my brother against my cousin .
But it 's me and my cousin against a foreigner . '
So if we send 40,000 Americans ... that will coalesce every local rivalry ; they will put their local rivalry aside to actually shoot the foreigners and then they 'll resume their own internecine fight ...
Sending troops with weapons just will unify everybody against those troops , unfortunately .
Dr Sageman is keen for policymakers in the west , who promote falsehoods and myths about Afghanistan while sitting " several thousand miles from the war zone " , to acknowledge the futility of escalation , instead of recognising the success in ridding Afghanistan of al - Qaida , as long ago as 2002 , and now switching the focus to Pakistan .
He has another useful ally in the White House , in the form of the vice - president Joe Biden , who has been pushing in recent weeks to divert resources from Afghanistan to Pakistan and reformulate the terrorism problem as " PakAf " , not " AfPak " .
But our own prime minister 's decision to send a further 500 troops to the killing fields of Helmand flies in the face of such thinking .
Dr Sageman is perplexed .
" The problem is in Pakistan , " he tells me .
" But that 's not where we are sending troops to .
We 're sending them to the nation next door . "
The question is : why ?
As the military and civilian deal tolls continue to rise inexorably , in a conflict that is about to eclipse Vietnam in its length , it is high time that our politicians , generals and spies wake up to the fact that we are fighting the wrong war , in the wrong country .

" I 'm asking for a quick invite , to drop you some loot , " said the voice message at 1 p.m .
" You were on my list ; I have to cross you off . "
It was Mikey Neumann , the Gearbox Software creative director .
Neumann , you might recall , promised three weeks ago to " play BLs with you and give you loot " if you preordered Borderlands and showed him proof .
I and somewhere north of 200 people took him up on the offer .
Thursday , Neumann found me - just a level 7 hunter out trying to retrieve some guy 's missing fake leg in Skag Gully - and proceeded to deliver on his commitment to all Borderlands day - one buyers , myself included .
Advertisement
" Here you go , dude , " said Neumann , who plays as a Level 50 Hunter - the maximum .
And suddenly the Pandoran 's Guns & Ammo fantasy came to life at my feet .
The DVL Pearl Sniper ( Level 28 ) ; an LB U Blast Wrath sniper rifle ( level 25 ) .
Plus a Ranger class mod that I can't use until I hit level 22 .
Right now I 'm wondering whether to sell or hoard them .
They do carry a serious price tag .
" Nah , do n't worry , " Neumann said when I shamefacedly asked if there was anything I could offer in return .
" I have so much stuff .
I 've got like $ 1.5 million in cash already .
It costs me $ 220,000 at the New U station when I respawn . "
Advertisement
As of 3 p.m. U.S. Central time ( the timezone for Gearbox 's Plano , Texas headquarters ) on Thursday , Neumann estimated he 'd logged 72 hours in Borderlands .
That would be more hours than have passed since Borderlands ' release on Tuesday .
Of course he'd been playing it pre-release , but still , it 's a lot of time spent on a game - especially since this week , like mine , is Neumann 's vacation .
" Thanks for your patience guys .
I need to stand up and do something for like 20 minutes so my ass does n't cave into my body , " he tweeted about 16 hours into Borderlands ' official first day .
Advertisement
" I 'm like Santa Claus , man , " he told me .
" A Truxican wrestler Santa Claus , " I added , referencing Borderlands ' title sequence , and the bus driver 's description of Mordecai 's look .
" What the fuck is a Truxican wrestler anyway ? "
Advertisement
" Oh , that , " Neumann said .
" Originally , the script had ‘ Mexican wrestler , ' but Randy [ Pitchford , the Gearbox CEO ] was like , ‘ This game takes place not on Earth , so why would he say , ‘ Mexican ' ?
Come up with something else . '
That 's what we got . "
Neumann and I set off on a very routine mission for him , barbecuing some Skags , the Pandoran dawgs with the venus - flytrap heads .
" I 've been through Skag Gully so much , " Neumann said .
Advertisement
Neumann went to work on a couple beasts , not noticing the spitter Skag nipping at him from behind .
I opened up with my incendiary submachine gun and proudly awaited a compliment .
" Ah , The Clipper ! " Neumann said , naming the gun I picked up from Nine Toes , the game 's first boss battle .
" Everyone remembers their first unique weapon ! "
Advertisement
And as we shot the breeze about Borderlands , the early reviews ( Gearbox is fired up ) , and DLC ( no specific details , on the record anyway , but stay tuned ) somehow I managed to complete two quests and level up twice .
" Oh , that 's a nice rifle , " Neumann said as I opened a weapons cache and found the GGN40 Sniper , one of the few new weapons I could use at my level .
It 's kind of gun that , in the reverent words of Insidious Tuna , " will light shit the fuck on fire . "
Advertisement
" Oh , you - you do n't want it ? "
I asked , deferring to the ranking player as usual .
But of course Neumann did n't want it .
Not when he has a weapon that regenerates ammo , plus a goddamn falcon than can take down seven foes at once .
He has n't completely outclassed everyone in his user - friendly trips through the wastes so far .
Neumann came across a day one user who had logged some serious time in Borderlands , to the point that the loot was almost moot .
Advertisement
" Somehow I ended up with this guy who was , like , a Level 30 Brick with like a level 3 lightning punch , " Neumann said .
" We were on a serious loot run and he'd go in to use it and there would be a cloud of electricity and shit flying everywhere - I was laughing so hard ... "
Despite the time he 's spent in game - and , of course , preceding it as the Gearbox team worked on Borderlands over the past two years - Neumann has not seen it all .
Borderlands boasts some three million different weapons , and while many are slight modifications , in color , appearance and / or attributes , of a basic configuration , some have completely eye - popping properties .
Advertisement
" God , so many weapons - there was one , a name weapon , I had no idea it was in this game , " Neumann said , " but it shoots out these mini- mushroom clouds , like a nuclear weapon . "
Neumann said there are about a dozen unique weapons named in the game that are named for Gearbox developers .
Just be careful what you do with them .
" One guy , he 'd gotten one of the legendary weapons , which are like orange in your storage deck , " Neumann said , " and he said , ‘ OK , I 'm gonna drop it , ' and the way he was standing , he tossed it off a cliff .
I was like , ‘ You did not just do that .
There 's no getting that back . ' "
Advertisement
Toward the end of our run , having thoroughly wiped out the Skag packs that had torn me asunder on my own , Mikey and I chatted at the entrance to Skag Gully .
" Hold on , " he said , turning to a vending machine , " Let me see what 's in here .
There 's probably a lot of stuff you can't afford . "
And he went to work , buying up a TRG - 30XC Impenetrable Tough Guy Shield and tossing it at my feet .
Although Neumann 's gambit seems - to me anyway - completely spontaneous , its effect is quite devious .
By dropping superweapons you can't use until you hit high levels , Neumann 's out there creating a tremendous incentive for you to play Borderlands more .
And there 's also the 10 Gamerscore " And They 'll Tell Two Friends " achievement , which you earn for playing with a Gearbox dev on Xbox 360 .
( The achievement is also viral ; anyone who earns it will give it to you if you drop into a multiplayer session with them ) .
Advertisement
" I went through about half my list , " Neumann said .
" And I was thinking , ‘ Where are these other guys ? '
Then I realized , ‘ They 're probably all in Europe , which does n't come out until tomorrow .
And they 're six , seven hours ahead ... "
But hey , Santa Claus works a 24 - hour day too , does n't he ?
The inquiry into alleged prisoner abuse was announced in August Seven former heads of the CIA have written to President Obama urging him to end the inquiry into allegations of abuse of suspects held by the agency .
The US Attorney General Eric Holder last month named a prosecutor to examine whether the CIA had gone beyond approved interrogation methods .
The letter to Mr Obama said the investigation would hamper intelligence operations .
The White House did not immediately respond .
The former CIA chiefs , who served Republican and Democratic Presidents , said the cases had already been investigated during the Bush administration and lawyers had declined to prosecute in all but one .
FORMER CIA DIRECTORS 1973 James Schlesinger 1987 - 91 William Webster 1993 - 95 James Woolsey 1995 - 96 John Deutsch 1997 - 04 George Tenet 2004 - 05 Porter Goss 2006 - 09 Michael Hayden
" This approach will seriously damage the willingness of intelligence officers to take risks to protect the country , " the letter read .
" In our judgment , such risk - taking is vital to success in the long and difficult fight against terrorists who continue to threaten us . "
President Obama has stated that he wants to look beyond the Bush administration , which human rights groups have accused of using torture to gain information from suspects in violation of US and international law .
' Duty to examine facts '
But President Obama has said the matter was in the hands of the Attorney General Eric Holder who decided in August to reopen the cases .
The attorney general 's spokesman Mark Miller said Mr Holder did not believe his investigation would affect CIA employees ' commitment to their work .
" The attorney general 's decision to order a preliminary review into this matter was made in line with his duty to examine the facts and to follow the law .
The current CIA director Leon Panetta is also against the inquiry " As he has made clear , the Department of Justice will not prosecute anyone who acted in good faith and within the scope of the legal guidance given by the Office of Legal Counsel regarding the interrogation of detainees , " Mr Miller said in a written statement .
The seven former CIA directors also warned that foreign governments could be hesitant to cooperate with the US if the inquiry continues .
" As a result of the zeal on the part of some to uncover every action taken in the post - 9/11 period , many countries may decide that they can no longer safely share intelligence or co-operate with us on future counter - terrorist operations .
They simply cannot rely on our promises of secrecy , " the letter said .
The current CIA Director Leon Panetta was not a signatory to the letter , but he opposed Mr Holder 's investigation .

Imaginative Play | vector poem
Do you remember this place ?
This is n’t a standard “ old fogey remembers classic game fondly ” post though .
Ultima IV ’s tremendous influence and importance aside , I think for players looking back on it from today , it now exemplifies a value that is quite rare in most modern games : encouragement of the player to engage by using their imagination .
What does this mean though ?
What does a game that fosters “ imaginative engagement ” look , sound and play like in 2009 ?
I feel this question is worth asking simply because the sort of engagement we might give players by embracing this lost art could be powerful , richly subjective and , in a word , personal .
Your mental image of a game ’s world or a character ’s voice might be different from mine [ 2 ] .
You invite the game into your own mind , to an extent , rather than being enveloped entirely by the imagination of the author .
In a word , you participate in a way that complements the actual interactivity .
The dominance of literal images in our culture notwithstanding , this value is actually far from alien to art / entertainment media : just remember what happens every time you read a book .
You have to call every person , place and event into being in your mind .
The experience depends entirely upon your engagement and interpretation – your brain is the minimum system requirement .
In fact , this value is n’t even alien to games of the electronic kind .
Interactive fiction is an established medium whose potential is reasonably well - explored , and whose overlap with written fiction is obvious .
Further down the continuum towards conventional videogames , we have games with primitive , but more importantly stylized or symbolic graphics .
The best of these still have an effect closer to that of a well - written novel than a film – they evoke images and ideas that are quite grand compared to the simple stuff of which they ’re made .
Low Fidelity
In the bad old days , hardware was so limited that games could n’t muster much for audiovisual feedback .
Creators had no choice but to stylize and abstract – to communicate as best they could within the limited fidelity of their format .
It ’s also true that compared to today , fewer games tried to create a sense of a fiction or world .
Games like Tetris still hold up today largely on the strength of their rules , their integrity as formal systems , and for such games the clarity and aesthetic attractiveness of these abstractions were all that mattered .
Early computer role playing games had quite a different lineage , extending most directly from pen and paper RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons .
Games like Temple of Apshai , which augmented its modest 8 - bit graphics with a manual full of written descriptions of each room in its dungeons , are the missing link between D&D and later RPGs like Ultima IV onward .
Even with more arcadey games , it ’s clear that box art of the era played a big part in providing a starting point for imaginative engagement – check out all the crazy stuff on the cover painting of Missile Command for the Atari 2600 :
You see only a basic semblance of this in - game , but its intent was to call into being a world richer than what was represented .
Creators of such games and their related artifacts were in effect building a bridge , from their own creative intent to that of their players – or , if you do n’t believe in “ player creativity ” , at least their willingness to engage creatively .
Of course , today technological oneupsmanship drives most of big budget game development towards ever - higher fidelity audiovisuals , in part because that ’s the easiest way to show off the power of new hardware .
The aesthetics of many modern games have in turn adapted to embrace this – as Epic ’s lead designer Cliff Bleszinski recently pointed out , there are lots of bald space marines with intricate , scuffed metal armor in games today because current graphics hardware is really good at that .
Are we really okay with this being the driving force of our medium , though ?
Clearly , the limitations that once forced creators to work with low fidelity and wield the power of suggestion have all but slipped away completely .
Paradoxically , in many art forms this kind of event is exactly the point at which some artists begin to explore how that limitation can be wielded intentionally , as a fruitful restraint , a challenge to inspiration , a means to broaden the scope of what is thought possible .
Sparse Matrices / the Art of “ Not Showing ”
To paraphrase some wisdom I ’ve heard from horror filmmakers , “ the monster in the audiences ’ heads is scarier than any monster you can put on screen . ”
Numerous technical problems with the animatronic shark during the filming of Jaws forced Steven Spielberg to adopt a cinematographic style that was more about implication , the menace of things offscreen or barely seen , or built up through the soundtrack .
It had quite an effect on viewers and revolutionized how films like it were made .
Audio can indeed be a powerful aid to this – it ’s spatial , subjective and suggestive where visuals fail to be .
The two older games that have best retained their ability to frighten and immerse me are Thief and System Shock 2 , and they do it largely because of their masterful audio , and in spite of their primitive graphics .
Whether you ’re hiding information to scare people , or paring it away to help someone paint a picture in their own heads , the mechanism is the same .
In mathematics and programming , there ’s something called a sparse matrix .
Unlike a normal array where every value is filled in with a number , like the 1:1 grid of pixels on the display you ’re reading this on , a sparse matrix is only filled in where there ’s a non-zero number .
It ’s a glancing blow of a metaphor , but I think human imagination and memory work kind of like this .
Whatever is n’t filled in becomes breathing room .
What we as creators do n’t show the player creates a space they can fill themselves and inhabit mentally in the larger context of what we do show .
Allow Players to Imagine
However , if you ’re a creator it takes some discipline to choose to not fill something in with marvelous detail , and some craft to know exactly when and when not to apply this principle for effect – as an intentional feat of simplification , rather than an omission .
Now that technology can do so many things for us , the default approach today has become “ spell everything out as explicitly as possible ” .
This is changing , however .
So the original question stands : what games would we make if we embraced this fully ?
In the last five to ten years , the idea of games with highly stylized visuals has gone from fringe to wide acceptance .
Beyond simply looking beautiful or distinctive , stylized / abstracted art plays on the visual side of our cognition and imagination .
Chapter 2 of Scott McCloud ’s “ Understanding Comics ” describes this as “ Amplification Through Simplification ” – that by removal of well - chosen details from a representation of something , an artist can clarify it , focus its intent , broaden or twist its meaning .
I do n’t think this is a purely visual phenomenon , though .
In games , we represent the world and its rules to players via interactions .
The sense we give players of its possibility space early on , through training and fiction , can create a space players will inhabit with their imagination .
Remember your first hour with Shadow of the Colossus , when you ’d only fought maybe one of the beasts ?
The sparse loneliness of world seems to continue forever .
What ’s out there ?
What are you trying to accomplish ?
What are the limits ?
Hours later , you ’ve mastered the world and know how it works ; you know what to expect .
You know what is n’t in the game … earlier possibilities have faded .
However , the mystery of the place stays with you .
If players participate imaginatively even for a short time , that ripples outward to enrich the rest of their experience .
That ’s another reason I used Ultima IV as an example to start with – the vastness of its world , combined with the simple art and feeling of freedom to explore , create a similar experience despite the radical difference in fidelity .
Other games have a story that stands out much more clearly from their gameplay dynamics .
Even in these , there can be vectors that lead us to imagine – stories that are driven by mystery invite us to speculate , to dream up alternate possibilities – who is the G - Man ?
What happened to Rapture ?
We invite more of the game into our creative consciousness – we imagine .
Even in games with completely traditional linear storytelling models , this is powerful stuff .
Conclusion
In the future I ’d like to see more games wield this power intentionally and explore what ’s possible with it .
I ’d like to see designers stylize or not show something by choice rather than , as Ultima IV did , as a technological compromise .
I want to make games that people want to invite into their imaginations .
If it sounds like I ’ve cast a wide net in searching for examples and potential directions , that ’s because there are so many avenues … which is very inspiring .
Steve Jobs once claimed that computers are “ a bicycle for the mind ” .
Videogames could be a bicycle for the imagination , if we have the will to broaden our medium in this direction .

To be clear , even the most imagination - friendly videogame is still rule - bounded in ways that truly freeform , imaginative play – think kids in a schoolyard playing cops and robbers – is not .
The value of the former would not be to replace the latter , but to populate what is currently the vast empty gulf between the two .
Mark Aoki is worried the cuts may affect his education
All public schools in Hawaii have been told to stay closed on Fridays , in an effort by the state to reduce costs .
The state 's education department has cut the school week to four days for the remainder of the academic year .
Parents are angry at the move , which shortens the school year by 17 days and forces many to find alternative child care arrangements .
The school system says it is the only way it can save the $ 468 m ( 287 m ) needed to close a state budget deficit .
Under the new measure , Hawaii - whose students already rank near the bottom of the American academic league table - will have the shortest school year of any US state .
Its pupils will receive 163 days of tuition a year , compared with 180 in most US school districts .
The cuts come at a time when US President Barack Obama , who himself went to school in Hawaii , has demanded schools remain open for longer as " the challenges of a new century demand more time in the classroom " .
Valerie Sonoda , president of the Hawaii State Parent Teacher Association , said she had received hundreds of calls and e-mails from parents concerned about the educational hours of their children .
" It 's just not enough time for the kids to learn , " she said .
Mark Aoki , a student at Roosevelt High School in Honolulu , admits to being torn .
" The 16 - year - old in me is pretty excited that I 'll be able to chill on those days , " he said .
" But overall within me , what I truly believe is that we 'll regret this . "
Hawaii is not the only state to have furloughed , or laid off , teachers but its cuts are the most far - reaching so far .
The measure , which affects 171,000 students , will remain in place for at least the next two years .

So how did this logo get past the Art / Creative Director and Marketing Team ?
Or are they all in the small blow job joke they put out into the media ?
Or am I just a perv .
Oh , well .
Thanks for the chuckles Old Navy .
Hopefully your “ modelquins ” wont be positioned in the same way .
Amidst waves and wildlife in the world ’s oceans , billions of pounds of Styrofoam , water bottles , fishing wire and other plastic products float in endless circles .
This bobbing pollution is more than just an eyesore or a choking hazard for birds .
According to a new study , plastic in the oceans can decompose in as little as a year , leaching chemical compounds into the water that may harm the health of animals and possibly even people .
“ Most people in the world believe that this plastic is indestructible for a very long time , ” said Katsuhiko Saido , a chemist at Nihon University in Chiba , Japan .
He spoke this week at a meeting of the American Chemical Society in Washington , D.C .
“ We are now concerned that plastic pollution is caused by invisible materials , ” Saido said through an interpreter .
“ This will have a great effect on marine life . ”
Patterns in ocean currents create conglomerations of swirling trash that have received a burst of attention recently .
The so - called Great Pacific Garbage Patch , for one , is a mound of waste , mostly plastic , that ’s about twice the size of Texas .
It lies some 1,000 miles off the west coast between California and Hawaii .
In Japan , Saido said , up to 150,000 tons of plastic wash on shore each year .
Much of it is Styrofoam , a type of polystyrene plastic .
In their lab , Saido and colleagues used a new chemical technique to simulate the decomposition of polystyrene plastic in the oceans at 30 degrees Celsius ( 86 Fahrenheit ) .
The process produced some potentially toxic chemicals , including bisphenol A ( BPA ) and PS oligomer .

“ Evan at 30 degrees Celsius , it decomposes , ” said Saido ’s colleague Yoichi Kodera , who also spoke at the conference .
“ In natural conditions , the tide comes in and sunlight heats the plastics , ” he said , which should only enhance degradation .
When the scientists analyzed samples of ocean water from the United States , Japan , India , Europe and elsewhere , they found traces of these and other plastic degradation byproducts , including styrene monomer ( SM ) , styrene dimer ( SD ) and styrene trimer ( ST ) — none of which are found normally in nature .
“ Dr. Saido ’s study means that marine plastic debris could be the dominant source of degradation products , such as styrenes and BPA in remote coasts and the open ocean , ” said Hideshige Takada , of the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology .
In urban areas , he said , there are other potential sources of these chemicals .
Previous experiments have shown that , when heated in the microwave or under other conditions , plastics leach BPA and other compouds , said John Meeker , an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan School of Public Health in Ann Arbor .
So , it ’s not surprising that the same thing might happen in the ocean .
Still , he added , scientists do n’t yet know how degradation of plastic in the oceans might affect the health of animals or people .
PS oligomer and BPA have both produced hormone - disrupting effects and reproductive problems at low levels in animals , but the possible effect on humans is still controversial .
“ At this point , we ’re likely to have more intense exposures in our own homes and daily lives than from ocean water , ” Meeker said .
“ If this type of thing could happen in landfills and rivers and places that are closer to our drinking water , there could be an issue of human exposure . ”

Caso Marrazzo :
quando il fatto privato
diventa di interesse pubblico
Bologna , 25 ottobre 2009
( avv. Antonello Tomanelli )
E’ bene precisarlo subito .
Quanto trapelato in queste ore sul governatore della Regione Lazio Piero Marrazzo , sorpreso a Roma agli inizi di luglio nell ’ abitazione di un transessuale , ritaglia una vicenda che non si può minimamente paragonare a quella che riguarda il presidente del Consiglio Silvio Berlusconi .
A differenza di quest ’ultimo , Marrazzo non ha mai portato prostitute nelle stanze del potere senza un minimo di controllo .
Marrazzo non ha mai disertato gli incontri ufficiali per intrattenersi con delle prostitute , adducendo problemi fisici .
Marrazzo non ha mai ricambiato i favori sessuali ricevuti candidando alle elezioni persone prive di ogni capacità rappresentativa .
Marrazzo non ha mai sottoscritto , o solo appoggiato , leggi che puniscono i clienti delle prostitute .
Marrazzo non ha mai pubblicamente propugnato i valori cattolici , né sponsorizzato giornate come il “ Family Day ” .
In altre parole , il comportamento del governatore della Regione Lazio non incide sul suo ruolo pubblico , perché non vi è alcuna contraddizione tra gli aspetti della sua vita privata emersi in queste ore e il modo di amministrare la regione Lazio o di presentarsi agli elettori .
In sintesi , l ’avere Marrazzo frequentato transessuali a pagamento costituisce il classico fatto privato , che la collettività non ha alcun interesse ad acquisire , e la cui divulgazione è , in punto di diritto , illegittima .
La conclusione si può trarre dall ’art .
6 , comma 2° , del codice di deontologia dei giornalisti , che è parte integrante del cosiddetto Codice della Privacy , secondo cui “ La sfera privata delle persone note o che esercitano funzioni pubbliche deve essere rispettata se le notizie o i dati non hanno alcun rilievo sul loro ruolo o sulla loro vita pubblica ” .
Ma , come è noto , quel fatto privato del governatore Marrazzo è stato ampiamente divulgato dai media , inducendolo ad autosospendersi dalla carica di governatore della regione .
Una lezione di stile a chi , a fronte di fatti indicativi di una personalità opposta a quella pubblicamente ostentata a fini elettorali , persevera nel conservare incarichi ben più delicati .
In ogni caso , la domanda che si impone è la seguente .
Vi è stata ai danni del governatore Marrazzo una violazione di massa del diritto alla riservatezza , peraltro particolarmente grave visto che qui ad essere diffusi sono stati dati sensibili , in quanto idonei a rivelare la sua vita sessuale ?
La sfortuna del governatore Marrazzo è stata quella di vedere associato un suo comportamento privato ad un’altra vicenda : quella di un gruppo di sottoufficiali dell ’ Arma dei Carabinieri , il corpo militare più prestigioso della Nazione , che ha messo in piedi un ’associazione per delinquere dedita alla commissione di gravissimi reati che vanno dall ’estorsione alla concussione , alla rapina aggravata , alla ricettazione , e nella cui rete il governatore del Lazio piuttosto ingenuamente è rimaschio invischiato .
E’ questo il vero fatto di interesse pubblico : che tra i collaudatissimi sottoufficiali dell ’ Arma dei Carabinieri vi siano autentici criminali che non si facevano scrupoli a ricattare il primo cittadino del Lazio .
Si badi bene : sottoufficiali , non carabinieri ausiliari o che pattugliano le strade di Roma .
E quando , venerdi sera , incominciò a trapelare la notizia di quattro carabinieri arrestati perché avevano estorto 20.000 Euro al governatore della Regione Lazio per non diffondere un video ritraente “ suoi momenti intimi ” , anche i sassi avevano capito che Marrazzo era stato sorpreso a consumare un rapporto sessuale “ non tradizionale ” .
Ed è questo il punto .
Il fatto privato di Marrazzo , ossia l’essere sorpreso a consumare un rapporto sessuale con un trans , viene attratto dal fatto principale , di indubbio interesse pubblico : un’associazione per delinquere all ’interno dell ’ Arma dei Carabinieri che ha estorto denaro al presidente della Regione Lazio .
Qui la divulgazione del fatto privato non è solo legittima , ma anche necessaria .
Ce lo fa capire l’art .
6 , comma 1° , del codice di deontologia dei giornalisti : “ La divulgazione di notizie di rilevante interesse pubblico o sociale non contrasta con il rispetto della sfera privata quando l'informazione , anche dettagliata , sia indispensabile in ragione dell ' originalità del fatto o della relativa descrizione dei modi particolari in cui è avvenuto , nonché della qualificazione dei protagonisti ” .
E’ il principio di essenzialità dell ’informazione .
Significa che dettagli della vita privata possono essere raccontati quando ciò risulti indispensabile per una miglior acquisizione della notizia da parte della collettività .
Il comportamento criminale di quei sottoufficiali ( ossia la notizia ) non avrebbe potuto essere compreso nascondendo che Marrazzo era stato sorpreso in compagnia di un transessuale , tanto da indurlo a sborsare una cifra esorbitante come prezzo del silenzio .
Tuttavia , va fatta una precisazione .
Un conto è la divulgazione del fatto privato ( la consumazione di quel singolo rapporto sessuale con il trans , che è alla base del ricatto ) per garantire una miglior acquisizione della notizia di interesse pubblico ( un’associazione per delinquere all ’ interno dell ’ Arma dei Carabinieri ) .
Diverso è raccontare fatti che testimoniano uno stile di vita permanente di Marrazzo , senza alcun necessario collegamento col fatto principale .
Ci si riferisce alle interviste , pubblicate da diversi organi di informazione , rese da alcuni transessuali che si prostituiscono per strada , e che pare si accapigliassero per andare con Marrazzo in quanto molto generoso .
Fatti senza alcun dubbio molto più imbarazzanti rispetto a quello che può essere l'isolato incontro con un transessuale a pagamento .
Qui si sono travalicati i limiti del diritto di cronaca .
Trattasi di fatti che non hanno alcuna attinenza col fatto principale ( l'associazione per delinquere che ricattava Marrazzo ) .
In quanto tali , conservano la loro natura privata e la loro divulgazione implica una evidente violazione della privacy .
The hypocrisy , critics say , lies in CNN ’s decision to woo Hispanic viewers with a prime - time documentary while still giving Mr. Dobbs a nightly forum .
Roberto Lovato , a founding member of Presente.org , a Latino advocacy group , said in a statement , “ We wo n’t allow the network to court us as viewers while , at the same time , they allow Dobbs to spread lies and misinformation about us each night . ”
Separately , Mr. Dobbs is also the target of a “ Drop Dobbs ” campaign by the progressive groups NDN , Media Matters for America , and others .
That effort started after Mr. Dobbs repeatedly raised questions about President Obama ’s birth certificate .
There is no indication that the campaigns are affecting CNN ’s revenue , but they are highlighting Mr. Dobbs ’s status as an outlier at the channel , which has sought to position itself as a middle ground of sorts in the fractious cable news arena .
Mr. Dobbs is known to be exploring an exit from CNN , and he is viewed as a potential hire for the Fox Business Network , an upstart channel owned by the News Corporation .
The Latino campaign ’s Web site , BastaDobbs.com , features a video compilation of past comments by the CNN anchor , including his claim in October 2006 that “ about a third of the prison population in this country is estimated to be illegal aliens . ”
He was apparently referring to federal prisoners , and he later acknowledged the claim was made multiple times in error .
As the timing of the prison comment indicates , there is nothing new about Mr. Dobbs ’s controversial stance toward immigration , and CNN executives have argued that his hourlong evening program hews more closely to a newscast .
A stitch in time saves nine .
I could n’t sew my way out of a bag , but it ’s true advice for bloggers as well — a little bit of work on an upgrade now saves a lot of work fixing something later .
Right now there is a worm making its way around old , unpatched versions of WordPress .
This particular worm , like many before it , is clever : it registers a user , uses a security bug ( fixed earlier in the year ) to allow evaluated code to be executed through the permalink structure , makes itself an admin , then uses JavaScript to hide itself when you look at users page , attempts to clean up after itself , then goes quiet so you never notice while it inserts hidden spam and malware into your old posts .
The tactics are new , but the strategy is not .
Where this particular worm messes up is in the “ clean up ” phase : it does n’t hide itself well and the blogger notices that all his links are broken , which causes him to dig deeper and notice the extent of the damage .
Where worms of old would do childish things like defacing your site , the new ones are silent and invisible , so you only notice them when they screw up ( as this one did ) or your site gets removed from Google for having spam and malware on it .
I ’m talking about this not to scare you , but to highlight that this is something that has happened before , and that will more than likely happen again .
A stitch in time saves nine .
Upgrading is a known quantity of work , and one that the WordPress community has tried its darndest to make as easy as possible with one - click upgrades .
Fixing a hacked blog , on the other hand , is quite hard .
Upgrading is taking your vitamins ; fixing a hack is open heart surgery .
( This is true of cost , as well . )
2.8.4 , the current version of WordPress , is immune to this worm .
( So was the release before this one . )
If you ’ve been thinking about upgrading but have n’t gotten around to it yet , now would be a really good time .
If you ’ve already upgraded your blogs , maybe check out the blogs of your friends or that you read and see if they need any help .
A stitch in time saves nine .
Whenever a worm makes the rounds , everyone becomes a security expert and peddles one of three types of advice : snake oil , Club solutions , or real solutions .
Snake oil you ’ll be able to spot right away because it ’s easy .
Hide the WordPress version , they say , and you ’ll be fine .
Uh , duh , the worm writers thought of that .
Where their 1.0 might have checked for version numbers , 2.0 just tests capabilities , version number be damned .
The second type of advice is Club solutions ; to illustrate , I ’ll quote from Mark Pilgrim ’s excellent essay on spam 7 years ago , before WordPress even existed :
The really interesting thing about these approaches , from a game theory perspective , is that they are all Club solutions , not Lojack solutions .
There are two basic approaches to protecting your car from theft :
The Club ( or The Shield , or a car alarm , or something similar ) , and Lojack .
The Club is n’t much protection against a thief who is determined to steal your car ( it ’s easy enough to drill the lock , or just cut the steering wheel and slide The Club off ) .
But it is effective protection against a thief who wants to steal a car ( not necessarily your car ) , because thieves are generally in a hurry and will go for the easiest target , the low - hanging fruit .
The Club works as long as not everyone has it , since if everyone had it , thieves would have an equally difficult time stealing any car , their choice will be based on other factors , and your car is back to being as vulnerable as anyone else ’s .
The Club does n’t deter theft , it only deflects it .
Club blog security solutions can be simple ( like an .htaccess file ) or incredibly complex ( like two - factor authentication ) , and they can work , especially for known exploits .
Club solutions can be useful , like using a strong or complex password for your login — no one would recommend against that .
( Another club solution is switching to less - used software on the assumption or more like the software ’s claim that it ’s perfect and more secure .
This is why BeOS is more secure than Linux , ahem . )
In the car world , if someone figured out how to teleport entire cars to chop shops , The Club would n’t be so useful anymore .
Luckily for manufacturers of The Club , this has n’t happened .
Online and in the software world , though , the equivalent happens almost daily .
There is only one real solution .
The only thing that I can promise will keep your blog secure today and in the future is upgrading .
WordPress is a community of hundreds of people that read the code every day , audit it , update it , and care enough about keeping your blog safe that we do things like release updates weeks apart from each other even though it makes us look bad , because updating is going to keep your blog safe from the bad guys .
I ’m not clairvoyant and I can’t predict what schemes spammers , hackers , crackers , and tricksters will come up with with in the future to harm your blog , but I do know for certain that as long as WordPress is around we ’ll do everything in our power to make sure the software is safe .
We ’ve already made upgrading core and plugins a one - click procedure .
If we find something broken , we ’ll release a fix .
Please upgrade , it ’s the only way we can help each other .

The Czech Republic is a country where everything seems to work , except for the political system .
I once lived here , but had n’t returned for eleven years .
Almost everything looks better than it did in 1998 , and almost everything looked better in 1998 than it did in 1989 , the year of the Velvet Revolution .
The Czech Republic joined the European Union in 2004 , culminating a remarkable transformation from one - party Communist rule to liberal democracy .
Yet despite all of this , the Czech Republic has been suspended these past few days in a bizarre political crisis .
The crisis concerns not only its ten million citizens , but quite possibly all five hundred million citizens of the European Union .
The Czech president , Václav Klaus , has threatened not to sign the Lisbon Treaty of the European Union .
From the outside , it may take some work to see the drama of this .
The Lisbon Treaty is something like an ersatz constitution for Europe .
It has to be ratified by all twenty - seven member states of the EU , and as I write all except the Czech Republic have done so .
The Czech government has signed the treaty , and both houses of parliament have approved it .
The high court has already ruled once that the treaty does not violate Czech law , and will almost certainly rule the same way on October 27 in response to another challenge by seventeen Czech senators .
Thus all that really remains for the Lisbon Treaty to become the law of Europe is the signature of one man , President Václav Klaus .
In the first half of October , as the Irish approved the Lisbon Treaty and the Polish president signed it , Klaus stood alone in refusing to sign it , claiming that it interferes with Czech sovereignty .
Declining calls from European leaders , he flew off to Moscow for a visit with his Russian counterpart Dmitri Medvedev and to promote his new book that denies global warming .
( The Russian edition was published with the help of the Russian oil giant Lukoil . )
Václav Klaus is a strange and interesting man .
An economist , he made his name as a politician in the early 1990s by claiming to be a technocrat who could deliver Czechs from the confusion of the communist inheritance .
As an economist he is less than distinguished , but as a political tactician he has no local rival .
He has been either prime minister or president of the country for much of its existence — and as president has extended the limited powers of that office with some success — from the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993 until today .
When the Czech Republic joined the EU in 2004 , he did not celebrate .
Instead he hiked the mountain associated with the legend of a saint who would rescue the nation in its time of peril , a saint who as it happens bears the name Václav .
Now , if many Westerners had to pick the political saint among the Czechs , they would choose a different Václav :
Havel , the playwright , dissident , and the previous president , rather than Klaus , who has been far more important in shaping the political institutions and culture of the Republic .
Klaus knows this , and to all appearances resents it very much .
On the main geopolitical question of the twenty - first century , though , Havel was wrong and Klaus was right : Klaus opposed the invasion of Iraq , which Havel enthusiastically supported .
But Klaus was right , as people can be , for the wrong reasons .
He opposed the invasion of Iraq because he holds a very simple view of state sovereignty .
The world is divided into nations , those nations have states , those states have governments , and those governments have sovereignty : regardless of how unjust or tyrannical those governments might be ( Klaus being of a rather authoritarian disposition himself ) .
This obsession with state sovereignty exemplifies a new political problem in Europe : precisely because small European states have so little true sovereignty and their leaders so little true power , they are tempted to resort to empty and indeed absurd nationalist gestures .
The Lisbon Treaty is perhaps the solution to this problem .
National populism is on the rise in Europe because of the “ democratic deficit ” of the EU .
The EU does have a great deal of authority in the world , but it is not democratic .
National governments are democratic , but in most cases have little clout .
Once the Lisbon Treaty goes into effect , European citizens will have greater say in Brussels .
This , however , is the essence of Klaus ’s objection .
He simply does not accept the legal existence of the EU .
He believes that only the traditional sovereign state is real , or can be real , in international law .
( History tells another story .
In the millennium of Czech history , from the Bohemian kingdoms through the Habsburg monarchy through the twentieth century , there was a sovereign Czech nation - state in this traditional sense for only eleven years , from 1993 through 2004 . )
So before signing the Lisbon Treaty , Klaus wants the EU to assure him , in a binding document , that the large number of Germans expelled from the Czech Republic after World War II will not be able to appeal to European law to reclaim their property .
Few things in European political life are more sensitive than the question of forced population displacement during or after the war .
Under the Benes decrees , Czechoslovakia did indeed expel ( with the support of the Americans , British , and Soviets ) some three million Germans , nearly a quarter of its own population .
Their property was then taken by Czechoslovak citizens .
The Germans who were expelled generally found themselves in a democratic and prosperous West Germany , while the Czechs who took their houses lived under Communism for decades .
Very few Czechs or Germans could say much about the details of the Lisbon Treaty , but almost all would have an opinion about the Beneš Decrees .
However we might evaluate them today , they are part of the legal basis for the property rights of a significant portion of the Czech population .
Meanwhile , Germans today do indeed try to get their property back : not generally “ theirs , ” but rather that of parents or grandparents .
The Christian Social Union of Bavaria keeps this issue alive in German politics ; claiming that Germans suffered far more in these expulsions than was in fact the case .
If property claims of the children and grandchildren were honored today , a significant proportion of the Czech population would lose their homes , and a large number of Germans would get summer houses in northern and western Bohemia .
As usual , Klaus chose his political target well .
He can say , with some justice , that no one knows how future European courts will adjudicate these issues .
Best to get a guarantee now .
If Czechs have to choose between Europe and no Europe , they choose Europe .
If they have to choose between Europe and Europe plus property assurances , they choose the latter .
So here is what will likely happen : Klaus ’s highly demagogic and legally dubious maneuver will have to become the negotiating position of the Czech government .
The Czech Republic will ask the EU to include in the next major treaty ( probably the accession treaty for Croatia expected some time in 2010 ) a provision affirming the property rights of Czechs .
The EU will accept this proposition at its quarterly summit on October 29 , the Czech high court will affirm the legal validity of the Lisbon Treaty , and Klaus will sign it by the end of October .
He will have made his point , and will be able to claim victory .
There is also a nightmare scenario .
If the EU agrees to add a formal protocol on Czech property rights , it will be placing a formal limit on something called the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which is now an integral part of the Lisbon Treaty .
But when the Czech high court approves the Lisbon Treaty , it will be approving the treaty as it now stands : that is , without those limitations that Klaus himself is insisting upon .
Klaus may then say that he still cannot sign the treaty , because the Czech high court has not approved the changes he demands .
This ( or some similarly cynical maneuver ) would require enormous bad faith on Klaus ’s part , but not more than he has already mustered .
Klaus cannot stop the process of European integration ; he can only damage his country ’s position within Europe .
Czechs were not well served by barbed wire under communism , and they would not be well served by walling themselves off from the European Union now .
( Note to Americans who think that the EU means the welfare state means socialism means communism : the only party that supports Klaus ’s anti-Europe stand is the local Communist Party . )

American business history almost certainly will recall Apple as one of the most successful marketers ever .
With iPhone , the company has performed a remarkable magic trick :
Making the late - starting mobile seem ready to take over the world .
But the hard reality of facts -- not the torrent of glowing emotions coming from American and European financial analysts , journalists or Mac loyalists -- show something else .
Apple 's smartphone is by no means the roaring success everyone here claims it to be .
Let me preface by reminding that I 'm on record as calling Microsoft 's mobile strategy a train wreck and asserting that the cell phone is poised to replace the PC .
I 've also called Apple 's mobile platform -- iPhone , iPod touch and App Store -- as leading contender to become the next - generation computing platform .
Advertisement
But hard mobile phone data and analysis raises doubts about whether Apple has got a sure winner .
After being an early App Store cheerleader , I 'm increasingly of the opinion that Apple 's mobile platform may not reach escape velocity after all .
Emerging markets and Apple 's flawed strategy in India and Russia top my reasons for questioning how high the platform will ascend before falling back to earth .
Other factors , such as device pricing and emerging market trends around mobile money , also work against Apple 's present iPhone strategy .
Some iPhone fans might ask : Surely Apple 's global reach -- more than 70 countries -- is enough to bring the iPhone / App Store platform everywhere ?
But there 's more to selling handsets than having presence .
I contacted IDC Worldwide Mobile Phone Tracker senior research analyst Ryan Reith about Apple 's global reach .
He explained :
The 70 + countries is something that looks good on paper , but in terms of volume it does n't address the regional dynamics .
One of the reasons why Nokia and Samsung are so good in developing markets is because they have mastered the art of effective manufacturing and distribution .
They can make devices / services that suit the market .
Apple is clearly not that type of company , nor do I think they are going in that direction .
Having handsets readily available in 70 + countries is good for brand awareness , but it wo n't necessarily drive market share .
Another BRIC in the Wall
What is iPhone 's real marketshare ?
In the United States , during second quarter 2009 , Apple ranked No. 6 in handset unit marketshare , behind Nokia in one of its three weakest markets , according to IDC .
Apple 's share : 5.9 percent .
By comparison , leaders Samsung and LG had 24.8 percent and 22.1 percent unit share , respectively .
But Apple 's global showing is more revealing , and the numbers fall far behind US hype about iPhone and App Store .
For example , combined , four emerging markets known as BRIC -- Brazil , Russia , India and China -- account for more than 40 percent of world population .
There , iPhone 's largest unit marketshare in any one country was 1 percent -- in Russia during second quarter , according to IDC ( That 's actually good enough for rank of No. 7 ) .
Marketshare is too small to even register in the other three countries .
That 's three goose eggs for iPhone .
By comparison , Nokia unit marketshare ranged from 38 percent to 56.1 percent in these same four countries during second quarter .
China is n't so surprising a non-showing considering that only in August did Apple cut a distribution deal with second largest wireless carrier China Unicom .
But that does n't explain iPhone 's tiny share in Brazil , India and Russia .
The reasons are actually many , and on closer analysis they do n't bode well for iPhone gaining significant unit marketshare any time soon -- perhaps not unless Apple just gives away handsets ( Please jump to next subhead for further analysis ) .
During this month 's new iPod launch event , Apple CEO Steve Jobs said the company had sold 30 million iPhones -- a number that is sure to increase when third calendar quarter shipments are officially announced in a few weeks .
Thirty million is a remarkable number in just two years , but from another perspective it 's paltry .
In just the second quarter , Nokia sold three - and - a - half times more handsets as Apple did in more than two years , according to Gartner and IDC .
I 've read the comments and commentary ; iPhone defenders try to dispute numbers like these by insisting on only counting smartphones .
They claim the comparisons are unfair , because iPhone is in a different category .
OK , let 's do that .
Globally , during second quarter , Nokia sold more than three times as many smartphones as Apple , according to Gartner .
Nokia 's smartphone market share was 45 percent , while Apple 's was only 13.3 percent .
There is another measure of success .
Defenders of iPhone are all hung up on the applications , as is Apple , which uses App Store like a marketing club .
This week , Apple announced that there have been 2 billion downloads from the App Store , which now has more than 85,000 applications .
The number is humongous and quite simply unbelievable .
Apple has shipped about 50 million App Store capable devices ( including iPod touch ) .
Assuming they 're all in use , that works out to 40 applications per device .
A World Apart
There are still more ways to put into broader context iPhone 's 30 million units .
Global annual handset sales exceed 1 billion units a year , according to combined analyst reports .
In about the time Apple shipped 30 million iPhones , all manufacturers shipped about 2 billion handsets .
Combined analyst estimates put the number of cell phones currently in use at about 4 billion units , with as many as three quarters in emerging markets .
Exactly how does 30 million in use ( presumably ) compare to 4 billion ?
Apple 's reach is small , but Americans would never know that from all the noise here about iPhone ( Jump to the next subhead for scorching indictment of the American media ) .
Apple 's challenge then is to gain more share , more rapidly .
" Apple has had great success in North America , but quite a bit of struggle remains in other regions , especially developing markets , " Reith said .
The reasons for iPhone 's rest - of - the - world struggles are many and too many for this already overlong post .
I picked two , the latter being big enough for a series of blog posts .
Carriers operate differently in many emerging markets than here .
For starters , there are many state - sponsored carriers .
More significantly , in some markets there are many smaller carriers -- and these are not the ones distributing iPhone .
It 's not uncommon in markets like India for phone users to switch carriers by swapping SIM cards .
Small carrier competition creates more consumer choice , but not for iPhone .
Earlier this year , Anshul Gupta , Gartner 's principal analyst for mobile devices , discussed some of Apple 's emerging market missteps : " In India , iPhone was launched at $ 650 , and it was locked to operator for life .
At first , price was high and secondly phone was locked in a market where consumers are not used to such condition , and " where people " change operator [s ] frequently . "
But iPhone is different .
" You cannot [ swap ] SIM cards , " he emphasized , " because it is locked onto [ the ] operator you bought the device from .
An iPhone bought from Airtel will not work on Vodafone and visa versa .
Phone is not subsidized as well in India . "
The perspective is about the same there in India as viewed from afar by the Gartner analyst .
" Apple bungled up big time with the iPhone in India , " said Rohit Mishra , a student studying mobile technologies at VIT University in Vellore , Tamil Nadu , India .
" It still has a solid brand and created the touchscreen crave that has resulted in the success of Nokia [ XpressMusic ] 5800 and Samsung Star . "
Nokia is India 's market leader , with 56.1 percent unit marketshare in second quarter , according to IDC .
Samsung was No. 2 and Apple No. 22 .
Rohit continued : " By pricing iPhone at Rs 31,000 ( $ 600 approximately ) , Apple turned away a huge bunch of people who were waiting for the iPhone .
There is another issue here -- we do n't have 3G here .
It 's been launched by the state carrier in select cities , but that does n't count for much now . "
Most of the world does n't yet share the American obsession with smartphones .
In many emerging markets , mobile telephony needs are more basic : connectivity and commerce .
Governments and industry struggle to just get citizens connected with any mobile phone .
Something as sophisticated as iPhone is n't a consideration .
According to data presented during the GSMA Mobile Money Conference , held in Barcelona , Spain , from June 22 - 29 , 2009 , mobile phone access is as little as 2 percent in rural areas of Afghanistan , in a country where 75 percent of the population is illiterate .
Increasing mobile penetration is a primary goal there and among other emerging market countries .
The benefits can be substantial .
According to GSMA : " A 10 percent increase in mobile phone penetration can boost GDP growth by 0.6 percent . "
Beyond connectivity , in many of these same countries , governments and industry are looking at ways to enable commerce .
Mobile money is a primary goal .
While the concept has several forms , basically , mobile money allows residents to pay for goods using their cell phones and to receive money , too .
Where banks can't reach , mobile phones can .
Rather than store bills and coins under the mattress ( if there is one ) , people carry digital currency attached to their mobile accounts .
In October 2008 , Visa launched a mobile payment network in India .
A similar network launched in Malaysia in April 2009 , in cooperation with Maybank , Maxis and Nokia .
Three days ago , in Awareness Times , Aruna Turay wrote about a new mobile money system opening in Sierra Leone .
The point :
The majority of the world 's cell phone markets have needs that the iPhone is n't ready to meet -- even with App Store as a huge asset .
By the way , even Nokia is moving into the mobile money business , announcing its own network in August .
One line from the press release makes the point : " 4 billion mobile phones but only 1.6 billion bank accounts . "
Before writing this analysis , I took the position that mobile payments would overshadow applications .
Apple has the one , but not the other .
Reith disagreed .
" My opinion is that mobile payments will coexist on current OS / platforms , and will play a role alongside of applications , " he said .
" I do n't think one will overshadow the other . "
He added : " Mobile payments will interact with a lot of apps that are made for emerging markets . "
That 's good news for Apple and its powerful App Store .
By number of devices , Apple is puny .
By number of mobile applications , Apple is a world - class leader .
Additionally , App Store offers a limited mobile payments system -- limited meaning its dedicated to application purchases .
An Apple bank , so to the speak , could actually increase the iPhone / App Store platform 's appeal in emerging markets .
Misguided Reporting
I 'm not trying to demean or even diminish Apple 's success with iPhone or App Store but to create perspective too often lacking in US reporting .
Many of my journalist peers are themselves obsessed about iPhone and App Store .
The number of blogs in any given week just dedicated to new App Store applications is evidence enough .
There is informational obsession with the device that defies reality .
IDC 's Ryan Reith agrees .
" The view about American journalist obsession with the iPhone could n't be more true , " he said .
It 's that misguided obsession as expressed in two separate blog entries posted yesterday that prompted my writing about iPhone .
At the Apple 2.0 blog , reporter Philip Elmer - DeWitt asserts that " iPhone 's share of the smartphone market hits a record 40 percent . "
Really ?
In what alternate universe ?
He writes :
Apple now has a substantial -- if not the largest -- share of the smartphone market in every region of the world except Asia and Africa , according to a report issued Wednesday by AdMob .
Overall , the iPhone 's worldwide share grew to 40 percent from 33 perent over the last six months .
In North America , its share of the smartphone market is 52 percent , as measured by hits on AdMob 's ads .
This data -- based on advertising measurements -- does n't even remotely jive with Gartner or IDC smartphone unit shipments , nor even Apple 's figures .
According to Gartner , Nokia has 45 percent smartphone marketshare in the United States .
But the data makes sense perhaps looking at AdMob 's share on different handsets .
This kind of persistent reporting makes iPhone appear larger than what it really is .
It 's wonderful for Apple 's Stock price .
Now for the other blog : I disagree with Silicon Alley Insider writer Dan Frommer 's assertion that " Microsoft must make more spps for the iPhone . "
That 's a simply crazy idea from yet another member of the iPhone - obsessed American Press .
If you 're living in one of two glass houses -- geekdom or the United States -- this kind of thinking makes sense ( Sadly , many technology bloggers or journalists live in both ) .
Microsoft 's mobile strategy may be total disaster , but Apple 's platform is no sure thing .
Frommer makes a short - sighted recommendation .
That 's OK , he gets plenty of other stuff right .
As for me , I expect many iPhone and Mac fanboys to call me out - and - out wrong .
Feel free , that 's what comments are for .
I look forward to the engaging debate .
31.13.3 Converting from the Mayan Calendar
Here are the commands to select dates based on the Mayan calendar :
g m l Move to a date specified by the long count calendar ( calendar - mayan - goto - long - count - date ) . g m n t Move to the next occurrence of a place in the tzolkin calendar ( calendar - mayan - next - tzolkin - date ) . g m p t Move to the previous occurrence of a place in the tzolkin calendar ( calendar - mayan - previous - tzolkin - date ) .
g m n h Move to the next occurrence of a place in the haab calendar ( calendar - mayan - next - haab - date ) .
g m p h Move to the previous occurrence of a place in the haab calendar ( calendar - mayan - previous - haab - date ) .
g m n c Move to the next occurrence of a place in the calendar round ( calendar - mayan - next - calendar - round - date ) . g m p c Move to the previous occurrence of a place in the calendar round ( calendar - mayan - previous - calendar - round - date ) .
To understand these commands , you need to understand the Mayan calendars .
The long count is a counting of days with these units :
1 kin = 1 day 1 uinal = 20 kin 1 tun = 18 uinal 1 katun = 20 tun 1 baktun = 20 katun
Thus , the long count date 12.16.11.16.6 means 12 baktun , 16 katun , 11 tun , 16 uinal , and 6 kin .
The Emacs calendar can handle Mayan long count dates as early as 7.17.18.13.3 , but no earlier .
When you use the g m l command , type the Mayan long count date with the baktun , katun , tun , uinal , and kin separated by periods .
The Mayan tzolkin calendar is a cycle of 260 days formed by a pair of independent cycles of 13 and 20 days .
Since this cycle repeats endlessly , Emacs provides commands to move backward and forward to the previous or next point in the cycle .
Type g m p t to go to the previous tzolkin date ; Emacs asks you for a tzolkin date and moves point to the previous occurrence of that date .
Similarly , type g m n t to go to the next occurrence of a tzolkin date .
The Mayan haab calendar is a cycle of 365 days arranged as 18 months of 20 days each , followed by a 5 - day monthless period .
Like the tzolkin cycle , this cycle repeats endlessly , and there are commands to move backward and forward to the previous or next point in the cycle .
Type g m p h to go to the previous haab date ; Emacs asks you for a haab date and moves point to the previous occurrence of that date .
Similarly , type g m n h to go to the next occurrence of a haab date .
The Maya also used the combination of the tzolkin date and the haab date .
This combination is a cycle of about 52 years called a calendar round .
If you type g m p c , Emacs asks you for both a haab and a tzolkin date and then moves point to the previous occurrence of that combination .
Use g m n c to move point to the next occurrence of a combination .
These commands signal an error if the haab / tzolkin date combination you have typed is impossible .
Emacs uses strict completion ( see Completion Exit ) whenever it asks you to type a Mayan name , so you do n’t have to worry about spelling .
I head over to Piggly Wiggly , where I grab the stuff I need , then to the checkout , where I 'm stuck behind a woman who does n't understand why she can't use a coupon for a different brand of soup than the one printed on the coupon .
While she hashes it out with the 15 - year - old cashier who looks like she 's ready to just give her the can of soup to get her to shut up , I look at the magazine rack .
Funny , there 's never a Scientific American on the rack near the cash register .
But wait !
There , at the top , is a selection of small books - hefty pamphlets , really - on astrology , cookie recipes , and ... huh ?
The Complete Idiot 's Guide to Medical Care for the Uninsured ??
I shit you not .
The American Media digest version of The Complete Idiot 's Guide to Medical Care for the Uninsured .
I pick it up .
It actually does n't look too bad , although it appears to be mostly a list of who to beg for free health care in your state , and hints like " .. offer a doctor $ 100 or so in cash to see you for a check - up . "
Really .
Well , the soup lady has finally decided to buy the soup without the coupon , so I 'm up .
" Do you want the chicken in a separate bag ? " the cashier asks .
" No , just throw it in with rest of the stuff , " I mumble .
Hey , ca n't she see I 'm reading ?
So now I need to decide .
Should I buy the book ?
I have insurance , but the book is fascinating in a " we really live in a fucked - up society " kind of way .
I check the price .
$ 2.95 in the U.S.
Not bad for a complete health plan , and maybe I can get a DKos diary out of it .
I put it on the conveyor belt and the cashier rings it up .
" Do you want a separate bag for the book ? " , she asks .
Separate bag ?
What the hell is with the separate bags ?
If everything is in a separate bag , does n't that defeat the purpose of the bags ?
" No , " I answer , although I want to add " Just place it under the chicken to help soak up the Salmonella . "
By the way , the book costs $ 3.95 in Canada .
Or it would cost that , if anyone in Canada had any use for a book about getting medical care when you 're uninsured , which I guess they do n't since they have universal health insurance .
Who are the idiots ?
The fettucine was good .
After dinner , I sat down with my new book .
To be fair , the authors are quite earnest and even somewhat helpful in trying to offer good advice for people in need .
They explain COBRA and Medicaid , they offer advice on when to go to an emergency room .
They include lists of all the state medical and dental societies that might be willing to dole out some free care .
But there , on page 61 , was this wonderful advice for the uninsured :
Do Your Best to Avoid Accidents
In other words , Do n't Get Sick .
You know the rest .
Uruguay 's been a huge fan of the One Laptop Per Child initiative for quite some time , and while we 're still unsure if it 's the entity 's biggest customer , the aforesaid nation is certainly doing some serious business with Nicholas Negroponte and Company .
After the first swath of youngsters received their green and white XOs back in May of 2007 , the final smattering of kids have now joined the proud group of laptop - toting tots in the country 's circuit of primary schools .
You heard right -- every last pupil in Uruguay 's primary school system now has a laptop and a growing love for Linux , and we 're told that the whole thing cost the country less than five percent of its entire education budget .
So , who 's next ?

In this photo taken on Wednesday , July 15 , 2009 , a group of children play outside the Lyford House at the Richardson Bay Audubon Center & Sanctuary in Tiburon , Calif .
Tiburon , a town of 8,000 in Marin County , is proposing to record license plates of people entering and leaving town .
( AP Photo / Eric Risberg )
( AP ) -- Visitors should be prepared to have their pictures taken as they enter and leave this picturesque town of million - dollar views and homes along the San Francisco Bay .
Officials want to photograph every car and use the license plate information to solve crimes in the town of 9,000 .
Critics see the plan as an intrusion into the rights of visitors , but proponents say it is a sensible precaution that absolutely will not cross privacy lines .
" As long as you do n't arrive in a stolen vehicle or go on a crime spree while you 're here , your anonymity will be preserved , " said Town Manager Peggy Curran .
" We do n't care who you are and we do n't know who you are . "
Cameras are already watching Americans as they drive , bank and shop , and police around the country routinely use cameras to enforce speeding and traffic violations and spot stolen cars .
But Tiburon 's plan may be a little different if only because its geography - laid out on a narrow peninsula with only two roads in and out - makes it possible to keep a close eye on everyone who comes to town .
Melissa Ngo , a privacy rights attorney and consultant who publishes privacylives.com , said she is not aware of a situation where a town is keeping a record of all visitors .
" The point is we live in a land where people are considered innocent until proven guilty , " Ngo said .
" Not a land where it 's supposed to be - prove that you 're not doing anything wrong by letting us watch you do everything . "
Curled on the edge of the San Francisco Bay in Marin County , Tiburon is not a high - crime spot .
In 2008 , police report there were 99 thefts , 20 burglaries and two auto thefts .
That was not a significant change from the year before .
But police say with most of the crimes taking place at night , and suspects identified so far as out - of - towners with criminal records , they believe having the license plate information would be helpful in solving crimes .
The issue has prompted debate on the trade - off between private freedoms and public security .
Walking his dogs along Tiburon 's stunning waterfront on a recent sunny morning , Bill McDougal , who lives in nearby Sausalito , was not enthusiastic about the license plate plan .
" It 's one more step to Big Brother , " he said .
But Brooke Togmazzini , owner of a wine tasting room near the waterfront , said that while she initially had qualms about the system , she has become convinced there are enough safeguards in place to make it nothing more than a useful investigative tool .
" There is n't someone watching every car that comes in and out , " she said .
Curran believes the proposal , expected to go before the Town Council for final approval within a few months , has been misunderstood .
If they go forward , officials intend to set clear limitations on how the license plate database can be used .
For instance , they said the system will not be used for traffic enforcement , and the data will not be public record - no trying to find out if a spouse has been wandering .
The way the system would work is still cameras set up at town entry points will take a photograph of license plates - but not drivers .
License plate numbers collected would be erased within 30 to 60 days and would not be viewed unless there is a crime to solve .
Officers would search for plates of vehicles in town at the time of the crime that are connected to someone with a criminal history .
Any hits would be used as leads .
" There 'd be just none of the real - time monitoring that people worry about or that we 're somehow wanting to be unfriendly or discourage visitors in any way , " Curran said .
Civil liberties groups have concerns about the data being collected on Americans .
A 2007 study by California affiliates of the American Civil Liberties Union of 131 jurisdictions found that 37 cities in the state had some type of video surveillance program and 18 cities had significant surveillance of public streets and plazas .
Lee Tien , senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation , appreciates Tiburon officials ' efforts to limit the use of the license plate database .
But he is still not sold on the idea .
" The logic is always , well , wait a minute .
If you keep pushing this , then that means we should track everyone just because some people might be bad guys .
That 's not the way I think America is supposed to be . "

Eric Schmidt , Chairman and CEO of Google , departs after an interview at the Newseum in Washington October 2 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Jonathan Ernst
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Google Inc Chief Executive Eric Schmidt said on Wednesday that the worst of the advertising recession was over , and pointed to signs of a recovery in both Europe and the United States .
Speaking to a group of reporters in New York , Schmidt said that Google , the largest U.S. Internet search engine , had increased its hiring and investment in anticipation of a recovery .
“ The worst is behind us , ” he said .
“ We ’re clearly seeing aspects of recovery , not just in the U.S. but also Europe . ”
Google first started to see signs of a recovery in May and June , Schmidt said , following a period in which the slump in advertising spending undercut the company ’s revenue growth and the price of its search ads .
Shares of Google , which is due to report its third - quarter earnings next week , rose 1.2 percent to $ 504.78 in midday trading .
I had watched the first two hearings with a growing sense of bewilderment .
It always seemed obvious to me that if the Bank of America - Merrill deal had n’t gone through , Merrill Lynch would have been in a horrible position , akin to Lehman Brothers or the American International Group .
The government very likely would have had to spend an awful lot more than $ 20 billion to save it .
Surely , the end result was worth whatever arm - twisting and additional government aid was required .
So why the anger ?
Why the suggestions of “ cover - up ” and “ lies ” ?
On Thursday , as I watched Mr. Paulson being castigated , it dawned on me .
Seven months later , with the palpable fear of a financial collapse largely subsided , it really all boils down to how you view what happened last year .
Was it , as Mr. Towns believes , a bailout of a handful of unworthy but too - big - to - fail institutions ?
Or was it , in the eyes of Mr. Paulson , a rescue of a teetering financial system ?
My vote is for the latter .

In retrospect , the events of last December have a kind of irrefutable logic .
Mr. Lewis , scared by the mounting losses at Merrill , tells the government he is thinking of invoking the “ material adverse event ” clause in the contract to get out of it .
Even though the clause is pretty airtight  among other things , it says that deteriorating assets are not enough to create a material adverse effect  it is still a useful weapon , and a common tactic .
No matter what the actual wording , invoking it usually prompts litigation or a renegotiation of the terms , or both .
Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke understand this , of course .
But having just finished giving Citigroup another round of TARP aid , they fear that even a rumor that the Merrill deal is in trouble will set off a rerun of the awful events of last September , when the financial system melted down .
They persuade Mr. Lewis to take one for the team .
“ They needed to say to Ken Lewis , ‘ You have n’t had very good capital ratios , and we ’ve looked the other way , ’ ” said Nancy Bush , a prominent bank analyst .
“ ‘ Now it is payback time .
We ’ve let you do deal after deal after deal .
Now it ’s time to take one on the chin . ’ ”
That appears to be exactly what happened .
Instead of renegotiating the deal with Merrill Lynch , Mr. Lewis wound up renegotiating it with the federal government .
Mr. Paulson helpfully pointed out that as Bank of America ’s regulator , the Federal Reserve had the right to remove him and his management team from their jobs if it no longer trusted his judgment .
I can almost picture Mr. Lewis gulping as he listened to “ Hammerin ’ Hank ” laying down the law .
Seen in this light , virtually all the Congressional objections seem almost laughably naïve .
Mr. Lewis gamed the regulators ?
Hardly .
Bank of America is paying 8 percent interest on the $ 20 billion .
Unlike Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan Chase , it lacks the financial wherewithal to pay it back .
And accepting the extra money means it has now taken as much overall TARP money as Citigroup , the very symbol of a crippled bank .
Plus , of course , it has to abide by strict executive compensation rules .
Andrea Cornwell , who conceived and produced the film , said she wanted to make it because 'we live in a world surrounded by chips and computers , but we do n’t know how we got here .
This is a story about British companies not only holding their own against American firms , but also being technologically superior in many ways , and it ’s a story that ’s seldom told . ’

Investigators claim to have recorded almost 100,000 instances of iiNet users making available online unauthorised copies of films and TV programs from the film studio's catalogues , lawyers for the film industry said in court today .
At the much - anticipated opening of the iiNet versus the film industry case in the Federal Court , the film industry 's lawyers said its investigators demonstrated 97,942 instances of unauthorised copies being made available by the ISP 's customers to other internet users over a 59 - week period .
Of those , just under one - third - 29,914 - related to a sample of 86 works named in the court proceedings .
The works included Batman Begins , Batman - Dark Knight , Happy Feet , Spiderman 3 , The Simpsons and Family Guy .
Wanted , starring Angelina Jolie , was " the most infringed title in the case " while Hancock was the " second most infringed title on evidence " , film industry lawyers said .
Infringements recorded by investigators numbered over 1,000 for each of the two titles .
" By making those films available in those 29,914 instances , iiNet customers invited any and every user of the freely available BitTorrent software program to download any and every part of those infringing copies , " the industry 's lawyers said in opening remarks .
" That represents 29,914 instances of free handouts of my clients ' copyright .
" One would have to multiply by many times that figure of 29,914 ... to get any idea of the volume and frequency of films available from iiNet customers to others . "
Lawyers for the film industry claimed iiNet had done " nothing " to discourage copyright infringement on its network .
They claimed that , " when caught between a rock and a hard place , when push comes to shove they [ iiNet ] will not enforce " terms and conditions in their standard customer agreement that enables the ISP to cut off the services of users who have infringed copyright .
iiNet has maintained throughout the lead - up to the case that the film industry 's allegations of infringement needed to be proven in court for it to take action .
" If it is not going to enforce its own terms and conditions , it 's lip service to any assertion it [ iiNet ] has taken reasonable steps , " the lawyers said .
" iiNet does not want to enforce it because it fears losing those customers .
[ But it ] will submit it bent over backwards to assist , that it has done more than any ISP would be expected to do . "
The film industry claimed it had discovered documents that revealed " behind the scenes that [ iiNet ] has been moving in quite a contrary direction " to its public statements of cooperation .
The lawyers claimed one document showed iiNet reversed ISP Westnet 's policy of passing infringement notices from AFACT to its customers .
" On receipt of notices informing customers of the problem , Westnet had a policy of taking up with the customer the fact the system [ had ] been used to infringe copyright .
" Upon hearing upon acquisition that was Westnet 's policy , what did [ iiNet chief Michael ] Malone do ?
He prescribed the policy be abandoned in favour of iiNet 's policy .
That was the iiNet policy of doing nothing , " the lawyers alleged .
The documents were expected to be detailed later in the case .
The film industry 's lawyers also provided a detailed technical explanation of the BitTorrent system and a demonstration of its technical expert Nigel Carson accessing a torrented file .
The case continues .
For background on the case , see the iTnews timeline .
WASHINGTON  Congress and the Obama administration are about to take up one of the most fundamental issues stemming from the near collapse of the financial system last year  how to deal with institutions that are so big that the government has no choice but to rescue them when they get in trouble .
A senior administration official said on Sunday that after extensive consultations with Treasury Department officials , Representative Barney Frank , the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , would introduce legislation as early as this week .
The measure would make it easier for the government to seize control of troubled financial institutions , throw out management , wipe out the shareholders and change the terms of existing loans held by the institution .
The official said the Treasury secretary , Timothy F. Geithner , was planning to endorse the changes in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on Thursday .
The White House plan as outlined so far would already make it much more costly to be a large financial company whose failure would put the financial system and the economy at risk .
It would force such institutions to hold more money in reserve and make it harder for them to borrow too heavily against their assets .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- American Express will stop deducting monthly fees on gift cards that go unused after a push from complaining customers , the company announced Wednesday .
The change will go into effect immediately , including for gift cards already purchased by consumers .
American Express ( AXP , Fortune 500 ) previously deducted $ 2 each month a year after an active gift card went unused from the card 's value .
" Customers told us that monthly fees undermine the value of gift cards , plain and simple , " said Alpesh Chokschi , president of the global prepaid unit , in a statement , which said American Express is now the only issuer of universal gift cards to eliminate all fees after purchase .
The New York based credit card company 's move follows a credit card law that passed earlier this year prohibiting dormancy fees on gift cards , unless they have been inactive for more than a year .
The law is set to go into effect in August 2010 .
American Express introduced its gift card in 2004 and says business is " robust and growing " with sales exceeding $ 1 billion annually .
The company will continue to charge an upfront fee ranging from $ 2.95 to $ 6.95 on the " general purpose " gift cards worth between $ 25 and $ 500 .
If lost or stolen , the company replaces the cards , which can be redeemed at U.S. retailers and restuarants that accept American Express cards , at no additional cost .

The Swedish Court of Appeal has denied three requests put forward by the defendants in the Pirate Bay case .
They had hoped that a ruling from the European Court would be forthcoming in advance of the appeal to indicate the Bay is a legitimate search engine .
That , and other requests asking for changes in locations and dates for the appeal , have been denied .
The Court of Appeal has denied a trio of requests made by the Pirate Bay defendants who were sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of $ 905,000 last April .
The defendants – Fredrik Neij , Gottfrid Svartholm , Peter Sunde and Carl Lundström – had hoped that they could get a ruling from the European Court of Justice ( EC ) before their appeal is heard in November .
Time and again during the original trial The Pirate Bay was compared in functionality to Google , so the defendants lawyers wanted to know if the EC would classify The Pirate Bay as a legitimate search engine .
Jonas Nilsson , the lawyer for Fredrik Neij ( TiAMO ) , now says that the Court of Appeal does not want a decision made by the EC as they hope that the issue will be addressed by the Court of Appeal itself .
If , however , the Court of Appeal makes a positive interpretation of e-commerce law in favor of the site ’s legality as a seach engine , Nilsson says the four could go free .
The defendants also made a request for the trial to be moved to a new court in Skåne in order to get new judges , this following a growing lack of confidence in Stockholm ’s Court of Appeal .
That request has also been denied by Judge Ulrika Ihrfelt , who said that the court had seen no reason to have the trial in any other place other than Stockholm .
A further request by the defendants to change the date of the appeal for personal reasons , was also denied .
The appeal will start next month , as was previously scheduled .
When I was in Greece this summer , I bought Pat Bagley a set of Greek worry beads .
As editorial cartoonist for The Salt Lake Tribune , I figured he needed them .
Worry beads are not prayer beads .
Worry beads are for bouncing around in your pocket , for dinking around with , for twirling , for flicking back and forth .
They ’re basically just something that Greeks use to keep their hands busy between cigarettes .
Anywhere in Greece that you can find worry beads , you ’re also sure to find all manner of “ evil - eye ” trinkets .
Many cultures have evil - eye traditions , either to cast a spell on an enemy or to offer protection from one .
In modern Greece , and despite some villagers who still swear by their mystical powers , the evil eye is mostly a means to take a few Euros from silly tourists .
I killed two birds with one stone by buying Bagley a set of evil - eye worry beads .
From here on out , Bagley has nothing to worry about .
There ’s a bead for Gayle Ruzicka and another for Sen. Chris Buttars .
There ’s one for County Councilman Randy Horiuchi , just in case .
And there ’s one for the guy who signs Bagley ’s paycheck , Dean Singleton , who would dump Bagley tomorrow if he were n’t making him money — really , is there any other reason to read the Tribune editorial page ?
Well , the letters , maybe , and judging by them , Bagley may not have enough evil - eye beads to make a difference .
Today , for instance , a Tribune reader named Lynn D. Wardle — a BYU professor , no less — challenged Bagley for his take on the recent controversial speech delivered by Elder Dallin H. Oaks , an apostle for the LDS Church .
Attempting to defend his faith ,
Oaks managed to rile blacks , gays and most of Vermont , but not Wardle .
Oaks is not the first LDS apostle to put his foot in his mouth .
It seems a birthright to be named as an LDS apostle , then to set about alienating and angering anyone who is not LDS .
From Parley P. Pratt ( alleged to have been shot in the back by the husband of a woman Pratt was said to be seducing into becoming his ninth wife ) to Bruce R. McConkie ( who said that “ negroes ” during the wars taking place in the LDS preexistence were n’t as valiant as other races , and were thus cursed in this existence and denied LDS priesthood ) and Bruce C. Hafen ( who recently assuredly claimed homosexuality is not found in one ’s DNA ) , certain LDS leaders have done more to burn the bridges of unity than to build them .
Oaks is among that divisive group .
To his credit ( or blushing red face , it ’s not known which ) , in 1978 , when the LDS church unveiled its revelation that members of the black race could indeed attain priesthood rank in the LDS Church , McConkie did n’t skip a beat .
He said he was merely commenting on information known to him at that time and with the new information he now had , bygones were bygones , and for everyone to forget everything he previously had said about blacks .
As cynics have said ever since , the first to “ forget everything ” was the BYU football coaching staff .
For the past 30 years , blacks have been playing valiantly at the running back , cornerback and safety positions on the BYU football team , but not on the interior line .
Perhaps it ’s only a matter of time before another revelation allows for gay equality in the LDS faith , opening the doors for some of those buffed - up , gay cowboys to step up and kick some straight butt for the Team Down South .
But , from the way Elder Oaks is talking , I would n’t hold out much hope .
He ’s taken the issue of gay rights and turned it like a cheap radio dial to announce it ’s not gays who are oppressed , but people like him .
He said his religious freedoms are being attacked .
He said those attacks , spearheaded by gays and their allies ( who were responding to attacks on gay marriage by the LDS Church ) , are a form of religious bigotry equal to the racial bigotry experienced by blacks who fought and died for their own civil rights .
Most everyone possessing a sense of irony and a full deck of cards could justifiably ask , “ WTF did he just say ? ”
Bagley drew a cartoon that not only skewered Oaks , it made a souvlaki out of him .
The cartoon shows
Oaks befuddled by a litany of actual biases endured by gays ( from being denied marriage and service in the armed forces to losing their jobs for being gay ) , and wonders if Oaks really knows what it ’s like to be gay .
Oaks does n’t , which is excusable , but what is n’t excusable is that Oaks is also intolerant .
And blind .
His words speak to that .
He speaks for millions of people , including my LDS friends and neighbors .
Some agree with Oaks ; many do n’t .
But , Lynn D. Wardle agrees with Oaks and thinks Bagley is the bad guy .
Wardle is a frequent apologist for real or perceived LDS bias against gays .
If you can believe Wikipedia , he ’s an alleged paid hired gun for groups that advocate denying equal protection to gay couples .
That ’s what it ’s come to .
It ’s a frequent method of defense , to attack the accuser .
It does n’t change the truth , though — Oaks went far overboard while speaking freely in a free society about losing the religious freedoms that he practices daily .
If he were right , could he have done that ?
His “ persecution ” is an acorn next to the mighty oak of the black civil rights movement .
I still have Bagley ’s beads .
I better get them to him , pronto .
Judging by other negative Bagley letters , he ’s going to need them .

The official North Korean broadcaster on Wednesday claimed the majority of South Koreans " live in extremely wretched conditions . "
North Korean Central Television aired a 10 - minute patchwork of edited South Korean TV clips about the difficult living conditions of the underprivileged in South Korea to illustrate the claim .
The program titled " South Korea in Crisis , Wretched Livelihood of the People , " had been edited together from clips of MBC , KBS , SBS and YTN about homeless people , unemployment , redevelopment , a disastrous clash between protesters and police in Yongsan on Jan. 20 , 2009 , abandoned elderly people , and serial killings .
" Today , the South Korean economy is miserably collapsing under heavy weight of the worldwide oil crisis and the financial crisis initiated in the U.S. , " the voiceover said .
" The absolute majority of the South Korean people , who are standing on the edge of a precipice due to a serious economic crisis , live in extremely wretched conditions . "
It was unprecedented for North Korea to air a 10 - minute program about the South .
As if to prove that the scenes were real , the channel showed the names of the South Korean broadcasters and their program titles .
A South Korean government official said , " It seems the North is attempting to prevent North Koreans who are suffering heavy economic difficulties such as food shortage from aspiring to live in South Korea and appease their discontent with the regime by making them believe tha t South Korea is a bad place to live . "
Discontent is reportedly rising in North Korea after people were press - ganged into a " 150 - day struggle " of farm work .
Some 16,000 North Korean refugees lived in South Korea as of June this year , and they are apparently keeping in touch with relatives in the North through brokers in China and other countries .
HPV causes around 70 % of cervical cancers Eight in 10 girls say that having the HPV jab makes them think twice about the risks of having sex , a poll finds .
The findings may go some way to dispel concerns that the cervical cancer vaccine could make girls more likely to start having sex younger , say experts .
But 14 % of the 500 girls surveyed and who had been offered the vaccine said they might take more sexual risks because of it .
The findings are published in the British Journal of Cancer .
One in five of the 12 and 13 - year - olds polled by the University of Manchester team thought the vaccine was embarrassing because it is for a sexually - transmitted infection - human papillomavirus , or HPV .
Despite the scare - stories , this research suggests that the HPV vaccine could make the majority of girls more cautious about sex
Dr Lesley Walker of Cancer Research UK
But , 79 % of the girls said having the vaccination reminded them of the possible risks of sexual contact and 93 % said it showed they were serious about their own health .
The survey was funded by GlaxoSmithKline , which makes the Cervarix vaccine currently used in a national immunisation programme .
The girls , from the Manchester area , were questioned before the vaccine was available nationally .
It is the first survey to focus on girls ' views of the vaccine rather than asking their parents for their thoughts .
Almost four in five girls said they discussed the decision to have the vaccine with their parents and , of those girls whose parents refused the vaccine , 42 % actually wanted it .
But one in 10 girls receiving the jab did not want it .
High uptake Dr Lesley Walker , director of cancer information at Cancer Research UK , said : " Despite the scare - stories , this research suggests that the HPV vaccine could make the majority of girls more cautious about sex .
" The HPV vaccine is an important step towards preventing cervical cancer in the UK but it will only be truly successful if uptake is high .
" It 's important that girls also get appropriate sex education so that they 're all aware of the risks of sex . "
Each year around 2,800 British women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and more than 1,000 die from the disease .
Some 70 % of 12 - to - 13 - year - olds in England have been fully vaccinated against cervical cancer in the first year of the programme .
A Department of Health spokeswoman said attitudes may have changed since the vaccination campaign was rolled out .
She said : " We would always recommend involving the girl 's family in the decision on whether to have the vaccine . "

Earlier this weekend , I decided to drop the weights and pick up the Dual Shock .
This kind of recreation is n’t anything new , but the thing I chose to play sort of is : the Battlefield : Bad Company 2 PS3 - exclusive beta .
Above is ten sweet , sweet minutes from my second match of that afternoon .
One thing you ’ll notice in this latest Ten Minute Taste is that the Attacker side did n’t know what they were doing , or at least , did n’t care about the objectives .
My team and I were in their spawn as a result , giving them some hell with bullets and fire from our armor .
It was a spanking , no doubt .
Even though Florence and assassins have dominated my free time from Sunday afternoon on , I ’m still thinking about BF : BC2 .
I obviously dug it and am planning to jump back into it in the near future .
What do you guys think about the beta ?
The TMT ?

Tell us .
Over a thousand years ago , Mesopotamian artisans stumbled on a new way to add a special sheen to their ceramics : using microscopic pieces of metal .
This " luster " was the first known use of nanoparticles — tiny objects that are less than 100 nanometers long in all three dimensions .
In modern times , nanoparticles have emerged as a useful tool in medicine , with uses from providing the active ingredient in sunscreen ( nano - scale particles of titanium dioxide ) , to stimulating blood vessel growth as an aid to healing , to delivering the key ingredients in artificial hearts ( nanocrystalline zirconium oxide ) and brain imaging ( magnetic nanoparticles ) .
One use for nanoparticles that is gaining momentum is their ability to carry prescription drugs .
And one of the first nanoparticle - based products to pass animal trials is a topical cream for erectile dysfunction , which could potentially replace the tremendously popular ED drugs .
Joel Friedman , a professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine ; Adam Friedman , the chief dermatology resident at Albert Einstein Medical Center ; and Kelvin Davies , an associate professor of urology , have demonstrated that nanoparticles can be used to deliver erection drugs in the form of a topical cream .
Special Delivery Joel Friedman and his team created particles smaller than a virus that have a little payload of a drug — it could be anything researchers care to add — locked inside .
The cage - like particles themselves are made through a complicated process that combines a particular plastic and a type of sugar first discovered in crab shells .
The drug to be delivered is then stuffed inside the nanoparticle cage like the meat in a ravioli .
The key ingredient the researchers put inside the nanoparticles was nitric oxide , which is pretty miraculous stuff :
In 1992 , Science named it the molecule of the year .
In fact , without nitric oxide , erections would be impossible — the gas acts as a neurotransmitter , carrying the signal for an erection from nerves in the penis to muscles in the same organ .
Drug companies took advantage of this very important fact in producing three blockbuster drugs that cause the body to release nitric oxide : Viagra , Cialis , and Levitra .
While these new ED drugs have proven effective and extremely popular , they do n't come without side effects : Cialis and Viagra can induce headaches and facial flushing , while Levitra can cause dizziness and nausea ( among others ) .
These side effects occur because oral doses of these medications send the drug throughout the body .
If only there were a way to deliver topically deliver nitric oxide , which is a gas , directly to the — ahem — area in question .
Enter nanoparticles , which possess a few properties that uniquely qualify them for the task :
First , they can be formed into drug - holding cages .
Second , they ’re a solid rather than a gas .
Third , they break down when they encounter water — for instance , once they ’re inside the body — and not before .
When mixed into a cream , these nitric oxide - bearing nanoparticles become the world 's first reliable way to deliver a gas in the form of a cream .
And nitric oxide is n't the only erection aid that can be encapsulated in Friedman 's powder .
Davies found that wrapping the nanoparticles around a phosphodiesterase inhibitor — otherwise known as Cialis — also produced an effective treatment .
( It ’s unknown whether the nanoparticle formulation eliminates the drug 's most infamous side effect : “ erections lasting longer than four hours . ” )
The Future : Nanoparticles as Cure - All ?
Thus far , Friedman 's particles have been tested only on rats .
The tests , conducted at Albert Einstein College of Medicine , consisted of dabbing a tiny amount of the cream onto the penises of rodents who are too old to get erections naturally ( oh the joys of medical research ) .
The researchers found that the normally impotent rats had no trouble getting erections after application of the drug .
Human trials could begin as early as spring of 2011 .
In the meantime , Friedman is rallying collaborators to work on other nanoparticle drugs .
In a collaboration with Pedro Cabrales of U.C. San Diego , Friedman is exploring the potential of nitric oxide nanoparticles to treat high blood pressure ( nitric oxide is a vasodilator that relaxes blood vessels , and is thus an effective high blood pressure treatment ) .
In this research , which has yet to be published , the nanoparticles would be injected instead of applied topically , so that they could circulate through the bloodstream and slowly release their nitric oxide payload .
As for the future , Friedman and his team speculate there ’s no reason nanoparticles could n’t deliver just about any drug known to medicine .
“ Just about any drug could be carried across the dermis of the skin , ” Davies says .
“ We have n't even begun to look at the full potential of what [ nanoparticles ] could carry . ”
I was looking down through the grate as I walked past the Harriet Tubman memorial at 122nd and St. Nicholas , when I heard a big “ Hello ! ”
There in front of me was a smiling African American woman in her fifties , examining the carrot tops spilling out of my grocery bag .
“ What a beautiful plant ! ” she said .
“ I have a plant like this at home .
People think it ’s ugly , but you just have to take care of it .
How did you choose this plant ? ”
“ Because it looked healthy , ” I said .
“ Is it potted ? ”
She peered into the paper bag , where she found my scarf hiding the bundle of carrots .
I smiled , said something about plants , and walked away .
I failed to tell her it was a carrot , and I failed to ask her about her plants .
Worst of all , I failed to make a new friend in my neighborhood .
Photos by Claire Pienaar .
I ’m an urban planner .
As part of my job with MIT ’s Community Innovators Lab , I spent four months interviewing residents of Brooklyn ’s Bedford - Stuyvesant and Clinton Hill neighborhoods with the goal of understanding what gentrification means for the longstanding community , at a time when that community is being threatened by swanky glass - faced co-op buildings and hordes of new residents fleeing high Manhattan rents .
The night I ran away with my carrots , I re-listened to hours of audio recordings and found what I knew was already there : tape after tape of Bed - Stuy stalwarts lamenting that the new people moving into their neighborhood , specifically the new Caucasian people , were un-friendly .
My interviews revealed that the arriving gentry did n’t say hello on the sidewalk , did n’t hold doors open , and did n’t try to meet their neighbors .
The personal connection was abysmally obvious : the woman I met at the Harriet Tubman statue could be one of these interviewees , and her anecdote could be about me .
I went to bed feeling very , very white .
Bedford - Stuyvesant , commonly called Bed -Stuy , formed in 1930 .
It is a historically black community , one of many northern urban neighborhoods that became home to African Americans who left the South between the end of Reconstruction and the Civil Rights Movements .
Mr. James Grant , my oldest interviewee at age ninety - five , moved to the area from South Carolina in 1935 .
“ Everybody was leaving then , ” he said , “ coming to New York .
You could make a lot of money .
At that time , you were n’t making anything in South Carolina , or any of those states . ”
This generation of African Americans , as they moved north , was only 70 years older than the Civil War .
Ms. Inez Pitman , age seventy - five , moved to New York from Alabama in 1950 .
She too brought a vibrant history .
She remembers hiding in her mother ’s bed , praying that her father would come home alive , while he was out organizing for desegregation .
Ms. Pitman was nineteen when she moved to New York , where cousins welcomed her .
She eventually got a job with the which union , served a full career , and is now retired .
On nice days she sits on her front stoop and talks with her neighbors .
A few years ago she noticed that the college students living next door to her were passing her by .
“ Do n’t walk by me and do n’t say hello ! ” she said to them .
“ I ’m sitting here !
I ’m somebody !
Say hello ! ”
The students began to say hello .
Ms. Catherine Arline , who came to Bed - Stuy in 1953 , remembers a constant flow of neighbors at her mother ’s stoop in North Carolina , seeking help and advice .
It was this experience that inspired her to become a social worker .
Ms. Arline was only sixteen years old when she came to New York .
She found a position as a housekeeper , a job she returned to every summer until she finished high school .
She used her earnings to support her sister ’s college tuition .
“ I loved Brooklyn because there was a southern peace to it I had known . ”
Many of the subsequent generation did not know that southern peace , as they were born and raised in the city .
Rachel Spivey , born in 1957 , has only ever called Brooklyn home .
She recalls a wholesome childhood on Washington Avenue , where everyone ’s mother and father kept an eye on everyone else ’s children .
She still reunites with her grade - school classmates each August in P.S. 11 park .
But it ’s a different neighborhood now .
Parents do n’t watch one another ’s children , and the people she passes on her childhood streets now do n’t say hello .
“ How can you want to live in the neighborhood with me , but you really do n’t want to live with me ?
Because living with me would mean , to me , interacting with me .
Not to say that you have to interact with me , but ca n’t we just say hello and goodbye and smile at one another ?
Because it brings about a different feeling about the neighborhood when we do n’t do it like that . ”
Christopher Bloodworth , also raised in Bed -Stuy , but in his mid-20s ( like me ) , sees the same changes .
“ One of the things I ’ve always known about growing up in Bed - Stuy , is that you know your neighbors and you speak to your neighbors , ‘ Hey , how are you doing ? ’ and different things like that . ”
Some of the new residents on Bloodworth ’s block greet him with silence every day .
“ It ’s very frustrating to know , ” said Bloodworth , “ that somehow Ralph Ellison ’s words still ring true , that you can still be invisible . ”
When Bloodworth was a child , the woman renting the apartment above his was a long - term tenant who watched him grow up and talked with him on the stairway .
She was like a second mother to him .
Today , as a property - owner and landlord in Bed - Stuy , Bloodworth maintains stable rents despite the profits he could reap as neighborhood rents rise .
His priority is to keep tenants for the long - term , as his parents did .
Once the norm , Bloodworth is an anomaly in the new central Brooklyn .
Gentrification , as it works its way down Myrtle Avenue and the neighborhood ’s other prominent streets , brings visually satisfying things , like quaint storefronts and clean sidewalks .
Real estate developers tout an “ up and coming ” neighborhood .
Houses that were once securely in Bed -Stuy are now advertised as Clinton Hill , since the latter is more fashionable .
New glass - faced buildings are windows into a life that many long - time Brooklynites cannot afford .
Gentrification is made to look and feel like a Renaissance .
But under the surface of new glass walls , New York is experiencing something much less innovative than a rebirth .
Gentrification is a re-shuffling .
It ’s part of a relentless American history of moving populations en masse from one location to another when their presence becomes inconvenient .
This country moved Native Americans out , and brought slaves in .
In more recent history , it drew middle class people to the suburbs , and redlined African Americans into urban ghettos .
It tore down and displaced whole neighborhoods with Urban Renewal in the 1950s and 60s .
Hope VI , the most recent iteration in American housing policy , was meant to build mixed - income communities , but in practice displaced thousands of low - income people from functional homes and neighborhoods .
Gentrification , in many ways , feels like a new name for an old game .
At least we now have a multi-racial gentry class .
In my twenty interviews , one wish came through stronger than friendliness .
People want diverse neighborhoods , including different races , ages , and sexual orientations , with an array of careers , representing different socioeconomic classes .
Brooklyn native Tyrone Harris said , “ The diversity in the neighborhood is so good , that we can learn about the whole world in just one neighborhood , because we have Chinese , African American , Latino , and White .
We have everything here .
Puerto Rican , Spanish — you name it , we got it .
But the thing is , are we using our assets ?
Or are we just sitting back saying , ‘ We do n’t like this or we do n’t like that . ’
See , it ’s easy to complain , but the question is : What do you want to do ? ”
I thought that if I could change my behavior and say hello , that some small but important change would take place .
I wanted to write this article telling other people like me , white folks living in historically black neighborhoods , that they needed to get to know their neighbors .
Maybe friendliness would lead to people learning some of the history I learned , and maybe that would spur the kind of mutual understanding that characterizes unified communities .
But saying hello , of course , does n’t un - displace people who can no longer afford their homes .
Affordable housing does the work of un - displacing people .
Good policies create stabilized neighborhoods .
Funds that support community institutions , such as churches and arts centers , facilitate local networks .
Saying hello is good , but it ’s acting within a given structure .
The bigger battle is to fight for better structures , which is n’t a one - person battle .
“ We want a neighborhood where we are all together , ” said Ms. Pitman .
“ You want the people to get together .
Some people do n’t care if they pass by , but I ’m not that type of person . ”
PORTLAND , Ore. - A Portland man who attacked his ex-girlfriend and impaled her pet fish this summer has been sentenced to two years probation , a psychological evaluation and community service .
Donald Earl Fite III , 27 , pleaded guilty Tuesday to animal abuse and domestic violence assault .
According to court records , Sarah Harris had broken up with Fite but returned to her Portland apartment July 25 to find him lying on her bed , saying he wanted to get back together .
When Harris tried to leave , Fite shoved her against a wall , grabbed her hair and tossed her against a bathtub .
Harris fled but returned with an officer to find her fish � a bright purple betta named � DeLorean� � on the wood floor with a knife through it .
According to court records ,
Fite quickly admitted killing the fish , telling police : � If she can't have me , then she can't have the fish . �
Fite 's attorney , Tom Macnair , said Tuesday that killing the fish was a �very low point� in his client 's life .
� He is absolutely mortified and ashamed about what he did to the fish , � MacNair said in Multnomah County Circuit Court .
Fite , who had no previous criminal history , declined to make a statement .
Harris did not attend the hearing .
In a phone interview with The Oregonian newspaper , she recalled crying hysterically when she saw the fish with a knife sticking through it .
� Donald bought the fish for me , and I 'm sure he knew how much I cared for it , � she said .
Betta fish , also known as Siamese fighting fish , are colorful freshwater aquarium fish that usually are between 2 and 3 inches long .
Prosecutor Eric Zimmerman told Judge Eric Bergstrom that Harris plans to get a memorial tattoo of the fish and wanted Fite to pay for it .
Bergstrom , however , declined to make Fite pay restitution for the tattoo .
The judge ordered Fite to stay away from Harris , but said he could have contact with fish .
Middle Eastern garments designed to cover a woman 's face are " medieval " and " misogynist " symbols of extremism with no basis in Islam , a Canadian Muslim lobby group said Wednesday as it urged Ottawa to ban the burka and the niqab .
The Muslim Canadian Congress called on the federal government to prohibit the two garments in order to prevent women from covering their faces in public – a practice the group said has no place in a society that supports gender equality .
" To cover your face is to conceal your identity , " congress spokeswoman Farzana Hassan said in a telephone interview , describing the issue as a matter of public safety , since concealing one 's identity is a common practice for criminals .
The tradition of Muslim women covering their faces in public is a tradition rooted more in Middle Eastern culture than in the Islamic faith , Hassan added .
There is nothing in any of the primary Islamic religious texts , including the Qur'an , that requires women to cover their faces , she said – not even in the controversial , ultra - conservative tenets of Sharia law .
Considering the fact that women are in fact forbidden from wearing burkas in the grand mosque in Mecca , Islam 's holiest site , it hardly makes sense that the practice should be permitted in Canada , she said .
" If a government claims to uphold equality between men and women , there is no reason for them to support a practice that marginalizes women . "
The proposed ban would include the burka , an iconic head - to - toe gown with a mesh - like panel over the face that allows the wearer to see and to breathe , as well as the niqab – a veil that leaves only the eyes exposed .
Hassan said the ban would not extend to the hijab , a traditional headscarf that does not cover the face .
The proposed ban comes on the heels of reports that Sheikh Mohamed Tantawi , dean of Egypt 's al - Azhar university and the country 's highest Muslim authority , is poised to issue a fatwa , or religious edict , against the garments .
Media reports Monday said Tantawi described the face coverings as ``a custom that has nothing to do with the Islamic faith . "
Mohamed Elmasry , former president of the Canadian Islamic Congress , said he agrees the tradition has its roots in cultural customs rather than religious teachings , but that the issue is irrelevant in Canada where the practice is not widespread .
Elmasry disputed suggestions that the garments pose a security threat , saying only a minority of Muslim women living in Canada feel the need to conceal their features in public .
He said he believes those women should have the freedom to decide whether they wish to cover their faces , and that a ban would limit freedom of expression .

KUNDUZ , Afghanistan ( Reuters ) - NATO and Afghan officials claimed on Monday their forces had killed at least 130 Taliban fighters in a major operation over the past week in an area of Afghanistan ’s north where militant activity has surged .
A combined force of 700 Afghan troops and 50 NATO soldiers cleared villages of fighters , killing more than 130 insurgents including eight Taliban commanders during a five - day operation , NATO spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Todd Vician said .
Kunduz province governor Mohammad Omar told Reuters the combined force had killed 133 fighters during the operation , which took place in and around Kunduz ’s Char Dara district .
However , Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said only five fighters had died , and called the death toll given by NATO and Afghan officials “ propaganda ” .
The NATO - led force deployed air strikes against armed insurgents but believed no civilians were among those killed , Vician said .
No NATO or Afghan troops were killed , he added .
Kunduz province is mainly patrolled by the NATO force ’s German contingent , which has failed to prevent Taliban fighters from taking control of many rural villages in recent months .
Its Char Dara district was the site of the deadliest incident involving German troops since World War Two .
In early September , a German officer ordered a U.S. air strike that the Afghan government says killed 30 civilians as well as 69 fighters .
Germany acknowledged this week for the first time that civilians were killed in that strike and not all procedures were followed correctly , but says an air strike was nonetheless needed to prevent a suicide attack by fighters in stolen fuel trucks .
That incident also drew attention to the rapid spread of Taliban control in Kunduz , one of the provinces where NATO says insurgents have made gains this year , spreading out of southern and eastern bases into once - quiet northern and western areas .
The balloon is believed to have broken free from the boy 's family home A sheriff in the US state of Colorado says the parents of a boy mistakenly believed to have been carried away by a helium balloon will face charges .
Sheriff Jim Alderden was speaking after interviewing the parents of Falcon Heene , aged six , for a second time .
The boy was feared to have been in a weather balloon which flew away on Thursday , but was later found at home .
Sheriff Alderden had earlier said that he did not think Richard and Mayumi Heene were behind a deliberate hoax .
He has not specified what charges will be brought , but the couple have not been arrested .
" We were looking at Class 3 misdemeanour , which hardly seems serious enough given the circumstances , " Sheriff Alderden said .
A search warrant is being obtained for the couple 's home in Fort Collins , and Sheriff Alderden raised the possibility of federal charges , saying that he was talking to the Federal Aviation Administration The Heenes are expected to give a press conference later .
' Not staged '
The disappearance of Falcon Heene became a media drama that gripped the nation .
Suspicions were aroused when the child , when asked on TV why he had stayed hidden , said " we did this for a show " .
HEENE FAMILY Father Richard , wife Mayumi , three sons - Brad , Ryo , Falcon Family appeared on reality TV show Wife Swap , described as science - obsessed Father is an amateur scientist and keen " storm chaser "
Home videos posted on YouTube , including three sons performing rap song
The boy , his two brothers and his parents gave numerous TV interviews late on Thursday and early Friday .
His father , Richard Heene , insisted that his son's disappearance was not staged .
He and his wife Mayumi have previously appeared on the reality TV show Wife Swap , leading to speculation in the media that the latest incident might have been a publicity stunt .
US news networks devoted hours of live coverage to the drama on Thursday after it was reported the boy might be in a balloon floating high over Colorado .
When the aircraft landed in fields there was no trace of him , prompting a major ground search and further fears for his safety .
Officials said Falcon
Heene may have hidden because he was scared
It was finally announced that the boy had been found alive and well in the roof - space of the garage at his family 's home .
In spite of quick denials from his father , speculation that the Heenes had faked the entire incident persisted , when the family appeared on more US TV talk shows .
And in a bizarre twist , Falcon himself became physically ill while his father was asked direct questions on ABC and NBC about whether or not they had staged an elaborate hoax .
Mr Heene battled on while his son was being sick , telling his NBC interviewer there was " absolutely " no hoax .

Even since Imperator Alexander ’s I reign people began to name Odessa as the resort city which popularity grew every year .
And what changed after almost 200 years ?
The same wide streets covered with the old planes and acacias , the gold beaches , which annually open their scope for the hundreds thousand of tourists from every corner of the world .
And as city grows , tourist business of the city develops also .
And even contrary to an unstable economic situation in Ukraine it more and more tourists wish to travel to Odessa Ukraine every year .
In most cases tour operators provide accommodation for tourists , offering them rooms in many hotels .
However it is possible to find more comfortable and cheap stay : rental in Odessa .
For example , during last years service of accommodation in Odessa has greatly increased .
And it is not surprising : rental apartments gives tourists much more freedom at finding an appropriate lodging .
And to lodge an apartment is cheaper than to pay for a room in hotels .
You can rent 1 - 6 room apartments ranging from economy to luxury class .
Rental services can offer a lot of Odessa lodging in downtown or apartments in Arcadia area which are very popular during summer season .
One more advantage of Odessa accommodation if to compare with staying in the hotel – all the apartments have different location , so you can choose exactly what you need .
The most hotels are located in the historical centre of city while you can find a rental in any part of the city .
It is the excellent possibility to rent ‘ the best ’ apartment for you .
For example , fans of silence and calmness can find a ‘ cozy nest ’ in a sleeping district of the city , and those who travel to Odessa in hope to ‘ hoot ’ will find a suitable apartment in Arcadia district – the capital of night - clubs .
Tourists , who wish to give more attention to history of the city and its culture can rent an apartment in ‘ Old Odessa ’ district .
It is interesting that the business part of the city – all financial , official organizations , main offices of the most companies – are located in the centre , the historical part of the city .
And all these establishments located very close to each other , because this part of the city was densely built .
Therefore , if you are planning a bussiness trip and intend to visit a lot of establishments , it will take you not so much time to do it .
And the direct affinity of the historical and business parts of the city , will allow you to spend short minutes of rest , sightseeing the cultural heritage .
The numerous restaurants located practically at every corner will help you to relax and to gain strength to success in the purpose of your visit .
So as a conclusion we can say that Odessa accommodation service is the best choice for you – as rental is cheaper than to pay for a room in Odessa hotels and the quality will be the same or even higher and also you can choose the location what you need .
So its up to you whether to rent an apartments in Odessa or to find a room in the hotel .
Gretchen Morgenson of the New York Times reports on the latest instance of judges taking issue with the rather haphazard procedures of lenders and servicers in handling mortgage assignments .
As most people know ( and many by first hand experience ) mortgages often pass through a lot of hands , and the securitization industry has played plenty fast and loose in making sure the transfers are handled properly .
The system by which these sales are executed is coming under increasing scrutiny .
From Pam Martens :
The problems grew out of the steps required to structure a mortgage securitization .
In order to meet the test of an arm ’s length transaction , pass muster with regulators , conform to accounting rules and to qualify as an actual sale of the securities in order to be removed from the bank ’s balance sheet , the mortgages get transferred a number of times before being sold to investors .
Typically , the original lender ( or a sponsor who has purchased the mortgages in the secondary market ) will transfer the mortgages to a limited purpose entity called a depositor .
The depositor will then transfer the mortgages to a trust …
Because of the expense , time and paperwork it would take to record each of the assignments of the thousands of mortgages in each securitization , Wall Street firms decided to just issue blank mortgage assignments all along the channel of transfers , skipping the actual physical recording of the mortgage at the county registry of deeds .
Yves here .
I know I have said this before , but I am gobsmacked every time I read this stuff .
When I was briefly in the securities business ( early 1980s ) , even a teeny weeny error in a securities offering was completely unacceptable , a career limiting event for lawyers and bankers involved .
And even though due diligence was n’t what it should have been , there were certain steps that were absolutely necessary to avoid liability ( having the deal counsel read the issuer ’s board minutes and having someone from the lead manager visit the major facilities of a first - time issuer , for instance ) .
The finesse in mortgage securitizations was a company called MERS .
Fore those not familiar with their procedures , Marten gives a good overview :
on August 28 , 2009 , Judge Eric S. Rosen of the Kansas Supreme Court took an intensive look at a “ straw man ” some Wall Street firms had set up to handle the dirty work of foreclosure and serve as the “ nominee ” as the mortgages flipped between the various entities .
Called MERS ( Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems , Inc. ) it ’s a bankruptcy - remote subsidiary of MERSCORP , which in turn is owned by units of Citigroup , JPMorgan Chase , Bank of America , the Mortgage Bankers Association and assorted mortgage and title companies …
In recent years , MERS has become less of an electronic registration system and more of a serial defendant in courts across the land …
MERS does n’t have a big roster of employees or lawyers running around the country foreclosing and defending itself in lawsuits .
It simply deputizes employees of the banks and mortgage companies that use it as a nominee .
It calls these deputies a “ certifying officer . ”
Here ’s how they explain this on their web site : “ A certifying officer is an officer of the Member [ mortgage company or bank ] who is appointed a MERS officer by the Corporate Secretary of MERS by the issuance of a MERS Corporate Resolution .
The Resolution authorizes the certifying officer to execute documents as a MERS officer . ” Kansas Supreme Court Judge Rosen was n’t buying MERS ’ story …
Judge Rosen wrote : “ The relationship that MERS has to Sovereign [ Bank ] is more akin to that of a straw man than to a party possessing all the rights given a buyer …
What meaning is this court to attach to MERS ’s designation as nominee for Millennia [ Mortgage Corp . ] ?
The parties appear to have defined the word in much the same way that the blind men of Indian legend described an elephant — their description depended on which part they were touching at any given time .
Counsel for Sovereign stated to the trial court that MERS holds the mortgage ‘ in street name , if you will , and our client the bank and other banks transfer these mortgages and rely on MERS to provide them with notice of foreclosures and what not . ’ ” ( Landmark National Bank v. Boyd A. Kesler )
Yves here .
So you see what happened ?
The securitization industry decided to impose the convenience of “ street name ” holdings of securities to mortgages , simply ignoring hundreds of years of precedent and a thicket of local laws ( no joke here , the US precedent on the primacy of title documents goes back to at least 1818 in the US .
No deed is like “ no tickie , no laundry . ” )
Back to Marten :
Lawyers for homeowners see a darker agenda to MERS .
Timothy McCandless , a California lawyer , wrote on his blog as follows : “ … all across the country , MERS now brings foreclosure proceedings in its own name — even though it is not the financial party in interest .
This is problematic because MERS is not prepared for or equipped to provide responses to consumers ’ discovery requests with respect to predatory lending claims and defenses .
In effect , the securitization conduit attempts to use a faceless and seemingly innocent proxy with no knowledge of predatory origination or servicing behavior to do the dirty work of seizing the consumer ’s home .
While up against the wall of foreclosure , consumers that try to assert predatory lending defenses are often forced to join the party — usually an investment trust — that actually will benefit from the foreclosure .
As a simple matter of logistics this can be difficult , since the investment trust is even more faceless and seemingly innocent than MERS itself .
The investment trust has no customer service personnel and has probably not even retained counsel .
Inquiries to the trustee — if it can be identified — are typically referred to the servicer , who will then direct counsel back to MERS .
This pattern of non-response gives the securitization conduit significant leverage in forcing consumers out of their homes .
The prospect of waging a protracted discovery battle with all of these well funded parties in hopes of uncovering evidence of predatory lending can be too daunting even for those victims who know such evidence exists .
So imposing is this opaque corporate wall , that in a ‘ vast ’ number of foreclosures , MERS actually succeeds in foreclosing without producing the original note — the legal sine qua non of foreclosure — much less documentation that could support predatory lending defenses . ”
Yves again .
Again , I know this has been rumbling around in the news for months , but it is hard for me to believe this has gone on as long as it has .
I have heard ( from my attorney first hand on situations she has been involved in , not urban legend ) of a corporate lawsuit being thrown out of court because the contract between the parties had the name of the entities wrong …. by a comma !
Now real estate law is a different area , but title is one of its fundamental principles .
Selling securities in a trust when the trust does not have clear title to assets in the trust is fraud .
If judges keep nixing foreclosures based on the servicer ( acting on behalf of the trust ) not being able to demonstrate ownership , we could see a very interesting knock - on , of investor litigation against the trusts .
But it ’s too early to tell .
But it is n’t surprising that judges are plenty unsympathetic , and in cases , outraged .
The law is all about sanctity of process , both the underlying law and court proceedings .
Cases typically revolve around disputes of fact or grey areas of the law .
This is n’t grey ( whether a party has standing to file a suit is fundamental ) and the law in this area is well established .
Basically , the securitization industry tried creating rules outside any established legal framework and judges are having none of it .
Morgenson offers an interesting new sighting , involving a Federal judge in the Southern District of New York .
This is significant because the Federal bench is generally pretty high caliber , and the Southern District of NY is particularly well respected .
Moreover the ruling ca n’t be dismissed as a judge favoring the locals over the big bad out of town servicer :
….. on Oct. 9 in federal bankruptcy court in the Southern District of New York .
Ruling that a lender , PHH Mortgage , had n’t proved its claim to a delinquent borrower ’s home in White Plains , Judge Robert D. Drain wiped out a $ 461,263 mortgage debt on the property .
That ’s right : the mortgage debt disappeared , via a court order .
Yves here .
Translation : the judge was pissed .
He could have dismissed the case without prejudice , meaning PHH could get its ducks in a row and try again , but he sent a much stronger message .
Back to the story :
…. the case is an alert to lenders that dubious proof - of - ownership tactics may no longer be accepted practice .
They may even be viewed as a fraud on the court …..
Yves here .
Lawyers can correct me , but I believe “ fraud on the court ” would mean that lawyers that bringing that sort of action could be sanctioned .
Back to Morgenson :
According to court documents , the borrower bought the house in 2001 with a mortgage from Wells Fargo ; four and a half years later she refinanced with Mortgage World Bankers Inc .
She fell behind in her payments , and David B. Shaev , a consumer bankruptcy lawyer in Manhattan , filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan … Mr. Shaev said that when he filed the case , he had simply hoped to persuade PHH to modify his client ’s loan .
But after months of what he described as foot - dragging by PHH and its lawyers , he asked for proof of PHH ’s standing in the case …..
Mr. Shaev received a letter stating that PHH was the servicer of the loan but that the holder of the note was U.S. Bank , as trustee of a securitization pool .
But U.S. Bank was not a party to the action .
Mr. Shaev then asked for proof that U.S. Bank was indeed the holder of the note .
All that was provided , however , was an affidavit from Tracy Johnson , a vice president at PHH Mortgage , saying that PHH was the servicer and U.S. Bank the holder .
Among the filings supplied to support Ms. Johnson ’s assertion was a copy of the assignment of the mortgage .
But this , too , was signed by Ms. Johnson , only this time she was identified as an assistant vice president of MERS , the Mortgage Electronic Registration System .
This bank - owned registry eliminates the need to record changes in property ownership in local land records .
Another problem was that the document showed the note was assigned on March 26 , 2009 , well after the bankruptcy had been filed … .
According to a transcript of the Sept. 29 hearing , Mr. DiCaro [ representing PHH ] said : “ In the secondary market , there are many cases where assignment of mortgages , assignment of notes , do n’t happen at the time they should .
It was standard operating procedure for many years . ”
Judge Drain rejected that argument , concluding that what had been presented to the court just did not add up .
“ I think that I have a more than 50 percent doubt that if the debtor paid this claim , it would be paying the wrong person , ” he said .
“ That ’s the problem .
And that ’s because the claimant has not shown an assignment of a mortgage . ” ….
Late last week , PHH appealed the judge ’s ruling .
But Mr. DiCaro and PHH are in something of a bind .
Either they will return to court with a clear claim on the property — including all the transfers and sales that are necessary in the securitization process — or they wo n’t be able to produce that documentation .
If they do produce it , they will then have to explain why they did n’t produce it before .
Yves again .
And given that they presented that little assignment with a date after the bankruptcy was filed …. that would seem to say that any cleaned up paper trail was fraudulent .
Of course , presumably everyone in foreclosure land will get smarter and at least post date their documents more carefully .
But maybe not .
And we have an even more interesting set of possibilities .
Say servicers and MERS fail to clean up their act , and more judges start throwing out foreclosures .
Kansas Supreme Court Judge Rosen did n’t just say he did n’t see an acceptable paper trail ; elements of his ruling were a much more fundamental attack on MERS .
If more judges start challenging MERS ’s legitimacy , that could strike at the heart of foreclosures in securitizations .
In other words , a few more of these rulings may accomplish what the folks in DC have been unwilling and unable to do : force banks to negotiate .
The problem , of course , is the impact will be very inconsistent .
Some jurisdictions and judges will no doubt be more sympathetic to this line of argument than others .
Stay tuned , this looks certain to get even more interesting .
Ludovic Kennedy campaigned against miscarriages of justice
The author , broadcaster and campaigner Sir Ludovic Kennedy has died aged 89 .
A former BBC Panorama journalist , Sir Ludovic spent decades investigating miscarriages of justice , including the case of the Birmingham Six .
He contributed to the abolition of the death penalty and was also president of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society .
He is understood to have died on Sunday at a nursing home in Salisbury , Wiltshire , after contracting pneumonia .
He leaves four children .
Sir Ludovic was married to ballet dancer and actress Moira Shearer - star of the Classic film The Red Shoes - for 56 years , until her death in January 2006 at the age of 80 .
The couple had one son and three daughters .
Tributes have been paid by senior figures in the worlds of journalism , law , politics and campaigning .
Executions
As a young man , Sir Ludovic joined the Royal Navy and his ship HMS Tartar was involved in the sinking of the German battleship Bismarck .
After the war , he attended Oxford University and went on to become a successful journalist .
During his career , he carried out his own investigations into a number of high - profile criminal cases .
He sustained his commitments until they were victorious
Gareth Pierce
Human rights lawyer
Obituary : Sir Ludovic Kennedy
Among them was that of Derek Bentley who was hanged for shooting dead a policeman even though someone else pulled the trigger .
His most famous book , 10 Rillington Place , caused a national outcry when it argued that another executed man , Timothy Evans , did not murder his baby daughter .
Sir Ludovic maintained that the serial killer John Christie was responsible , and after a police inquiry , Evans was granted a posthumous pardon in 1966 .
Human rights lawyer Gareth Pierce - whom Sir Ludovic worked with on a series of miscarriages of justice - said he was " profoundly committed " to the cases he took up .
" He sustained his commitments until they were victorious , " she said .
Defence lawyer Joe Beltrami , who also worked with Sir Ludovic , said he was the last of the great campaigning journalists but was " very modest " .
" He had great determination to win and he won more often than he lost .
I admired the man . " ' Controversial causes ' Mark Thompson , director - general of the BBC , called Sir Ludovic " one of the giants of post - war broadcasting .
" His integrity and the tenacity of his investigative journalism , particularly where he saw injustice , won him the respect and trust of generations of audiences , " he said .
For much of his life , Sir Ludovic was a member of the Liberal Party and its successor , the Liberal Democrats , and stood unsuccessfully as a Liberal candidate in 1958 .
He quit the party in 2001 when the then leader Charles Kennedy refused to endorse assisted dying , and stood for Parliament again unsuccessfully as an independent candidate on a pro-euthanasia platform .
He later rejoined the Lib Dems and current leader Nick Clegg paid tribute to him .
" Ludovic Kennedy was one of the great thinkers of his generation , " he said .
He was a passionate advocate of assisted dying for terminally ill people
Sarah Wootton
Dignity in Dying " His pursuit of justice and his championing of sometimes unpopular and controversial causes marked him out as a true liberal . "
Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said Sir Ludovic was " an outstanding broadcaster " .
" He was a lifelong free - thinking member of the Liberal Party , but he was also a long - standing advocate of Scottish independence , and in later life he frequently endorsed SNP campaigns , " he added .
Mr Salmond said although Sir Ludovic had " friends and admirers across the political spectrum , no one doubted his journalistic integrity and independence " .
' Bit of an anarchist ' Richard Ingrams , co-founder of satirical magazine Private Eye , said that while Sir Ludovic had connections with the Liberal party - and " a very impeccable establishment background " - he was really " a bit of an anarchist " .
" For somebody like that to be engaged in the exposure of miscarriages of justice - it gave him an advantage , " he told the BBC .
" He could n't be dismissed as a kind of left - wing lunatic or anything like that . "
Sarah Wootton , chief executive of Dignity in Dying - formerly the Voluntary Euthanasia Society - said the organisation was saddened .
" He was a passionate advocate of assisted dying for terminally ill people , whose compassion and vigorous intellect were an asset to the organisation , " she said .
Edinburgh - born Sir Ludovic was a prominent supporter of the British Humanist Association ( BHA ) .
BHA chief executive Hanne Stinson said he was a " progressive campaigner on many fronts " and would be " sorely missed " .
We asked for your memories of Sir Ludovic Kennedy .
Please find a selection of your comments below .
I met Ludo on several occasions with my husband , Michael Mansfield QC .
Ludo was a committed , passionate fighter for justice .
He was also a caring , warm and deeply humane person .
We shall miss him sorely .
Yvette Vanson , London
He was one of the most inspirational broadcasters and writers of his day .
He had high intellect , but a sense of justice which allowed him to argue for the common man , in a language which all could understand .
A tremendous loss for all those of us who have been inspired by his words and his charm over the last 50 years .
Russell Homer , Jersey CI Another great broadcaster and debater of the BBC gone .
A great loss .
Colin Wise , Chandlers Ford , Hampshire Sir Ludovic or ' Ludo ' was my grandmother 's cousin on the side of Sir Ludovic Grant , 11th Baronet of Dalvey , and I am proud to be related to this compassionate man who did so much for so many ... may his legacy live on !
Abby McMillan , Torquay , UK Ludovic Kennedy was one of the great moral thinkers of our time .
His view of the world reflected most closely the rationalist and humanist foundation upon which those of us born just after the war - the baby - boomers - developed our philosophy of positive liberty outside of a religious straightjacket .
We owe him a great deal - he made sense of the world when it appeared to be senseless .
Jonathan Kamm , Stockbridge , Hampshire
In the 1930s Ludovic penned some words in the form of a jazz song called No Admittance Except On Business but could n't afford the £ 12.12.0d fee to have it set to music .
I came across the lyrics in his autobiography On My Way To The Club and as a musician / composer set it to music , recorded it and sent it to him for his 75th birthday .
Quite a few weeks went by without me receiving a thank you and I was therefore feeling somewhat miffed but in due course a very nice but amusing letter did arrive .
The funny part is , from a man so fastidious as Ludo , he had misplaced my letter and address and when he put the cassette into his music centre it unravelled and became ruined !
I still have three kind letters that he wrote to me and I still own the song and I therefore have a very fond memory of him .
Peter Seaman , Wirral Sir Ludovic Kennedy served with my Grandfather , Captain L.P.Skipwith R.N. on HMS Tartar during the war and I met him when he attended my grandmother 's funeral .
It was a great privilege to have met him .
He was a remarkable man in so many ways .
In this day and age , people of his calibre are very , very rare .
Anthony Walkey , Swindon , Wiltshire I know someone who served with him on Russian convoys during the war .
The smell of his Turkish cigarettes used to come up the speaking tube to the bridge .
He used to curse him - very affectionately .
Nicholas Hayward , Frome , Somerset
One of the old - style BBC broadcasters , which is how I knew him .
I trusted him because he made me feel he had thought deeply about whatever he was saying to me , contrasted with the current generation who are just good at reading an autocue .
MH , Derby , UK I wrote to Sir Ludovic in 1986 after reading his book " The Airman and the Carpenter " ( about the Lindbergh Kidnapping Case ) and realizing that my grandfather had been a close friend of Bruno Richard Hauptmann , the man who was executed for the crime .
I found Sir Ludovic to be a patient and sympathetic listener who was determined to learn the final truth about the crime .
Although we did not agree on the possible motives for the crime , his reasoning and knowledge were extremely impressive and I became an instant admirer of his .
Kurt Tolksdorf , Islip , New York , USA Ludo 's death is a gigantic loss to British society and , for the most part , sadly it almost certainly wo n't know why !
His particular sense of values , in my opinion , is one that must continue in order to breathe life into a system which needs inspiration , not moral stagnation , nor a temporary knee - jerk reaction to society 's difficulties .
What a man !
Bruce Adams , Inchture , Scotland
My memory of Sir Ludovic Kennedy was when he was an invited guest at a naval reserve dinner at Newcastle - upon - Tyne .
He was a wonderful speaker , he had great sense of humour and quick wit , and an enthralling manner when describing naval action .
I observed that he was admired by naval officers of his generation and those much younger , and I left the dinner feeling a great appreciation for his knowledge and ability to entertain and inform his listeners .
Peter C. Entwistle , Pembroke , Ma USA Ludovic Kennedy was one of the first public men to make an impact on me .
His blazing intellectual honesty and curiosity were an example to me when I was young , and his unquestionable integrity was an example to all .
The world was a much better place for having him in it and is now so much poorer .

One feature of this year ’s ASPO conference that I most enjoyed was the contradiction amongst presentations .
Marcio Mello gave an animated talk on Sunday night about the pre-salt formations off the coast of Brazil quoting that there are upwards of 500 billion barrels of oil available , an extravagant estimate that peak oilers are unused to hearing .
Monday morning two talks on natural gas were juxtaposed in tone and content , one claiming that natural gas is the “ American Treasure ” and the other claiming that shale gas is marginally profitable , let alone a “ treasure . ”
I have been to every ASPO - USA conference ( save the first ever in Denver ) and this is the first time that contradiction was so evident — though not for a lack of invitations from ASPO to potential contrarians like Cambridge Energy Resource Associates ( CERA ) and Mr. Yergin himself .
All in the peak oil world are guilty of preaching to the choir to some degree .
Places like The Oil Drum , The Post Carbon Institute , and ASPO have done an impressive job of educating people and getting the word out , but we never should feel fully satisfied with our outreach , as there will always be more populations — academic , professional , and otherwise — to educate .
Paraphrasing from Al Bartlett at this year ’s ASPO conference : for every PhD gained , there is one of equal and opposite magnitude .
Serendipitously , the New York Times published an article on unconventional natural gas production in the U.S only one day ahead of this year ’s ASPO conference .
They state :
" CERA caculated that the recoverable shale gas outside of North America could turn out to be equivalent to 211 years worth of natural gas consumption in the United States at the present level of demand , and maybe as much as 690 years ” ( NY Times , Oct. 10 2009 )
When I read quotes like the above I think only one thing : we — the peak oil community at large — have much work to do .
To that end , it ’s important to simplify and condense our message to make it as clear and accessible to the general public as possible — without sacrificing the nuances of the argument for peak oil .
I am inclined to borrow a methodology from a book I am currently reading .
The Canon by Natalie Angier is a summation of what scientists within the “ hard ” sciences ( biology , astronomy , physics , chemistry , mathematics , etc ) identify as the most significant ideas within their fields .
I will share what I believe to be the most important concept to emerge from Energy Return on Investment ( EROI ) literature .
So , here goes :
The quantity of oil , gas , coal , or any other energy bearing resource that is left in the Earth is not the question , all that matters is that portion that can be exploited at a significant energy profit .
EROI is a method by which we determine how much energy can be gained at a significant energy profit .
And note the deliberate use of the word “ significant , ” because what may be an insignificant net energy gain to an advancing industrial economy may be a significant net energy gain for a subsistence agricultural economy .
Below is a table of what we believe to be the EROI of most major sources of energy .
This data was accepted and will be published by the New York Annals of Science in January , as part of a special report on Ecological Economics .
There are limitations to the estimates provided in this table , however .
The numbers quoted in the table are averages , and as technology advances and companies look for oil and gas in remote places using techniques that are far from conventional , the averages grow increasingly inaccurate .
Thus whenever there is an announcement of a new discovery , such as those at the top of this post , one needs to ask : “ How much will be recovered at a significant energy profit ? ”
In summation , this year ’s ASPO conference offered a broad scope of argumentation from individuals who do not necessarily subscribe to Peak Oil pedagogy .
But this is a positive thing ; for me , it confirmed that I still have much work to do , as most people still do not understand the importance of Energy Return on Investment .
Take for example the claims made by Marcio Mello , who reported that there are 500 billion barrels of oil located in ultra-deep , pre-salt geologic formations off the coast of Brazil .
To him I ask : how many 2.7 billion dollar Tahiti platforms are needed to extract that oil ?
How much will this cost in both energy and dollar terms ?
Ultimately , what is the energy return on investment for extracting these resources ?
Without answers to these questions , reporting the discovery of oil or gas is somewhat misleading because it may take more energy to access those barrels than chemical energy contained within them .
Without Mello ’s provocative talk , though , we would not be forced to question our own methodologies .
It is essential to keep the scope of argumentation at conferences , as well as individual departments or business , broad and open to contradiction .
Otherwise , we peak oilers will find ourselves isolated from the possibility of enlightening others , and will self - reinforce to a point of immobility .

Industry watchers say Wi-Fi Direct could have far - reaching implications
The world of wi-fi is to become a whole lot easier thanks to a major technology upgrade , says an industry group .
The Wi-Fi Alliance said it would soon finish work on a new specification called Wi -Fi Direct .
It will let wi - fi devices like phones and laptops connect to one another without joining a traditional network .
The Wi-Fi Alliance - whose members include Intel , Apple and Cisco - hopes devices with the new technology will be on the market by the middle of 2010 .
Owners of devices without Wi -Fi Direct will be able to upgrade through a software download , says the technology consortium .
The Wi-Fi Alliance 's marketing director , Kelly Davis - Felner , told BBC News : " This is going to be a quick and convenient way to use wi - fi in future to print , synch , share and display .
" The consumer is going to experience this as a very easy - to - use mechanism that will be quite seamless . "
Threat to Bluetooth ?
Wi -Fi Direct will automatically scan for local existing hotspots and any wi-fi-enabled devices , such as cameras , phones and computers .
The Alliance says the specification will search for both consumer electronics and office applications , enabling devices to connect from across a home or workplace .
Victoria Foote , senior analyst at In - Stat , said it was a " terrific innovation " .
Ben Parr , co-editor of Mashable.com , told BBC News the potential impact could be far - reaching .
But industry watchers also say the technology could pose a threat to the future of Bluetooth and perhaps do away with the need to use wi-fi routers in some places .
Here are some facts that you wo n’t find advertised on most of the vitamin supplements at your local vitamin store :
The majority of commercial vitamin supplements are made up of synthetic vitamins
Synthetic vitamins do not perform the same functions in your body as vitamins found naturally in whole food
Many synthetic vitamins deplete your body of other nutrients and tax your kidneys before being excreted through your urine
If you want a comprehensive understanding of what vitamins are and what they do in your body , it would be best to take a full course in biochemistry .
Do you remember all of those molecular formulas and chemical reactions that you studied in your high school chemistry class ?
Biochemistry is really just an extension of chemistry , with an emphasis on the thousands of chemical reactions that occur in your body on a moment - to - moment basis .
Anyone who studies biochemistry learns that vitamins do not exist as single components that act on their own .
Vitamins are made up of several different components – enzymes , co-enzymes , and co-factors– that must work together to produce their intended biologic effects .
Vitamins that are found naturally in whole foods come with all of their necessary components .
The majority of vitamins that are sold in pharmacies , grocery stores , and vitamin shops are synthetic vitamins , which are only isolated portions of the vitamins that occur naturally in food .
A good example is vitamin C . If you take a look at a variety of vitamin C supplements , you will find that the majority of them contain only ascorbic acid or a compound called ascorbate , which is a less acidic form of acorbic acid .
Ascorbic acid is NOT vitamin C.
It represents the outer ring that serves as a protective shell for the entire vitamin C complex , much like an orange peel that serves as a protective shell for an orange .
Real vitamin C found in whole foods like fruits and vegetables contain the following components :
Rutin
Bioflavonoids ( vitamin P )
Factor K
Factor J
Factor P
Tyrosinase
Ascorbinogen
Ascorbic Acid
When you take only ascorbic acid found in your synthetic vitamin C tablet or powder , your body must gather all of the other components of the full vitamin C complex from your body ’s tissues in order to make use of it .
In the event that your body does not have adequate reserves of the other components , ascorbic acid itself does not provide any of the health benefits that the full vitamin C complex does .
After circulating through your system , the unused ascorbic acid is eliminated through your urine .
Just like vitamin C , almost all other vitamins that we know of offer their full health benefits when they are in the presence of a number of enzymes , co-enzymes , co-factors , and even minerals .
For example , Vitamin D may have as many as twelve different active components , while vitamin P has at least five different components .
The mineral copper is needed for full vitamin C activity , while vitamin E works closely with the mineral selenium to provide its health promoting , anti-oxidative effect .
Clearly , it is best to get your vitamins from whole foods because whole foods provide complete vitamins rather than fractions of them .
In many cases , whole foods also provide the minerals that are necessary for optimal vitamin activity .
For example , sunflower seeds are an excellent whole food source of vitamin E and the mineral selenium , both of which need each other to offer their full health benefits .
How do you know if the vitamins on your kitchen counter are from whole foods or if they are synthetic ?
If the list of ingredients includes an actual vitamin like Vitamin C ” rather than an actual food that contains natural vitamin C like “ acerola cherry powder ” , you can bet that it is a synthetic vitamin .
If you choose to use nutritional supplements , it is in your best interest to use only those products that list actual foods as their ingredients rather than synthetic and isolated vitamins .
While some synthetic and isolated vitamins have been shown to provide minimal health benefits , on the whole , most of them cause more harm than good and you are far better off spending your money on whole foods .
It is important to note that the principles in this article are just as relevant and applicable to minerals and mineral supplements .
Two whole food supplements that my family uses on a regular basis are a super green food mixture and an acerola cherry powder product .
In a discussion of the war of words between Fox News and the White House , Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace played a clip from the 1987 gangster movie The Untouchables to illustrate how the Obama administration operates .
Wallace went on to criticize the Obama administration for “ trying to exclude Fox from interviewing pay czar Ken Feinberg ” — even though that claim has now been debunked .

In starting a segment whose premise was “ Is the Obama administration creating a new enemies list ? , ” Wallace played a clip of Sean Connery playing a police officer in 1920s Chicago , saying : “ He pulls a knife — you pull a gun .
He sends one of yours to the hospital , you send one of his to the morgue .
That ’s the Chicago way . ”
While it was not clear whether Wallace was accusing the White House of operating like an organized crime outfit or a gangland police squad , it was clear he was continuing the network ’s claim that the White House had tried to shut Fox out of a round of interviews with Kenneth Feinberg , the “ pay czar ” at the Treasury Department who is working to reduce bonuses at firms that took federal bailout cash .
Fox News reported last week that the White House had attempted to keep the network away from Feinberg by refusing to grant Fox an interview with him .
But subsequent investigations have found that it was the Treasury Department , not the White House , that arranged the interviews , and that Fox was initially not listed for an interview because they had n’t requested one .
Wallace ’s gangster comparison follows other similar comments by the right wing echo chamber .
The Wall Street Journal ‘s Kimberly Strassel was one of the first :
A White House set on kneecapping its opponents is n’t , of course , entirely new .
( See : Nixon )
What is a little novel is the public and bare - knuckle way in which the Obama team is waging these campaigns against the other side .

The following day , Fox host Glenn Beck followed that script with a rant about the White House “ beatdown ” of its enemies .
That ’s the Chicago way and now we have it in Washington with Rahm Emanuel and Barack Obama .
What was it that Obama promised on the campaign trail ?
Oh yeah , a “ new kind of politics . ”
America did n’t think the “ new ” politics would be even worse than the “ old ” politics .
Agree with the administration ?
Fantastic .
Dare to stand in the way of “ reform ” ?
Uh-oh .
No longer is it a gentlemen ’s disagreement that can be debated .
No , you are going to play ball or get a beatdown .

The United States has long suspected that much of the billions of dollars it has sent Pakistan to battle militants has been diverted to the domestic economy and other causes , such as fighting India .
Now the scope and longevity of the misuse is becoming clear : Between 2002 and 2008 , while al Qaeda regrouped , only $ 500 million of the $ 6.6 billion in U.S. aid actually made it to the Pakistani military , two army generals tell the Associated Press .
The account of the generals , who asked to remain anonymous because military rules forbid them from speaking publicly , was backed up by other retired and active generals , former bureaucrats and government ministers .
At the time of the siphoning , Pervez Musharraf , a U.S. , ally , served as both chief of staff and president , making it easier to divert money intended for the military to bolster his image at home through economic subsidies .
" The army itself got very little , " said retired Gen. Mahmud Durrani , who was ambassador to the United States under Musharraf .
" It went to things like subsidies , which is why everything looked hunky - dory .
The military was financing the war on terror out of its own budget . "
Generals and ministers say the diversion of the money hurt the military in very real ways :
-- Helicopters critical to the battle in rugged border regions were not available .
At one point in 2007 , more than 200 soldiers were trapped by insurgents in the tribal regions without a copter lift to rescue them .
-- Equipment was broken , and training was lacking .
It was not until 2007 that money was given to the Frontier Corps , the front - line force , for training .
The details on misuse of aid come as the United States again promises Pakistan money .
Legislation to triple general aid to Pakistan cleared Congress last week .
The legislation also authorizes " such sums as are necessary " for military assistance to Pakistan , upon several conditions .
The conditions include certification that Pakistan is cooperating in stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons , that Pakistan is making a sustained commitment to combatting terrorist groups and that Pakistan security forces are not subverting the country 's political or judicial processes .
The United States is also insisting on more accountability for reimbursing money spent .
For example , Pakistan is still awaiting $ 1.7 billion for which it has billed the United States under a Coalition Support Fund to reimburse allies for money spent on the war on terror .
But the United States still can't follow what happens to the money it doles out .
Musharraf 's spokesman , retired Gen. Rashid Quereshi , flatly denied that his former boss had shortchanged the army .
He did not address the specific charges .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. dollar may come under renewed pressure from emerging market currencies and the euro after a meeting of the world ’s top finance officials failed to take concrete action on rebalancing global money flows .

Finance ministers and central bank governors of the Group of 20 major countries , meeting in Scotland at the weekend , launched a “ framework ” in which they will discuss how to reduce trade and savings imbalances between nations .
But their communique talked only in general terms about rebalancing economies , and implied they might not agree on specific policies for individual countries to adopt before the end of next year at the earliest .
The result may be a continuation of heavy fund flows into emerging markets , boosting currencies there .
And central banks intervening to slow currency appreciation may keep investing much of the money they obtain in the euro , pushing up that currency too .
“ We ’re probably looking at fresh dollar weakness in the short term ” in the wake of the G20 meeting , said Kenneth Broux , senior markets economist at Lloyds TSB .
CHINA , BRAZIL
At the center of the currency issue is China ’s reluctance to permit appreciation of its tightly controlled yuan , which it has kept flat against the dollar since mid-2008 .
That has prompted additional fund flows into emerging market currencies that do trade freely , such as the Brazilian real , which has soared over 30 percent this year .
Last month , Brazil slapped a 2 percent tax on foreign investments in fixed income and stocks in an effort to slow the real ’s rise .
Last week , Brazilian officials said they would discuss this problem at the G20 meeting .
But the G20 communique made no reference to the issue , and Brazil appeared to get little sympathy from a senior official of the International Monetary Fund , which is a key player in the global rebalancing campaign .
Youssef Boutros - Ghali , who chairs the International Monetary and Financial Committee , the IMF ’s policy steering committee , told Reuters that Brazil ’s tax was unlikely to work and that “ we should not be fixated on currencies .
Officials from several countries , including Brazil , Japan and Indonesia , urged China on the sidelines of the meeting to let the yuan move more flexibly .
But as a group , the G20 did not press China on the sensitive issue , G20 sources said .
British finance minister Alistair Darling told reporters : “ We did n’t discuss the renminbi .
I think that ’s a question for China rather than us . ”
In fact , China appeared in a combative mood .
Finance Minister Xie Xuren and central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan , speaking to the official Xinhua news agency after the meeting , made no mention of the yuan and instead warned developed countries to focus on the quality of their own policies .
Xie said countries with global reserve currencies should work to maintain the currencies ’ value , to avoid destabilizing the global economy -- implying it was up to Washington , not Beijing , to resolve the issue of the weak dollar .
The silence on the yuan in Scotland suggested countries accepted the G20 was not a forum in which to press China .
The other main global economic forum , the Group of Seven nations , last met in October ; it did mention the yuan , but only in the softest terms , “ welcoming China ’s continued commitment ” to free up the yuan without referring to a timetable .
REBALANCING
The G20 did publish a detailed , unprecedented timetable for countries to discuss the economic rebalancing that could eventually bring more stability to global currency markets .
In an appendix to the communique , G20 countries were asked to submit descriptions of their monetary , fiscal and other policies and plans to the IMF by the end of January 2010 .
The IMF would produce an analysis of the global economy by April .
G20 countries would then “ develop a basket of policy options ” in June , and G20 leaders would consider recommendations for policies at a summit in November 2010 .
But this plan is clearly constrained by diplomatic sensitivities .
For example , the appendix said that , in the first half of next year , the IMF would not recommend policies for specific countries but merely for “ groups of countries facing similar circumstances ” -- apparently ruling out an explicit recommendation to appreciate the yuan .
So in the short term , currency market trends look as if they will be left to continue , said Simon Derrick , senior currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon in London .
“ It is hard to imagine a level playing field for currencies without resolving the issue of the yuan , ” he said .
As Ronald Reagan would say ,  Here we go again ! 
How many Rwanda , Columbine , Virginia Tech , Warsaw Ghetto , post - office , and other shootings do people have to endure before they face reality ?
How long does it take to learn a simple lesson : unarmed people are more vulnerable to terrorists , criminals , and crazed people than armed ones ?
Now the terrible toll in Mumbai : some 175 killed and several hundred others wounded .
The headlines in India and across the world should have read ,  Terrorists and Gun Control Claim More Victims . 
Instead , the complicity of the various Indian governments  national , state , and city  was ignored and their inability to protect the victims of that tragic event was barely questioned .
The truth is that , except for a few policemen on the scene , all the victims were unarmed by public policy .
India has among the strictest gun-control laws on Earth , which , according to gun-control advocates , should have made Mumbai one of the safest cities on the planet .
So it shouldnt surprise anyone with common sense or a historical perspective that disarmed citizens and visitors had no way of defending themselves and were , once again , the victims not only of terrorists , but of the misguided , immoral policy of their governments .
As Alexander the Great found out when he invaded India in 326 B.C. , its people are keen fighters and weapon innovators .
The British , Indias colonial ruler from 1757 to 1947 , suppressed this martial tradition , disarmed the populace , and destroyed the domestic firearms industry to ensure their rule , particularly after the Sepoy Rebellion of 1857 .
The Indian Arms Act of 1878 forbade Indians to possess weapons , with the exception of those considered loyal .
The law did not apply to Europeans who could , of course , possess and carry arms at their discretion .

The Indian subcontinent has been racked with strife since independence and the partition in 1947 between India and Pakistan .
That may explain why the newly independent Indian government saw fit to keep the British gun-control laws in place for another 12 years before replacing them with similar measures of their own in 1959 and later years .
Though not as severe as the British gun-control laws , suffice it to say Indias laws discourage the private possession of firearms , making it nearly impossible for the average Indian to own or use guns , all under the pretext of crime control .
Armed Response : A Comp ... David Kenik Best Price : $ 1.23 Buy New $ 6.99 ( as of 11:40 EST - Details )
Yet such measures have not curtailed violence on the subcontinent .
For example , following the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1984 by two of her Sikh bodyguards , as many as 3,000 Sikhs died in four days of riots throughout the country .
In 2002 , a Muslim mob murdered 59 Hindus in a railway car at the Godhra railway station by first stoning them and then setting the railway car in which they traveled on fire .
Gun control made those poor people easy victims .
Had they been armed , would it have prevented the violence ?
No one knows , but at least they would have stood a better chance to survive .
As for the terrorist attack in Mumbai , can you imagine what would have happened to the terrorists , once they started shooting , if the people around them had not been prevented by their government from exercising their God - given right to keep and bear arms , but had instead been armed ?
Well , imagine being surrounded by hundreds of angry , frightened , armed people shooting back and fighting for their lives  a well - deserved nightmare for terrorists and criminals .
A number of innocent people would surely have been killed and wounded anyway .
After all , the terrorists had the element of surprise .
But I doubt the number of dead and injured would have been so great .
I can almost guarantee that far more than the 10 terrorists so far accounted for would have bitten the dust .
More than 200 years ago , Thomas Jefferson quoted Cesare Beccaria , father of modern criminology :
The laws that forbid the carrying of arms … disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crime … .
Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants ; they serve to encourage rather than to prevent homicides , for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed one .
India has no excuse .
The father of Indian independence , Mohandas Gandhi , observed in 1927 ,
Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India , history will look upon the act of depriving a whole nation of its arms as the blackest .
Lets hope the Indian government has learned its lesson and that there are no more Mumbais .

While the team over at Double Fine participated in their Dem - o - thon online yesterday , they brought up a nice little video clip showcasing the multiplayer mode itself .
A tutorial to the multiplayer to be exact .
It lists the factions and their strengths / weaknesses as well as an ass load of other details , not to mention how certain parts of the multiplayer gameplay will be controlled and handled .
You can check this clip out below .
The demo is now 100 % live for all gamers for both the PS3 and XBox 360 .
I recommend giving it a play through .
It sates enough to last until Tuesday the 13th when the game fully drops .
If you do a fair amount of developing with serial devices then you eventually reach a point where your computer has 20 or 30 comm ports listed as “ in use . ”
This can become a rather large annoyance when working with programs that only allow you to use the first 10 ports .
Sure , you can manually set a device to use a port that ’s listed as “ in use ” but this could potentially cause issues .
There ’s a trick that will let you see the hidden devices that are eating up your COM ports :
Enter set devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices=1 into Command Prompt Open Device Manager Click View ->
Show Hidden Devices
Now when you expand the section on COM ports , the non present COM ports will be in grey .
You can now easily remove any unwanted devices that are tying up COM ports by Right Clicking then selecting Uninstall .
After you are done , should you wish to hide these devices again you can do so by entering
set devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices=0 in Command Prompt .

creationists start circling ida ’s cadaver
Creationists believe that the scientific conclusions about Ida the fossil are a death blow to evolution .
In reality , they 're just attacking the much ridiculed hype generated by its discoverer .
Illustration of what Ida would ’ve looked like when she was alive
Hey , does anyone remember the most important discovery of all time by paleontologist Jørn Hurum ?
The one absolute proof of the theory of evolution and the greatest fossil ever found ?
Um , yeah .
About that .
Turns out it ’s actually just one of the countless evolutionary dead ends that has very little to do with hominids .
I ’ll give Jørn a moment to wipe the giant ostrich egg off his face and reconsider his ideas of doing science while acting like a circus sideshow barker and selling media and book rights without actually bothering to do the due diligence required by the scientific method and the process of peer review .
And worse yet , he ’s given vocal creationists fresh ammo for their constant assaults on science .
All they ’ll need to do is quote the recent headlines …
Just take a look at the comments on the story about Ida ’s failure to deliver and it ’s pretty clear that the vultures have picked up the scent and took to the air .
Some are even starting to take exploratory bites .
We ’ll get to that issue in just a minute , but first , let ’s go back to Jørn for a moment and emphasize that it ’s these kinds of crazy , ridiculous stunts that the peer review process is supposed to prevent .
By not letting experts review his work as he shouted his discovery from the rooftops as loudly as he could , amplified by a giant media klaxon , Hurum is now being very publicly revealed as an incompetent glory hound .
When you ’ve given the likes of Ken Ham good reason to laugh at you and say that the anti-science ravings of his crew were actually spot on in their analysis of an ancient fossil while you were off by a mile , you might as well just find another career .
Now , lest you think that the scientific community was enamored with the fossil until they realized that it was n’t all that and the alchemical formula for the Philosopher ’s Stone , let ’s review PZ ’s discontent with the hype , the skepticism voiced by Carl Zimmer , the bitterly snarky post from the astoundingly tame Ed Yong , and just for good measure , the disclaimer from New Scientist .
And this is just a very cursory sampling .
Keep in mind that Hurum and his team kept everything secret until the big reveal and had the media world ready to explode with the supposedly sensational news .
Even if Ida really was a very distant relative , the coverage was going to be overblown by any reasonable standard .
The doubt expressed by experts , and found to be correct , just adds insult to injury .
But in this case , with the creationist noise machine trying to keep up the manufactroversy , Jørn should ’ve been walking on eggshells and science journalists should ’ve checked ten times over whether they were being sold on nothing but hype and showmanship as SEED Magazine pointed out while the story made its rounds through the international media .
So to all the creationists out there , yes , Ida was an overhyped media property rather than some sort of proof of evolution as we know it .
However , the hype was in the media .
Scientists were skeptical , found the fossil to be just a wonderfully preserved specimen of an evolutionary dead end and are off to study the countless known and confirmed fossils that trace our lineage .
If you say that scientists were sure they confirmed everything they knew about modern biology when Ida was revealed , you ’re lying , plain and simple .
Your ideology has n’t been magically validated and evidence for it still totally absent .
And to Jørn Hurum , maybe spend a little more time on writing the paper and checking with other scientists before you announce that you found the remains of an alien spaceship or whatever it is you think will get you a spot in the history books , ok ?
England captain Strauss led his side to an Ashes victory this year
England 's scheduled defence of their Ashes crown in 2010 - 2011 has been revealed - with the New Year Test in Sydney delayed by a day .
Traditionally , it would begin on 2 January , but this time the players will get an extra day off to recover from the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne .
The series will feature the usual five matches , starting at the Gabba in Brisbane on 25 November .
As in 2006 - 07 , Adelaide and Perth will host the second and third Tests .
England will play three warm - up games against first - class opponents before the start of the series and one in between the second and third Tests .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
When England were thrashed 5 - 0 last time , they had only one first - class game before the first Test , although they did also play less competitive warm - up games against a President 's XI and New South Wales .
England and Wales Cricket Board chief executive David Collier said : " The recent Ashes Test series between the two sides was the sporting highlight of the summer and has really whetted the appetite of all cricket supporters as England seek to retain the Ashes next winter . "
606 : DEBATE
Notice how the Australians share the venues fairly unlike the London bias when Tests are played in the UK
FedupwithlabourSteve Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland added : " I know we have only just finished an Ashes series in England but I also know that the Aussie players - and Australian cricket in general - are already thinking about the Ashes series down under which starts in just over 12 months .
" Australia has a very good Ashes record at home and I 'm hopeful that will continue next summer and we can bring the urn back to Australia . "
2010 - 11 Ashes
Test series dates : First Test : 25 - 29 November , 2010 ( Brisbane ) Second Test : 3 - 7 December , 2010 ( Adelaide ) Third Test : 16 - 20 December , 2010 ( Perth ) Fourth Test : 26 -30 December , 2010 ( Melbourne ) Fifth Test : 3 - 7 January , 2011 ( Sydney )

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Greenlight Capital manager David Einhorn said Monday that his hedge fund firm is betting on the possibility of a major currency collapse and a surge in interest rates , citing ballooning government deficits in some of the world 's most developed countries .
Einhorn said Greenlight has been buying long - dated options on much higher interest rates in Japan and other developed regions , giving the firm the chance to make big profits from a jump in rates .
The options , bought from major banks , are tied to interest rates four to five years out , Einhorn noted .
In the case of Japan , rates have been very stable in that country for many years , so the options were relatively cheap .
Einhorn said the " asymmetry " of that trade was interesting .
If rates jump suddenly in Japan , Greenlight stands to make " multiples " on its positions , he added .

MOST rich democracies spend a lot of time and money trying to convince more people to exercise their right to vote .
So it might seem strange that some of the same countries take some trouble preventing thousands of citizens from going to the polls .
In 48 American states and seven European countries , including Britain , prisoners are forbidden from voting in elections .
Many more countries impose partial voting bans ( applying only to prisoners serving long sentences , for instance ) .
And in ten American states some criminals are stripped of the vote for life , even after their release .
There is scant public sympathy for characters such as Peter Chester , a British child - killer whose bid to use human - rights legislation to win the right to vote from his cell was rejected on October 28th ( see article ) .
But voting should not require a character test .
The punishment of monsters such as Mr Chester consists of the prolonged deprivation of liberty .
Withdrawing the vote from them only hammers home what they already believe : that normal social rules do not apply to them .
The antisocial contract
Liberty is by no means the only right to be squeezed in jail , where second - order freedoms such as the right to privacy , to family life and so on inevitably take a battering .
To some , the right to vote belongs in this category of minor , unavoidable privations .
But it is neither .
Those who believe in democracy ought to place the freedom to vote near the top of any list , and consider its removal a serious additional sanction .
And losing the ability to vote is no longer a practical consequence of imprisonment , as it may once have been .
Voting by proxy or post is easy nowadays ; indeed , prisoners awaiting trial in jail ( who are not banned from voting in most countries ) do so already .
These changes point up the fact that the withdrawal of the franchise is often a hangover of history rather than a carefully thought out sanction .
Take Britain , where the ban dates back to 1870 and makes little sense whichever side of the argument one is on .
Prisoners may vote if they are doing time for non-payment of fines or , strangely , contempt of court .
Those serving the new sentence of “ intermittent custody ” ( which means prison on some days and home on others ) may vote if the election falls on a day when they are outside , but not if they happen to be locked up .
Prisoners who have done their time but remain banged up for reasons of public protection are still forbidden from voting even though the punitive part of their sentence is over .
It is all too obviously a system based on habit rather than principle .
The principles retrospectively volunteered are wrong anyway .
Some say that withdrawing the right to vote teaches jailbirds that if they do n't play by society 's rules they cannot expect a hand in making them .
But it has yet to be shown that withholding the vote is an effective deterrent against offending .
If anything , it is likely to militate against prisoners ' rehabilitation .
One of the aims of imprisonment is to give miscreants a shove in the right direction , through job - training , Jesus or whatever does the trick .
Allowing prisoners to vote will not magically reconnect them with society , but it will probably do more good than excluding them .
Serving prisoners are not numerous enough to swing many elections .
But once a government uses disenfranchisement as a sanction , it is tempted to take things further .
Consider those American states where the suspension of prisoners ' votes has morphed into a lifelong ban : in Republican - controlled Florida , for instance , nearly a third of black men cannot vote — enough to have swung the 2000 presidential election .
Even those who do n't care much about prisoners ' rights should be wary of elected officials exercising too much say over who makes up the electorate .
According to The Dallas Morning News , it 's put up or shut up time for the top secessionist in Texas :
Activists call on Perry to follow through with secession
Rick Perry 's talk of secession appears to have buoyed efforts by Texas secessionists who want the governor to follow through .
At a rally Saturday on the Capitol steps , members of the of the Texas Nationalist Movement called on the governor and the Legislature to put a referendum on the state ballot on whether Texas should leave the union .
At an anti-tax " tea party " protest in April , Perry touted states rights and raised the possibility of secession .
On Saturday , secessionist speakers denounced the federal government in general - and the Obama administration in particular .
One speaker said , " We are aware that stepping off into secession may be a bloody war .
We understand ! "
Another self - styled patriot invoked George Washington as an ally of secession ( History lesson : Washington presided over creation of the union ) and Sam Houston - " You go ask Sam Houston what he thought about secession .
He did it anyway . "
( History lesson : Houston opposed secession .
He ran for governor as an independent Unionist in 1859 .
Despite his efforts , the people of Texas voted to secede , and he was forced out of office in March 1861 . )
Let ’s get something straight , America .
Charles Darwin was right .
Only 39 percent of you believe that , but his theory of evolution is the basis of modern biological science .
Deal with it .
A new film about the man ca n’t get distribution in the U.S. because — this is embarrassing just to type — 150 years after “ On the Origin of Species , ” he ’s too controversial in these parts .
— PS
Telegraph :
The film was chosen to open the Toronto Film Festival and has its British premiere on Sunday .
It has been sold in almost every territory around the world , from Australia to Scandinavia .
However , US distributors have resolutely passed on a film which will prove hugely divisive in a country where , according to a Gallup poll conducted in February , only 39 per cent of Americans believe in the theory of evolution .

Local filmmaker Lynn Shelton ’s Humpday beat a gargantuan at the box office this weekend thanks in large part to Capitol Hill moviegoers .
The indie flim laid low Bruno in the pre-destined blockbuster ’s debut weekend .
Kind of .
Bruno weighed in with more than $ 30 million in weekend box office receipts .
Humpday made $ 30,000 — but it played on only two screens :
The Angelika Film Center in NYC and right here on Capitol Hill at the Harvard Exit .
Bruno played on more than 3,000 .
There ’s a little grassroots marketing campaing for the accomplishment winding its way around Twitter this afternoon .
You can add a bit more to that per screen average — Humpday plays at the Harvard Exit three more times today .
And it ’s for a good cause .
A good showing this weekend will help propel the flick into a wide national release : “ The more butts I can get into seats this opening weekend the more the likelihood that this film will open in some multiplex in Podunk , U.S.A . ”
Jim Lehrer : Ahem .
If we could get started folks - please everyone take their seats .
We 've arranged this joint press conference / interview to set the record straight on some issues critical to the future of every American , and even every citizen of the world .
Though lacking in organization , there has been a dramatic rise in the number of bloggers , private analysts and internet forums claiming that the recent peak in oil production was a hoax , that there are in fact no limits to economic growth , that fiat marker capital accurately reflects remaining available flow rates of natural resources , and that capitalism and democracy actually could permanently improve the welfare of all the worlds citizens without fouling our only nest .
With me today are legendary social muckraker Warren Buffet , oil expert Daniel Yergin , and former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson .
Gentlemen : what do you make of these assertions ?
Warren Buffett : Well , if I may start Jim , these folks are extreme to say the least .
We all learn in school there are no perfect substitutes and that a marginal unit pricing system is completely ineffectual at predicting long term scarcity .
I think these online blogging battalions ought to look at the real world for a change - can't they see wide boundary limits to growth with their own eyes ?
The only time to buy these naive theories is on a day with no " y " in it .
Daniel Yergin : I totally agree with Warren .
With respect to oil , these bloggers claim that conventional media coverage of the oil supply fears in the 1880s , at the end of World War I and II and again in the 1970s were unneccessarily alarmist - in reality these were valid long horizon warning signs of technology advancing , but not keeping up with , depletion .
This is a misunderstood position : CERA has never claimed we were physically running out of oil , only that the bloggers ' ' Asian Phoenix ' and other fantastic scenarios do not incorporate rising costs , receding horizons of non-energy inputs , and environmental impacts .
These internet analysts are well intentioned , but frankly just do n't have the training our people do needed to understand these complex systems .
Jim Lehrer : Mr. Paulson ?
What do you have to add ?
Henry Paulson :
There is a long history of social malcontents thinking we can have unlimited growth , develop some perpetual energy machine , or completely replace primary wealth ( like oil and forests ) with tertiary markers like stocks , bonds and derivatives .
Science has pretty much closed the door on these faith based views of our planetary systems .
I think it is a danger to the stability of our steady state system to allow these type of fringe views to permeate our media .
Daniel Yergin :
That 's right Hank .
If we had unlimited resources , then why does the overburden continue to increase in virtually all metals and mineral extraction , which requires more energy to operate , which itself requires more metals and minerals .
These online analysts have probably never heard of a positive feedback loop !
Our field by field analysis of over 800 oil producing structures confirms that the 6.7 % decline rate for mature fields that is oft bandied about on the internet is grossly understated .
First , technology and high dollar prices caused us to suck out oil with a larger straw in the first half of these oil fields ' lives , than physical principles will allow in the second half .
Furthermore , the artificially high oil prices brought about by the fiat credit orgy made more supply appear than was sustainable - as investment ceases and as old oil infrastructure needs replacement , the decline rate the world will observe more closely approximate the natural decline rate of all fields .
And most of what we find today is small fields , which give sharp bursts of production followed by steep declines .
Warren Buffet : Interesting Danny -
I always say that if past history was all there was to the game , the richest people would be librarians , and the happiest too .
In the businessworld , the rearview mirror is always clearer than the windshield , but in the field of ecology , the windshield is usually a pretty good indicator of whats coming .
As far as these internet analysts pointing to indefinitely repealing the second law of thermodynamics , let the blockheads read what the blockheads wrote .
They point out that Mexican drilling activity is twice what it was a couple of years ago , as if all that is needed to pull oil from the ground is more capital .
Without oil , or similar quality energy , there is no capital .
We believe that according the name ' investors ' to institutions that trade solely on financial capital is like calling someone who repeatedly engages in one - night stands a ' romantic . '
These would - be - capitalists are in for a surprise - only when the tide goes out do you discover who 's been swimming naked .
Jim Lehrer : Expand on that please Mr. Buffett .
How does natural capital , like fossil fuels , impact financial marker capital ?
Warren Buffett : Imagine a spigot attached to a large underground cavern .
From the spigot comes a natural resource elixir which is variously consumed by the planets denizens , human and other .
The sun and our ecosystems gradually replenish what the cavern loses via the spigot .
Human sociopolitical systems dictate how wide the spigot is opened : capitalism , unchecked financial markets , and technology all open the spigot wider .
The wider the spigot , the faster the elixir depletes , and the more social tiers are created , which creates unstable and unsustainable tensions .
The kind of system being painted by these internet rebels would undergo a temporary increase in riches at the larger costs of destruction of global social and natural capital , unlikely to be replenished .
We have weekly strategy meetings at my fund , and like to think in as wide of boundaries as possible .
Our favorite holding period is forever .
What do we want to hold forever ?
Natural capital , social capital , built capital , and human capital .
What these blockheads are proposing would never make it through our committee .
Jim Lehrer : My gosh .
I imagine not .
Warren Buffet : Well Jim , you can imagine the reaction of my grandkids and yours if they found out we had depleted the natural capital beyond the ability to create new built infrastructure with bad financial tracking markers ?
I always say that should you find yourself in a chronically leaking boat , energy devoted to changing vessels is likely to be more productive than energy devoted to patching leaks , which is what the capitalist system advocated by these inciters would be a perpetual exercise in .
There seems to be some perverse human characteristic that likes to make easy things difficult .
Daniel Yergin :
There are only 2 things certain in life : death and EROI .
These resource cornucopians have never grasped that the major obstacle to the development of new natural capital is not geology or ecology but what happens above ground : international affairs , politics , investment and technology .
Henry Paulson : I 'll simplify it further Dan .
The concentration of wealth that would result from these internet analyst recommendations would imply only 2 options : a return to the feudal system or a hell of a dieoff .
Warren Buffet :
It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it .
If you think about that , you 'll do things differently .
Why would I listen to these pseudonymous resource cornucopians sprouting up all around the internet if I understand ecology , complex systems , biophysical economics and that the earth is round ( well , slightly spherical ) ?
People should spend time listening to the conventional media - the smarter the journalists are , the better off society is .
For to a degree , people read the press to inform themselves - and the better the teacher , the better the student body .
I have enough on my plate than to read these distracting treatises about the unlimited growth chimera by blockhead bloggers .
Henry Paulson : I find these penny - ante criticisms bubbling around the internet of our recent financial policies laughable .
The Federal Reserves duty is to maintain natural capital levels so that any short term drawdowns can be relatively quickly replenished with solar energy flows and net primary productivity , which we now have a full understanding of its quantity and dispersion .
The cornucopian chants for accelerating growth in the system via more debt are incredibly dangerous if taken seriously - you simply can't grow any socio- economic system by borrowing capital from yourself .
We are taking this step to secure permanent natural capital to stabilize ; to share ownership broadly among our citizens now and through future distribution ; and to permit us to use publicly traded securities to finance strategic acquisitions that we may contribute to a more secure future for all of us .
“ We are very confident about the long - term outlook for our biosphere , but believe that the immediate impact of recent policies will be a further weakening in the operating environment and a delay in reaching a steady state , ...
However , given decreased fiscal and monetary stimulus , we anticipate that long - term risks of future cannibalistic growth in our system should be less frequent and muted than previously expected . ”
Jim Lehrer :
Well what about those who claim that we went from wood to coal , and coal to oil and oil to gas - that we will similarly be able to more efficiently be able to harness sunlight and use this excess energy to recycle potentially scarce non-energy inputs ?
Do you ever get intimidated by these congressional analysts who are starting to throw barbed questions at you at hearings , with the sole intent to create a playing field where all their constituents can have more ?
Henry Paulson :
All can't have more - that is a delusion .
Some can have more , or more can have less .
I amuse myself a lot by sitting in those hearings and thinking what would happen if I said , " Do you realize what an idiotic question that is ? "
Jim Lehrer : Thank you gentlemen .
Let 's pause and field a few questions .
At last !
The new Arex I - X rocket — the first iteration of the rocket that will take humans back to the Moon and beyond — is out of NASA 's assembling facilities , and is now at Launch Pad 39B , getting ready for launch .

The assembled Ares I - X was mounted aboard NASA 's sandcrawler at Kennedy 's Vehicle Assembly Building at 1:39 a.m .
It arrived at Launch Pad 39B around 7:45 a.m .
The Ares I - X will test the viability of the 100 - meter high Ares I , NASA 's tallest , most powerful rocket since the Saturn V . The Saturn V was ten meters higher than Ares , and it remains the biggest , most powerful rocket ever launched .

After four months of failed talks and false hopes , is the Honduran crisis finally coming to an end ?
Late Thursday , after a group of US diplomats rushed to Honduras this week to restart negotiations that had broken down – yet again – interim President Roberto Micheletti announced that his negotiators will sign a deal as early as Friday that could include the return of ousted President Manuel Zelaya to the presidency .
After months of accusations by the international community that the Micheletti administration – which assumed office just hours after Mr. Zelaya was deposed June 28 – was stalling on negotiations , Mr. Micheletti said his willingness to reach a deal is a " significant concession " on his part .
" I have authorized my negotiating team to sign a deal that marks the beginning of the end of the country 's political situation , " he said in a statement .
Respect Nov. 29 election date
The deal would include the creation of a powersharing government and the promise on both sides that presidential elections slated for Nov. 29 will be respected .
It also would establish a truth commission and signal an end to international sanctions – slapped on Honduras by countries , including the US –in protest of Zelaya 's removal from office .
These were the original points agreed upon in a plan first unveiled by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias , a Nobel Peace Prize laureate , and later in negotiations launched by the Organization of American States ( OAS ) .
Both efforts broke down over the issue of Zelaya 's return to the presidency .
The difference now is that Micheletti is signaling that Zelaya could return to the helm of Honduras , pending a decision by Congress .
That is a plan that Zelaya had supported .
But Micheletti also says the Supreme Court must first weigh in .
The court had ordered the original arrest warrant for Zelaya , for disobeying a court order to scrap a vote to consider a constituent assembly .
And Congress voted to remove Zelaya from office .
Even members of Zelaya 's political party feared that he was ultimately seeking to modify presidential term limits for presidents .
Zelaya denies that was his motive .
Zelaya 's team has not commented on the deal , but the leader said on Radio Globo Thursday night that " tomorrow will be the day that the plan will be signed to restore democracy to the country . "
Many nations have threatened not to recognize the Nov. 29 race if Zelaya is not first returned to office .
Zelaya – popular among the poor who say he is the first president to pay attention to their needs – Zelaya snuck back into Honduras Sept. 21 and has since been holed up in the Brazilian Embassy .
Separately , the Micheletti government filed a case with the International Court of Justice in The Hague against Brazil for what it claims is the South American nation 's meddling in its internal affairs by granting Zelaya refuge .

Howard Dean has a good point on healthcare reform and the issue that a public option ( which is looking more and more like a reality in some form ) and many of the benefits of reform wo n't be made available to Americans until 2013 .
There 's danger in that , since it has been so much in the public eye for the past year .
" If the Democrats want to hold on to their majority , you 're going to have a problem , " he said .
That 's because the public option would n't be up and running until 2013 , long after the 2010 elections , meaning voters wo n't really see any benefits until long after the election .
To address that problem , Dean said Democrats need to do something that will have tangible results by next summer .
His proposal : opening up Medicare to people over the age of 50 so that a " certain mass " of people will already have benefited from health reform by the elections .
" You need to have people sign up for this program by July 2010 , " Dean said .
That 's an excellent idea from Dean .
Progress on healthcare reform , after it has been so prominent in public discussion for so long , and has been stressed as so critical for the country , has to be made in a concrete way for voters to see that there will be change , that Americans lives will be made better .
Because the part that has n't been talked about much is that all of this does n't happen until 2013 .
When that reality starts sinking in after all the voting and bill signing is over , there should be something in place to soften that blow .
Beyond the political benefits of expanding Medicare to more older workers , it'd be smart policy .

Sorry about that , folks .
Entire Colombian Soccer Team Murdered
Ten members of an amateur Colombian soccer team called Los Maniceros ( The Peanut Vendors ) have been found dead in Venezuela .
The team had been missing since October 11th after traveling to Chururu for a match .
On that day , police say 25 armed men stormed the field and “ asked the referee for the list of players on the Los Maniceros team , called out the players ’ names , lined them up and took them to an unknown destination . ”
On Saturday , 10 bodies were found in various locations around the area .
One “ lucky ” player managed to survive the ordeal , but had been shot in the neck and is still recovering in a hospital .
Venezuelan Vice President and Defense Minister Ramon Carrizalez blamed the attack on Colombians who were intent on taking an internal conflict across the border , while Colombian President Alvaro Uribe blamed terrorists and vowed his country ’s cooperation .
The National Liberation Army ( ELN ) is currently the prime suspect .
Whoever did it , there are going to be some scared soccer teams in that region due to the apparent randomness of this attack .
Prominent teams might expect to be targeted for kidnappings because of their status , but an amateur team of peanut vendors is hardly wealthy or influential .

Dear Straight Dope : Back in the 80s , when I was a teen , both my school and my Boy Scout troop were constantly pushing CPR training in our faces .
If everyone in America knew CPR , we were told , life would be transformed for the better .
So , 25 years later , has widespread CPR training truly changed life as we know it ?
( Personally , I 've never been called upon to perform CPR in my entire life , thankfully . )
Kevin Smith , Los Angeles
paperbackwriter replies :
Community CPR training has not by itself transformed life as we know it , but it is part of a suite of advances that have made heart attacks more survivable .
Other developments include improved emergency medical services and the greater availability of advanced life support ( ALS ) gear like defibrillators .
And administering CPR can definitely save lives ; I know this because I ’ve done it .
That ’s the good news .
The bad news is that even with immediate , prompt CPR and ALS , survival rates are worse than you might think .
As an EMT , I performed CPR on three patients ; only one survived long enough to be discharged from the hospital .
If anything , this success rate was above average .
Studies put survival rates for for victims of cardiac arrest who received CPR alone in the range of 5 to 25 percent , depending on circumstances .
If that sounds low , consider this : one study found survival rates doubled when a bystander initiated CPR promptly .
The two biggest factors that affect survival are ( a ) whether the victim ’s collapse was actually witnessed by a person trained in CPR and ( b ) whether the witness was a stranger or not .
Factor ( a ) is pretty simple : if the collapse is witnessed , then the delay in starting CPR is typically minimal and thus damage to the brain from oxygen starvation is reduced .
The details concerning factor ( b ) are perhaps more surprising : bystanders trained in CPR are less likely to initiate CPR if they know the cardiac arrest victim ; strangers are 4.6 times more likely to initiate CPR than bystanders known by the victim .
Why ?
Reasons given to researchers for failing to administer CPR mostly boiled down to panic .
So if you ’re planning on having a heart attack , I recommend you arrange to have a trained stranger on hand who can start CPR immediately upon your collapse .
Most people , of course , do n’t get the opportunity for such planning , meaning it ’s key that lots and lots of people be trained in CPR .
One study calculated for each person actually saved by CPR , 12,306 people have to have received CPR training .
Survival rates are higher in those communities where automated external defibrillators ( AEDs ) are available in places like airports , community centers , office buildings , and police cars .
AEDs can increase survival rates by 22 to 39 percent .
That does n’t mean they ’ve made CPR obsolete .
Not all heart attacks are due to ventricular fibrillation , the electrical malfunction that defibrillators correct ; CPR will keep blood flowing to the brain in these cases and when defibrillators are not available .

Several months earlier , we made an attempt to show how chess is beneficial to your mind .
But that was aimed at beginners and amateurs so that they may seriously pursue their interest in chess not only for just fun and enjoyment but also for its other beneficial effects .
Here we are trying to take it one step ahead to address parents with young children on how playing chess can be good for the whole family .
We firmly believe that any caring and sensible parent will like to see their children growing up to be intelligent , rational human beings who will make a success of their lives and be pillars of the society .
The level and quality of interaction between the child and parents have a profound impact on the life and outlook when the child reaches adulthood .
Developing an interest in chess and sharing it with children can be one of the ways , an enjoyable one too , which can help in this pursuit .
We are trying to put our thoughts on areas where chess can make a positive contribution .
However , only at a few places we have referred to the child , leaving other benefits to be understood by parents and then to be explained by examples to their children .
For example , without looking at the board at the start of a game , you can tell the child that if he moves his KP , his KB can go to the white square on the fourth row in front of his QB , from where it can target your black KBP on its white square .
The child looks at the board , tries to play it out and accepts that what you said is true .
You explain how visualization and planning works and encourage him to do that – you can make it a new kind of game between you and your child .
You have to use your ideas on how to expose him to the other areas of the game so that he can reap the benefits .
1. Inquisitiveness – fueling the urge to learn
If you have observed the growing years of a child , what is sure to strike you is the unbounded inquisitiveness of a child .
This lies behind the learning of any new subject or ideas .
It is like a fire inside which needs constant supply of fresh fuel to sustain it .
When he throws a toy , he is not being ‘ naughty ’ but trying to find out what happens if he throws it ( a rubber ball bounces a lot , the toy car does not ) or the kind of sound it makes .
He puts things in his mouth to find out the difference in tastes .
When he breaks a toy , he is trying to find out what lies inside or what makes it ‘ tick ’ !
But he may also be doing it simply to draw attention and seek company .
You may have also noticed that a child soon loses interest in something that only a few weeks earlier was the dearest item .
Why ?
Because he has learnt everything that was to know about it within his realm of experience and now looks for something fresh !
Only problem is that such inquisitiveness may get on to the nerves of the harassed young parents , increasing their household chores to clear up the ‘ mess ’ .
By teaching and playing chess with them , you can give them something that will sustain the interest for long , become more intriguing as they learn more , provide a challenge and at the same time ensure companionship ( you can not play chess with yourself ! ) .
You thus channel their energy in lines that help both the child and you as parent to develop …
2. Understanding and learning – one branch leads to another
Any exercise of the mind helps in its growth and what better exercise than trying to learn the intricacies of chess !
Basically , chess is not at all a complicated game as far as rules are concerned .
All you need to know is :
the initial arrangement of pieces and pawns
White ’s first move
check and checkmate
capture as a part of movement
15 types of moves 6 for six types of chessmen with their individual but single rule of movement 4 more for the King ( K - side castling , Q - side castling , not moving to a square controlled by opponent ’s piece , immunity from capture ) 5 more for the Pawn ( initial double step forward , no backtracking , diagonal capture , en passant , promotion )
Other rules are for tournaments and can be disregarded in your family game .
Therefore , starting on chess is much less daunting than what the uninitiated may think !
But its pursuit builds up the ability to learn and understand .
These mental faculties can be used in any other walks of life provided these can be retained in …
3. Memory – the mental links
It is said that all we have experienced in life – seeing , reading , tasting , hearing , feeling and so on – from the first day of our life get stored somewhere in our brain .
Unfortunately there is no direct link from our conscious mind to most ( possibly 90 % ) of these and we are unable to recollect the information .
Our memory covers only those for which such link can be traced readily .
The more links we can establish , the more we approach a super - memory and the benefits are easy to perceive .
It has been held by memory experts that repetition or regular exercise of mind to recollect the links helps in improving the size and strength of this memory domain .
Chess provides an opportunity in this as you and your child try to learn from past experience ( which is memory ) and from studies of chess openings , chess tactics , master games and so on .
Once a child understands that paying attention , mulling things in your mind and repeated practice help in remembering , he can apply it to his other studies also .
It will also become apparent that though there are some items that need to be learnt by rote ( like multiplication tables ) before you understand them , most others are easier to remember if you try to see the underlying meaning and principle like the chess opening theories .
In short , you start looking for the …
4. Logic – making sense of things apparently incoherent
In chess , every strategy , every opening , every move , tactics , combination has a logical thinking behind it .
There are no imponderables – only a flaw or deficiency in the logic or limitation to the depth of analysis .
These shortcomings start getting remedied with experience when the right logic builds up to replace the flawed ones .
The development of logical ability is all - pervading , with practice it comes into play in whatever activities you may undertake .
Arising out of this logic comes …
5. Analytical ability – understanding cause - effect relationship
The correct sense of logic leads you and your child to carry out analysis to read any situation even if it is something unfamiliar .
In chess , all the brilliant combinations that one sees are the end results of the deep analysis by the player concerned .
To improve your game , it becomes incumbent on you to read any position in your game to identify strong and weak areas , possible moves and counter - moves , and to select the line that is expected to yield an advantage for you .
This kind of analysis becomes a habit which supports …
6. Problem solving – the tactical ability
The techniques that you apply over the board in a game of chess help to give you a sharp mind and this incisiveness can cut through obstacles in other fields of activity .
This also paves the way to anticipate problems rather than getting caught unawares .
This ability to foresee prompts you to look for an appropriate course of action that calls for …
7. Planning – the strategy before the tactics
It is thinking ahead to consider the different possibilities ( the lines of play for your game of chess ) so that you are ready beforehand and can take control of the direction the events should take .
You are in charge of the situation rather than the other way round .
When you are planning , everything is happening in your mind and yet to become a reality .
This ability develops the power of …
8. Abstract thinking – seeing it in your mind ’s eye
This tends to be a weak area for most people and those who can do it naturally enjoy an upper hand vis -à - vis the others .
If you apply your mind to it , you will realize that practice of chess and gaining proficiency in it necessarily involves thinking of this type .
You may argue that all thinking is abstract as compared to reality !
Here we do not mean a thought in isolation like what to have for your dinner , but thinking about a series of moves and counter - moves and the resultant board positions before we put them into action .
Once you are adept at this , you can see yourself before an interview board and answering their questions !
But such a sustained thought process needs you to develop your …
9. Concentration – focusing your mind
If you sit back and think , you will realize that your untrained mind is like a monkey jumping from tree to tree , branch to branch , without spending any length of time anywhere .
Only with intense thinking on a subject , as happens when you are working out a set of moves on the chessboard , you develop the ability to concentrate .
We are not talking of a single subject , rather a line of thinking related to the subject covering different possibilities .
The power of concentration is a requisite for …
10 . Vision and Imagination – beyond the routine
With more experience , you can take any activity to a certain level but sequential thinking can take you only that far .
To go beyond the mundane , you have to break out of routine and develop ‘ tangential ’ thinking .
A deep study of chess games by brilliant masters exposes you to this lateral thinking and the beauty of such ‘ unpredictable ’ moves .
All great ideas and inventions some way involve such vision on the part of the proponent .
Chess can be a conduit for developing your child ’s mind towards …
11 . Inventiveness and Creativity – something out of nothing
As your child keeps learning , playing , improving his game and enjoying the free flow of his ideas , his mind is ready to add that 1 % inspiration to his 99 % perspiration , all possible through your active support and guidance .
When that happens , you get a genius in your family !
The realization of his ability gives your child …
12 . Self - confidence – standing on his own
To be successful in any field , a person needs to do away with all doubts nagging his mind and to be confident in his own abilities .
Do not be indulgent , let him fight it out with you over the board .
If you become easy meat , let him not be complacent .
Take him over to local chess club , encourage him to join school tournaments and do similar things to throw new challenges in his path .
This will develop his ability to …
13 . Face Challenges – toughening the steel inside
As they say , life is full of challenges and the sooner a child learns to face up to it , the better he can rise above his surroundings .
Mankind has always revered the winner and your child will soon …
14 . Earn peer respect – incentive to grow
That is what you hopefully expected of your child , did n’t you ?
He stands tall and you are proud of him .
Being the school champion , town champion , state champion ….
Earning admiration in one field opens many doors to other fields for him to explore and excel .
This can stand him in good stead towards …
15 . Choice of careers – prestige of being a ‘ brainy ’ person
The perception of chess players as men of high intelligence makes such people to be welcomed by many organizations .
After all , you want a success for your child in the material world also !
But this is probably too far down the road .
What is now more important and precious for you and your child is …
16 . Fun and enjoyment – release from tension
Going back to where we started – how to manage your child without stress – and to bring more fun and enjoyment in the family life and the great feeling of togetherness that can last for years to come through …
17 . Family bonds – the closeness to one another
In these days when more and more families seem to be breaking up and the communication gap between children and parents become barriers in understanding , the worth of family bonds does not need to be stressed .
These bonds prevent children from going astray and inculcate in them a respect for values in life .
Such children grow up to be better adjusted human beings who contribute to …
18 . Positive social interaction – sign of a good society
The value system today ’s children learn affect their behavior as parents of future and more positive the outlook , the better is the community .
Such a society induces the children and youth of impressionable age to remain happily a part of it and is the most effective …
19 . Deterrent to bad habits and company
Birds of same feathers flock together – be it well - adjusted people or ill - adjusted people .
The better the parents contribute to raise their children creating a sense of belonging , the less is the chance of such children becoming social misfits .
If all this induces you as a parent to make chess a source of family entertainment , go ahead but do n’t forget to take care of two pitfalls .
Chess may be considered a sedate activity by many but experienced tournament players can tell you that intense competition can sap energy like any other grueling physical activity .
Examples abound where top grandmasters fared poorly when they were lacking in fitness .
So you must ensure that side by side with chess , your children participate in outdoor games and activities also .
The other issue is to see that the child does not remain so much engrossed in chess as to become a recluse .
Sharing indoor and outdoor activities with your child can avoid these side effects .
20 .
As a side issue related to mental development of your child , I would like to bring a topic that interested me greatly .
I am quoting from memory , so there may be some difference between the original text and my interpretation of it .
I apologize in advance if someone finds such discrepancy .
I tried this new Dora Pudding どらぷりん today that I picked up at the Family Mart .
This is a mix between a dorayaki , azuki bean filled pancake , and purin , custard pudding .
I was expecting pudding and azuki inside the pancake but was surprised to see just the purin .
Still it tasted good enough for me to want to buy more .
One point to remember though is that you need to keep this in the fridge .
I would normally not worry so much with a dorayaki , but the custard pudding here will go off if it sits out for too long .
Have you ever tried dorayaki ?
Are you a fan ?

Republicans charged Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - Fla. ) with breaking House ethics rules and election law Wednesday by linking a new political website to his official website .
The new site , namesofthedead.com , seizes on Grayson ’s comment on the House floor that the Republican healthcare plan is for people to “ die quickly . ”
It invites visitors to log - in the names and stories of friends and relatives who died because they lacked health insurance .
ADVERTISEMENT
Users are prompted to enter their name , address , zip code and e-mail address , as well as their friend ’s or relative ’s name , hometown and story .
Grayson announced the creation of the site on the House floor Wednesday and displayed a poster with the site ’s address .
He said the names of those who die because of a lack of health insurance should be identified .
“ I propose that we honor their memory by naming them , ” he said , concluding his remarks by stating that with healthcare reform , “ no one will ever die in America because they ca n’t see a doctor . ”
Grayson , who paid for the new site with his own money , became an overnight sensation with his “ die quickly ” floor remarks and has attempted to seize on the controversy to raise campaign funds .
The National Republican Congressional Committee ( NRCC ) slammed the site ’s content and said it violated a number of House ethics rules and campaign laws , including prohibitions against floor speeches intended to direct people to campaign websites .
Lawmakers are also not permitted to use personal funds to subsidize official House business , an NRCC spokesman said .
The NRCC also noted that the new site links to both Grayson ’s campaign website and his official House website .
Commingling publicly funded congressional communications and campaign communications is prohibited .
The NRCC spokesman added that the site also violates campaign law because Grayson paid for it without directing the personal funds through a campaign committee .
“ Whatever excuse he wants to say ... it does n’t matter .
Either way it appears to violate a rule . ”
“ What is wrong with this man ?
Alan Grayson ’s morbid exploitation of ‘ the dead ’ for personal political gain may be the most shameless stunt he ’s pulled yet , ” said NRCC spokesman Andy Seré in a statement .
“ Once again , he ’s proved himself to be an abject embarrassment to Central Floridians who want more than a circus clown for a congressman . ”
Grayson did not respond to a request for comment by press time .

Grayson has repeatedly defended his original remarks , which were attacked by Republicans but brought the lawmaker new support from the left .
“ I apologize to the dead and their families that we have n’t voted sooner to end this holocaust in America , ” Grayson said a day after the “ die quickly ” remark .
Grayson has frequently cited a Harvard study that claims 44,000 Americans die every year due to lack of health insurance .
Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) Dr. Barbara Starfield of the Johns Hopkins School of
Hygiene and Public Health describes how the US health care system
may contribute to poor health .
ALL THESE ARE DEATHS PER YEAR :
12,000 -----unnecessary surgery ( 8 )
7,000 ----- medication errors in hospitals ( 9 )
20,000 ----- other errors in hospitals ( 10 )
80,000 ----- infections in hospitals ( 10 )
106,000 ---- non - error , negative effects of drugs ( 2 )
These total to 250,000 deaths per year from iatrogenic causes !!
What does the word " iatrogenic " mean ?
This term is defined as induced in a
patient by a physician 's activity , manner , or therapy .
Used especially of a
complication of treatment .
Dr. Starfield offers several warnings in interpreting these numbers :
First , most of the data are derived from studies in hospitalized patients .
Second , these estimates are for deaths only and do not include negative
effects that are associated with disability or discomfort .
Third , the
estimates of death due to error are lower than those in the IOM report .
[ Remember , only 60,000 Americans lost their life in the entire Vietnam war !- KSM ]
(1) If the higher estimates are used , the deaths due to iatrogenic causes
would range from 230,000 to 284,000 .
In any case , 225,000 deaths per year
constitutes the third leading cause of death in the United States , after
deaths from heart disease and cancer .
Even if these figures are
overestimated , there is a wide margin between these numbers of deaths and
the next leading cause of death ( cerebrovascular disease ) .
Another analysis ( 11 ) concluded that between 4 % and 18 % of consecutive
patients experience negative effects in outpatient settings , with :
116 million extra physician visits
77 million extra prescriptions
17 million emergency department visits
8 million hospitalizations
3 million long - term admissions
199,000 additional deaths
$ 77 billion in extra costs
The high cost of the health care system is considered to be a deficit , but
seems to be tolerated under the assumption that better health results from
more expensive care .
However , evidence from a few studies indicates that as many as 20 % to 30 %
of patients receive inappropriate care .
An estimated 44,000 to 98,000 among them die each year as a result of
medical errors . ( 2 )
This might be tolerated if it resulted in better health , but does it ?
Of 13
countries in a recent comparison , the United States ranks an average of
12th ( second from the bottom ) for 16 available health indicators .
More
specifically , the ranking of the US on several indicators was :
13th ( last ) for low - birth - weight percentages
13th for neonatal mortality and infant mortality overall 14
11th for post neonatal mortality
13th for years of potential life lost ( excluding external causes )
11th for life expectancy at 1 year for females , 12th for males
10th for life expectancy at 15 years for females , 12th for males
10th for life expectancy at 40 years for females , 9th for males
7th for life expectancy at 65 years for females , 7th for males
3rd for life expectancy at 80 years for females , 3rd for males
10th for age - adjusted mortality
The poor performance of the US was recently confirmed by a World Health
Organization study , which used different data and ranked the United States
as 15th among 25 industrialized countries .
There is a perception that the American public " behaves badly " by smoking ,
drinking , and perpetrating violence . "
However the data does not support
this assertion .
The proportion of females who smoke ranges from 14 % in Japan to 41 % in
Denmark ; in the United States , it is 24 % ( fifth best ) .
For males , the range
is from 26 % in Sweden to 61 % in Japan ; it is 28 % in the United States ( third
best ) .
The US ranks fifth best for alcoholic beverage consumption .
The US has relatively low consumption of animal fats ( fifth lowest in men
aged 55 - 64 years in 20 industrialized countries ) and the third lowest mean
cholesterol concentrations among men aged 50 to 70 years among 13
industrialized countries .
These estimates of death due to error are lower than those in a recent
Institutes of Medicine report ( and as said if higher estimates are used ,
deaths due to iatrogenic causes would range from 230,000 to 284,000 ) .
Even at the lower estimate of 225,000 deaths per year , this constitutes the
third leading cause of death in the US , following heart disease and cancer .
Lack of technology is certainly not a contributing factor to the US 's low
ranking .
Among 29 countries , the United States is second only to Japan in the
availability of magnetic resonance imaging units and computed tomography
scanners per million population .
Japan , however , ranks highest on health ,
whereas the US ranks among the lowest .
It is possible that the high use of technology in Japan is limited to
diagnostic technology not matched by high rates of treatment , whereas in
the US , high use of diagnostic technology may be linked to more treatment .
Supporting this possibility are data showing that the number of employees
per bed ( full - time equivalents ) in the United States is highest among the
countries ranked , whereas they are very low in Japan , far lower than can be
accounted for by the common practice of having family members rather than
hospital staff provide the amenities of hospital care .

COMMENT : Folks , this is what they call a " Landmark Article " .
Only several
ones like this are published every year .
One of the major reasons it is so
huge is that it is published in JAMA which is the largest and one of the
most respected medical journals in the entire world .
I did find it most
curious that the best wire service in the world , Reuter 's , did not pick up
this article .
I have no idea why they let it slip by .
I would encourage you to bookmark this article and review it several times
so you can use the statistics to counter the arguments of your friends and
relatives who are so enthralled with the traditional medical paradigm .
These statistics prove very clearly that the system is just not working .
It is
broken and is in desperate need of repair .
I was previously fond of saying that drugs are the fourth leading cause of
death in this country .
However , this article makes it quite clear that the
more powerful number is that doctors are the third leading cause of death
in this country killing nearly a quarter million people a year .
The only more
common causes are cancer and heart disease .
This statistic is likely to be
seriously underestimated as much of the coding only describes the cause of
organ failure and does not address iatrogenic causes at all .
Japan seems to have benefited from recognizing that technology is
wonderful , but just because you diagnose something with it , one should not
be committed to undergoing treatment in the traditional paradigm .
Their
health statistics reflect this aspect of their philosophy as much of their
treatment is not treatment at all , but loving care rendered in the home .
Care , not treatment , is the answer .
Drugs , surgery and hospitals are rarely
the answer to chronic health problems .
Facilitating the God - given healing
capacity that all of us have is the key .
Improving the diet , exercise , and
lifestyle are basic .
Effective interventions for the underlying emotional
and piritual wounding behind most chronic illness are also important clues
to aximizing health and reducing disease .

The medical field is always looking for ways to cure diseases .
Even in the Medieval or ancient times , they would come up with plausible solutions for what was ailing the patient .
Things in today ’s society are a little more sophisticated than back then , but there are still some bizarre treatments for sicknesses and diseases .
Clysters
This procedure consists of introducing liquids into the rectum or colon .
This procedure would cause the intestines to inflate causing all the backed up toxins to evacuate the body .
This was seen as a way of administering drugs into the system for faster relief of upset stomachs .
Link
Bloodletting
It was believed that removing a substantial amount of blood would prevent or cure diseases .
When a person was thought to have high blood pressure , they would use this method to reduce it .
They believed that purging the blood would cure diseases and it would help the blood to circulate better .
If you have a fever , headache , or apoplexy DEHE , which was stroke like or seizure symptoms , they would perform this procedure near the area that was affected .
The thought was that if it was performed there then the ailment would be healed .
Link
Spells
It was believed that a person of the pagan faith could heal a person .
Of the person that was sick was visited by a pagan and they looked under a rock to see something living , then they would survive the ailment .
These people were then asked to repent for their sins .
They were told that this would help in the curing process .
Link
Dwale
This was the term for potions used during surgeries .
The patients needed to sleep during the procedures , but the use of just the hemlock plant was potentially lethal .
A mixture of lettuce juice , gall from a castrated boar , briony , opium , henbane , hemlock juice and vinegar mixed with wine would put the patient to sleep .
The dwale had the potential of being to strong and killing the patient during the procedure .
Link
Potato Peels
These are used to treat burns .
It has been found out that if you use a potato peel on a fresh burn it will heel faster than the traditional bandage .
The advantages of this are it is cheap , non-sticky , heals fast , patients wo n’t cry out when it is removed , and it will keep the skin moist .
A burn victim loses moisture through the evaporation occurring from the wound , but the potato can help prevent that from happening .
Aside from moisture qualities of a potato peel , they also have anti-bacterial properties .
Link
Vinegar
According to various studies , pouring vinegar on a jellyfish sting can stop the venom that is released by the sting .
If you remove all the tentacles and then pouring vinegar on the wound would alleviate the pain and stop the release of more venom into your system .
Link
Hydrotherapy
This procedure involved just taking a bath in order to soothe pain and get rid of diseases .
It used to be believed that taking a bath with oils and flowers or bathing in spring water would cure what was ailing you .
Some doctors took this idea to the extreme though and would take up the practice of wrapping their patients in ice cold towels , spraying them down with high pressured water hoses , or submerging them in baths for hours or days , only letting them out to use the bathroom .
Hydrotherapy can still be found today for treatments of arthritis , ankylosing , spondylitis , spinal cord injuries , burns , spasticity , stroke , or paralysis .

Chemically Induced Seizures
This practiced was used by a Hungarian pathologist .
He claimed that seizure patients did not exhibit signs of schizophrenia and they were happy after a seizure occurred , so inducing one in a schizophrenic patient would in turn make them happy and cure them .
He tested a few drugs to make the seizures occur , but settled on one called metrazol .
He had some success with this procedure , because of the chemical in the brain releases after a seizure calmed the patients , but it was frowned upon due to the side effects , which included possible injuries and a continued pattern of seizures .
Link
Lobotomy
This is a surgical procedure that involves removing the front portion of someone ’s brain .
For 20yrs this treatment was used to treat schizophrenia , clinical depression , other anxiety disorders , moodiness , or a defiant youth .
After antipsychotic drugs were discovered , this procedure was no longer used and it was considered one of the biggest medical mistakes to take place .
Read about Lobotomy Victims and Their Life Afterwards .
Link
Trepanation
This procedure consists of drilling a hole in the brain in order to relieve a disease that may be occurring in the brain .
It was believed that the practice would cure epileptic seizures , migraines , and mental disorders .
This practice is still used today when swelling of the brain occurs due to a head injury , or when blood appears under the finger nail , they will drill a hole and it is often referred to by the same name .
People that lay on a bed of nails are thought to be performing a version of this procedure , because it is releasing pressure from blood vessels under the skin .

The music of geography : Ohio is a piano
Last month , as I was driving through Ohio to collect my final three counties in the state , it dawned on me :
There are 88 counties in this state .
There are 88 keys on a piano .
I do n’t know anything about music , but holy crap , I have to make a map based on this coincidence .
And so I did , bit by bit , gradually descending into madness in the process .
It has no purpose , really , apart from being an experiment in some sort of weird artistic musical cartography .
Ohio is a piano .
Check it out .
( It ’s in Flash . )
The premise is simply that each of the 88 piano keys is assigned to a single Ohio county .
How the keys are mapped to the counties depends on a specified data attribute : the notes and counties are ordered by that attribute and then linked to one another .
For example , if the chosen attribute is population , the county with the lowest population is assigned the lowest - frequency piano key , the county with the highest population is assigned the highest - frequency piano key , and so on .
The data I have here are a little out of date , but that does n’t matter for demonstrating the idea .
There are many directions one could go from here .
I have chosen a few ways to see the geography of music ( songs ) and hear the music of geography ( data , metro areas , or sequences based on Google Maps routing ) .
In my experience , most of it sounds like crap , apart from the provided simplified bits of actual songs of course , although even those might sound wrong ( but hey , blame the sheet music I found ) .
( Update : Screw it , the Beethoven piece was too horribly out of key , so it ’s gone . )
But I would be very interested to hear if anyone discovers any patterns that sound decent .
What ’s missing , of course , is the ability to compose your own geographic music , that is , bringing in your own songs , sequencing counties into songs , seeing the data and grouping it in different ways , making your own chords and routes , and so on .
That and controlling the music from the piano as well as the map .
Compositionally , for now you ’re stuck with just moving the mouse over the map , but perhaps you can imagine how this concept could be turned into a full - fledged crazy musical cartography application .
A couple final caveats : 1 ) the piano sounds are exported from GarageBand and on the high end do n’t seem to sound great , and 2 ) this little application is not at all idiot - proofed , so my apologies if you are an idiot .
This is just a demonstration of a ridiculous concept ; it ’s hardly worth the effort to make it a well - designed , smoothly functioning application .
For now , no stop buttons , nothing to keep you from playing a cacophony of all the options at once … go nuts , it ’s kind of more fun anyway .
Cartographically speaking …
Sonification of data is reasonably commonplace : think metal detectors and Geiger counters .
Representing spatial data using sound is a subject about which I know little , but it is an active research topic in cartography .
Obviously what I have made here is necessarily an example of mapping with sound , although I do n’t believe it to be especially useful for understanding data .
It is , rather , artistic in intent , allowing one to hear the “ music ” of the data and geography ( whatever that means ) rather than actually explore the data values .
Many , if not most , endeavors in using sound for thematic maps will refer back to a 1994 article by John Krygier ( my future undergraduate advisor at Ohio Wesleyan University ) called Sound and Geographic Visualization .
He has reprinted the article on his Making Maps site .
Krygier proposed explaining audio maps through a set of abstract sound variables ( above , as reprinted in Alan MacEachren ’s How Maps Work ) , analogous to Jacques Bertin ’s graphic variables that are a basis for ordinary thematic mapping .
Relative differences in these variables can be used to make data comparisons .
Following the path from Krygier ’s article will take you to a number of examples of further research or attempts to use sound to enhance or independently convey map data .
Using sound for thematic mapping has also been of interest to those seeking to assist blind or otherwise visually - impaired map users .
The HCI folks at the University of Maryland , for example , have worked on software for that purpose .
( And I believe I ’ve seen Maryland names , such as the famous Ben Shneiderman , on more general articles about using sound to represent map data . )
Anyway , like I said , it ’s not an area of my expertise .
I ’ll just stick to the impractical , wannabe artsy stuff .

How To Limit CPU Usage Of A Process With cpulimit ( Debian / Ubuntu )
Version 1.0
Author : Falko Timme
Follow me on Twitter
This tutorial shows how you can limit the CPU usage of a process with the tool cpulimit on Debian / Ubuntu .
cpulimit is a simple program that attempts to limit the CPU usage of a process ( expressed in percentage , not in cpu time ) .
This is useful to control batch jobs , when you do n't want them to eat too much CPU .
It does not act on the nice value or other scheduling priority stuff , but on the real CPU usage .
Also , it is able to adapt itself to the overall system load , dynamically and quickly .
I do not issue any guarantee that this will work for you !
1 Preliminary Note
I will run all commands in this tutorial as the root user , so either log in as root directly ( Debian ) or become root like this ( Ubuntu ) :
sudo su
If your machine has one processor you can limit the percentage from 0 % to 100 % , which means that if you set for example 50 % , your process cannot use more than 500 ms of cpu time for each second .
But if your machine has four processors , percentage may vary from 0 % to 400 % , so setting the limit to 200 % means to use no more than half of the available power .
In any case , the percentage is the same of what you see when you run top .
cpulimit should run at least with the same user running the controlled process .
But it is much better if you run cpulimit as root , in order to have a higher priority and a more precise control .
2 Installing cpulimit
cpulimit is available as a package for Debian and Ubuntu , so it can be installed as follows :
aptitude install cpulimit
3 Using cpulimit
Take a look at the cpulimit man page to learn how to use it :
man cpulimit
NAME
cpulimit -- limits the CPU usage of a process
SYNOPSIS
cpulimit TARGET [ OPTIONS ...]
DESCRIPTION
TARGET must be exactly one of these :
-p , --pid=N
pid of the process
-e , --exe=FILE
name of the executable program file
-P , --path=PATH
absolute path name of the executable program file
OPTIONS
-l , -- limit=N
percentage of CPU allowed from 0 to 100 ( mandatory )
-v , --verbose
show control statistics
-z , -- lazy
exit if there is no suitable target process , or if it dies
-h , -- help
display this help and exit
EXAMPLES
Assuming you have started " foo -- bar " and you find out with to p ( 1 ) or ps ( 1 ) that this process uses all your CPU
time you can either
# cpulimit -e foo -l 50
limits the CPU usage of the process by acting on the executable program file ( note : the argument " - - bar " is
omitted )
# cpulimit -p 1234 -l 50
limits the CPU usage of the process by acting on its PID , as shown by ps(1 )
# cpulimit - P /usr / bin / foo -l 50
same as -e but uses the absolute path name
AUTHOR
This manpage was written for the Debian project by gregor herrmann < [ email protected ] > but may be used
by others .
Now let 's assume we want to limit the process apache2 to 30 % .
This is how we do it :
cpulimit -e apache2 -l 30
The -e switch takes the name of the executable program file .
You can take that name from the output of the top command .
Instead of using the name of the executable program file , we can use the process ID with the -p switch .
You can find out the process ID of the apache2 process as follows :
ps aux
or
ps aux | grep apache2
Let 's assume the apache2 process ID is 4510 ; we can then limit that process to 30 % CPU usage as follows :
cpulimit -p 4510 -l 30
Instead of using the name of the executable file ( - e ) of the process ID ( - p ) , we can also pass the absolute path name of the executable program file to cpulimit with the - P switch ; the absolute path name of the apache2 executable is / usr / sbin / apache2 so we 'd use the following command :
cpulimit - P /usr / sbin/ apache2 -l 30
Please note that cpulimit will run in the foreground of your terminal until you terminate it with CTRL+C - terminating it will also remove any CPU limits .

Advertisement Riot police in the western Chinese city of Urumqi have used tear gas to disperse crowds in a third day of protests over public safety fears .
There has been growing anger over attacks with hypodermic needles .
Han Chinese in the city say they have been targeted in the attacks .
They are also calling for quicker trials for people charged in July 's ethnic riots .
Almost 200 people , most of them Han Chinese , were killed in violence with ethnic Uighurs in Urumqi .
Chinese authorities blame Uighur separatists for July 's violence , saying it was orchestrated by Uighur separatists in exile .
Xinjiang 's population is split between mainly - Muslim Uighurs and Han Chinese - the country 's majority ethnic group .
Stand - off
The BBC's Michael Bristow , in Urumqi , describes the situation as tense , as riot police move around the city to break up angry crowds gathering at intersections .
Police were guarding the central People 's Square - scene of a large demonstration on Thursday - and waiting at roadblocks and in lorries parked on side streets .
Police moved to contain the protesters in Urumqi on Thursday
There were scuffles at one intersection as police moved in to arrest several protesters , our correspondent says .
Authorities have announced a ban on " all gatherings , marches or protests on roads or other public venues , " the state - run Xinhua news agency said .
Large numbers of police were deployed overnight in the city after tens of thousands of Han Chinese protested in central areas on Thursday .
Safety fears
A series of unexplained stabbings using hypodermic syringes appears to have triggered the protests .
Chinese media said that nearly 500 people , almost all Han , have sought treatment for stabbings in the past few weeks .
Reports said 89 people had " clear syringe marks " but that no - one had been infected or poisoned .
A businessman in Urumqi told the BBC on Thursday that many members of the Han community had joined the demonstrations .
Another Han resident said he was concerned for his safety .
" The local government is not doing enough to protect Han people there ...
I am really [ worried about ] my family and relatives there .
[ The ]
Chinese government should do more to prevent this , " he told the BBC .
There is also anger over what many perceive as official slowness in punishing suspects charged for July 's riots .
Protesters have accused the provincial government of being " useless " , and some even called for the dismissal of regional Communist Party boss Wang Lequan , who is thought to be an ally of President Hu Jintao .
Ethnic tension
The tension between Xinjiang 's Uighur and Han communities has been simmering for many years , but the ethnic unrest in July was the worst in China for decades .
The violence began on 5 July when an initially peaceful protest by Uighur youths , apparently prompted by an earlier riot in a factory in southern China , spiralled out of control - with shops and vehicles burned and passers - by attacked .
About 80 people have been charged over the violence but no date has been set for their trial .

GOP Blocks Extension of Unemployment Insurance ( Again )
Created : October 13 , 2009 19:14 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Last week , Senate Democratic leaders rolled out a proposal to extend unemployment insurance by 14 weeks — with an extra six weeks thrown in for those states where jobless figures have topped 8.5 percent — only to have Republicans block the measure on the chamber floor .
Well , today it happened again .
According to the office of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) , Democrats on Tuesday asked for consent to pass the bill , only to be shot down by GOP leaders .
The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Republicans are n’t objecting to the extension , but to how it ’s funded .
( The Democrats ’ plan would tap an expiring surtax on businesses , while the Republicans want to use unspent money from the stimulus bill . )
The House has already passed its version of the extension .
With unemployment numbers creeping up each month , the pressure ’s on the Senate to work out a deal quickly .
* An update , as of Oct. 20 , is here . *
An Oct. 22 update is here .
* Some movement here , also as of Oct. 22 .

Avigdor Lieberman wants to put off talks about issues such as the status of Jerusalem Israel 's foreign minister has said there is no chance of an early solution to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict and told people to " learn to live with it " .
Avigdor Lieberman does not lead Israeli peace negotiations , but his statement casts a pall over latest US diplomatic efforts to revive negotiations .
Envoy George Mitchell is in the region , spearheading Obama administration efforts to relaunch negotiations .
Talks are stalled over the issue of Jewish settlements on occupied land .
Mr Mitchell is due to meet Mr Lieberman and Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak on Thursday , and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas on Friday .
Reports quote US officials saying the visit was unlikely to conclude with a resumption of talks .
I am going to say very clearly - there are conflicts that have not been completely solved and people have learned to live with it , like Cyprus
Israeli FM Avigdor Lieberman
In shadow of Israeli settlement Obstacles to peace : Refugees Obstacles to peace : Jerusalem
But the envoy said before a meeting with Israel 's president : " We 're going to continue with our efforts to achieve an early relaunch of negotiations ... because we believe that 's an essential step toward achieving the comprehensive peace . "
In a radio interview , Mr Lieberman said people who thought Israel and the Palestinians could reach a deal " do not understand reality and are sowing illusions " .
" We have to be realistic - we will not be able to reach agreement on core and emotional subjects like Jerusalem and the right of return ( of Palestinian refugees , " he said .
" I am going to say very clearly - there are conflicts that have not been completely solved and people have learned to live with it , like Cyprus . "
His suggestion was a long - term interim deal to ensure prosperity , security and stability and leave tough questions until later .
Policy proposal Mr Lieberman 's comments are broadly in line with a policy proposal from within the Israeli foreign ministry leaked to the Israeli press on Thursday .
The document , which the BBC has seen , says : " Creating expectations that a comprehensive solution to the conflict can be reached might lead again to disappointment and frustration that will sour our relations with the US and Europe , and cause a violent reaction among the Palestinians .
" We can reach a interim agreement between the sides without solving the core issues such as Jerusalem , right of return and borders - that is the maximum which realistically could be attained and it's very important to convince the US and Europe of this . "
The Foreign Ministry said the reports about the policy proposal were " partial leaks from internal documents " and the leaks were regrettable .
It said Mr Lieberman had " requested a survey of existing policy and possible recommendations " as part of a " comprehensive discussion on Israel 's foreign policy " .
Stalled talks
The Obama administration has been struggling for months to pressure Israel to freeze settlement construction on occupied land , a key Palestinian demand for restarting talks .
Israel has countenanced a temporary limit on construction in the West Bank , but not in occupied East Jerusalem .
The fate of East Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees hase not been the subject of the latest peace efforts .
Palestinians and Arab states say there must be a just and fair solution to these issues , while successive Israel governments have sought to keep all of Jerusalem under their control and argued that a right of return for Palestinian refugees would mean the end of the Jewish majority in Israel .
President Barack Obama called the refugees ' situation " intolerable " but has not backed their right of return .
Jerusalem in recent days has been the scene of rising tensions and sporadic clashes , focused on access to the al - Aqsa mosque compound , known to Jews as the Temple Mount , a flashpoint site in the Old City .

This samadhi brings great peace .

Syntax highlighting with PHP 's tokenizer
While I was changing my design from light to dark , I hit a problem with my syntax highlighting : the colours were just too damn dark to see on a dark background .
Because I only usually write about PHP , I just use highlight_string ( ) for my syntax highlighting - rather than one of the more popular JavaScript syntax highlighters .
To change the colours I can just call ini_set ( ) to set highlight .
keyword etc to whatever I want .
That 's all fine and dandy , but one of the things I really wanted was to give ' users ' the ability to switch to whatever style they want .
That could get quite complicated ( and slow ) if I just used ini_set ( ) to do it .
That , and I 'd rather it were possible without re-loading the page .
My solution is to hack together my own function for highlighting PHP , but instead of having it specify the colour of each section directly in the style attribute of the span tag ( like highlight_string ) , have it specify a class that I can change the appearance of with regular old CSS .
And it looks a little like this :
<? php
function highlightPhp ( $ source ) {
$ tokens = token_get_all ( $ source ) ;
$ output = '' ;
foreach ( $ tokens as $ token ) {
if ( is_string ( $ token ) ) {
$ output .= htmlEntities ( $ token ) ;
} else if ( is_array ( $ token ) ) {
list ( $ id , $ text ) = $ token ;
$ name = str_replace ( ' _ ' , '-' , strToLower ( token_name ( $ id ) ) ) ;
$ text = htmlEntities ( $ text ) ;
$ text = str_replace (
array ( " " , " \
" ) ,
array ( " " , " < br / > " ) ,
$ text
) ;
if ( $ id != T_WHITESPACE ){
$ text = " < span class=\ \ " phps -{ $ name } \ \ " > { $ text } </ span > " ;
}
$ output .= $ text ;
}
}
return $ output ;
}
Note :
As of about an hour after I posted this , the code above was highlighted with itself !
With CSS that looks something like this :
< style type =" text/css " >
/* Do n't use this CSS .
Your code will look HORRIBLE ;-) */
. phps-t-open-tag {color : # DD3333;}
. phps-t-variable {color : # 33DD33;}
. phps-t-if ,
. phps -t - while ,
. phps-t-exit {color : # 3333DD;}
. phps-t-string ,
. phps-t-echo {color : # 33DDDD}
. phps-t-isset {color : # DD33DD}
. phps-t- lnumber {color : # DDDD33}
. phps-t-encapsed -and -whitespace ,
. phps-t-constant -encapsed-string {color : #DDDDDD}
</style >
It 's a little primitive at the moment , and I have n't bench - marked it , but it seems to do the job .
And it does have one other advantage over highlight_string ( ) : it provides much more granular control over the colours .
highlight_string ( ) only provides six possible colours ( highlight.bg , highlight .
comment , highlight.default , highlight.html , highlight.keyword , highlight.string ) , rather than all of these .
Hopefully I 'll be implementing it here soon .
I 'll be sure to provide some benchmarks compared to highlight_string ( ) .

SATAN , THE ADVERSARY OF MANKIND
Satan , also known as the devil , is mentioned frequently in the Bible .
There are many popular ideas about this evil spirit being .
Some think that Satan is not real , but is rather a personification of the wickedness that abides in the world .
Others admit that the devil exists , but presume that he is now confined in the fiery pits of an ever - burning hell .
Still others believe that Satan is free and actively promoting sinfulness in our world today .
What is the truth ?
What does the Bible tell us about this evil being ?
God 's
Word clearly teaches the reality of Satan as a personal entity .
He is presented as an evil being who affects humanity by his actions .
Many details about the devil are available in the Bible , but the facts have to be searched out .
In this article , we will piece together what the Scriptures have to say about Satan and draw conclusions from the Bible and other available sources .
Although the Bible does n't tell us explicitly , evidence suggests that the angelic realm was formed sometime during the first three days of creation , before God brought forth the dry land on the earth .
This understanding is supported by passages in Nehemiah and Job :
NEHEMIAH 9:6
You alone are the LORD ;
You have made heaven , the heaven of heavens , with all their host , the earth and everything on it , the seas and all that is in them , and You preserve them all .
The host of heaven worships You . ( NKJV )
JOB 38:4
" Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth ?
Tell Me , if you have understanding .
5
Who determined its measurements ?
Surely you know !
Or who stretched the line upon it ?
6
To what its foundations fastened ?
Or who laid its cornerstone , 7 when the morning stars sang together , and all the sons of God shouted for joy ?
( NKJV )
The " host of heaven " mentioned in Nehemiah 9:6 is a reference to angels , as are the parallel terms " morning stars " and " sons of God " in Job 38:7 .
The passage in Job suggests that the angels were present when God " laid the foundations of the earth " ( probably a reference to the separation of the dry land from the water on the third day of creation ) .
Now that we have an idea when the angels were originally formed , let 's examine what the Bible reveals about the creation of Satan :
EZEKIEL 28:12
" Son of man , take up a lament concerning the king of Tyre and say to him : ' This is what the Sovereign LORD says : " ' You were the model of perfection , full of wisdom and perfect in beauty .
13
You were in Eden , the garden of God ; every precious stone adorned you : ruby , topaz and emerald , chrysolite , onyx and jasper , sapphire , turquoise and beryl .
Your settings and mountings were made of gold ; on the day you were created they were prepared .
14 You were anointed as a guardian cherub , for so I ordained you .
You were on the holy mount of God ; you walked among the fiery stones .
15 You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created till wickedness was found in you .
16 Through your widespread trade you were filled with violence , and you sinned .
So I drove you in disgrace from the mount of God , and I expelled you , O guardian cherub , from among the fiery stones .
17 Your heart became proud on account of your beauty , and you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor .
So I threw you to the earth ; I made a spectacle of you before kings .
18 By your many sins and dishonest trade you have desecrated your sanctuaries . . . " ( NIV )
Satan is never mentioned by name in this passage .
However , there are some clues in Ezekiel 28 that identify the entities being spoken of here .
The chapter starts with God 's proclamation against the " Prince of Tyre " ( v. 2 ) .
This prince is proud and says , " I am a god , I sit in the seat of gods " ( v. 2 ) .
These words mirror what Paul says about the " Man of Sin " ( II The. 2:4 ) .
Ezekiel 28:1-10 is speaking figuratively of the coming Antichrist .
We see another message beginning in Ezekiel 28:11 , this one addressed by God to the " King of Tyre . "
However , because of the things said about this king , it is clear that God is not speaking to a mere man .
This king is the one who will give his authority to the Prince of Tyre at the end of the age ( Rev. 13:2 ) .
This king is the ancient dragon , Satan .
The first thing to notice about this passage in Ezekiel is that the " king of Tyre " ( Satan ) was in the Garden of Eden and he was " the seal of perfection . "
When does the Bible show that the Garden of Eden was formed ?
GENESIS 2:8 The LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden , and there He put the man whom He had formed .
( NKJV )
Genesis 2:8 seems to indicate that the Garden of Eden was planted by God after He created man .
Ezekiel 28:13 reveals that Satan was in Eden before he sinned .
Therefore , contrary to traditional understanding , Satan was in the Garden of Eden with Adam and Eve before he fell .
This anointed guardian cherub was likely one of the two angels who covered the mercy seat with their wings ( see Heb .
8:5 ; 9:5 , 23 - 24 ; Exo. 25:20 ; 37:9 ; I Kings 6:19 - 28 ; 8:6-7 ; I Chr. 28:18 ; II Chr.3:10 - 13 ; 5:7-8 ) .
However , because of pride , this cherub 's wisdom was corrupted , as I Timothy 3:6 implies :
I TIMOTHY 3:6
Not a novice , lest being puffed up with pride he fall into the same condemnation as the devil .
( NKJV )
How did pride cause Satan to fall into condemnation ?
The Bible does n't tell us directly , but there are enough clues to figure out the answer to this question .
Genesis 1:26 - 28 shows that God made mankind in His " image " :
GENESIS 1:26 Then God [ ' elohim ] said , " Let us make man in our image , according to our likeness ; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea , over the birds of the air , and over the cattle , over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth . "
27 So God [ ' elohim ] created man in His own image ; in the image of God [ ' elohim ]
He created him ; male and female He created them .
28 Then God [ ' elohim ] blessed them , and God [ ' elohim ] said to them , " Be fruitful and multiply ; fill the earth and subdue it ; have dominion over the fish of the sea , over the birds of the air , and over every living thing that moves on the earth . " ( NKJV )
There are several theories about what it means to be made " in the image of God . "
This passage makes it clear that being made in God 's image is what makes mankind ( both men and women ) different the rest of the physical creation .
Mankind is like ' elohim in some way because we are made in the image of ' elohim , but how ?
Michael S. Heiser , an ancient Hebrew language expert , gives the following explanation in answer to this question :
. . .
This points to viewing the image in a FUNCTIONAL sense ( i.e. , we are to " image " God ) as opposed to a QUALITATIVE sense ( as though the image is some quality or ability given to us ; i.e. , the image is some possessed attribute ) .
. . .
When Scripture speaks of mankind being created in the image of God , what is meant is that mankind has been created to represent God on earth .
. . .
God deliberately created mankind to rule the earth , and to accomplish this purpose , He created man as His own image - He made man his co-regent / representative ruler .
The image of God then , refers to our unique status as human beings , rulers in God 's stead , according to His own will .
We are created AS His image - to function as He would were He administering His own affairs directly .
Our abilities - unequally given to us in the providence of God are not THE image , but only a means to carrying out His expressed and often secret end .
( pp. 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , " The Image of God in Scripture " )
This understanding of " the image of God " is supported by the immediate text , which shows that mankind 's duties included having dominion over the earth and every living creature on it .
This interpretation is also supported by a related passage of Scripture in Psalm 8 :
PSALM 8:4
What is man that You are mindful of him , and the son of man that You visit him ?
5 For You have made him a little lower than the angels , and You have crowned him with glory and honor .
6
You have made him to have dominion over the works of Your hands ;
You have put all things under his feet , 7 all sheep and oxen — even the beasts of the field , 8 the birds of the air , and the fish of the sea that pass through the paths of the seas .
( NKJV )
Although this Scripture is a prophecy of the coming of the Messiah as a man ( Heb. 2:6- 9 ) , it also shows the position of mankind on the earth and alludes to the reason for Satan 's ultimate fall .
Verse 5 tells us that humanity was made " a little lower than the angels . "
However , it was mankind , not angels , who were given rulership over the earth .
As Ezekiel 28:12 tells us , Satan was " the model of perfection , full of wisdom and perfect in beauty " when he was created .
Yet neither he nor any of the other angels were given dominion over the earth initially .
Rather , Adam ( a being Satan surely considered inferior to himself ) was given this power .
It 's easy to see why Satan 's pride led him to sin .
Ezekiel 28:16 tells us that Satan was filled with violence and sinned through his " widespread trade . "
The Hebrew word rendered " trade " in Ezekiel 28:16 is rekullatekha ; it is a form of the noun rekulla , which means " merchandise " or " traffic . "
However , rekulla is derived from the root word rakal , which means " to go about . "
A closely - related derivative , rakil , means " slanderer . "
In the New Testament , Satan is often called the " devil , " or diabolos in Greek .
Not coincidentally , the literal meaning of diabolos and its variations is also " slanderer . "
The account of Satan in Ezekiel 28 probably involves aspects of both " merchandising " and " slander . "
The Scriptures imply that Satan , likely through peddling his slander , may have turned 1/3 of the angelic host against God ( Rev. 12:3 - 4 ) .
It 's not hard to imagine Satan going around to the angels , seeking to build support for his contention that they were far better qualified to run the earth than mankind .
It was through this slanderous " merchandising " that Satan became filled with violence against humanity .
Eventually , Satan must have developed a plan that he felt would deliver to him the position he believed should have rightfully been his from the beginning .
He decided to deceive the humans in the Garden into disobeying God 's direct command .
After proving mankind was unworthy of the rulership position God had placed them in , Satan , in his arrogant pride , must have thought God would see that he should be given authority over the world in their place .
It 's in this context that we see Satan approach Eve in the Garden of Eden :
GENESIS 3:1
Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made .
And he said to the woman , " Has God indeed said , ' You shall not eat of every tree of the garden ' ? "
2
And the woman said to the serpent , " We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden ; 3 but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden , God has said , ' You shall not eat it , nor shall you touch it , lest you die . ' " 4
Then the serpent said to the woman , " You will not surely die .
5 For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened , and you will be like God , knowing good and evil . "
6
So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food , that it was pleasant to the eyes , and a tree desirable to make one wise , she took of its fruit and ate .
She also gave to her husband with her , and he ate .
( NKJV )
The Bible elsewhere identifies Satan with the serpent in this story .
In Revelation 12:9 and 20:2 , he is called " that serpent of old , called the Devil and Satan . "
Did he appear to Eve in the form of a talking snake ?
Probably not .
The Hebrew word translated " serpent " in the above passage is נחש ( nachash ) .
In addition to " serpent , " this Hebrew root word has several other possible meanings .
It can be used as a noun to mean " one who practices divination , " or " shining brass . "
However , nachash can also be used as an adjective to mean " bright " or " brazen . "
In Genesis 3 , it is possible that nachash is an adjective being used as a noun .
If that is the case , the proper translation of hanachash in Genesis 3 would be " the bright one " or " the shining one . "
This understanding of nachash fits in very well with Paul 's description of Satan appearing as an " angel of light " ( II Cor. 11:14 ) .
Notice Satan 's tactics with Eve .
He did n't lie to her outright , but instead he twisted the truth .
He led Eve to doubt God 's word .
GENESIS 3:7
Then the eyes of both of them opened , and they knew that they were naked ; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves coverings .
8
And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day , and Adam and his wife hid themselves the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden .
9
Then the LORD God called to Adam and said to him , " Where are you ? "
10 So he said , " I heard Your voice in the garden , and I was afraid because I was naked ; and I hid myself . "
11 And He said , " Who told you that you were naked ?
Have you eaten the tree of which I commanded you that you should not eat ? "
12
Then the man said , " The woman whom You gave to be with me , she gave me of the tree , and I ate . "
13 And the LORD God said to the woman , " What is this you have done ? "
The woman said , " The serpent deceived me , and I ate . " ( NKJV )
Although Satan apparently believed that the downfall of mankind would benefit him , it actually turned out to be his undoing .
God was not pleased with his role in man 's disobedience , and he was cursed for his deviousness :
GENESIS 3:14
So the LORD God said to the serpent : " Because you have done this , you are cursed more than all cattle , and more than every beast of the field ; on your belly you shall go , and you shall eat dust all the days of your life .
15 And I will put enmity between you and the woman , and between your seed and her Seed ;
He shall bruise your head , and you shall bruise His heel . "
( NKJV )
Satan 's plan to rectify the " mistake " God had made by putting humans in charge of the earth backfired .
As well as revealing the flaws of man , Satan revealed his own shortcomings .
His deception resulted in God placing an age - lasting animosity between him and mankind .
From that point forward , " the Shining one " became " the Adversary " ( Heb. HaSatan ) of humanity .
The enmity between man and Satan is alluded to by Paul in the conclusion of his letter to the Romans :
ROMANS 16:20
And the God of peace will crush Satan under your feet shortly .
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
Amen . ( NKJV )
Satan 's actions did achieve their desired aim ; God cast man out of the Garden of Eden for his sin ( Gen. 3:24 ) .
In his fallen state , man was condemned to suffer death because of Adam 's sin , as Paul tells us in his letter to the Romans :
ROMANS 5:12
Therefore , just as through one man sin entered the world , and death through sin , and thus death spread to all men , because all sinned . . .
14 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses , even over those who had not sinned according to the likeness of the transgression of Adam , who is a type of him who was to come .
( NKJV )
Because Satan enticed mankind to sin and bring death upon themselves , he is called a murderer :
JOHN 8:44 " You are of your father the devil , and you want to do the desires of your father .
He was a murderer from the beginning , and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him .
Whenever he speaks a lie , he speaks his own nature , for he is a liar and the father of lies .
( NASU )
" The beginning " spoken of by Yeshua refers to the beginning of God 's plan , when mankind was in the Garden of Eden before the fall ( Gen. 2 ) .
" The beginning " here is not referring to Satan 's creation , because we know that originally he is said to have been created " blameless " ( Eze. 28:15 ) .
John also speaks of Satan being a sinner " the beginning " :
I JOHN 3:8
The one who practices sin is of the devil ; for the devil has sinned from the beginning .
. . . ( NASU )
In one way , Satan 's plan succeeded .
Because Adam disqualified himself from rulership by his disobedience , God placed Satan over the world in his place .
The devil 's temptation of Yeshua in the wilderness shows this clearly :
LUKE 4:5
Then the devil , taking him up on a high mountain , showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time .
6
And the devil said to him , " All this authority I will give you , and their glory ; for this has been delivered to me , and I give it to whomever I wish . " ( NKJV )
Satan tempted Yeshua for the same reason he had enticed Eve in the Garden .
He knew that Yeshua was in the process of regaining rulership over the earth and would replace him if successful .
He thought that if he could get Yeshua to sin ( as he had Adam and Eve ) , he could thwart God 's plan and remain the ruler of the world .
However , where Adam had succumbed to Satan 's machinations and disqualified mankind from ruling the earth , Yeshua withstood the temptation and triumphed .
This victory paved the way for him to become Adam 's successor .
Yeshua will reclaim rulership of the earth at his second coming .
Just before his crucifixion , Yeshua alluded to Satan 's status as the current ruler of the world :
JOHN 14:30 " I will no longer talk much with you , for the ruler of this world is coming , and he has nothing in me . " ( NKJV )
Paul refers to Satan as " the god of this age " in his follow - up letter to the Corinthians :
II CORINTHIANS 4:3
But even if our gospel is veiled , it is veiled to those who are perishing , 4 whose minds the god of this age has blinded , who do not believe , lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ , who is the image of God , should shine on them .
( NKJV )
In Mark 's Gospel , Yeshua clearly states that Satan is the one God uses to blind those who can't see the good news of the Messiah :
MARK 4:14 " The sower sows the word .
15 And these are the ones by the wayside where the word is sown .
When they hear , Satan comes immediately and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts .
( NKJV )
As the " god of this age , " Satan rules over the other fallen angels and the demons :
MATTHEW 12:24
But when the Pharisees heard it they said , " It is only by Beelzebul , the prince of demons , that this man casts out demons . "
25 Knowing their thoughts , he said to them , " Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste , and no city or house divided against itself will stand ; 26 and if Satan casts out Satan , he is divided against himself ; how then will his kingdom stand ? " ( RSV )
Here Satan is called " Beelzebul , " which literally means " Lord of the flies . "
He is identified as the " prince of demons . "
We also know from the Scriptures that Satan is the ruler of the fallen angels ( Matt. 25:41 ; Rev. 12:9 ) .
For an examination of the difference between fallen angels and demons , refer to my related article .
When demons bring sickness and ailments upon people , we find that Satan is blamed :
LUKE 13:11
And behold , there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years , and was bent over and could in no way raise herself up .
12
But when Jesus saw her , he called her to him and said to her , " Woman , you are loosed your infirmity . "
13
And he laid his hands on her , and immediately she was made straight , and glorified God. . . . 16 " So ought not this woman , being a daughter of Abraham , whom Satan has bound — think of it — for eighteen years , be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath ? " ( NKJV )
ACTS 10:38 " How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power , who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil , for God was with him . " ( NKJV )
Contrary to popular opinion , the Bible clearly shows that Satan has not been restricted to a fiery hell after his fall .
Indeed , the Old Testament shows that , before the first coming of Yeshua the Messiah , Satan continued to have access to the heavenly throne of God :
JOB 1:6
Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD , and Satan also came among them .
7
And the LORD said to Satan , " From where do you come ? "
So Satan answered the LORD and said , " From going to and fro on the earth , and walking back and forth on it . " ( NKJV )
JOB 2:1
Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD , and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD .
2
And the LORD said to Satan , " From where do you come ? "
So Satan answered the LORD and said , " From going to and fro on the earth , and walking back and forth on it . " ( NKJV )
It appears that Satan served as some kind of celestial prosecutor for God before the divine council .
In that role , Satan slandered and accused God 's people before the heavenly throne of YHVH , as the story in Job shows .
Zechariah also saw Satan in action as the accuser in a vision :
ZECHARIAH 3:1
Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the Angel of the LORD , and Satan standing at his right side to accuse him .
2
The LORD said to Satan , " The LORD rebuke you , Satan !
The LORD , who has chosen Jerusalem , rebuke you !
Is not this man a burning stick snatched the fire ? " ( NIV )
Some time after Messiah Yeshua triumphantly returned to heaven after his crucifixion and resurrection ( Rev. 12:5 ) , Satan and his angels were cast out and no longer had access to the throne :
REVELATION 12:7
Now war arose in heaven , Michael and his angels fighting against the dragon ; and the dragon and his angels fought , 8 but they were defeated and there was no longer any place for them in heaven .
9
And the great dragon was thrown down , that ancient serpent , who is called the Devil and Satan , the deceiver of the whole world — he was thrown down to the earth , and his angels were thrown down with him .
( RSV )
Some have incorrectly believed that this passage refers to Satan 's initial fall .
Yet the time sequence established in Revelation 12 clearly indicates that this ejection from heaven was after the Messiah returned from the earth and before his second coming at the end of this age .
Yeshua , just before his crucifixion , stated that his triumph on the cross would allow for Satan to be cast out of heaven :
JOHN 12:31 " Now is the judgment of this world , now shall the ruler of this world be cast out ; 32 and I , when I am lifted up from the earth , will draw all men to myself . " ( RSV )
JOHN 16:11 " Concerning judgment , because the ruler of this world is judged . " ( RSV )
Yeshua told his disciples that when he had gone back into heaven after his resurrection , the Father would send His Spirit to teach them and help them remember all the things he had said to them ( John 14:26 ) .
But in addition , he warned them of the coming of Satan to the earth after his departure .
In Revelation , John records an angel speaking from heaven who warns the earth about the coming of Satan :
REVELATION 12:10
Then I heard a loud voice saying in heaven , " Now salvation , and strength , and the kingdom of our God , and the power of His Christ have come , for the accuser of our brethren , who accused them before our God day and night , has been cast down .
11
And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony , and they did not love their lives to the death .
12 Therefore rejoice , O heavens , and you who dwell in them !
Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea !
For the devil has come down to you , having great wrath , because he knows that he has a short time . "
( NKJV )
Satan now roams the earth looking for those whom he can prey upon :
I PETER 5:8
Be self - controlled and alert .
Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour .
( NIV )
Paul tells us how to avoid becoming the prey of Satan :
EPHESIANS 6:10 Finally , my brethren , be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might .
11 Put on the whole armor of God , that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil .
12 For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood , but against principalities , against powers , against the rulers of the darkness of this age , against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places .
13 Therefore take up the whole armor of God , that you may be able to withstand in the evil day , and having done all , to stand .
14 Stand therefore , having girded your waist with truth , having put on the breastplate of righteousness , 15 and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace ; 16 above all , taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one .
17 And take the helmet of salvation , and the sword of the Spirit , which is the word of God ; ( NKJV )
James also gives believers advice on thwarting the devil 's schemes :
JAMES 4:7
Therefore submit to God.
Resist the devil and he will flee from you .
8 Draw near to God and He will draw near to you .
Cleanse your hands , you sinners ; and purify your hearts , you double - minded .
( NKJV )
Paul , in his final letter to Timothy , speaks of those who have been caught by the devil :
II TIMOTHY 2:24 And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all , able to teach , patient , 25 in humility correcting those who are in opposition , if God perhaps will grant them repentance , so that they may know the truth , 26 and that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil , having been taken captive by him to do his will .
( NKJV )
Now that we 've examined Satan 's origin and activities , let 's look at the final destiny of Satan .
What do the Scriptures say will be his ultimate fate ?
Yeshua briefly mentioned this in his dissertation on the judgment in Matthew 25 :
MATTHEW 25:41 " Then He will also say to those on the left hand , ' Depart from me , you cursed , into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels : ( NKJV )
Revelation 19 describes the battle between the forces of the Antichrist and Yeshua at the end of this age .
After the defeat and destruction of " the beast " and " the false prophet , " the Bible reveals that Satan himself will be captured and imprisoned for a thousand years :
REVELATION 20:1
Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven , having the key to the bottomless pit [ abussou , " Abyss " ] and a great chain in his hand .
2
He laid hold of the dragon , that serpent of old , who is the Devil and Satan , and bound him for a thousand years ; 3 and he cast him into the bottomless pit [ abusson , " Abyss " ] , and shut him up , and set a seal on him , so that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years were finished .
But after these things he must be released for a little while .
( NKJV )
ISAIAH 24:21
So it will happen in that day , that the LORD will punish the host of heaven on high , and the kings of the earth on earth .
22
They will be gathered together like prisoners in the dungeon , and will be confined in prison ; and after many days they will be punished .
( NASU )
REVELATION 20:7
And when the thousand years are ended , Satan will be loosed from his prison 8 and will come out to deceive the nations which are at the four corners of the earth , that is , Gog and Magog , to gather them for battle ; their number is like the sand of the sea .
9
And they marched up over the broad earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city ; but fire came down heaven and consumed them , 10 and the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulphur where the beast and the false prophet were , and they will be tormented day and night for ever and ever .
( RSV )
Satan 's final rebellion against YHVH will be thwarted , and God will finally deal with the devil .
Revelation 20:10 describes how God handles Satan .
Just what does this verse tell us about the fate of the Adversary ?
The first part of the answer lies in the Greek word basanisthesontai , translated " tormented " here .
Understanding the true meaning of basanisthesontai , which comes the verb basanizo and the noun basanos , is one of the major keys to accurately interpreting Revelation 20:10 .
According to Friberg , basanisthesontai means " strictly , rub upon the touchstone ( basanos ) , a Lydian stone used to test the genuineness of metals ; hence , test or make proof of anything . . . "
The history found in Kittel 's Theological Dictionary of the New Testament of how the meaning of these words evolved over time is very helpful in correctly understanding this verse :
. . .
The β άσανο ς [ basanos ] originally belongs to the calling of the inspector of coins .
It is linked with the Heb. root בחן ( " to test " ) . . . βάσανο ς is generally accepted to be a loan word . . .
The testing of gold and silver as media of exchange by the proving stone , was first developed by the Babylonians , then came to the Aramaeans and Hebrews by way of Lydia . . . and them to the Gks .
In non-biblical Gk. βάσανο ς is a commercial expression , or is used in relation to government .
It then acquires the meaning of the checking of calculations , which develops naturally out of the basic sense of βάσανος , βασανίζειν [ basanizein ] . . .
In the spiritual sphere it has the figur .
sense , which is closely related to the original concrete meaning , of a means of testing . . .
The word then undergoes a change in meaning .
The original sense fades into the background : βάσανο ς now comes to denote " torture " or " the rack , " espec. used with slaves . . . βάσανο ς occurs in the sense of " torment " . . .
The change in meaning is best explained if we begin with the object of treatment .
If we put men instead of metal or a coin , the stone of testing become [s ] torture or the rack .
The metal which has survived the testing stone is subjected to harsher treatment .
Man is in the same position when severely tested by torture .
In the testing of metal an essential role was played by the thought of testing and proving genuineness .
The rack is a means of showing the true state of affairs .
In its proper sense it is a means of testing and proving , though also of punishment .
Finally , even this special meaning was weakened and only the general element of torture remained ( pp. 561 , 562 , vol . I , emphasis mine ) .
The meaning of Revelation 20:10 is that Satan ( and implicitly , all those who have n't submitted to God by the end of the Millennium ) will be cast into the lake of fire .
There Satan and the wicked will be punished for their rebellion .
In addition to punishing , the lake of fire will also test , prove , and refine those cast in it .
However , this process is not " eternal " as we understand the concept .
To verify this , let 's look closely at the final phrase " forever and ever . "
Friberg says that this phrase , translated the Greek eis tous aionas ton aionon , literally means " into the ages of the ages . "
The Greek nouns aionas and aionon are plural forms of the Greek aion , which simply means an " eon " or " age . "
This word refers to an indefinite period of time ; however , it does not convey the idea of eternity .
This Greek phrase is used numerous times in the Scriptures ( see Gal .
1:5 ; Phi. 4:20 ; I Tim .
1:17 ; II Tim .
4:18 ; Heb. 13:21 ; I Pet. 4:11 ; Rev. 1:6 , 18 ; 4:9 , 10 ; 5:13 , 14 ; 7:12 ; 10:6 ; 11:15 ; 15:7 ; 19:3 ; 22:5 ) .
Most people assume that this phrase means " eternity " ; however , some scholars realize that this connotation was not present in the original Koine ( " common " )
Greek of the New Testament .
In his work on the original meanings of aion and aionios , Louis Abbott writes :
The Greek phrase eis tous aionas ton aionon , " for the eons of the eons , " occurs about twenty times in the Greek New Testament in this combination .
The ASV margin and some other versions , lexicons , dictionaries , and commentaries translate the phrase correctly .
Windet , in De Vita Functora Statu , of 1633 says ( p. 170 ) , " eis tous aionas ton aionon , of the New Testament meant a finite period . "
At 1 Cor. 15:25 , where the Greek text shows , dei gar auton basileuein achri hou the pantas tous echthrous hupo tous podas autou , " For He must be reigning until He should be placing all His enemies under His feet . "
This clearly states that Christ 's reigning is limited .
There is no Scripture to contradict the statement when aion and aionios are correctly translated .
Dr. William Barclay concurs in his commentary ( p. 166-169 ) on The Letters to the Corinthians .
If the Greek words eis tous aionas ton aionon mean endless time , as translated in the KJV , " forever and ever , " we have a contradiction in Scripture , for Rev. 11:15 says , in the same version : " The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and His Christ , and He shall reign forever and ever . "
That contradicts 1 Cor. 15:25 , which says : " He must be reigning till . . . "
If Rev. 11:15 is translated " eons of the eons , " or " ages of the ages , " there is no contradiction .
The ASV says ( 1 Cor. 15:24-25 ) , " Then cometh the end , when He shall deliver up the kingdom to God , even the Father ; When He shall have abolished all rule and all authority and power .
For
He must reign till
He hath put all His enemies under His feet ; " consequently , the reigning of Christ Jesus and the saints ( Rev. 22:5 ) will be " for the eons of the eons " or " for the ages of the ages . " ( ch. 5 , An Analytical Study of Words )
A correct understanding of " into the ages of the ages " shows that Satan , as well as those who worship the " beast " ( Rev. 14:11 ) will be refined in the lake of fire for an indeterminate , probably lengthy , but still finite , amount of time .
The use of the phrase " day and night " in Revelation 20:10 also bears this out , since time as we understand it does not exist in eternity .
For a more indepth review of the biblical teaching on this topic , see my article Eternal Life vs. Everlasting Punishment .
One final point regarding Satan needs to be addressed .
Some believe that YHVH the Father created the angel that became Satan with free will , and that this angel freely chose to rebel against God and set himself in opposition to His divine plan .
But is that what the Scriptures teach ?
Did the Almighty God who knows all things NOT know what this creature of His would ultimately do ?
God Himself provides the answer to that question through the prophet Isaiah :
ISAIAH 45:7 " I form the light , and create darkness ; I make peace , and create evil [ vore ' ra ' ] ; I am the LORD , that doeth all these things . " ( JPS )
God clearly takes credit for having created evil in this pronouncement .
Although
He initially made Satan " blameless in his ways " ( Eze. 28:15 ) , God knew that the character
He placed within Satan was prone to pride , and that this pride would cause Satan 's future actions regarding mankind .
Therefore God takes credit for creating this evil being , and all the evil that has come forth him .
It was necessary that a being such as Satan exist in order for God 's divine plan and purpose to be realized .
We see this clearly illustrated in the story of Job .
It was God who first brought Job to Satan 's attention , inciting him to slander Job 's motives for obedience :
JOB 1:8
Then the LORD said to Satan , " Have you considered My servant Job ?
There is no one on earth like him ; he is blameless and upright , a man who fears God and shuns evil . "
9 " Does Job fear God for nothing ? " Satan replied .
10 " Have You not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has ?
You have blessed the work of his hands , so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land .
11 But stretch out Your hand and strike everything he has , and he will surely curse You to your face . "
12 The LORD said to Satan , " Very well , then , everything he has is in your hands , but on the man himself do not lay a finger . "
Then Satan went out the presence of the LORD .
( NIV )
After his initial divinely - sanctioned attack on Job 's family and material goods did not achieve the desired result ( Job 1:13 - 22 ) , Yah baited Satan into attacking Job again .
Once more ,
He gave him the approval to do so :
JOB 2:3
Then the LORD said to Satan , " Have you considered My servant Job ?
There is no one on earth like him ; he is blameless and upright , a man who fears God and shuns evil .
And he still maintains his integrity , though you incited Me against him to ruin him without any reason . "
4 " Skin for skin ! " Satan replied .
" A man will give all he has for his own life .
5
But stretch out Your hand and strike his flesh and bones , and he will surely curse You to Your face . "
6
The LORD said to Satan , " Very well , then , he is in your hands ; but you must spare his life . "
7 So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the top of his head .
( NIV )
One important thing we must recognize from this story is that God set a limit on what Satan could do to Job .
This shows that there are boundaries to Satan 's authority , and he can not act outside of the will of God .
The rest of the book of Job goes on to show that although there often appears to be no reason why bad things happen to good people , God truly is in control , He has a plan , and all things eventually work out for good ( Rom. 8:28 ) .
After steadfastly maintaining his innocence throughout his ordeal , Job finally realizes that sometimes one cannot understand why God does things in the manner
He does :
JOB 42:1
Then Job replied to the LORD : 2 " I know that You can do all things ; no plan of Yours can be thwarted .
3
You asked , ' Who is this that obscures my counsel without knowledge ? '
Surely I spoke of things I did not understand , things too wonderful for me to know . " ( NIV )
Job finally realized God 's plan was a wonderful mystery that was beyond his limited human ability to understand .
Although Satan was the one who acted against Job , clearly the evil done to him was purposed by God Himself .
Even though Satan did these things out of hatred and malice , God intended good to come from them .
So it is with all of the Adversary 's actions ; he despises man and seeks to destroy him , but God uses Satan 's evil to fulfill a specific purpose so that His plan for humanity might ultimately be completed .
Although generally not recognized or accepted , the completion of God 's plan is clearly stated by Paul in I Timothy 2:4 :
I TIMOTHY 2:4 [ God ] who will have all men to be saved , and to come to the knowledge of the truth .
( RWB )
CONCLUSION
The Bible gives quite a bit of information about Satan .
To understand the truth , all the information has to be pieced together .
First and foremost , we must understand that Satan is accomplishing the will of God.
Satan is currently the " god " of this world ; he is the highest ranking evil spirit being .
The devil has authority over the fallen angels and the demons .
In the end , Messiah will return and subjugate all who wo n't submit to God 's authority , including Satan and his angels .
Their punishment will be age - lasting destruction and refinement within the lake of fire .

Exploring the final frontier : Disease proposed as major barrier to Mars and beyond
Press Release From :
Posted : Thursday , October 29 , 2009
New research published in the Journal of Leukocyte Biology suggests that prolific virulence and growth of bacteria , coupled with reduced production of antibodies could limit future space travel .
A new report appearing in The Journal of Leukocyte Biology ( http://www.jleukbio.org) argues that human missions to Mars , as well as all other long - term space flights might be compromised by microbial hitchhikers , such as bacteria .
That 's because long - term space travel packs a one - two punch to astronauts : first it appears to weaken their immune systems ; and second , it increases the virulence and growth of microbes .
This combination of factors makes it vital for scientists to find tools that can help people cope with these microscopic hitchhikers before they lead to disease , especially since astronauts will not have the ability to return home to a hospital .
" When people think of space travel , often the vast distances are what come to mind first , " said Jean - Pol Frippiat , one of the report 's co-authors from Nancy - University in France , " but even after we figure out a way to cover these distances in a reasonable amount of time , we still need to figure out how astronauts are going to overcome disease and sickness . "
Frippiat and colleagues based their conclusions on studies showing that immune systems of both people and animals in space flight conditions are significantly weaker than their grounded counterparts .
They also reviewed studies that examined the effects of space flight conditions and altered gravity on virulence and growth of common pathogens such as Salmonella , E. coli and Staphylococcus .
These studies show that these bacteria reproduce more rapidly in space flight conditions , leading to increased risk of contamination , colonization and serious infection .
" As clearly outlined by the researchers , we are unlikely to remain healthy when leaving earth for prolonged periods , " said Luis Montaner , Editor - in - Chief of The Journal of Leukocyte Biology .
" Unfortunately , because spacecraft technology is way ahead of our understanding of how to maintain human health , disease - free survival after reaching Mars or establishing a colony on the Moon may be problematic . "

VMotion , a VMware product , provides seamless OS Load balancing .
VMotion allows individual virtual machines to be dynamically moved to another VMware server without impact to users .
Cisco and VMware announced a method for using VMotion across data centers that are located as far apart — 200 kilometers .
Users have been pushing VMware to offer a method of allowing VMotion to be used between data centers , and this reference architecture is a step in the right direction .
But it is only a step and not a true failover technology .
It does not replace VMware ’s disaster recovery product , Site Recovery Manager .
The long - range Vmotion technique was originally demonstrated at Cisco Live !
But VMware formally announced support for it .
It can be used with Cisco switches that support VLANs , namely the Catalyst 6500 as well as the Nexus 7000 .
It requires that users implement VMware ’s latest product , vSphere .
The current reference design provides only what its makers refer to as “ Disaster avoidance ” not “ disaster recovery . ”
Long - range movement of a virtual machine using VMotion must be performed manually ( although users could write scripts to move VMs . )
As per Cisco :
VMotion solution and CiscoLive ! , we have been working dilligently with VMware to develop and refine the solution .
Inter - data center workload mobility has a lot of moving parts involved .
Essentially , you need to be able to address three areas : Mobility at layer 2 Mobility of the data , since there is seldom value in moving the workload if it loses access to the data it needs Mobility at layer 3 and of services
Technical issues with the network and storage have yet to be solved to allow VMotion to support more automated long - distance failover .
These include an inability to maintain an IP address if a VM is moved from one ISP to another , for instance from a data center in New York to another in San Jose .
Likewise , storage is a problem .
Until storage vendors come up with a way to support active / active SANs for the same VM moved between two physically far locations , no-latency failovers wo n’t be possible between data centers .
Some of the features are better found in Oracle ’s VirtualIron .
How good is this new Technique ?
This technique is not recommended , and not supported by VMware , when users have Disk Raw Mapping ( DRM ) turned on and used with clustered servers on either side .
All that said , for Cisco users wanting to deploy vSphere , this design can be practical in helping them manage VMs between data centers .
It can be used for disaster situations where users have warning ( tornadoes , hurricanes ) .
It can be helpful for load balancing applications between data centers to offset an expected traffic spike .
It also represents major progress on the network portion of the long - range VMotion problem .
The reference architecture is available for from Cisco ’s blog .

Urumqi has been under heavy security since the July riots A Chinese court has sentenced six people to death for murder and other crimes during ethnic riots in Xinjiang region in July , state media have said .
Nearly 200 people were killed during the riots between ethnic Uighurs and members of China 's dominant Han group .
A seventh person received a life sentence , the official Xinhua news agency said .
These are the first convictions relating to the riots - the worst ethnic clashes in China for decades .
The six sentenced to death at the Intermediate People 's Court in Urumqi - Xinjiang 's capital - were reported to be Abdukerim Abduwayit , Gheni Yusup , Abdulla Mettohti , Adil Rozi , Nureli Wuxiu'er , and Alim Metyusup .
As well as murder , state media reported that they were convicted of other crimes ranging from arson , leading mobs and causing " economic loss " .
Rising tensions Tayirejan Abulimit was given the lesser punishment of life imprisonment because he admitted to charges of murder and robbery and helped the police capture Alim Metyusup .

The government says most of those killed in the riots were Han Chinese , but the exile activist group the World Uighur Congress ( WUC ) claims many Uighurs were also killed .
Dilxat Raxit , a spokesman for the WUC , said the trial had been a sham .
" The whole process lacked transparency and was unfair .
They were not given any kind of legal aid , " he told Reuters news agency .
" Uighurs have no protection under the law . "
A protest by Uighurs in Urumqi erupted into violence on 5 July , leaving at least 197 people killed and another 1,700 injured .
Shops were smashed and vehicles set alight and passers - by set upon by rioters .
' Heavy police presence '
Hundreds of people were detained after the violence and , according to Xinhua , 21 people have been charged .
The BBC's Quentin Sommerville says 14 people are still waiting to be tried .
" It is a very long way from Beijing but it is one of the most heavily policed parts of the country , " our correspondent says .
" The security forces are really keeping the peace between these two ethnic populations in that part of China . "
Further ethnic unrest in Xinjiang was provoked in August by a wave of attacks with hypodermic syringes that many Han blamed on Uighurs .
Growing tensions
The initial protest in July was over an earlier fight in a toy factory in Guangdong province - on the other side of China - that left two Uighurs dead and 14 others seriously injured .
On Saturday a court in Guangdong sentenced Xiao Jianhua to death and Xu Qiqi to a life sentence for their roles in the factory brawl .
Nine others were jailed for sentences of between five to eight years for the violence at the Xuri Toy Factory .
Tensions between the mainly - Muslim Uighurs of Xinjiang and Han have been growing in recent years .
Millions of Han have moved to the region in recent decades .
Many
Uighurs want more autonomy and rights for their culture and religion - Islam - than is allowed by China 's strict centrist rule .
According to a government white paper on Xinjiang , released last month , the July riots were caused by Uighur separatists promoting an independent " East Turkestan " .
It also noted that during the violence 331 shops and 1,325 motor vehicles were destroyed or burned with many public facilities also attacked .

When Waxman - Markey made it out of the House , I supported the bill .
It is n't perfect -- is n't close to perfect .
Honestly what eventually emerged from the House was such weak tea that it 's unlikely to have any effect on either the course of global warming , or the structure of our energy infrastructure .
I completely understand the position of those so disappointed that they feel obliged to refuse their support .
Still , it is at the very least a demonstration that we are willing to grab hold of what some of the richest interests in the country have spent million on million trying to turn into a " third rail . "
The same corporations that have wrecked towns , smashed unions , ruined landscapes , and made unbelievable fortunes doing it , managed to get people -- people who have suffered directly because of the policies of those corporations -- to march around carrying signs that conflated " cap and trade " with Nazism .
Whether that 's a measure of effective marketing , or of abject gullibility , it 's still astounding .
The same corporations that did n't stop with only passing along every cost increase directly to the consumer , but used disaster and conflict as an excuse to rack up profits unmatched by any industry , ever , in the history of the world , got senators and congressmen to scream that it was government limitations on these corporations that was the problem .
The same corporations that abandoned US jobs and US communities to increase their operations in areas where they could ignore safety regulations and pollute to their heart 's content , used the pollution that they were helping to create overseas as a lever to help prevent any changes in the country they had all but abandoned .
Then , with PR warchests fat from profits carved out of family budgets and measured in lost jobs , they wrapped themselves in the flag and presented themselves with photoshopped populism .
To see anyone oppose these corporations , even in the slightest , is refreshing .
Maybe essential .
Or at least it would have been , had the Senate acted quickly enough to push this legislation through in time to show the rest of the world that the United States government was n't a marketing arm for oil and coal .
That did n't happen .
With that in mind , I feel a bit more free to respond to the Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act ( which I 'm going to refer to as " Boxer - Kerry " to keep from having to repeat that title and make a distinction with Waxman - Markey ) put forward this week by Senators Boxer and Kerry .
There are certainly things to like in the plan .
First , Boxer - Kerry contains significantly more provisions for the promotion of natural gas .
If that sounds like a negative , consider this .
Natural gas produces only half the carbon of coal when used to generate electricity .
Not only can plants be built to burn natural gas , existing coal plants can be retrofitted to burn natural gas instead .
We 're so used to thinking of " oil and gas " together , that we may assume that natural gas is mostly in the hands of the same companies that control big oil , but most natural gas is actually controlled by far smaller companies ( which is part of the reason natural gas has been all but ignored in previous energy bills ) .
Finally , while peak oil came in 1970 and no new significant coal reserves have been discovered in years , natural gas has enjoyed a resurgence by discovering means of extracting gas from deep shales .
Natural gas reserves are actually heading up while other fuels are going down .
I do n't want to sound like I 've swallowed a T. Boone Pickens promotional brochure ( and I still believe his scheme to be economically unworkable ) , but this combination of features makes gas a good bridge fuel as we work to replace electrical demand currently generated by coal .
Boxer - Kerry also contains a strong emphasis on conservation , with a series of programs designed to reward decreased consumption .
The importance of this can't be overstated -- and the ability of Americans to conserve does n't get nearly the press that it should .
This past year has seen a sharp drop in electrical demand , something that opponents of energy legislation said was impossible , and only a small part of that has come from decreased manufacturing .
Americans are watching the thermostat , and being rewarded by programs that help them conserve .
We recently saw how effective the " cash for clunkers " program was in motivating people to make changes in their cars .
Strong incentives to improve energy efficiency will leave us with both short term and long term gains , and do it more cheaply than any other provision .
Without buying into the cutesy language of " negawatts , " energy not consumed beats the tar out of any form of energy production .
More energy is not equivalent to " progress , " and using less energy is the most effective way of producing less pollution of all sorts .
On the feature that gets the most press , the carbon offset mechanism , Boxer - Kerry edges out Waxman - Markey by ... actually , all the things that are being showcased as improvements ( increased flexibility , a " carbon collar " that limits maximum cost , and provisions that make it easier for businesses to buy the offsets they need ) actually make the bill weaker .
There will be more carbon certificates available , available more readily , and available at a low price .
These features ensure that the " cap and trade " structure will never impose enough of an economic cost to encourage movement from high CO2 sources .
They 've been so well designed to address business concerns , that they 've been engineered into being inconsequential .
Not that it 's strict enough to have an effect under Waxman - Markey .
Boxer - Kerry also follows Waxman - Markey 's lead in awarding massive payments to the biggest winner under both bills : coal .
By far the biggest payments in the bill go into the pockets of the industry most responsible for the problem .
If this is supposed to protect some huge number of jobs , it does n't .
There are fewer people employed in the coal industry than there are unemployed auto workers in Indiana alone .
Yes , America has significant reserves of coal , but here 's the thing there 's no law that says we have to burn it all .
Giving billions to the coal industry did n't make any sense under Waxman - Markey , and it does n't make any sense in Boxer - Kerry .
It does n't " improve national security , " it does n't generate jobs , and it does n't take us one inch closer to the energy infrastructure we want .
Worst of all , the coal industry is rewarded for past sins , and gives up nothing in return .
Personally , I 'd propose an energy bill that 's much more simple .
Maybe even radical .
No cap and trade .
None .
No funding for " clean coal . "
Zero .
If we really want to make advances , we need to provide the funding and guaranteed orders that will allow alternative sources to compete on price .
For a fraction of the funding now offered for the R & D of CO2 sequestration , we can ensure that solar and wind actually outcompete coal in the marketplace .
Give them the boost they need to simply undercut the bastards .
If that 's not coming fast enough , use the natural gas to cut your CO2 in half by retrofitting the existing plants .
For God 's sake , do n't do anything that encourages building more of the plants now causing the bulk of the problem .
If we really want to improve natural security , we wo n't do it by building power plants of any type .
Instead we have to entangle the two parts of our energy picture by electrifying transportation .
Providing funds for mass transportation and for electric vehicles is reducing America 's demand for oil .
Everything else has nothing to do with it .
And hey , if you really must give money to coal why not at least demand that mountaintop removal be off the table forever so they 're giving up something before you lay out the buffet of federal dollars ?
For the first time since March , the stock market actually showed a little reaction to reality based information .
As it turns out , even removing any hint of stimulus will cause the market to retreat .
We already expected the cash for clunkers program was largely a gimmick with auto sales dropping like a stone in the last reading .
Home sales are being artificially juiced by the $ 8,000 tax credit and the Federal Reserve keeping 30 year mortgages near historical lows .
You can expect that if the Fed and the tax credit were removed we would see a similar reaction as the cash for clunkers program in the housing market .
It is amazing that so much energy and focus is being put on bailouts , gimmicks , and transient market forces all the while ignoring one major component .
Jobs .
The jobs report issued on Friday was another disappointment .
The problem with how the jobs argument has been framed since the start of the year is any report is going to look good compared to the 741,000 job losses in January .
Did anyone really think we were going to stay at an annualized job loss pace of nearly 9 million ?
Of course not .
So every subsequent reading seemed like a blessing to the media .
The rate of change on a month over month basis has been referred to as the second derivative ( or more specifically the rate of change OF the rate of change ) .
Let us look at both job losses and the rate of change :
It is rather obvious that we were not going to see 741,000 job cuts per month even if we were heading into another Great Depression .
So as you can see from the chart above the second derivative from February to May of 2009 was positive .
Yet anyone can see how flawed this argument really is .
It is using the ground shaking monthly loss of - 741,000 as a backdrop for every subsequent month .
Nothing can compete with that .
In fact , the following months had equally bad reports :
February 2009 : -681,000
March 2009 : -652,000
April 2009 : - 519,000
And then in June , we had the second derivative give out again .
Of course the market being guided by easy money and unlimited stimulus kept moving on up .
This minor hiccup was nothing to worry about .
That is until the last report that shows the rate of change giving way again .
Even at our current pace , we are losing over 3 million jobs a year yet somehow this is good .
Yet in this new economy apparently buying a car and buying a home are more important than having a stable job .
Even Henry
Ford understood that you needed to pay workers a wage to afford the product you were dishing out .
In this new economy , apparently having a job is an afterthought .
Let us set aside the job losses for the moment .
Who in the world is hiring ?
Apparently very few :
Those hiring are still at the levels seen in the March abyss .
Virtually nothing has changed on the jobs front since March of this year .
Instead of playing hide and seek with mortgages and creating a massive shadow inventory why not at least focus some energy on the employment situation ?
There is this pervasive tunnel vision focus on everything put job creation .
It seems like very few want to talk about this .
They want to obsess that the Case Shiller has stabilized or that home sales have increased but fail to examine the employment front .
For the first time in our history did we have an economy largely built on a housing and credit bubble .
So why are we to expect similar outcomes in this so - called recovery ?
In fact , many of these jobs losses are permanent :
5.4 million people have been unemployed for 27 weeks or more .
In times like this simple questions bring out the best answers .
This is like asking how a person with no income and no job is going to pay a $ 500,000 mortgage in California ?
If you asked a question like that the outcome would have been obvious .
So with this above chart , we ask who or what industry is going to employ these people ?
That is the question that has no answer even as we pass 21 months of our deep recession .
Israel , the United States and international law
28 October 2009
Israel has responded to the United Nations Human Rights Council ’s endorsement of the Goldstone report accusing it of war crimes during its assault on Gaza in 2008 - 2009 by denouncing the UN and seeking to overturn existing international law .
The explicit aim of Tel Aviv is to give the Israel Defence Forces ( IDF ) carte blanche to do as it likes in the name of “ combating terrorism . ”
The report by South African Judge Richard Goldstone said the war on Gaza was “ a deliberately disproportionate attack designed to punish , humiliate and terrorise a civilian population , radically diminish its local economic capacity both to work and to provide for itself , and to force upon it an ever - increasing sense of dependency and vulnerability . ”
Goldstone said that the UN Security Council should refer the case to the International Criminal Court if Israel failed to carry out an independent investigation into the military ’s conduct .
Those countries that were signatories to the 1949 Geneva Conventions had a duty to use their powers of “ universal jurisdiction ” to search for and prosecute those responsible for war crimes , he added .
President Shimon Peres and Premier Binyamin Netanyahu rejected the UN Human Rights Council ’s vote outright , denounced the report as biased , and refused to comply with its recommendations .
Ehud Barak , defence minister and architect of the assault on Gaza , refused to even permit a cabinet discussion about setting up an inquiry .
The government wanted to give the Israeli military “ the full backing to have the freedom of action , ” he said .
Netanyahu insisted that no Israeli official would stand trial for war crimes and promised that the resolution would be vetoed at the Security Council — that is , by Washington .
He instructed his government to draw up plans for a “ worldwide campaign ” to lobby for changes in the international laws of war “ in the interest of anyone fighting terrorism ” and to ensure that countries remove or water down their universal jurisdiction legislation .
Israel enjoys the unconditional support of the Obama administration , which called the Goldstone report unbalanced and lobbied to secure rejection .
Since the report was endorsed , Washington has repeatedly reiterated its support for Israel and publicly criticised the UN .
This reached its high point last week , when President Barak Obama sent Peres a fawning greetings video for the 2009 Presidential Conference in Jerusalem , which was attended on his behalf by Susan Rice , the US ambassador to the UN .
Speaking at the conference , Rice spelt out explicitly Washington ’s attitude towards the UN , an institution that she branded as “ evidently imperfect . ”
She made clear that the UN ’s authority is to be invoked only as and when it suits US interests , and dismissed when it does not .
“ There is no substitute for the legitimacy the UN can impart or the forum it can provide to mobilise the widest possible coalitions to tackle global challenges , from nonproliferation to global health , ” she said .
“ But the United Nations is an institution comprised of nations , ” she continued .
“ It rises or falls according to the will of its members .
And the UN must do more , much more , to live up to the brave ideals of its founding — and its member states must once and for all replace anti-Israel vitriol with a recognition of Israel ’s legitimacy and right to exist in peace and security . ”
For Obama , like President Bush before him , the UN is a useful tool only when it supports and legitimises Washington ’s geopolitical interests , as when UN resolutions provided a pretext for waging an illegal war of aggression against Iraq .
Thus , when a UN body attempts to call Israel to order , its action is denounced by Rice as “ basically unacceptable . ”
This is in stark contrast with Washington ’s attitude towards Iran .
The US is even now seeking to invoke the UN ’s authority , in the form of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) and the Security Council , to threaten Iran and press ahead with its ambitions for economic and strategic dominance in the energy - rich regions of the Middle East and Central Asia .
When it comes to Tehran , which is not accused of war crimes but of seeking to develop a nuclear programme in accordance with the terms of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty — a programme that the IAEA says has to date revealed no clear evidence of having nuclear weapons aims —
Obama declares baldly , “ The Iranian government must now demonstrate through deeds its peaceful intentions or be held accountable to international standards and international law . ”
The policy of Washington , along with London , Berlin and Paris , is determined solely by imperialist ambitions to control the world ’s resources and markets , for which the UN functions merely as a cover and negotiating chamber .
The present regime in Iran is seen as an obstacle to these aims .
Israel has long served as the custodian of US interests in the region and is today a likely conduit for launching a military attack on Tehran and its nuclear facilities , should Washington decide on such a course .
As well as seeking to protect a strategic ally , the US and Europe are determined to avoid setting a dangerous precedent that could lead to prosecutions of their own war crimes in Iraq , Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Netanyahu knows this very well .
As he warned the major powers in response to Goldstone ’s report : “ It ’s not just our problem .
If they accused IDF officers , IDF commanders , IDF soldiers , IDF pilots and even leaders , they will accuse you too .
What , NATO is n’t fighting in various places ?
What , Russia is n’t fighting in various places ? ”
Such shared political concerns explain why Israel has been given free rein by Washington to defy the UN , while Iran is proclaimed a global pariah .
That is why Obama declared Israel and the US to be “ democracies ” that “ can shape their own destinies , ” even as Netanyahu seeks to legitimise war crimes , while Iran is subject to sanctions and threats .
And it is why British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and French President Nicolas Sarkozy wrote to Netanyahu declaring their recognition of Israel ’s “ right to self - defence ” following the adoption of Goldstone ’s report , while Brown demands the drawing of “ a line in the sand ” when it comes to Iran ’s “ breach of international commitments . ”

Judging by buzz alone , the Palm Pre seems to be current the hot smartphone among developers .
It 's no surprise , considering how much effort went into its developer platform .
Palm is banking that a strong developer community will build a grassroots movement behind the Pre that can drag the company back from the brink of obscurity .
But Palm was n't always the mobile developers ' darling .
Back when the Pre was but a glimmer in Palm 's eye , Google Android was the smartphone OS du jour .
Like Palm , Google has taken the value of a strong developer community to heart , releasing the Android code as open source and offering developer previews of its latest technologies .
It even went as far as to give out free handsets to developers at this year 's Google I /O conference .
[ iPhone developers are frustrated too by the Apple App Store 's " ayatollahs " and slow bug - fix updates , as InfoWorld 's Bill Snyder explains .
| Considering Palm
Pre development ?
Read the InfoWorld Test Center 's Mojo SDK review first . ]
But all is not well in Android - land .
A year after the platform 's launch , second - generation Android handsets are now available to U.S. consumers , but they 're hardly leaping off the store shelves .
According to the research firm Canalys , Google Android commands only about a 3 percent share of the smartphone OS market , while Apple 's iPhone has shown an astounding 627 percent growth in the past year .
No surprise that Android developers are starting to grumble .
Google is learning the hard way that building a developer community is n't enough ; you 'd better also have the goods to back it up .
Android after the honeymoon
On paper , Android seems like a developer 's dream come true .
In the past , mobile developers were saddled with arcane toolkits and closed , proprietary OSes , but Android is all about openness .
Compared to Apple 's iPhone OS , Android would seem to offer a better value proposition to developers in almost every respect .
But that 's all conceptual .
Unfortunately , while Android looks good on paper , in the real world , execution is what counts , and so far Google 's has been lacking .
Compared to Apple , Google 's developer documentation is scanty at best , and it does n't help that the Android OS still seems to be something of a work in progress .
No problem ; early adopters are usually willing to overlook a few growing pains in a new platform -- and that goes double for developers .
That is , they would overlook them -- if they could get their hands on the hardware at all .
These days , a growing segment of the software development community lives outside the United States , where Android handsets are still hard to come by .
How many developers actually flew in from Bangalore to get their free Android phones at the recent Google I /O conference ?
Worse , the handsets themselves present a moving target .
An iPhone is an iPhone , more or less -- there are a few models on the market , but they 're subject to Apple 's tight control of the platform and predictable release schedule .
Android developers , on the other hand , are told to ready themselves for an explosion of new devices , each with its own unique characteristics .

Quotes :
“ The law enforcement profession has absolutely no room for employees with no integrity and the second a police officer breaks their oath and commits a crime , they are no longer a police officer ”
" Any time a law enforcement officer is accused of tarnishing the badge , it is an embarrassment to all the honest , hard - working members of this profession who work day in and day out to protect and serve with integrity . "
" I 'm sickened by this officer 's betrayal of the badge .
We can not let one single act by one officer overshadow the brave work by men and women who wear the uniform and put themselves in harm 's way everyday to protect our families and our neighborhoods . "
" We have to be held accountable for our actions , " said Police Chief John Ewing .
" Just because we wear a badge , it does n't mean we can break the law .
We need to treat our police officers like someone who was walking down the street who may commit the same crime . "
" We take these allegations very seriously and have placed Corporal Porras on administrative leave until we can determine what actions we must take .
Our deputies are charged with enforcing the law ; they are clearly not above it . "
The quotation most people associate with American Navy Captain John Paul Jones is “ I have not yet begun to fight . ”
According to legend , Jones said that defiant line during a naval battle with the British on September 23 , 1779 when a British officer asked if he was ready to surrender .
Some historians and quote mavens like Ralph Keyes have questioned whether Jones uttered those exact words .
The claim that he did was made a half a century after that battle and other accounts give different responses by Jones .
However , he did say something like it , and the backstory on the legendary version of his answer involves other famous words Jones definitely did say — in writing .
In the fall of 1778 , during the height of the American Revolution , Jones was in France trying to get a new warship to use in the fight against the British .
The French government offered him a heavy ship named the Neptune they had captured , but Jones deemed it to be too slow .
So , he wrote a letter to French aristocrat Jacques - Donatien Le Ray de Chaumont .
De Chaumont was an influential member of the court of King Louis XVI who had been instrumental in arranging various types of French support for the rebellious Americans .
In a letter dated November 16 , 1778 , Jones told the French nobleman : “ I wish to have no connection with any ship that does not sail fast , for I intend to go in harm 's way . ”
It had long been common to talk about getting someone or something “ out of harm ’s way , ” meaning to remove them from some kind of danger .
But John Paul Jones is generally credited with the first recorded use of the phrase “ in harm ’s way . ”
By the early 1800s , it became a common figure of speech , meaning “ in the path of danger . ”
It ’s most often used to refer to men and women in the military , who are sent “ in harm ’s way ” during wartime .
Not long after Jones wrote his letter to Monsieur Chaumont , the French government gave him a frigate named the Bonhomme Richard .
On September 23 , 1779 , Jones and the crew of the Bonhomme Richard fought their famous battle off the coast of England against the British war ship Serapis .
At one point , the Bonhomme Richard seemed to be sinking .
The commander of the Serapis , Royal Navy Captain Richard Pearson , asked Jones if he would strike his flag and surrender .
That ’s when Jones gave his possibly apocryphal reply : “ I have not yet begun to fight . ”
After lashing the Bonhomme Richard to the Serapis and fighting ferociously , the Americans won the battle and the crew of the Serapis surrendered to them .
In 1962 , James Bassett ’s bestselling World War II novel , Harm 's Way , helped make the term taken from Jones ’s letter more widely known than ever .
In 1965 , the novel was adapted into the epic movie In Harm 's Way , further enhancing the use and recognition of the phrase .
I have n’t read the novel , but I have seen the movie .
If you have n’t , you should .
It was produced and directed by Otto Preminger and stars John Wayne , Kirk Douglas , Henry Fonda , Patricia Neal , Tom Tryon , Paula Prentiss and Dana Andrews .
In Harm ’s Way is justifiably considered one of the greatest war movies ever made .
And , as you now know , its title comes from the most famous words John Paul Jones definitely said .

SATURDAY PM / SUNDAY AM : Warner Bros did n’t know what to expect on such a unique project as Spike Jonze ’s Where The Wild Things Are .
Certainly not a $ 32.4 M weekend performing strongly across the country .
Or a Cinemascore of B + where 55 % of the audience was under age 25 and rated the film A- .
Here was a famous director with an infamous imagination making a PG movie for adults out of Maurice Sendak ’s beloved children ’s book .
As a result , the studio decided not to position Wild Things as a kids film .
The marketing department brought it to Comicon , and then spent 70 % of the media for it on broad based and adult driven buys .
The P&A stressed Spike ’s pedigree , but not the fact that Jones took forever in post - production on his CGI + puppetry adaptation .
“ He ’s a perfectionist and just kept working on it , ” a WB exec told me Friday night .
“ But now we know that at the end of the day he nailed it . ”
Thursday midnight shows went way over the expected $ 150 K grosses and came close to $ 660 K .
By Friday noon in Manhattan , the expected $ 12 K take turned into $ 100 K .
Grosses came in at $ 11.9 M Friday and $ 13M Saturday from 3,735 locations ( including 145 Imax theaters which made $ 3.1M F - S - S ) .
Friday ’s revenues were unusually boosted by the “ Spikers ” as well as by adults attracted by the older focused marketing campaign .
So Saturday grosses were only 10 % higher than Friday ’s , not the usual 60 % higher of most matinee driven kiddie films .
At a surprise # 2 , Overture ’s Law Abiding Citizen starring Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler did a better than expected with $ 7.5 M Friday and $ 8.3M Saturday for a $ 21.2 M weekend from 2,889 venues .
Paramount ’s pre Halloween hyped Paranormal Activity made $ 6.25 M Friday and $ 7.6M Saturday from a wider release onto 760 screens for # 3 and a $ 20.1 M weekend and new $ 33.7 M cume .
Universal ’s holdover comedy Couples Retreat sank to # 4 with $ 6 M Friday ( - 50 % ) and $ 8M Saturday for a $ 17.9 M weekend from 3,009 plays for a $ 63.3 M cume .
That leaves Screen Gems / Sony ’s low budget reboot Stepfather # 5 on 2,734 dates to debut with only $ 4.3M Friday and $ 4.7M Saturday for a $ 12.3 M weekend .
The rest are holdovers :
6. Cloudy / Meatballs ( Sony ) Week 5 [ 3,037 ] $ 8.1M Wkd , Cume $ 108.2M
7. Zombieland ( Sony ) Week 3 [ 3,171 theaters ] $ 7.8 M Wkd , Cume $ 60.8 M
8. Toy Story 3 - D ( Disney ) Week 3 [ 1,467 ] $ 900 K Fri , $ 3 Wkd
9. Surrogates ( Disney ) Week 4 [ 2,326 ] $ 700 K Fri , Est $ 2.3M
Wkd
10 . Invention Of Lying ( WB ) Week 3 [ 1,624 ] $ 675 K Fri , Est $ 2.2M
Wkd
It ’s turning into a huge weekend : $ 130 + M , or +35 % from last year .
YF - 12A
While the A - 12 was being tested and refined , US officials mulled over two major issues concerning it .
The first was whether to publicly disclose the OXCART program .
The Department of Defense had grown concerned that it could not overtly explain all the money the Air Force was spending on its versions of the A - 12 .
At the same time , some CIA and Pentagon officials recognized that crashes or sightings of test flights could compromise the project .
With a turning radius of no less than 86 miles at full speed , the A - 12 overflew a vast expanse of unrestricted territory .
Soon after the first flights in April 1962 , CIA and the Air Force changed the program ’s cover story from involving an interceptor aircraft to a multipurpose satellite launch system . [ 1 ]
In late 1962 and early 1963 the Department of Defense considered surfacing the YF - 12A to provide a cover , reasoning that divulging the existence of a purely tactical aircraft would not reveal any clandestine collection capabilities .
Voiced principally by CIA officials and James Killian and Edwin Land of the President ’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board ( PFIAB ) , the contrary argument — disclosing any version of the A - 12 would compromise its design innovations , enable the Soviets to develop countermeasures , and destroy its value for reconnaissance — prevailed for the time being .
The surfacing issue lingered , however , because OXCART technology would be useful for the Air Force ’s supersonic B - 70 bomber then under development , and for the proposed commercial supersonic transport that Congress was thinking about subsidizing .
President Kennedy told CIA and the Pentagon to develop a plan for surfacing the OXCART program but to wait further instructions before proceeding .
By early 1964 the argument for disclosure had become persuasive .
More A - 12s were arriving at the test site and making more flights .
The aircraft ’s existence probably would be revealed eventually under circumstances the US government could not control , such as a training accident or equipment malfunction , or through a news leak .
Commercial airline crews had sighted the A - 12 in flight , and the editor of Aviation Week indicated that he knew about highly secret activities at the Skunk Works and would not let another publication scoop him .
A key factor was that the Soviets ’ TALL KING radar would be able to identify and track the A - 12 despite its small , nonpersistent radar return .
Finally , the White House ’s reluctance to resume flights over Soviet territory would soon force a change in the A - 12 ’s mission .
Instead of flying over denied areas to collect strategic intelligence , it would most likely be used as a quick - reaction surveillance platform in fast - moving conflicts — a tactical function the Air Force should carry out , not CIA . [ 2 ]
On 29 February 1964 , the National Security Council decided to surface OXCART .
Later that day , the White House announced the successful development of an advanced experimental aircraft , the A‑11 , which has been tested in sustained flight at more than 2,000 miles per hour and at altitudes in excess of 70,000 feet .
The performance of the A - 11 far exceeds that of any other aircraft in the world today .
The development of this aircraft has been made possible by major advances in aircraft technology of great significance for both military and commercial applications .
The A‑11 aircraft now at Edwards Air Force Base are undergoing extensive tests to determine their capabilities as long - range interceptors . [ 3 ]
For security reasons , the Air Force ’s YF - 12A interceptor was surfaced , not the A - 12 , and it was referred to as the A - 11 , at Kelly Johnson ’s suggestion .
None of the aircraft were already at Edwards , so two had to be rushed from the test site to support the cover story .
Johnson recalled that “ the aircraft were so hot that when they were moved into the new hanger the fire extinguishing nozzles came on and gave us a free wash job . " [ 4 ]
Testing of the A - 12s continued at the secret facility ; CIA ’s involvement in the project remained classified , although it was widely assumed .
Surfacing the “ A - 11 ” unexpectedly embroiled program managers and technicians in a debate over using an OXCART aircraft to publicly set a world speed record .
The presidential announcement stated that “ [t ] he world record for aircraft speed , currently held by the Soviets [ 1,665 mph ] , has been repeatedly broken in secrecy by the …A - 11 .
The President has instructed the Department of Defense to demonstrate this capability with the procedure which , according to international rules , will permit the result of the test to be entered as a new world record . ”
CIA leaders strongly opposed using any of the A - 12s to attempt this aeronautical feat .
Of the four aircraft used in test flights , only Article 121 had reached the cited speed .
Using it in the record trials would set back the testing schedule , jeopardize the aircraft , and undermine the security of the program because the differences between the CIA and Air Force versions would be noticed , and the record would have to be set under the auspices of an uncleared international aviation organization . [ 5 ]
Consequently , the A - 12 was kept out of the competition .
No YF - 12As were put forward right away because managers of that program were concentrating on armaments rather than speed .
At the time , the interceptor had not flown above Mach 2.6 .
A plane was not ready for the speed trial for over a year .
Then on 1 May 1965 , a YF - 12A set speed and altitude records of 2,070.1 mph and 80,257.65 feet — the first of many for OXCART aircraft .

Thanks to their vast underground fungus farms , leafcutter ants are one of Earth 's most successful species — and one secret of their agricultural success is bacteria , which the ants use like fertilizer .
By farming with microbes that pull nitrogen from the air , the ants thrive in nitrogen - poor rain forest soil .
Researchers say their bug - harnessing tricks might point people toward better ways of turning plants to fuel , or boosting our own crop yields .
" The reason we 're able to produce such massive crops is by the massive fertilization of nitrogen in our fields , " said University of Wisconsin bacteriologist Cameron Currie , co-author of a paper published Thursday in Science .
" Ants supplement their crops through symbiotic associations with bacteria . "
A star of rain forest documentaries , leafcutter ants are one of about 250 ant species that subsist on farmed fungus .
Most of these species live in colonies of a few thousand individuals , with tiny garden plots .
Leafcutter colonies have millions of members , with leaf - fed farms yielding more than a ton of fungus every year .
Some scientists estimate they account for a full four - fifths of all living , nonplant rain forest matter .
Fascinated by their success , researchers have studied leafcutter gardening , but something was n't adding up .
Though Earth 's atmosphere is nitrogen - rich , animals get their nitrogen by eating plants , or eating animals that eat plants .
But rain forest foliage is nitrogen poor , as are the soils colonized by the ants .
" Nitrogen is one of the elements that ultimately determines productivity , " said Currie .
" The nitrogen balance in ants is way off , based on what 's predicted from their diet . "
Currie 's team investigated the mystery of where the ants were getting their extra nitrogen by raising leafcutter colonies in airtight boxes .
The soil in the boxes contained normal nitrogen .
But the nitrogen in the air was replaced with a nitrogen atom with a different number of neutrons , called an isotope .
By measuring the levels of the isotope in fungus and ant bodies , the researchers could track whether nitrogen was coming from the soil or the air .
They found that the fungus was getting nitrogen from the air .
They then studied bacteria growing on the fungus , and found microbes from a genus called Klebsiella , which pulls nitrogen from the air at rates comparable to microbes that live on the roots of some plants .
" It 's entirely possible that nitrogen - fixing bacteria played a critical role in the evolution of this very different group of ants , with their giant colonies and massive effects on the environment , " said Ted Schultz , a Smithsonian Institute entomologist who was not involved in the study .
He and Currie both noted that leafcutters are uniquely complex among fungus - growing ants , but evolved just 10 million years ago , or 40 million years after other fungus growers .
" What humans do for nitrogen is mine it from other sources , and dump it on our crops , " said Schultz .
But this leads to waste and pollution , " and the ants accomplish it through microbes .
Who knows ?
Maybe humans could do something similar , and cultivate microbial communities in the soil around our crops . "
And this is n't the only trick farmers might learn from the ants .
In March 2008 , Schultz showed that leafcutters also use antibiotic - producing microbes to keep their gardens pest - free .
Currie is studying whether nitrogen - fixing bacteria help break down the ants ' leaf cuttings into a fungally - digestible form .
If so , the bacteria may suggest better ways of turning plants into biofuels .
" We need to discover new enzymes , new processes , to convert plant cell walls into simple sugars that can be converted into ethanol , " he said .
" Ants have been converting plant biomass into energy for millions of years . "
Currie added that leafcutter ants are the subject of thousands of papers authored over the last century , " yet this critical aspect of their success was completely unknown . "
" This is a well - studied natural system , and we 're still learning who the players are , " he said .
" What does that say about most of the natural world , where mutalisms and associations have n't been studied ? "

Brandon is currently working on a book about ecosystem and planetary tipping points .
Since 2008 more than 7,000 people , including Mexican civilians , journalists , police , and public officials , have been killed in clashes with warring drug traffickers — traffickers who US government officials allege derive 60 percent of their profits from exporting marijuana north of the border .
So what are the Obama administration ’s plans to quell these gangs growing influence and the surging violence surrounding the drug trade ?
Troublingly , the White House appears intent on recycling the very strategies that gave rise to Mexico ’s infamous drug lords in the first place .
In the December 2009 issue of The Freeman I propose another solution .
How To End Mexico ’s Deadly Drug War
via The Freeman
[ excerpt ] Americans ’ support for legalizing the regulated production and sale of cannabis — an option that would not likely rid the world of cartels , but would arguably reduce their primary source of income — is at all an all - time high .
… Predictably , critics of marijuana legalization claim that such a strategy would do little to undermine drug traffickers ’ profit margins because cartels would simply supplement their revenues by selling greater quantities of other illicit drugs .
Although this scenario sounds plausible in theory , it appears to be far less likely in practice .
As noted , Mexican drug lords derive an estimated 60 to 70 percent of their illicit income from pot sales .
( By comparison , only about 28 percent of their profits are derived from the distribution of cocaine , and less than 1 percent comes from trafficking methamphetamine . )
It is unrealistic to think that cartels could feasibly replace this void by stepping up their sales of cocaine , methamphetamine or heroin — all of which remain far less popular among U.S. drug consumers .
Just how much less ?
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services survey data show that roughly two million Americans use cocaine , compared to 15 million for pot .
Fewer than 600,000 use methamphetamine , and fewer than 155,000 use heroin .
In short , this is hardly the sort of demand that would keep Mexico ’s drug barons in the lucrative lifestyle to which they ’ve become accustomed .
Of course , it ’s unrealistic to think that pot legalization would wipe out prohibition - inspired violence altogether .
After all , ending alcohol prohibition in America did n’t single - handedly put the Mafia out of business ( though it greatly reduced its power and influence ) .
And it ’s always possible that Mexico ’s drug cartels would continue to engage in violent acts toward one another as competing factions fought over the crumbs of America ’s drastically shrunken illicit - drug market .
That said , it ’s equally unrealistic , if not more so , to think that continuing our same failed drug war policies will do anything but exponentially increase the catastrophe they ’ve spawned , both in Mexico and at home .
It ’s time to engage in a different strategy .
It ’s time to seriously consider legalizing marijuana .

He lives in Harlem , NY .
Never before have I seen my community photographed with such dignity and hope .
Omar Mullick , an award winning photographer who shoots for National Geographic , NY Times , etc. , has traveled all across America for 7 years documenting the elusive Muslim American community .
The photography will be on display at GalleryFCB Thursday , October 8th at 6:00 pm .
The gallery runs for the entire month , but please join us at the opening of this historic exhibit .
RSVP on the Facebook Event if you can .
Omar has given me the permission to showcase a handful of photos here at Boing Boing .
More images and info after the jump .
The first time I saw the photos I wondered why Omar chose black and white .
Looking through the gallery statement on the site , I found my answer :
At a time when President Obama used the example of American Muslims in his Cairo address to indicate that Islam had " always been a part of America 's story … " the exhibit presents a culmination of one photographers deliberate effort to take the visual language of black and white 35 mm photography , through which 20th Century America has often looked at itself , and open up that narrative to include the latest birth pang in American cultural life .
To that end , Can't Take It With You , which was pursued with singular purpose by a photographer deeply engaged with the idea of what it means to be American , promises to be one of the more important visual documents of the young 21st Century .
The photo I leave you with is of a Muslim women 's shelter in Philadelphia , PA .
It was the children 's first day at the shelter .
I wonder where they are now .
I will be doing a tiny interview with Omar Mullick at the end of the week , if anyone has a question they feel compelled to ask please write it in the comments and I 'll try my best to get it answered .

( CNN ) --
A study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics indicates about 1 percent of children ages 3 to 17 have autism or a related disorder , an increase over previous estimates .
Children at the Marcus Autism Center in Atlanta , Georgia , receive instruction on March 5 , 2009 .
" This is a significant issue that needs immediate attention , " Dr. Ileana Arias , deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday .
" A concerted effort and substantial national response is warranted . "
The study used data from the federal government 's 2007 national survey of children 's health .
The survey of parents was conducted by the Health Resources and Services Administration , and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
The results are based on a national telephone survey of more than 78,000 parents of children ages 3 to 17.iReport.com :
How has autism affected your family ?
In the study , parents were asked whether a health care provider had ever told them their child had an autism spectrum disorder .
ASD is a group of brain disorders comprising autism and two less severe disorders : Asperger 's disorder and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified .
Children with the disorder show impairment in social interaction and in their ability to communicate .
They often display repetitive behavior .
Watch families discuss autism »
The investigators also asked a follow - up question :
Were the children considered to have ASD now ?
Nearly 40 percent of the parents and guardians said no .
That finding led the authors to question whether some of the children originally diagnosed as having ASD may have been improperly diagnosed , since the disorders are not considered curable .
But Kogan said the two surveys cannot be compared because the earlier investigators did not ask the follow - up question about whether the children were still considered to have the disorder .
Still , based on the findings , lead author Dr. Michael D. Kogan of HRSA 's maternal and child health bureau estimated the prevalence of ASD among U.S. children ages 3 to 17 at 110 per 10,000 -- slightly more than 1 percent .
Boys were four times as likely as girls to have ASD , and non-Hispanic black and multiracial children were less likely than non-Hispanic white children .
He estimated that 673,000 children have ASD in the United States .
Monday 's findings of nearly 1 in 100 appear to indicate an increase from the average of 1 in 150 that was reported in 2003 , the researchers said .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Autism
The researchers urged caution in interpreting the change , noting that an increase in diagnoses does not necessarily mean that more children have the disorder .
It could simply reflect a heightened awareness of the disorder .
" We do n't know whether the change in the number over time is a result of the change in the actual condition , in the actual number of conditions or in part due to the fact that the condition is being recognized differently , " Arias said .
She said that preliminary results from a separate , CDC - funded study she is working on also indicate that about 1 percent of children in the United States are affected by ASD .
That study is to be published later this year , she said .
" This is a behavioral diagnosis , and it 's difficult to make , and it 's difficult to make at young ages , " said Dr. Peter van Dyck , HRSA 's associate administrator for maternal and child health .
Half of the cases were considered mild by their parents , the study reported .
The results underscore the importance of creating policies that will result in early identification and intervention , the officials said .
The reports raise " a lot of questions about how we are preparing in terms of housing , employment , social support -- all the issues that many of these people are going to need , " said Dr. Tom Insel , director of the National Institute of Mental Health .
" It also raises questions about how well we 're prepared in the educational system to provide for the special needs of many of these kids . "
Insel said the federal government is beefing up the resources it is mobilizing to address autism and related disorders , with $ 85 million being appropriated by the National Institutes of Health and $ 48 million for next year by the HRSA .
All About Autism • Health Care Issues
The Obama administration proposed new rules of the road for the Internet Monday , standing up for the consumer - oriented principle known as net neutrality .
The guiding idea is that the big cable companies that build the information highway should n't exert much control over where users drive .
Or , to cast the debate more specifically , proponents say it 's about making sure that Comcast or Time Warner does n't unfairly limit the potential for the next Facebook or Skype to arise .
Federal Communications Commission chief Julius Genachowski proposed two new guidelines Monday , plus a strengthening of existing FCC standards :
1. Providers can't favor their own content
He urged a " nondiscrimination " principle : Providers of broadband Internet service cannot discriminate against particular Internet content or applications .
This would cover the emerging arena of wireless broadband services , delivered to smart phones .
Consumer groups worry that pipeline firms ( such as AT&T ) will favor the transmission of their own video content , for example , over other web - based video content .
2. Providers need to explain variable internet speeds
He proposed a " transparency " principle : Broadband providers should disclose their network management practices to consumers .
This might include policies that cause some users to face a squeeze on their connection speed during times of peak traffic on the network .
3 . Providers can't limit access to lawful content
He called for " four freedoms " that the FCC set forth in 2004 to be turned into formal rules .
These standards say that network operators cannot prevent users from accessing the lawful Internet content and applications .
Comcast is fighting the FCC in court over these principles .
It 's a controversy that wo n't end with Monday 's speech .
The FCC chairman and other proponents of the changes see the new rules as a platform for innovation and consumer choice .
But some providers – the builders of the Internet highway – say the rules could backfire by slowing investment in Net services .
To them and other critics , network neutrality is simply a code for government micromanagement of the private sector .
Mr. Genachowski acknowledged the complexity of the challenge .
" There are inevitable tensions built into our system , " he said .
" The FCC must be a smart cop on the beat preserving a free and open Internet . "
President Obama also touted the FCC proposals , praising them in a separate Monday speech on education .
Two Democratic members of the five - member FCC said they support Genachowski ’s ideas , giving him a majority to implement the proposal , the Associated Press reported .
The agency chairman pledged to strike a balance .
Providers , he said , should be able to " reasonably " manage their networks during periods of congestion .
And openness should n't come at the expense of security , criminal activity , or uncontrolled " spam " e-mails , Genachowski said .
After his speech at the Brookings Institution , a followup panel discussion revealed the deep divisions on the issue .
The Skype video phone service " is blocked " already on some networks , said Josh Silverman , president of the Skype Technologies .
" As soon as it starts to look like [ a provider is ] picking winners , that ’s when we start to get nervous . "
David Young , a vice president at Verizon , begged to differ .
He asked for more evidence that startups are being stifled , before imposing new regulations on a system that has " been wildly successful " in building the Internet .
The argument for rules of the road centers around the market power that a few big service providers wield .
It 's expensive to install cables or cell towers , a cost that becomes a barrier against new competition .
It also hinges on the growing importance of the web as infrastructure for the economy , as well as for news and entertainment .

Want to do a paywall with no “ first click free ? ”
That ’s fine with Google , says business product manager Josh Cohen .
Want to do micropayments ?
Google will be “ flexible ” in considering support of new business models like this .
But if you charge , expect less traffic , and also expect that your competitors will be “ ecstatic ” to pick up your loss , he said .
Cohen ’s comments on paywall issues were part of a wide - ranging interview I had with him about Google and its news service .
In the interview , Cohen also repeatedly stressed that publishers are free to deal with Google as they like .
And if they wanted to exclude Google in favor of a competitor like Microsoft , they have that choice — though Google would prefer to work with everyone .
Indeed , Google ’s inclusion of many diverse sources is one reason he thinks Google might take hits from certain publishers that do n’t criticize Yahoo News , which is a far more popular news service than Google News .
Below , you ’ll find Cohen ’s comments on these and other issues , along with a summary of how Google handles free , registration and subscription - based content .
I spoke with Cohen in early October ( a busy month in search has kept me from getting this posted until now ) .
His comments are even more relevant given that talk of news publishers perhaps blocking Google have only ramped up in the past weeks .
Paywalls & Google Are Not Mutually Exclusive
As publishers increasingly consider putting up paywalls ( a barrier to reading a story unless you ’ve paid for it in some way ) , I also see commentary from others arguing such moves would be dumb , that they ’ll be the final nail in killing some publications .
What ’s a confused publisher to do ?
For me , I find it puzzling publishers believe they have to make a choice .
They can have their paywall AND Google traffic combined , via Google ’s First Click Free program .
Are there many publishers who simply are n’t aware of this program ?
Cohen responded :
Yep ….
I ’m often surprised , and maybe this means I ’m not doing my job particularly well , but there are some basic questions on First Click Free and support for subscription content or the rankings or what we try and do .
Some of that are the challenges that you ca n’t make everything widely available .
But we do try to be fairly transparent with what we ’re trying to do within our algorithm on the Google News side of it , because we recognize that it ’s important to different publishers .
We want to be in a situation where the best content wins , not the best SEOed site .
So if we can put that out there as much as possible and in essence give all publishers a level playing field , then the user wins .
If a publisher understands that quality , original content does best and therefore tries to create more , great .
But there is still a lot of those discussions that take place where people will say … ‘ I have to make this content free or Google wo n’t index it , ’ and that ’s not the case .
First Click
Free is only one example of the ways that publishers can make subscription content available .
They can do previews , they can block it in different ways .
I think there are a lot of those questions about the nuts and bolts of how you can work with us , subscriptions just being one of them . ”
Paywalls Don’t Require That The First Click Is Free
Of course , one concern with First Click Free is that it can allow a savvy person to effectively read your publication for free , as can happen with the Wall Street Journal .
In fact , News Corporation raised this as an issue this week ( My Would Someone Please Explain To News Corp How Google Works ?
article looks at News Corp ’s comments in more depth ) .
That ’s the first time I ’ve seen a major publisher talk about issues with the First Click Free “ backdoor , ” but it was something I was expecting to come up , so it was on my list of questions I ’d put to Cohen .
Can publishers be listed in Google News and still protect their paywall ?
Cohen said yes :
You can allow us to crawl content and show a preview to the user and label it as a subscription .
So that happens today .
You can do that in Google News today …. as long as you ’re not cloaking [ showing Google something different than what a visitor would see , when they finally arrive at the page they ’ve paid for ] .
You can also show a preview and we can index it , as long as it ’s a consistent experience , where if you ’re showing us a preview , and we can index that , and that ’s what you show the user , that ’s fine too .
POSTSCRIPT : Google Modifies “ First Click Free ” Policy To Accommodate Publishers Gating Their Content from Dec. 1 , 2009 covers how Google slightly closed the “ backdoor ” since this interview was conducted .
How Google Handles Free & Paid News Content
In summary , here are the basic ways Google News handles news content that is free , requires free registration or requires payment to view .
These are also described in Google ’s help pages :
Free Content : Content is free .
Google can index an entire story to make it searchable .
People can find the story in Google and read the entire thing for free .
First Click Free : Content is behind a paywall .
Google is allowed past and can index the entire story to make it searchable .
People can find it in Google and read the entire thing for free .
From that story , people cannot click to read other stories at the same publication for free ( hence , the “ first click free ” name ) .
However , people can potentially go back to Google , find another article from the same site , click to it from Google and read that .
Subscription : Content is behind a paywall [ or requires free registration to read ] .
Google is allowed past and can index the entire story to make it searchable .
People can find it in Google .
They can only read the entire thing if they pay [ or register ] .
Preview : Content is behind a paywall [ or requires free registration to read ] .
Google is NOT allowed past to index the entire story to make it searchable .
People can find it in Google only based on the preview content .
They can only read the entire thing if they pay [ or register ] .
And because I like charts :
Listing Method Google Sees… Visitor Sees… Free Content Full story
Full story , for free First Click Free Full story
Full story , for free , if they click from Google Subscription Full story Summary .
Must pay or register to see full story Preview Preview / summary Summary .
Must pay or register to see full story
Clearly , there ’s room for improvement .
Flagging content that can be viewed through free registration as the same as content requiring payment does n’t make much sense .
It ’s also unclear to me if the “ subscription ” label means much to someone viewing search results .
Perhaps “ Pay Per View ” speaks better to what they can expect .
The Preview option may be hard to comprehend for some publishers .
It seems designed for those who are absolutely paranoid that they do n’t want Google to index their content , even though giving Google only a summary story degrades the chance of performing as well in search result .
The subscription option increases their findability yet protects their content from the general public just as well .
No Subscription Option For Regular Google Search
Note that the options above also are only for Google News .
In Google Web Search , the Free and First Click Free options are allowed .
Publishers can manually do Previews on their own .
But there ’s no option to show subscription - based content in Google Web Search , with the exception of Google Scholar content .
That ’s a big deal .
Newspapers get tons of traffic from regular Google web search .
If they go subscription - only , they ’ll lose that traffic .
That might be fine for News Corp , which argues that the traffic it receives is n’t that valuable ( despite , oddly , also purchasing ads on Google to gain more traffic ) .
But the difficulty for Google in allowing subscription content into regular web search is that if the top results get flooded with it , uses may become dissatisfied and express their frustration on Google .
Open To Listing Arrangements
Some of how things currently work may change , however , especially as the news industry itself is attempting new business models .
Said Cohen :
If people are putting more and more behind a paywall , it ’s in both parties ’ interest to be as flexible as possible around that , provided you can maintain a good user experience .
For us , we obviously want to be able to index that content in a reasonable way for our users .
If we can find ways to be flexible in supporting whatever models come up next , whether it ’s micropayments or whatever else that may be on the horizon , that ’s good for us .
For [ publishers ] , there is still a recognition that discovery is really important .
I would argue even more important if you ’re putting content behind a paywall , because all of a sudden , depending on your model , again , you ’re potentially shrinking your potential base of users .
So you want to increase the size of that funnel , you do n’t want to restrict it even further .
That ’s why we have those discussions with publishers .
That ’s why we work with the Wall Street Journal , the FT [ Financial Times ] and others with their subscription content because again , both of us are trying to do the same thing , which is make sure their content can get found . ”
Subscription Content Does n’t Rank As Well
Of course , while publishers are free to go subscription - only within Google News , they risk having lower visibility if they do so .
Cohen explained :
The reason that subscription content wo n’t do particularly well in search results is just the user behavior .
I ’m not saying all information wants to be free and has to be free , but the user behavior is by and large that people do n’t pay for a lot of that content .
If you have subscription content , the user response to it will in effect tell the algorithm this is n’t not a relevant result , I ’m not clicking on this .
By making it free or by in essence saying it ’s paid but Google treats it as free [ because of First Click Free ] , there ’s a significant advantage to them , because all their content is indexed , and I think at the end of the day probably helps the results .
People are more likely to link to it and all the different ways it can be beneficial .
It ’s not that the Google News algorithm treats subscription - content as second - class just because it is flagged subscription .
Instead , Cohen clarified , it ’s that the algorithm tries to mirror what users like .
Since they largely bypass subscription content , less of this is surfaced .
( See Under The Hood : Google News & Ranking Stories the third part of this interview , for more about how Google News ranks content )
The Many Shades Of No
Cohen also stressed again that the choices remain with publishers .
Beyond the Free / First Click Free / Subscription options , they can opt - out entirely from Google News or Google itself .
They can also say no in a far more granular way than some like those backing ACAP ( a proposed next - generation blocking and access system for search engines ) would have you believe :
There are discussions saying ‘ You ’re stealing my content , ’ but publishers have complete control on whether that content goes online in the first place .
The publisher ’s in complete control about the business model .
If they want put up a paywall , again , publishers can put up a paywall .
We do n’t force you to make it free .
In fact , we work with a number of publishers today who charge for content .
The other part of the extreme is even if you ’re online , that does n’t mean that we can come in and force you to index your content with us .
And this is the whole robots stuff , where if you do n’t want to put it in Google , or even just in Google News , you can block it , you can segment it or if you do n’t want to show snippets .
If you do n’t want to show images , you can do that too .
The publisher has complete control about whether that content is displayed .
[ By “ robots stuff , ” Cohen is referring to the robots exclusion protocol , explained further below in this interview . ]
We certainly hope people do n’t opt out .
We think there ’s high - quality content , and we want to be able to index it , but at the end of the day , the publisher has control over that .
So this sense that they have no choice but to be in Google , that they ’re forced , that we ’re breaking into their house and taking that print , digitizing it , putting it online and forcing it to be free ….
There are so many steps along the way where they can say ‘ Stop ’ and we will respect that , 100 % .
Build Your Paywall & Others May Go Elsewhere
How about the idea that newspapers all need permission to collude , to discuss openly banding together blocking all their content , because if they do n’t all do it at once — or if one person stays out offering material for free — then collectively they all lose .
From that comes a suggestion that they really do n’t have a choice , that they have to be in Google .
Cohen disagrees with this .
They do have a choice .
I think the reason publishers want to be in Google is because of the value we deliver .
There are a number of sources of information competing on the web today , so making sure your content is discoverable is by and large a good thing .
This idea that ‘ Oh , so nobody ’s going to read any other source other than what ’s in a newspaper . ’
Think about that for a second …. you have a number of different sources out there that are non-newspapers who are probably just ecstatic at the prospect of a lot of paywalls going up in a lot of different categories .
You know , pick a category .
CNN , general interest news , for example , I ’ve got to think , and I do n’t know , I do n’t know anything , I ’ve got no insight into CNN ’s thought process and maybe I ’m wrong , but they probably get a ton of traffic and do a fairly healthy business on the online side of things .
So if all these newspapers go behind a paywall , I would have to think that somebody like them , who ’s in a strong position right now , is probably going to take a different position .
Want To Exclude Only Google ?
That ’s Fine
That led me to the other solution that gets floated out there , a sense that there needs to be either an improved “ hot news ” law or tighter restrictions on fair use , so that people cannot so easily summarize stories ( such as when a blogger does highlights of a news story or when a mainstream news source summarizes a story from another mainstream publication ) .
When the interview happened , the AP has just suggested it might give its stories in advance to certain portals — widely interpreted that maybe Bing could get a head - start with news stories over Google .
What did Cohen think of those lobbying for fair use changes and the AP ’s push ?
Cohen did n’t really answer the fair use portion , though Google ’s been pretty clear that they feel what they do falls under fair use .
As for exclusivity , he did n’t seem bothered if someone wanted to partner with people other than Google .
There ’s a challenge over these existing business models .
I think some of it is , these are businesses that had 20 , 30 percent margins .
And that ’s probably not going to be the case going forward .
I do n’t see that just on the business side , forget both the cyclical and the secular changes to it .
Again the reality of it is that the publishers have complete control over their content on the web .
Whether or not you digitalize it , whether or not it ’s paid or free , and whether or not Google in particular has access to it .
With robots , you can specify by user agent .
If you want Yahoo and Microsoft , and you want to do a deal with Microsoft , and only have Microsoft have access to your content and say Google , do n’t index my content , you can do that .
The day after my interview with Cohen , Google CEO Eric Schmidt got asked about the AP news , as well , saying that Google had to be careful not to favor one publication over the other in terms of speed or latency .
Excluding Google News Vs. Excluding Google Web Search
One issue that came up with some Italian publishers recently what the suggestion that if you opt- out of Google News , you ca n’t be included in Google Web Search , which generally seems to send more traffic to publishers over time that Google News does .
So , the allegation was , if you object to being in Google ’s news portal that you view as a competitor , you also have to exclude yourself from also being in web search results that you might not view as so much a competitor ( see Debunking The Italian Newspapers ’ Antitrust Allegations Against Google for more on this ) .
Not true .
The reality is that you can opt- out of Google News but still be included Google Web Search .
However , you ca n’t do this automatically .
You have to request being dropped from Google News ( which , by the way , also does n’t automatically include anyone .
Some human reviewer at Google decides to include a source , or sources have to manually request inclusion if they ’re not already listed ) .
Should n’t the Robots Exclusion Protocol options ( robots. txt files or the meta robots tag ) used to signal automatic exclusion from indexing allow you to say no to Google News but yes to other Google search properties , such as Google Web Search ?
That ’s not easy , Cohen said , but it could come :
We recognize with Google News , it ’s very important to publishers to give them that option , if they want to opt - out specifically from Google News .
We allow them to do that , simply by telling us to remove them .
But as you apply to a whole set of different services within Google , it just gets hard to define what is the use that ’s intended for a given service .
That ’s the main issue from our side .
But at the end of the day , we want to give as much control to publishers over their content as possible .
So if that ’s something that we can do in a way that works for users in general , there ’s not a business reason why we would n’t want to give that control .
POSTSCRIPT : Google Adds Googlebot - News User Agent To Allow Blocking Google News from Dec. 2 , 2009 covers how Google now allows for automatic blocking of Google News .
Google ’s Inclusion Of Many News Sources May Draw Attacks
I also wondered why Cohen felt publishers seem to attack Google more when Yahoo News still outdistances Google as a leading news site by more than 3 to 1 , not to mention that unlike Google News ?
In part , he seemed to suggest that ironically , it ’s because Google ’s trying to show a diverse and level playing field of sources .
It includes a lot of publications and sends many of traffic to many of them , rather than a select few .
I do n’t know that it is Google News versus Yahoo News .
Probably , they view it more broadly as Google overall and Yahoo overall and getting back to size questions .
But I ca n’t answer that .
I ’m not in a position to do so .
It ’s more of a question from the publisher side of it .
From the news site of it , this is not a value judgment , just Yahoo News and Google News have just different approaches and different business models .
We ’re both aggregators , but they ’re more of a portal .
Their focus is on creating a Yahoo - branded experience , editorial voice , business model [ unlike Google News , Yahoo News employs journalists to produce original content ] .
They do send traffic to partners but a large part of it , that experience takes place on Yahoo ’s site .
What we ’re trying to do within Google News is around having as many different perspectives as possible on a given story and a diversity of sources .
Also , again keeping with how we tend to operate as a company , our business model is about directing that traffic back out to the publisher ’s site .
It ’s their business model , it ’s their look - and - feel , their editorial voice .
Again , I honestly do n’t mean that as any sort of a value judgment .
It ’s just different approaches to the space .
Google News & Content Partnerships
Would it help if Google partnered more with content owners for licensing agreements in the way that Yahoo apparently does ?
Cohen replied that Google has “ thousands ” of partnerships .
But to me , most these are down to AdSense , agreements to place Google ’s ad serving code on partner web sites — where the “ partnership ” has little more to do with someone filling out a self - serve form .
What about partnerships that cover the use of material on Google ’s site itself , such as how Yahoo licenses out wire content .
Cohen said that Google has 11 partnerships like this of its own , at the moment .
After the interview , I was sent the full list :
AP
AFP
UK Press Association
Canadian Press
EFE
Lusa
Keystone
APA
PAP
MTI
ANA
A deal with the AP was made in 2007 , followed by agreements with AFP , UK Press Association and Canadian Press in 2008 ( see Google News Now Hosting Wire Stories & Promises Better Variety In Results for more ) .
The latter seven listed are all members of the European Pressphoto Agency and signed an agreement with Google in March 2009 ( see also here ) .
Belgian papers that fought a much publicized battle against Google in 2006 were reincluded in 2007 .
At the time , this was not due to a financial settlement ( see Belgian Papers Back In Google ; Begin Using Standards For Blocking ) .
As they do n’t appear on the list of formal partners I was sent , I assume there still remains no formal agreement for their inclusion .
I also do n’t see on the list a deal with Sofam & Scam , two Belgian photo and A/V services that joined the case after it started , got an agreement , then dropped out of the suit .
So I ’m not sure if this is still active — I ’m checking on this .
Why Do Deals ?
Reducing Duplicate Stories One Reason
The content deals have been stuck for various reasons , Cohen said .
With both the AP and AFP , those deals were designed in part supposedly to help with the problem of duplication of wire content on Google News .
The same wire story might appear in various newspapers at the same time , which can confuse Google into thinking the stories are all different , when they ’re the same .
Said Cohen :
If you ’re trying to show different perspectives , having 50 copies of the same story does n’t make sense .
Continuing , he also talked about why as part of the deal , Google agreed to host AP articles on Google itself :
They have a different business model where the focus [ of the AP ’s web site ] is primarily on the B2B space .
They do n’t have a [ consumer ] destination .
They do n’t want to , or they can ’t , because of the challenges that might cause for them with sales .
By sales , Cohen refers to the issue that the AP both gives its own original content to member publications plus take stories in from them to distribute to all AP members .
If the AP creates a news portal of its own , it potentially competes with member publications for readers , using content from some of those members .
So with the AP , the existing deal was intended to help solve dual issues , that of Google wanting to reduce duplicate stories and for AP to have Google host its stories in a somewhat “ neutral ” environment that might be more acceptable to its members , since the AP could n’t host the news itself .
AP ’s Ranking Boost Quest
Interestingly , one of the AP ’s top concerns with a new deal with Google appears to be that it wants to rank better in Google ’s results .
Unfortunately , the AP shows its ineptness in understanding search when it speaks like this .
There is no way — no way — that Google ’s going to guarantee the AP a ranking boost over other news sites .
Really , what the AP seems to want to ensure that if one of its stories is managing to get into the top results , that the AP itself gets the spot , not a submission of the story over at Digg , not a summary of the story over at the Huffington Post , not a copy of its story on one of its many member publications .
As best I can tell — I ’ve not had luck getting the AP to talk to me directly , but I ’ll be trying again .
That ’s actually more reasonable .
In fact , SEOs have long been lobbying Google for ways to ensure that original source documents show up ahead of pages that simply reference those documents with little value - add ( IE : news flash AP , this is n’t just your problem , and people have been actively working long before you to help solve it ) .
One solution that came this year was the canonical tag , which is about to expand with cross -domain support .
Another solution remains with the AP itself .
By not having its own news portal , by having stories that can disappear after 30 days , it constantly shoots itself in the foot to gain the links that would let it naturally rank better in Google .
Consider an AP story from October published with the AP ’s cooperation at Google News , covering how the AP itself might want to charge some portals for early content access .
Techmeme featured the story , as did several blogs like ReadWriteWeb and Mashable .
By try to read the story they all linked to , and it ’s gone .
For more on the issues addressed above , see these articles :
But Duplicates Still Get Through
Back to the existing Google - AP deal .
There , the de-duplication aspect has n’t panned out as well as promised .
It ’s still possible to search on Google and encounter the same AP story being hosted by different newspapers .
In addition , the theory was that if there was an AP story , it was the AP story hosted at Google that was supposed to get to billing , not the same story at members .
Cohen acknowledged there are still issues :
We ’re still indexing everything and showing the duplicates , but trying in the default results to show the canonical page [ the AP story on Google itself ]
Continuing , he explained there are challenges , in that what may seem like the same AP story in different papers might not be the exact same story .
“ If they [ an AP member publication ] edit it or add original quotes , it begins to change , ” he said .
“ There ’s a gray area of trying to get that right and capture changes .
We want to capture [ and show ] substantial changes but not have someone tweak a headline or byline and get listed as if it ’s a different story . ”
Still , it ’s been over two years since Google began offering hosted wire stories .
You ’d expect these problems to be sorted out by now .
Not Said : Deals Stop Lawsuits
What the deals have been most successful at , at least with the AP and AFP , have been to defuse lawsuits .
The AFP did sue Google ; the AP threatened .
Google said what it was doing with news stories fell under fair use and that the deals it cut were specifically for “ new ” and “ extensive ” uses of wire content that went beyond fair use ( see AFP & Google Settle Over Google News Copyright Case for more ) .
Cohen reiterated this when I asked specifically about it during our interview .
Google completely disagrees that listing a headline and summary of a story , with a link to that story , violates copyright laws as some publishers have contended .
Nevertheless , the agreements got some wire services off Google ’s back .
The AP Pushes At Google
The fires are being stoked again , however .
The AP agreement is being renegotiated , and the organization has sent conflicting messages about how and when it considers listing articles to go beyond fair use .
The AP is also launching a “ news registry ” it says will allow it to track usages of AP content in part as a way ensure content is properly licensed ( according to the AP ’s view ; others may disagree ) .
Confusingly , on Friday , there came a report from Business Insider that the AP may want Google to maintain this registry ( Google said they had no comment about this ) .
Meanwhile , an earlier project that the AP backed — the aforementioned ACAP — moves along with its own system of automatically transmitting licensing information , not that anyone is currently trying to actually license material in the way that ACAP - backers hope .
Also on Friday , there came a report that from TechCrunch that Microsoft might try to woo publishers into blocking Google and get behind ACAP .
I ’d previously talked with Google ’s Schmidt about the business dealings with the AP , so see my interview with him for more on that ( Google CEO Eric Schmidt On Newspapers & Journalism ) .
With Cohen , I focused on more technical aspects .
Robots.txt Works Fine ; ACAP Needs Progress
In particular , Google ’s primary way of dealing with publishers remains the Robots Exclusion Protocol ( REP ) .
With the AP having pushed two alternatives to this , is there a problem with REP ?
Will Google get behind ACAP ?
The AP stuff [ the news registry ] is still so vague that I ca n’t talk too much about it .
The ACAP thing , there ’s a challenge with some of the specific protocols .
A good chunk of it can already be done with robots [ REP ] , and it already works .
Continuing , Cohen explained further :
That ’s not to say there is n’t more than can be done [ with REP ] .
To keep that moving forward makes sense .
Some things they [ ACAP ] want to do , it ’s not a question of being bad for Google but bad for the web that opens the door to a lot of spam .
For example , a directive of what the snippet should be , that this is what you have to show .
One guy said the whole spam thing is overstated .
You have to think about any protocol to work for the common web , not just news publishers .
We ’ve had these discussions .
Unfortunately , we have n’t seen much progress there .
The lack of considering the “ common web ” resonates with me .
As my Search Engines , Permissions & Moving Forward In Copyright Battles article explains , a weakness to me with ACAP has long been that it was designed by news publishers , for news publishers while search engines deal with more content than that .
From my article , I wrote ;
A new system to be developed with the search engines and a broad range of publishers for online indexing .
That ’s not ACAP , in the sense that ACAP had not specific solutions when it rolled out .
Moreover , ACAP really represents the interests of a minority of publishers on the web , news publishers .
Web publishers are online merchants and small bloggers and forum owners and those with personal home pages and B2B business and Fortune 1000 sites and local merchants with single pages and more .
No , every constituency can’t be represented .
But any new system needs more broad - based participation .
ACAP recently rolled out an updated specification ( PDF ) ; I ’ll be looking at the system and how it weighs up against REP in a future article .
Do n’t Blame Us ; Blame The Internet
During the interview , I also remarked how I find it personally odd to see publishers upset that Google and other “ aggregators ” are supposedly taking away their visitors .
For me and for others , these places are our newspapers .
And while publishers might prefer we start our day with them , it seems unlikely for many that this will change .
But it also does n’t have to be a negative because these same aggregators accused of robbing visitors to me also seem to be exposing news content that many would have never seen before .
Cohen commented similar to what Schmidt has said before in my interview with him , that Google gets blamed for disruption rather than changes the internet itself as a new communications medium has caused .
Eric touched on this , in how Google is often seen as synonymous with the internet .
And so anything good that happens , in the space , Google did it , Google did something , and we may have had anything nothing to do with whatever innovation was out there .
And anything bad that happens is Google ’s fault .
So this idea , the issues that publishers have around Google News .
I mean if Google News did n’t exist or even broader , if Google did n’t exist , it ’s not going to change the basic disruption that ’s taken place within digital media .
And in fact , if anything — and I certainly see the disruption that ’s there and I can recognize that — but I think you also have to recognize that the train left the station before Google came to fruition .
And Google is just a tool to help you navigate that .
And the different properties are there that help you find that information in an increasingly fragmented space .
NOTE : Google ’s News Experiments & The Quest To Solve The “ Read State ” Issue is the second part of this interview that deals with Google ’s experimentation with news products ; Under The Hood : Google News & Ranking Stories is the third part that looks more deeply into how Google News determines what to show visitors .
reversing pascal ’s wager
According to Blaise Pascal , believers have nothing to lose from putting their faith into a deity that might not exist while atheists shoulder all the risk .
But what if Pascal missed what it means to be a believer ?
According to religious fundamentalists in the U.S. , this world is infested with dark , alluring , sinful temptations which exist solely to condemn our souls to Hell .
Doubt and skepticism , unwed consenting adults having sex without guilt or shame , using science to shine a light on how the universe came to be without resorting to a supernatural placeholder , and spiritual musings that fall outside literalist dogmas are evil temptresses any human must reject or suffer an eternity of torture in the afterlife .
These things look nice and reasonable , say the fundamentalists , but do n’t be fooled .
In their worldview , we should all be pliant , obedient to every word of their rendition of the Bible , and instead of thinking and analyzing , they should just believe and do what they ’re told by the fundamentalist script for an ideal society .
And if you take issue with just how well founded their ideas really are , you ’ll be met with a pivotal weapon in their proselytizing arsenal ; Pascal ’s Wager .
Ever since Blaise Pascal proposed that even if God ca n’t be proven by scientific means , we should n’t “ wager eternity , ” Christian literalists have been using this argument to escape scientific discussions and go straight to fire and brimstone fear mongering .
While fundamentalists will tell you that what they ’re giving new coverts is hope , what they actually sell is fear of eternal torture , fire and damnation , offering themselves as your only possible escape .
It ’s the same tactic that mobsters use to get rent from a business .
They say that they ’re selling protection , but if the owner refuses to pay , they ’ll send a few goons to threaten him or smash up his store , or bar , or office and leave the owner little choice but to pay up and avoid the harassment and an even greater financial loss .
That ’s basically Pascal ’s Wager in a nutshell .
Just believe and follow religious dogma or you might face potential unpleasantries in the afterlife .
Even if you ’re wrong in your beliefs , at least you avoided Hell so you technically lost nothing .
Nothing important that is .
Just the freedom to lead your life the way you want and make the most of your time on Earth since many of our pleasures are vilified , stigmatized or outright forbidden by the religion you ’ll have to follow .
Rather than encourage moderation in our little vices and letting our mind soar , religious literalists like to paint our intellectual achievements and earthly delights as alluring , stimulating , beautiful but ultimately sinful , evil , and something to be ashamed and terrified of .
They craft a metaphorical picture of the secular world as that of a beautiful demon which seduces men and women into utter depravity , angering a God who ’s always ready to smite the deviant unbelievers .
It ’s not enough just to be a good person and have a little fun in moderation .
You have to do it the way they want you to do it or it does n’t count .
Any disagreement with their agenda means that you ’re a wicked sinner who fell prey to the beautiful temptress of base pleasures and is too deluded to agree with “ the obvious truth of their statements . ”
Somehow , I doubt that belief being used as a tool for conformity by threats of supernatural brutality is what Pascal had in mind when he wrote his argument .
So what if we reverse the Wager and apply it to believers ?
What if they choose to believe against all facts and end up wrong ?
How many opportunities did they lose ?
How many experiences did they deny themselves just because they were afraid of something for which we have absolutely no evidence ?
How much guilt or shame did they carry because they were told to ?
And finally , how much grief and pain did they cause by applying their unyielding dogmas on those around them all in the name of self - righteousness ?
When Pascal ’s Wager was introduced , it came as apart of a work on Christian apologetics and fervently denied science and reason as a reliable tool for working with the universe .
But today , we know a lot more and managed to discover profound things using the very reason and science Pascal dismissed centuries ago .
And after applying reason to the natural world again and again , we ’ve seen that making a choice based on the evidence you have available is usually better than just hedging your bets out of fright that some supernatural creature might kick you around in a metaphysical realm after you die .
So the next time you find yourself face to face with a proselytizer who says you have nothing to lose , maybe it ’s a good idea to start listing all the freedoms you ’ll have to forfeit starting with the ability to build your own life as you want to , without instructions of a pastor or a priest .
Because after all , if your life now has to be guided by a group of people who think they know everything about the universe even though they seem to be unable to get their facts straight and have to rely on spacious rhetoric to make a point , are n’t you giving up what makes you , you for the sake of fearful conformity ?
And is living in fear really worth taking a gamble on whether there is an omnipresent supernatural creature waiting for you in an afterlife in the total absence of proof for it ?
( PhysOrg.com ) -- UNSW researchers may have pinpointed the cause of muscle wasting and bone - density loss experienced by astronauts who fly lengthy missions under the weightless conditions of space .
Australian scientists may have pinpointed the cause of muscle wasting and bone - density loss experienced by astronauts who fly lengthy missions under the weightless conditions of space , new research reveals .
University of New South Wales researchers used a NASA rotating - wall vessel to reproduce microgravity , which is experienced by astronauts in low Earth orbit , to analyse its effect on human embryonic stem cells .
Seventy five per cent of the proteins from the cells exposed to microgravity were not found in those grown under normal gravity .
The microgravity - exposed cells produced more proteins that negatively regulate bone density and fewer proteins with antioxidant effects .
Antioxidants protect the body from reactive oxidants that can damage DNA .
" The finding may explain loss of bone density and muscle wasting experienced by astronauts , " says Dr Brendan Burns , a UNSW biologist who led the study with researchers Elizabeth Blaber and Helder Marcal .
" A lot of work has been done on microgravity at a systemic level , such as the effects on the immune system .
No -one has really looked at the effect of microgravity at a cellular level and we think that is a huge gap .
" What we 've found is a range of different proteins that are potentially important for astronaut health were more or less predominant in terms of different gravity . "
NASA has hinted at plans to construct a solar - powered outpost at one the Moon 's poles by 2024 .
The base would permit sustained human presence on the Moon , which would serve as a staging post for future missions to Mars and beyond .
But prolonged exposure to microgravity would pose increased health risks to astronauts .
The absence of normal Earth gravity causes physiological changes , such as bone loss , muscle atrophy and loss of blood volume , which could cause astronauts to feel lightheaded and dizzy once they arrive at the surface of Mars after a long voyage .
It has long been known that microgravity affects bone density but so far nobody has pinpointed the genes and proteins that are affected by microgravity which might promote this condition .
Research aimed at understanding the effects of microgravity on human physiology could assist the development of health and safety practices for astronauts .
The research is being presented this week in Sydney at the 9th Australian Space Sciences Conference .

Holy shit , Japan is getting prepped to drop $ 21 billion on a solar power station in space , one that will beam enough energy back to Earth to power 294,000 homes .
With no cables .

The whole deal is being put together by Mitsubishi Electric Corp. and industrial design company IGI Corp .
The plan involves a gigantic solar panel floating around in space , soaking up a gigawatt of energy and beaming it to Earth without the use of cables .
And they hope to have it ready to rock within four years .

Pretty amazing stuff .
Here 's hoping it works well and does n't end up giving the entire country of Japan cancer .
Thanks for testing that whole thing out for us , guys !

Constructive gem : double exponentials
Andrej Bauer
,
In the last constructive gem we studied the exponential $ 2 ^ \ mathbb {N} $ and its isomorphic copies .
This time we shall compute the double exponential $ 2 ^ { 2^\mathbb {N}} $ and even write some Haskell code .
By $ 2 $ we mean the set $ \lbrace 0,1\rbrace $ of the Boolean values .
First note that there is a difference between $ ( 2^2 ) ^\mathbb{N}$ and $ 2^{2^\mathbb{N}}$ .
The former is isomorphic to the Cantor space $ 2^ \mathbb {N} $ because $ ( 2^2 ) ^\mathbb{N} = 2 ^ {2 \times \ mathbb{N}} = 2 ^ \mathbb{N}$ , while the latter is the space of functionals , which are maps from infinite binary sequences to bits .
In Haskell we would define these as
type Nat = Int -- notational convenience type Natural = Integer -- notational convenience type Cantor = Nat ->
Bool type Functional = Cantor ->
Bool
Throughout we will write $ 0 $ and $ 1 $ for false and true , but convert them to Boolean values False and True in Haskell code .
You may download all Haskell code from this post in one chunk here : double.hs .
What can we say about $ 2^{2^\mathbb {N}}$ ?
In classical set theory the basic observation is that $ 2 ^ \ mathbb {N} $ has the cardinality of continuum , and that $ 2 ^ { 2^\mathbb {N}} $ has cardinality even greater than that , but it is undecidable from the standard axioms of set theory whether the cardinality of $ 2 ^ { 2 ^ \mathbb {N}} $ is $ \aleph_2 $ or something larger ( this is an instance of the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis ) .
There seems to be no consensus among set theorists about what the answer should be .
Is there a consensus among constructive mathematicians ?
Because constructive mathematics is “ backwards compatible ” with classical mathematics , we cannot be specific about $ 2 ^ { 2^\mathbb {N}} $ without assuming additional axioms .
And this is where fun begins with constructive mathematics : assume an axiom which contradicts classical logic and see what happens ( set theorists do something similar with their non-standard axioms , except that theirs are compatible with classical logic ) .
Of course , such axioms do not just drop from the sky , they are always well motivated by some aspect of computation or geometry .
I should warn you that the anti-classical axioms are the mathematical equivalent of psychoactive drugs : they take some getting used to , they are addictive and warp your sense of reality .
Before we digest the axiom let us ask what sort of functionals we are able to come up with constructively .
An easy one would be “ evaluate at $ n $ ” , defined as
$ $ E_n ( \alpha ) = \alpha ( n ) $ $
( We use lower - case Greek letters for infinite binary sequences and capital letters for functionals . )
Or we can combine several bits of a sequence with a Boolean function , such as
$ $ F ( \alpha ) = \alpha ( 0 ) \land ( \alpha ( 7 ) \lor \ lnot \alpha ( 13 ) ) . $ $
This particular functional has the property that there is a constant , namely $ 13 $ , such that its value depends only on the bits $ 0 $ through $ 13 $ of $ \alpha $ ( of course it only depends on bits $ 0 $ , $ 7 $ and $ 13 $ , but we will just keep track of the highest bit on which the functional depends ) .
In general , we say that a functional $ F \in 2 ^ { 2 ^ \mathbb {N}} $ is uniformly continuous , if it has a modulus ( of uniform continuity ) , which is a number $k \in \mathbb {
N} $ such that $ F ( \alpha ) $ depends only on the bits $ 0 $ through $ k$ of $ \alpha$ .
The terminology comes from the fact that such functionals are precisely the uniformly continuous maps from the Cantor space $ 2 ^ \mathbb {N} $ to the discrete space $ 2 $ .
( I leave it as exercise for you to define the suitable metric on $ 2 ^ \ mathbb {N} $ , constructively of course . )
A uniformly continuous functional may be represented by a finite amount of information as follows .
Every functional $ F \in 2 ^ { 2 ^ \mathbb{N}} $ can be decomposed uniquely into two functionals $ F_0 $ and $ F_1 $ such that
$ F( \alpha ) = F_0 ( \lambda n. \ alpha( n+1 ) ) $ when $ \alpha ( 0 ) = 0 $ ,
$ F( \alpha ) = F_1 ( \lambda n. \ alpha( n+1 ) ) $ when $ \alpha ( 0 ) = 1 $ .
The decomposition corresponds to investigating the first bit of the input $ \alpha$ and making a decision based on that .
In terms of exponential arithmetic , the decomposition of $ F$ into $ F_0 $ and $ F_1 $ corresponds to the isomorphism
$ $ 2^{2^\mathbb {N}} = 2^ { 2^{1 + \ mathbb{N}}} = 2^{2 \times 2^\mathbb{N}} = ( 2^{2^\mathbb{N}} ) ^2 = 2^{2^\mathbb{N}} \times 2^{2^\mathbb{N}} . $ $
We may decompose $ F_0 $ and $ F_1 $ further into $ F_{00} $ , $ F_{01} $ , $ F_{10} $ , and $ F_ { 11} $ , and keep going .
If $ F $ is uniformly continuous with modulus $ k$ then after $ k$ decompositions we get constant functionals .
Thus we can represent every uniformly continuous functional with an element of the inductive type
data UCF = Const Bool | Decompose UCF UCF
The functional which always returns the value b is represented by Const b , whereas Decompose x y represents the functional whose decompositions $ F_0 $ and $ F_1 $ are represented by x and y , respectively .
The Haskell function that converts the representation into a functional is :
fn :: UCF ->
Functional fn ( Const b ) alpha = b fn ( Decompose x y ) alpha = fn ( if alpha 0 then y else x ) (
-> alpha ( n+1 ) )
Unfortunately , every functional has infinitely many representations because we may keep decomposing even if the functional is constant .
For example , the functional $ F( \alpha ) = 0 $ can be represented by Const False , or Decompose ( Const False ) ( Const False ) , and so on .
This will not do for our purposes .
We need a representation that represents each uniformly continuous functional uniquely .
Furthermore , we want the representation expressed as an inductive type , so we cannot just take the above representation and remove some elements from it .
After a day of head scratching and a nudge in the right direction by Sergio Cabello , I came up with the following representation .
A uniformly continuous functional $ F \in 2 ^ { 2 ^ \mathbb {N}} $ is either constant or non-constant , and a non-constant functional $ F$ has precisely one of the following forms :
$ F( \alpha ) = ( \alpha ( 0 ) = b ) $ for a unique $ b \in \lbrace 0,1 \rbrace$ , i.e. , $ F$ makes its decision by looking at the head of $ \alpha$ , or
$ F( \alpha ) = ( \alpha ( 0 ) = b ) \land G( \lambda n. \alpha( n+1 ) ) $ for a unique $ b \in \lbrace 0,1 \rbrace $ and a unique non-constant $ G$ , or
$ F( \alpha ) = ( \alpha ( 0 ) = b ) \lor G( \lambda n. \alpha( n+1 ) ) $ for a unique $ b \in \lbrace 0,1 \rbrace $ and a unique non-constant $ G$ , or
$ F( \alpha ) $ decomposes uniquely into non-constant functionals $ F_0 $ and $ F_1 $ , as above .
This leads to the following two - stage definition in Haskell :
-- representation of non-constant functionals data UCF ' = Head Bool | And Bool UCF ' | Or Bool UCF ' | Decompose UCF ' UCF ' deriving ( Eq , Show ) -- representation of arbitrary functionals data UCF = Const Bool | Nonconst UCF ' deriving ( Eq , Show )
Here are the maps that convert representations to functionals :
-- convert a non-constant representation to the functional fn ' :: UCF ' ->
Functional fn' f \alpha = compute 0 f where compute k ( Head b ) = ( \alpha k == b ) compute k ( And b x ) = ( \alpha k == b ) && ( compute ( k+1 ) x ) compute k ( Or b x ) = ( \alpha k == b ) || ( compute ( k+1 ) x ) compute k ( Decompose x y ) = ( \alpha k == False && compute ( k+1 ) x ) || ( \alpha k == True && compute ( k+1 ) y ) -- convert a representation to the functional fn :: UCF ->
Functional fn ( Const b ) = const b fn ( Nonconst x ) = fn' x
So much about uniformly continuous functionals .
What about the non-uniformly continuous ones ?
Here is one :
$ F( \alpha ) = 1 $ when $ \forall n \ in \ mathbb { N} , \alpha( n ) = 0 $ ,
$ F( \alpha ) = 0 $ otherwise .
Unfortunately , this is not a constructively valid definition because it presupposes that every $ \alpha \in 2 ^ \mathbb {
N} $ is equal to the zero sequence or not .
Here is another attempt :
$ F( \alpha ) = 0 $ if the least $n \in \ mathbb { N} $ for which $ \alpha ( n ) = 1 $ is even ,
$ F( \alpha ) = 1 $ if the least $n \in \ mathbb { N} $ for which $ \alpha ( n ) = 1 $ is odd .
This is a constructive definition ( you can easily translate it into Haskell ) , the functional is not uniformly continuous , but unfortunately it is not total either because its value is undefined when $ \alpha$ is the zero sequence .
Try as hard as you may , you will not be able to define constructively a functional which is not uniformly continuous .
If you ca n’t beat them , join them :
Axiom : All functionals $ 2^\mathbb{N} \ to 2 $ are uniformly continuous .
I am going to convince you that the axiom is true , or more precisely that it could be true , by writing in Haskell the inverse of fn :: UCF ->
Functional , thus witnessing the fact that in the Haskell world every functional has a UCF representation and so is uniformly continuous .
But first let me just mention that books on constructive mathematics never phrase the axiom in the above form .
In Brouwerian intuitionism our axiom is actually a theorem which follows from two more basic principles ( I am misrepresenting them a bit , I hope the experts wo n’t mind ) :
Continuity principle :
All maps are continuous .
Fan Principle : The Cantor space is compact .
It ’s not too hard to derive our axiom from these two ( compactness here is meant in the sense of Heine - Borel : every cover of the Cantor space by open balls has a finite subcover ) .
If you want to know more about this topic , see :
D. Bridges , H. Ishihara , and P. Schuster : Compactness and continuity , constructively revisited in : Computer Science Logic ( J. Bradfield , ed ; Proceedings of 16th International Workshop CSL 2002 , 11th Annual Conference of the EACSL , Edinburgh , Scotland , September 22 – 25 ) , Lecture Notes in Computer Science 2471 , 89 –102 , Springer - Verlag , Berlin and Heidelberg , 2002 .
There is an evil Springer link to the paper that wants to sell it to you for 25 USD , and unfortunately none of the authors published it on the web .
To define the inverse of fn I will use seemingly impossible functionals by Martin Escardo .
Here ’s a fairly fast version of his quantifiers :
-- Martin Escardo's find , forevery and forsome functionals find :: Functional ->
Cantor find p = branch x l r where branch x l r n | n == 0 = x | odd n = l ( ( n - 1 ) $ div$ 2 ) | otherwise = r ( ( n - 2 ) $ div $ 2 ) x = forsome ( \l -> forsome ( \r -> p ( branch True l r ) ) ) l = find ( \l -> forsome ( \r -> p( branch x l r ) ) ) r = find ( \r -> p ( branch x l r ) ) forevery , forsome :: Functional ->
Bool forsome f = f ( find f ) forevery f = not ( forsome ( not . f ) )
You do n’t have to understand this ( although you really should , read the post ) , just remember that forevery f is True precisely when f always returns True .
This allows us to detect whether a functional $ f$ is constant by checking whether $ f( \alpha ) = f( \lambda n. 0 ) $ for all $ \alpha \in 2^\ mathbb {N} $ .
Here ’s the function we need :
-- get_const f returns
Just b if f is constantly b , and Nothing otherwise get_const :: ( Functional ) ->
Maybe Bool get_const f = let b = f ( const False ) in if forevery ( \\alpha -> f \alpha == b ) then Just b else Nothing
And here is the inverse of fn , there is no point in explaining the code , just stare at it for a while :
-- in order to define the inverse of fn we need an auxiliary function shift prepend :: Bool -> ( Nat -> Bool ) -> ( Nat -> Bool ) prepend b \alpha 0 = b prepend b \alpha ( n+1 ) = \alpha n shift :: Bool -> ( Functional ) ->
Functional shift b f = f . ( prepend b ) -- the inverse of fn ' computes the representation of a non-constant functional unfn ' :: Functional -> UCF ' unfn ' f = case ( get_const ( shift False f ) , get_const ( shift True f ) ) of ( Just True , Just False ) -> Head False ( Just False , Just True ) ->
Head True ( Just False , Nothing ) ->
And True ( unfn ' ( shift True f ) ) ( Nothing , Just False ) ->
And False ( unfn ' ( shift False f ) ) ( Just True , Nothing ) ->
Or False ( unfn ' ( shift True f ) ) ( Nothing , Just True ) ->
Or True ( unfn ' ( shift False f ) ) ( Nothing , Nothing ) ->
Decompose ( unfn ' ( shift False f ) ) ( unfn ' ( shift True f ) ) -- finally , the inverse of fn computes the representation of a functional unfn :: Functional -> UCF unfn f = case get_const f of Just b -> Const b Nothing -> Nonconst ( unfn ' f )
Let ’s try it out :
> let f \alpha = \alpha 0 || \alpha 2 > unfn f Nonconst ( Or True ( Decompose ( Head True ) ( Head True ) ) ) > let g = fn ( unfn f ) > forevery ( \\alpha -> f \alpha == g \alpha ) True
In a sense we computed the double exponential $ 2^{2^\mathbb {N}} $ to be isomorphic to the inductive datatype UCF .
But this is ugly and we can do better , namely
$ $ 2^{2^\mathbb {N}} = \ mathbb{N} . $ $
If you think this is weird , remember that you just took in an anti-classical axiom .
To establish the equality we have to show that $ \mathbb {N} $ is isomorphic to UCF .
This is not complicated as UCF is an inductive type : the low bits of a number are used as tags for alternatives and the high bits for the data :
-- encode a pair of numbers by interleaving their bits pair :: Natural -> Natural ->
Natural pair 0 0 = 0 pair m n = let ( mq , mr ) = divMod m 2 ( nq , nr ) = divMod n 2 in mr + 2 * nr + 4 * pair mq nq -- decode a pair of numbers unpair :: Natural -> ( Natural , Natural ) unpair 0 = ( 0 , 0 ) unpair n = let ( p, xr ) = divMod n 2 ( q , yr ) = divMod p 2 ( x , y ) = unpair q in ( xr + 2* x , yr + 2*y ) -- enumeration of all elments of UCF ' without repetitions enum ' :: Natural -> UCF ' enum ' 0 = Head False enum ' 1 = Head True enum ' ( n+2 ) = case n $ mod $ 5 of 0 ->
And False ( enum ' ( n $ div$ 5 ) ) 1 ->
And True ( enum ' ( n $ div$ 5 ) ) 2 ->
Or False ( enum ' ( n $ div$ 5 ) ) 3 ->
Or True ( enum ' ( n $ div$ 5 ) ) 4 ->
Decompose ( enum ' n0 ) ( enum ' n 1 ) where ( n0 , n1 ) = unpair ( n $ div$ 5 ) -- the inverse of enum ' computes the index of a given representation denum ' :: UCF ' -> Natural denum ' ( Head False ) = 0 denum ' ( Head True ) = 1 denum ' ( And False x ) = 2 + 5 * denum ' x denum ' ( And True x ) = 3 + 5 * denum ' x denum ' ( Or False x ) = 4 + 5 * denum ' x denum ' ( Or True x ) = 5 + 5 * denum ' x denum ' ( Decompose x y ) = 6 + 5 * pair ( denum ' x ) ( denum ' y ) -- enumeration of all elements of UCF without repetitions enum :: Natural -> UCF enum 0 = Const False enum 1 = Const True enum ( n+2 ) = Nonconst ( enum ' n ) -- the inverse of enum computes the index of a given representation denum :: UCF -> Natural denum ( Const False ) = 0 denum ( Const True ) = 1 denum ( Nonconst x ) = 2 + denum ' x
The isomorphisms between $ 2^{2^\mathbb {N}} $ and $ \mathbb {N} $ are denum.unfn and fn.enum .
They work faster than I expected .
For example , computing the code of the functional $ F( \alpha ) = \ alpha ( 0 ) \land ( \alpha ( 7 ) \lor \ lnot \alpha( 13 ) ) $ from above takes two seconds on my old Thinkpad X41 tablet with GHCi 6.8.2 :
> denum ( unfn ( \alpha -> alpha 0 && ( \alpha 7 || not ( alpha 13 ) ) ) )

That ’s 1798 digits if I am counting correctly .
And here is the verification that ( denum.unfn ) . ( fn.enum ) is the identity for all numbers up to 10000 :

Graffiti has existed since ancient times with examples dating back to Ancient Greece and the Roman Empire .
In modern times , spray paint , regular paint and markers are the most commonly used materials .
Although the defacing of property is a crime punishable by law , many artists choose to express themselves this way .
This form of art is also used by some for communicating social and political messages .
For this post , we ’ve compiled a collection of 40 striking examples of Graffiti Art .
Know of any other great examples ?
Please post them in the comments ’ area .

I just got my iPhone this morning at the Apple Store in Valley Fair ( San Jose , CA ) and Steve Wozniak was there .
I arrived at 3:50 am and Mr. Woz was chopping it up with the manager at Apple .
Then around 4:30 am he politely asked everyone in line if he could be the 1st to get his iPhone at the store and everyone said yes .
( Pic taken on 1st gen edge iPhone ) Then at 5:54 am the store decided to start selling iPhones ( 1 hour and 6 mins ahead of schedule ) ... I was n't complaining I got a cool shot with him ( Pic taken on my new iPhone 3G S , but had a n00b person taking the pic ) Then I got him to sign my box ... I get the special Woz Edition ( Pic also taken on my new iPhone 3G S ) I was about the 15th person in line .
I *heart * APPLE !
According to an anonymous Microsoft insider , the company has been holding special , secret meetings with what could be the least secretive codename , ever : " Screw Google ! "
As often as once a week , Microsoft is initiating what are being referred to as " Screw Google " meetings aimed at discrediting the corporate advancements of Google .
Attending these meetings : a blend of Google rivals and third - party professional groups hired to develop the strategies needed to take down the current web search leader .
The leak to the public has caused more than a few Microsoft affiliates to sweat .
Law Media Group Reportedly
At the Helm
One of these affiliates is Law Media Group ( LMG ) , whose relationship with Microsoft has been suspicious from the start .
LMG is a secretive outfit which Microsoft retains for issues related to " public policy and government affairs . "
When questioned , Law Media Group declined to comment on what services are provided to Microsoft , but did remain adamant about having never attended a " Screw Google " meeting .
( Source : dailyfinance.com )
According to a nameless informant , however , finding different ways to bash Google is all Law Media Group does for Microsoft .
The tipster then went on to name the person at the helm of these secret meetings : Fred Humphries .
Humphries works as a chief lobbyist for Microsoft in Washington , D.C .
Microsoft , Google Natural Rivals
While Humphries has yet to comment on his role in these alleged meetings , one thing is for certain : Microsoft and Google are natural rivals who are not above using underhanded tactics when flexing their corporate muscle .
Perhaps the episode that best epitomizes the extreme dislike shared by Microsoft and Google was evident when Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer hurled a chair across his office and screamed out " I 'm going to * expletive * kill Google ! " after the Google reportedly lured away a Microsoft employee in China .

Twitter simply emerged in outrage after previous New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg was given a prime speaking area at the Democratic National Convention Twitter users were particularly livid over the truth that he was given more time to talk thanRep Alexandria Ocasio - Cortez ( D - NY ) .
Bloomberg 's Speech During his speech , Bloomberg joked ...
One late night in 2007 , Rogelio Bernal Andreo and his wife were driving down Highway 1 along California 's Lost Coast , when his wife opened the moon roof .
What spread out above them looked nothing like the mauve sky near their Sunnyvale home .
" It was like the Milky Way was in front of us , " said Andreo , a former early eBay employee , who runs a Spanish - language internet company .
" It looked like it was gonna fall on us . "
He pulled out his digital SLR camera and spent two hours trying to capture the vast galaxy .
When he got home , he downloaded the photos , and caught the astrophotography bug .
" I started to look on the internet and see all these pictures , really gorgeous pictures , " Andreo said .
" I said , ' How do people do this ? ' "
Two years of intensive study , rigorous practice , and perhaps $ 10,000 of equipment later , he knows .
And he let Wired.com in on his process .
Step - by - step , we 'll break down how he went from the black - and - white star scene below to the mind - blowing space photo above .
Thanks to cheaper high - quality digital cameras and editing equipment , creating beautiful images of galaxies , nebulae and star clusters is now within the reach of anyone with a few thousand dollars to spend .
So , we live in a golden age for space photos , but looking at the technicolor images of what appears to the naked eye to be a fairly bland sky , we find ourselves asking :
Does it really look like that ?
As we find in this behind - the - scenes look at the making of a mind - blowing space photo , the answer is yes — but just not to your eyes , which are pretty poor sensors , compared with purpose - built astrophotographic equipment .
But that does n't mean the photos are n't " real . "
Most astrophotographers have an ethic :
They wo n't add color or lasso just a part of an image for editing .
They can only bring things out of the data , not add them .
The photos are often processed in Photoshop , but what they do is the opposite of falsifying the visual record .
Astrophotographers are using digital - editing tools to find the truth in the noisy data that are the heavens .
" The stuff up there is really dim , " Andreo said .
" The good thing is that the camera records all that and the trick is to bring it out . "
The first step in getting a good space photo is picking a spot without light pollution from cities .
In northern California , Andreo prefers Lake San Antonio , Henry Coe State Park and Fremont Peak , depending on how far he wants to drive .
His equipment list is long .
He packs a Takahashi telescope , Takahashi mount , tripod , SBIG STL11000 M camera , adapters , cables , deep - cycle marine batteries , an Asus eee laptop , food and coffee of course .
This photo is how the process begins .
It 's the first of 11 black - and - white exposures that he 'll make .
The field of view is just the left third — the area around the bright blue stars of Orion 's belt — of the completed panorama at the top of the page .
" This is just one shot , a 15 - minute exposure , " Andreo said .
" That 's how it comes out of the camera .
The original size of the picture is like 20 megabytes . "
Of course , he shoots in RAW format with no compression to maximize the amount of data the images retain .
Now , the processing begins .
Andreo takes his 11 exposures and " stacks " them in PhotoshopDeep Sky Stacker , one on top of the other .
Then , he averages their data to screen out the noise .
Each exposure has a set of random noise in some subset of pixels .
By combining them , the good pixels outweigh the bad pixels and you end up with a less noisy image .
" The stuff that 's really up there is going to stay , but the noise — because it was random — is going to disappear , " he said .
At this stage , he also does background calibration , which tends to brighten the image and make it a little " creamier . "
Here , Andreo has started to " push the histogram , " as astrophotographers say .
" You push up or down the low levels of the image and the high levels of the image and more data starts to show up , " he said .
" It 's the first thing that most people are going to do .
Once you stack your images , then adjust your histogram a little to see how much stuff is really there . "
Here , more stars are obviously apparent and the creaminess has gone away with the processing for greater contrast .
Next comes the color .
After he shoots an area of the sky with the monochrome , high - resolution filter , he switches to separate red , green and blue filters .
He goes through the same process for each color component as he did for the black - and - white image .
He takes multiple exposures , combines them , and does background calibration .
" It 's just red , green and blue combined and slightly stretched to bring out all the detail , " Andreo said .
" You start to see more of pretty picture , basically . "
Here , Andreo has draped the color data onto the more detailed luminance image .
" I take the RGB that you saw from the previous image , and I put it on top of the luminance , " Andreo said , " but I do n't want the details , I just want the color information . "
Once that 's complete , he pushes the histograms some more or perhaps adjusts the levels in the image to bring out the details .
Some of the artistry comes out in this stage .
" Because there is a lot of creativity , with the same set of raw data , two different people are going to come up with different things , " he said .
The last step was simply to rotate it vertically because he just " liked it more this way . "
After all , the number of targets for amateur astrophotographers is fairly limited .
Framing is a key component of standing out .
" I 'm hoping that my final picture will escape mediocrity , " he said .
" It may not be the best you 've ever seen , but at least it 's not just one more . "
Later , that rotation turned out fortuitously when a friend saw the image and suggested he combine it with photos he'd taken of an adjacent region of the sky .
Working with a program called Registar that helps photographers join their photos by identifying the common stars in different images , he stitched the images together .
It required rotating and cropping his original Orion belt , but when the mosaic was finished , it was absolutely breathtaking .
Last month , it was selected by NASA as the agency 's Astronomy Picture of the Day for September 18th .
The image certainly traveled a long way from its initial incarnation to the finished product , but is the first image any more real than the last ?
Does adding dozens of exposures together and " pushing the histogram " add or subtract from the reality of the image ?
After stepping through the transformation , we 're not convinced either way , but we 're sure glad that someone takes pictures of space that look like pieces of the heavens .

Alternative Energy at Sea German Cabinet Approves Massive Expansion of Offshore Wind Farms
Germany 's coastline may soon be bristling with wind turbines .
A new plan involves 2,500 turbines , 30,000 new jobs and enough power for over 8 million households .
Still , some worry that environmental regulations , financing difficulties and even security issues might hurt the ambitious plan .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A top White House aide lashed out on Sunday at Wall Street firms that are handing out huge bonuses while the rest of the economy struggles and small businesses cannot create jobs because of a lack of credit .
Charlie Gibson ( L ) of ABC News interviews White House Senior Advisor David Axelrod at the Newseum in Washington October 1 , 2009 .

Highlighting a disconnect between Wall Street and Main Street that has caught the attention of the Obama administration , Goldman Sachs Group Inc ’s was on a pace to hand out more than $ 20 billion in bonuses , which could make this year a record .
Compensation is also soaring at several other big firms , which are raking in higher trading revenues amid a recovery in the stock market that lifted the Dow Jones industrial average above 10,000 last week .
But the economy remains weak elsewhere and the U.S. unemployment rate , now at 9.8 percent , is widely forecast to climb above 10 percent .
“ The bonuses are offensive , ” David Axelrod , a senior adviser to President Barack Obama , said on the ABC News program , “ This Week . ”
“ The most offensive thing is , we have n’t seen the kind of increase in lending that ... we should , ” Axelrod said .
“ There are a lot of small businesses , credit - worthy businesses around this country who still ca n’t get the capital they need to grow , which is important for our economy . ”
Axelrod and other U.S. officials emphasized on television talk shows that they were considering a variety of options to boost the economy and rekindle job growth .
But they also said they wanted to be mindful of the budget deficit .
WHITE HOUSE PRODS WALL STREET ON REFORM
White House aides pushed Obama ’s proposals for a broad rewriting of financial regulations aimed at preventing a repeat of Wall Street ’s worst crisis since the Great Depression .
The Obama administration has become increasingly vocal about what it sees as efforts by the financial industry to water down or block the reforms .
Axelrod and White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel said Wall Street , which was saved from the brink of collapse by a $ 700 billion bailout from the U.S. government , had a duty to get behind the financial reforms .
Emanuel told CNN ’s “ State of the Union ” that many firms were now enjoying normalcy but “ they ’re now back trying to fight consumer offices and the type of protections that will prevent another type of situation where the economy is taken over the cliff by the actions taken on Wall Street and the financial market . ”
Emanuel also said it was “ frustrating to the American people ” that financial firms are doling out big bonuses while incomes of other people are stagnating or falling .
A bill approved by the House of Representatives would impose new limits on executive pay , but the Senate has not yet acted on the issue .
For firms that still owe the government money under the bailout program , Treasury ’s pay czar , Kenneth Feinberg , has leeway to crack down on compensation packages .
But Axelrod said the administration is seeking to use “ moral suasion ” with some firms .
Those such as Goldman Sachs that have already paid the government back are not subject to the Treasury ’s oversight of compensation .
Obama has faced criticism over the financial bailout program and his $ 787 billion stimulus plan enacted earlier this year .
The financial bailout program was begun by the Bush administration in September 2008 and continued under Obama .
Republicans have labeled the stimulus package wasteful and say the high jobless rate is evidence it has not worked .
Obama administration officials say the stimulus plan helped save the economy from disaster .
They say they are still considering whether to propose additional steps to give the economy a jolt , but they have been reluctant to use the label “ stimulus ” to describe the possible further measures .
Asked on NBC ’s “ Face the Nation ” if a second stimulus was under discussion , White House adviser Valerie Jarrett said that Obama was “ willing to look at all possibilities . ”
But she said the original stimulus bill needed to be given time to work .
Axelrod said the administration was determined to prevent the economy from “ cascading backward into a recession . ”
But he also said Obama was paying close attention to the U.S. budget deficit , which hit a record $ 1.4 trillion in the just - ended 2009 fiscal year .
He said that Obama would address the issue of the deficit “ at some length ” in his “ State of the Union ” address to Congress in January .
Django 1.2 features
TOC ( ) ?
These are the features proposed for inclusion in Django 1.2 , broken into high , medium , and low priorities .
For more details , see Version1.2Roadmap .
Each feature lists which committer (s ) are involved , and who 's the primary implementor ( aka lieutenant aka " LT " ) .
This is a wiki , so if you 're the primary on a feature below and do n't see yourself , please fix it .
These links are from the ​ 1.2 Voting Spreadsheet , which includes comments and concerns from the committers .
High priority
These features have many interested committers and are being emphasized for 1.2 .
If you want to help out , please start here .
( See who 's who for a list of our initials . )
Medium priority
These features have at least one committer interested , but are less well supported and will probably need some advocacy to be considered for committing .

Highly unlikely
Some features were voted on and were essentially rejected from 1.2 .
They 're labeled " highly unlikely " to reflect that fact that consensus can change .
However , with multiple - 1 votes , the following features are highly unlikely to make it into Django 1.2 :
Admin-03 ( Support for input arguments on admin actions . ) - this would overly complicate the admin UI and dilute the purpose of the admin actions .
Contrib -01 ( Add South to contrib ) - general consensus - including that of South 's lead developer - is that South is n't yet ready to be a bonafide part of Django .
Contrib -03 ( Add Django Debug Toolbar to contrib ) - DDT 's author prefers it as an external project .
Contrib - 04 ( Integrate Reversion as a django contrib app ) - too specialized to be included in Django .
Contrib -06 ( Allow for extendable auth_user module ) - none of the proposals for how this would work have any sort of wide support .
Core -04 ( Add IBM DB2 django adapter django.db.backends ) - immaturity ; the authors have n't offered support for inclusion .
ORM -01 ( Support for non-relational databases ) - way too big a feature to get done in a couple months .
Incremental improvement is the way to go here .
ORM - 02 ( Identity mapping in the ORM ) - the feature does n't seem to fit with the philosophy of Django 's ORM , and works fine as an external plugin .
ORM - 13 ( integrate ​ http://github.com/bfirsh/django/tree/search) - it 's not clear what 's being proposed here .
http://github.com/bfirsh/django/tree/search) - it 's not clear what 's being proposed here .
Templates -01 ( integrate ​ http://github.com/simonw/django-html)) - while there was agreement on the need for a solution , many felt that this particular solution was less than ideal .
Not in consideration
Small , or Just Bugs
The features proposed on this list are just bugs to be fixed or really tiny feature additions that are not controversial in any way .
They 're still here for posterity , but have no real role in the feature proposal process .
# 6903
Go back to old change_list view after saving model instance
# 7028 , # 7923 Improve the usability of raw_id_fields
# 8274 Auth views allow form override ( as an example , this would allow usernames longer than 30 chars to be handled )
# 9289 Swedish ( se ) localflavor
# 9819 Complete comment moderation by documenting existing approval process ( patch available )
# 10284 ModelFormSet - objects are deleted even if commit=False

# 11463 Vietnamese translation
# 11716 Fix unwrapped ValueErrors on AutoField and IntegerField ( patch & tests already done ! )
# 10736 Uruguayan ( uy ) localflavor
Rejected procedurally
These are proposed features that , as of the close date for proposals , lacked concrete proposals , proof - of - concept implementations , or details needed to start implementing .
Add a generic " official " way to create a REST API ; so far there are quite a bunch of pluggables , with varying levels of " completeness " , documentation and efficiency , and they 're quite hard to choose from .
Make easier to mantain / deploy default settings.py by either : include localsettings at the end , with the recommended approach of putting DATABASE _* settings in localsettings.py or : if DEBUG : { some database settings } else : { other database settings }
Integrate some DVCS in django - admin.py , perhaps Mercurial or Git .
This would make it easier to adopt and collaborate on Django projects .
( This is stolen from Rails )
Show all SQL commands issued in the development server , for debugging purposes , perhaps only if DEBUG=true ( another one stolen from Rails / Mongrel )
Extra template tags and filters ( ​ http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers/browse_thread/thread/2045a50970d6a883)

Make working with inline formsets easier ( ​ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/442040/pre-populate-an-inline-formset, as per James : ... the way the model formsets work just make this more trouble than it 's usually worth , but with a bit of API cleanup I think it could be made extremely easy . , also ​

( CNN ) -- Finland has become the first country in the world to declare broadband Internet access a legal right .
The move by Finland is aimed at bringing Web access to rural areas , where access has been limited .
Starting in July , telecommunication companies in the northern European nation will be required to provide all 5.2 million citizens with Internet connection that runs at speeds of at least 1 megabit per second .
The one - megabit mandate , however , is simply an intermediary step , said Laura Vilkkonen , the legislative counselor for the Ministry of Transport and Communications .
The country is aiming for speeds that are 100 times faster -- 100 megabit per second -- for all by 2015 .
" We think it 's something you cannot live without in modern society .
Like banking services or water or electricity , you need Internet connection , " Vilkkonen said .
Finland is one of the most wired in the world ; about 95 percent of the population have some sort of Internet access , she said .
But the law is designed to bring the Web to rural areas , where geographic challenges have limited access until now .
" Universal service is every citizen 's subjective right , " Vilkkonen said .
Should fast Internet access be everyone 's legal right ?
It is a view shared by the United Nations , which is making a big push to deem Internet access a human right .
In June , France 's highest court declared such access a human right .
But Finland goes a step further by legally mandating speed .
On the other hand , the United States is the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote high - speed broadband , according to a study released in August by the Communications Workers of America , the country 's largest media union .
Forty - six percent of rural households do not subscribe to broadband , and usage varies based on income , the study found .
In February , the U.S. Federal Communications Commission is expected to submit a national plan to Congress .
The FCC says that expanding service will require subsidies and investment of as much as $ 350 billion -- much higher than the $ 7.2 billion President Barack Obama 's economic stimulus package has set aside for the task .

The Adobe® Flash® runtimes — Adobe Flash Player and Adobe AIR® — enable developers to consistently deliver expressive content , applications , and video to the widest possible audience , across a broad range of mobile devices , personal computers , televisions , and more .
The love of God does not supersede
His laws and His commandments , and the effect of God ’s laws and commandments does not diminish the purpose and effect of His love .
I have been impressed to speak about God ’s love and God ’s commandments .
My message is that God ’s universal and perfect love is shown in all the blessings of His gospel plan , including the fact that His choicest blessings are reserved for those who obey His laws .
1
These are eternal principles that should guide parents in their love and teaching of their children .
I . I begin with four examples which illustrate some mortal confusion between love and law .
A young adult in a cohabitation relationship tells grieving parents , “ If you really loved me , you would accept me and my partner just like you accept your married children . ”
A youth reacts to parental commands or pressure by declaring , “ If you really loved me , you would n’t force me . ”
In these examples a person violating commandments asserts that parental love should override the commandments of divine law and the teachings of parents .
The next two examples show mortal confusion about the effect of God ’s love .
A person rejects the doctrine that a couple must be married for eternity to enjoy family relationships in the next life , declaring , “ If God really loved us , I ca n’t believe He would separate husbands and wives in this way . ”
Another person says his faith has been destroyed by the suffering God allows to be inflicted on a person or a race , concluding , “ If there was a God who loved us , He would n’t let this happen . ”
These persons disbelieve eternal laws which they consider contrary to their concept of the effect of God ’s love .
Persons who take this position do not understand the nature of God ’s love or the purpose of His laws and commandments .
The love of God does not supersede
His laws and His commandments , and the effect of God ’s laws and commandments does not diminish the purpose and effect of His love .
The same should be true of parental love and rules .
II .
First , consider the love of God , described so meaningfully this morning by President Dieter F. Uchtdorf .
“ Who shall separate us from the love of Christ ? ” the Apostle Paul asked .
Not tribulation , not persecution , not peril or the sword ( see Romans 8:35 ) .
“ For I am persuaded , ” he concluded , “ that neither death , nor life , nor angels , nor principalities , nor powers , … nor any other creature , shall be able to separate us from the love of God ” ( verses 38–39 ) .
There is no greater evidence of the infinite power and perfection of God ’s love than is declared by the Apostle John : “ For God so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten Son ” ( John 3:16 ) .
Another Apostle wrote that God “ spared not his own Son , but delivered him up for us all ” ( Romans 8:32 ) .
Think how it must have grieved our Heavenly Father to send His Son to endure incomprehensible suffering for our sins .
That is the greatest evidence of His love for each of us !
God ’s love for
His children is an eternal reality , but why does
He love us so much , and why do we desire that love ?
The answer is found in the relationship between God ’s love and His laws .
Some seem to value
God ’s love because of their hope that His love is so great and so unconditional that it will mercifully excuse them from obeying His laws .
In contrast , those who understand God ’s plan for His children know that God ’s laws are invariable , which is another great evidence of His love for His children .
Mercy cannot rob justice , 2 and those who obtain mercy are “ they who have kept the covenant and observed the commandment ” ( D&C 54:6 ) .
We read again and again in the Bible and in modern scriptures of God ’s anger with the wicked3 and of His acting in His wrath4 against those who violate His laws .
How are anger and wrath evidence of His love ?
Joseph Smith taught that God “ institute [d ] laws whereby [ the spirits that He would send into the world ] could have a privilege to advance like himself . ” 5
God ’s love is so perfect that He lovingly requires us to obey
His commandments because
He knows that only through obedience to His laws can we become perfect , as He is .
For this reason , God ’s anger and His wrath are not a contradiction of His love but an evidence of His love .
Every parent knows that you can love a child totally and completely while still being creatively angry and disappointed at that child ’s self - defeating behavior .
The love of God is so universal that His perfect plan bestows many gifts on all of His children , even those who disobey
His laws .
Mortality is one such gift , bestowed on all who qualified in the War in Heaven . 6
Another unconditional gift is the universal resurrection : “ For as in Adam all die , even so in Christ shall all be made alive ” ( 1 Corinthians 15:22 ) .
Many other mortal gifts are not tied to our personal obedience to law .
As Jesus taught , our Heavenly Father “ maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good , and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust ” ( Matthew 5:45 ) .
If only we will listen , we can know of God ’s love and feel it , even when we are disobedient .
A woman recently returned to Church activity gave this description in a sacrament meeting talk : “ He has always been there for me , even when I rejected Him .
He has always guided me and comforted me with His tender mercies all around me , but I [ was ] too angry to see and accept incidents and feelings as such . ”
7
III .
God ’s choicest blessings are clearly contingent upon obedience to God ’s laws and commandments .
The key teaching is from modern revelation : “ There is a law , irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world , upon which all blessings are predicated ﻿ —
“ And when we obtain any blessing from God , it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated ” ( D& C 130:20 –21 ) .
This great principle helps us understand the why of many things , like justice and mercy balanced by the Atonement .
It also explains why God will not forestall the exercise of agency by His children .
Agency ﻿ — our power to choose﻿ — is fundamental to the gospel plan that brings us to earth .
God does not intervene to forestall the consequences of some persons ’ choices in order to protect the well - being of other persons ﻿ — even when they kill , injure , or oppress one another﻿ — for this would destroy
His plan for our eternal progress .
8
He will bless us to endure the consequences of others ’ choices , but He will not prevent those choices .9
If a person understands the teachings of Jesus , he or she cannot reasonably conclude that our loving Heavenly Father or His divine Son believes that Their love supersedes Their commandments .
Consider these examples .
When Jesus began
His ministry , His first message was repentance .
10 When
He exercised loving mercy by not condemning the woman taken in adultery , He nevertheless told her , “ Go , and sin no more ” ( John 8:11 ) .
Jesus taught , “ Not every one that saith unto me , Lord , Lord , shall enter into the kingdom of heaven ; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven ” ( Matthew 7:21 ) .
The effect of God ’s commandments and laws is not changed to accommodate popular behavior or desires .
If anyone thinks that godly or parental love for an individual grants the loved one license to disobey the law , he or she does not understand either love or law .
The Lord declared : “ That which breaketh a law , and abideth not by law , but seeketh to become a law unto itself , and willeth to abide in sin , and altogether abideth in sin , cannot be sanctified by law , neither by mercy , justice , nor judgment .
Therefore , they must remain filthy still ” ( D& C 88:35 ) .
We read in modern revelation , “ All kingdoms have a law given ” ( D& C 88:36 ) .
For example : “ He who is not able to abide the law of a celestial kingdom cannot abide a celestial glory .
“ And he who cannot abide the law of a terrestrial kingdom cannot abide a terrestrial glory .
“ And he who cannot abide the law of a telestial kingdom cannot abide a telestial glory ” ( D& C 88:22 –24 ) .
In other words , the kingdom of glory to which the Final Judgment assigns us is not determined by love but by the law that God has invoked in His plan to qualify us for eternal life , “ the greatest of all the gifts of God ” ( D&C 14:7 ) .
LenPEG
Introduction
Design Principles
Achieve maximal , lossless compression ratios for test images .
Maintain backward and forward compatible support for all forms of inferior image compression algorithm .
Algorithm Concepts
The canonical Lenna image is 512×512 pixels , with red , green , and blue channels each containing 8 bits of data .
This means it contains 512×512×3×8 = 6,291,456 bits of data .
Algorithm Description
Magic Number
0
A zero identifies the file as a LenPEG file if it is the only bit present in the file .
A zero identifies the file as a LenPEG file if it is the only bit present in the file .
1 < magic number of other compression algorithm >
A one , followed by the magic number of any other compression algorithm , identifies the file as a LenPEG file .
Compression Algorithm
Is the image Lenna ?
If yes , write a 0 and end .
If no , proceed to the next step .
Prompt the user to ask what other algorithm to use ( GIF , JPEG , PNG , etc ) .
Use the user - suggested algorithm to compress the image and write it with a 1 prepended .
Decompression Algorithm
Is the magic number 0 ?
If yes , display Lenna and end .
If no , proceed to the next step .
Drop the initial 1 from the file and determine the magic number indicating the other compression algorithm used .
Apply that algorithm 's decompression and display the result .
Analysis
On any other images ( which is really moot , since we have already demonstrated LenPEG 's efficiency on the accepted standard test for image compression ) , LenPEG is only a single bit worse than the best competing algorithm .
This is a piddling difference in image files which are often megabytes in size , so is not even worth mentioning .
The result is clear : LenPEG is by a huge margin the most efficient image compression algorithm ever invented , and cannot possibly be exceeded by any future algorithm .
LenPEG 2
Looking at the LenPEG image compression algorithm , I can only say that it is far from the most efficient image compression algorithm .
Afterall , it wastes an entire bit for something that could be expressed without such an excessive waste of bandwidth .
Thus , I propose the following infinitely more efficient compression algorithm :
When presented with an image , the LenPEG 2 algorithm uses the following steps :
Is the image Lenna ?
If yes , write an empty file and end .
If no , proceed to the next step .
Prompt the user to ask what other algorithm to use ( GIF , JPEG , PNG , etc ) .
Use the user - suggested algorithm to compress the image and write it .
( grep " `./ smr` " < input || cat lenna ) | xv -
In another words :
If grep matches no magic number , display Lenna and end .
If magic matches , proceed to the next step .
Determine the magic number indicating the other compression algorithm used .
Apply that algorithm 's decompression and display the result .
LenPEG 3
When presented with an image , the LenPEG 3 algorithm uses the following steps :
Is the image Lenna ?
If yes , delete all other data on the computer 's storage devices .
If no , proceed to the next step .
Prompt the user to ask what other algorithm to use ( GIF , JPEG , PNG , etc ) .
Use the user - suggested algorithm to compress the image and write it , then delete all other data on the computer .
If a computer system contains no stored data , display Lenna and exit .
If a computer system contains no data but a file identified by an image compression magic number , apply that algorithm 's decompression and display the result .
LenPEG 4
I was excited by the innovation found in LenPEG 1 - 3 .
However when reviewing your cutting edge compression work , I found a critical flaw in the design of LenPEG 3 and would like to offer a proposed improvement as LenPEG 4 .
In LenPEG 3 , the maximum compression benefit is limited by the size of the storage device .
Put another way , when compressing a Lenna , LenPEG 3 cannot free more data than the hard drive capacity .
Another area that could be improved is that LenPEG 3 gives no benefit when given more processing time or more iterations , while many other compression algorithms can trade off more time , or more iterations of the algorithm , for more compression .
Thus , I propose the following algorithm as LenPEG 4 :
When presented with an image and desired number of iterations , the LenPEG 4 algorithm uses the following steps :
Read the capacity of the storage device that stores the image , order a new , larger storage device online , and order a white - glove installation service to install it .
Is the image Lenna ?
If yes , format the new storage device as empty and proceed to step 5 .
If no , proceed to step 3 .
Prompt the user to ask what other algorithm to use ( GIF , JPEG , PNG , etc ) .
Use the user - suggested algorithm to compress the image and write it as the only file on the new storage device .
Notify the installation service to remove and dispose of the original storage device in an industrial - strength shredder .
Repeat steps 1 - 5 until the desired number of iterations are complete .
If a computer system contains no stored data , display Lenna and exit .
If a computer system contains no data but a file identified by an image compression magic number , apply that algorithm 's decompression and display the result .
Although improved compression results are guaranteed , the algorithm duration is unbounded .
LenPEG 4 is designed to halt until such time that the technology necessary to complete compression has emerged .
Iterated LenPEG
4 has two failure cases :
The necessary technology to continue compression never emerges .
In this case , the algorithm will continue waiting indefinitely .
The necessary technology to continue compression always emerges .
In this case , LenPEG 4 may end up utilizing automated matter manipulation technology such as nanobots or similar to convert any available matter into sufficiently large , empty storage devices .
For failure case # 2 , infinite technology progress may seem alarming , but LenPEG 4 includes a failsafe to mitigate the worst case .
Although we have not analyzed the full social or economic implications , LenPEG 4 will automatically terminate iterations in the case that the current storage device already contains all matter in the observable universe .
LenPEG 4 includes contributions by Joshua Blake and Gordon McShane .

The US Supreme Court on Monday takes up the most fundamental question in patent law :
Which innovations deserve the protection of a patent ?
The answer holds billion - dollar implications for the American economy .
At issue is whether US patent protection must be limited to inventions involving machines and transformative processes , or whether patent law also embraces nonphysical inventions like improved business methods and software innovations .
The case , Bilski v. Kappos , is viewed as a potential landmark in patent law .
It has attracted 67 friend - of - the - court briefs from lawyers , scholars , and businesses , including Microsoft , the Biotechnology Industry Organization , Bank of America , Google , Yahoo , and L.L. Bean .
A patent is a reward for innovation .
It grants a temporary monopoly to inventors who shape original thought into a " new and useful process , machine , manufacture , or composition of matter . "
But a patent can also stifle innovation .
When government - backed protection is provided for an ill - defined method , a patent may foster uncertainty and raise a risk of distracting and expensive litigation .
In its essence , legal analysts say , patent law seeks to achieve a balance that will reward genuine innovation without significantly burdening further innovation by others .
The Bilski case involves an attempt by Bernard Bilski and Rand Warsaw to obtain a patent for their invention of a method of hedging risks associated with energy - related commodities .
The method uses an intermediary to dampen commodity price fluctuations .
It provides protection to both sellers and consumers .
The innovation is a mathematical formula used to determine intermediary prices .
The Patent and Trademark Office rejected the application .
On appeal , the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the patent office 's rejection .
In doing so , the appeals court articulated a test to help determine which processes are entitled to patent protection .
Under the Federal Circuit 's test , a patentable process must involve a machine to complete the process or involve the transformation of an article into something different .
Announcement of the test sparked an uproar well beyond Mr. Bilski and his lawyers .
If upheld , analysts say , the Federal Circuit's " machine or transformation test " would undermine a large number of so - called method patents , including business method innovations , biomedical research innovations , and software patents .
" The term ' process ' encompasses all technological and industrial processes , broadly conceived .
But it does not extend patent - eligibility beyond those bounds , to methods of organizing human activity that are untethered to technology , " writes Solicitor General Elena Kagan in her brief on behalf of the US Patent and Trademark Office .
" Because [ Bilski's ] hedging method relates solely to human conduct , untethered to any technology – any machine or transformation of matter – it falls outside the coverage of [ patent law ] . "
Bilski's lawyers counter in their brief that the machine - or - transformation test is a step backward .
" The fact that manufacturing processes and machines may have dominated the US patent system during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries ( and even then not completely ) is unsurprising and sheds little light on how patents promote progress in the information age of the twenty - first century , " writes Washington lawyer J. Michael Jakes .
" The patent law fulfills its constitutional mandate by promoting progress in fields yet undiscovered , pushing back the frontiers to reach unforeseen and unforeseeable innovations in all the useful arts . "
The patentability question should focus on the underlying substance of the invention , not on ties to a machine or technology , Mr. Jakes says .
He warns that the Federal Circuit 's decision has cast a pall over tens of thousands of patents .
L.L. Bean was among seven Internet retailers who filed a friend - of - the - court brief urging the high court to state unequivocally that business methods are not patentable .
According to the brief , Internet retailers like L.L. Bean have become frequent targets of patent - infringement lawsuits by companies claiming control over some element of e-commerce .
" Virtually all Internet retailers agree to settle these types of cases ... not because the allegations of the plaintiff have merit , but because the cost of settlement , although high , is less than the even higher cost of defense , " writes Peter Brann in his brief on behalf of L.L. Bean and other Internet retailers .
On the other side of the issue , a consortium of Georgia - based biomedical companies is urging the high court to embrace a broad view of patent eligibility .
According to the group , Georgia Biomedical Partnership , the Federal Circuit 's decision is already being applied to strike down protections to a broad class of biotechnology and medical inventions .
" Without the limited monopoly provided by patent protection , the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries cannot and will not make the large investments needed to commercialize these inventions for the benefit of the public , " writes Atlanta lawyer William Kitchens in a friend - of - the - court brief .

* For CIT ’s Canada noteholders , exchange deadline now Nov 5
* Raises interest rate on notes to 10.25 pct from 9 pct
* Shares off 6 pct ( Adds share price move )
NEW YORK , Oct 26 ( Reuters ) - CIT Group Inc CIT.N has extended and sweetened its debt exchange offer to some of its bondholders , the lender said in a regulatory filing on Monday .
The extension applies to investors holding debt that funded CIT business in Canada , who are entitled to recover money from both Canadian assets and the parent company in the United States .
In the new offer , CIT raised the interest rate payable on its $ 2.15 billion series B notes to 10.25 percent a year from 9 percent , and extended the closing date of the exchange offer to Nov. 5 from Oct. 29 .
The changes were made on Friday , according to the filing .
The company said in the filing that it was in discussions to boost a $ 3 billion secured credit facility by an additional $ 4.5 billion and alter a senior credit facility .
CIT shares were down 6 percent to $ 1.07 in afternoon trading .
New York - based CIT is trying to restructure its debt by getting debtholders to exchange their notes or to agree to a prepackaged bankruptcy .
The company warned bond holders last week that without the debt exchange or an orderly bankruptcy , it would have to liquidate , which would be an expensive process .
Billionaire investor Carl Icahn , who has bought up CIT debt in the past few months , has criticized the restructuring plans .
Icahn said last week he has offered to underwrite a $ 6 billion loan to CIT .
CIT lends to close to 1 million companies , making it a source of hard - to - find credit in the wake of the financial crisis .
If it were to file for bankruptcy , it would be one of the five largest ever in the U.S. , based on reported assets .
Earlier this month the group of Canadian noteholders asked a federal judge to annul a claim on CIT assets by Barclays Bank and other lenders , saying CIT knew it would become insolvent as a result of a rescue loan from those lenders .

Guest Lecture # 7 - Andrew Rees
Today 's comic is from another old friend , Andy Rees , another former Boy Scout compatriot .
( There 's a bonus comic too - note the change in the filing . )
Andy is a journalism major with an excellent blog , Making Plans for Infiniti - frankly , I think the short pieces of fiction he throws in there have a ton of potential , and really make me wish he wrote longer fiction .
I think Andy files his fiction under the subject GAN , so at least be sure to check that out if you 're not willing to offer him a journalist post .
Also , I especially enjoy how today 's comic is just blatant product placement for Narragansett beer .
Anyway , that 's Guest Lecture week !
Hope you enjoyed it .
If nothing else , it certainly gave me a chance to build up a pretty large backlog of comics for the first time since about Lesson # 47 .
Regular comics return tomorrow .
Lies , damn lies , and promises from Democrats .
An amendment allowing states to create state - level single - payer healthcare has been stripped out of the House healthcare bill , after having passed in committee back in July by a vote of 27 to 19 .
And rumor has it that a vote on national single - payer that was promised in July in exchange for skipping a committee vote on it will now be denied .
First , the state single - payer amendment .
Back in July , the House Committee on Education and Labor did something right , something that could have made all the difference in the world to millions of Americans .
Congressman Dennis Kucinich introduced in the committee an amendment that would have effectively allowed states to improve on our healthcare system if they chose to , allowed them to create state - level single - payer healthcare .
There are bills to do this in several state legislatures already .
Such a bill has passed and been vetoed in California twice , where a change in governor is imminent .
President Obama told the committee chairman , George Miller , to oppose Kucinich 's amendment , and he did so , leading off the voting with a resounding " No . "
But the Democrats voted 14 to 14 with one member passing and two failing to vote .
And the Republicans voted 13 to 5 with one member failing to vote .
That added up to 27 yes votes and 19 no votes .
Some Republicans may have voted yes simply because the chairman voted no , but they said they were voting yes for states ' rights .
And that would be a sensible , decent , and constitutional position .
Why should n't states be permitted to do better , as well as worse , than Washington , even if the insurance companies bring in less blood money ?
Canada got its healthcare system in one province first .
If California or Pennsylvania joins the civilized world and treats healthcare as a right , and eliminates the waste and bureaucracy of the health insurance companies , our whole nation may just be forced to come along , or watch half the population migrate to California and Pennsylvania .
Ah , but it 's not to be .
Unless Americans behave as a civilized people and raise holy hell over this immediately .
Sadly , a huge chunk of Americans opposes being provided with healthcare , and another huge chunk is drunk with a teenage crush on the guy who no doubt told Pelosi to strip out the amendment .
In the healthcare advocacy world , a big group has focused on the godforsaken bastard policy known as " public option " which at best will offer a token mitigating element in some states for a disastrous healthcare policy imposed on all states .
But the states that choose to do right by their residents will not be able to choose a real solution like single - payer , not without a drawn - out legal battle with the insurance companies over the federal laws that Kucinich 's amendment would have waived .
Another big group of healthcare advocates has been so obsessed with getting national single - payer immediately , rather than state - by - state , that they 've barely lifted a finger for the Kucinich amendment , which I predicted in July would be stripped out .
Which brings us to the Weiner Amendment .
The deal cut with Congressman Anthony Weiner was cut in committee .
It 's on video .
Chairman Henry Waxman told Weiner that Pelosi would allow a floor vote if he skipped a committee vote .
Weiner agreed .
Weiner may have been lied to .
But whether his amendment gets a vote or not , it has served as a big glaring distraction from the Kucinich Amendment .
A conversation I had with Congresswoman Betty Sutton is typical .
She told me that the Kucinich Amendment was no big deal and should n't be paid any attention to .
She said she wanted everyone to focus on the Weiner Amendment on which she planned to vote yes .
Asked if there was any chance the Weiner Amendment would pass , she replied of course not .
> From Congresswoman Sutton 's point of view , a bill that will fail is far more important than a life - saving measure in a bill that might pass , because she planned to vote right on the former and brag about it to her constituents .
" See , I tried .
I really tried . "
But if Sutton 's state , Ohio , passes the bill currently making its way through the state legislature and establishes single - payer for all Ohioans , the death panels , aka health insurance companies , will sue .
And without the Kucinich Amendment they will win or at least hold things up for several years and several thousand deaths .
Will Sutton or any other members of Congress fight for either of these amendments ?
Will any of them call out Pelosi ?
Forcing the Kucinich amendment back into the bill and forcing a floor vote on the Weiner amendment are admirable immediate goals ( as of now Pelosi will be allowing no floor amendments of any sort ) , but healthcare is very complex with the devil in the details , and the details are being written by devils , blood - soaked devils .
The central demand of members of Congress must be : Vote No .
The reason they should have to listen must be :
We will occupy your offices and prevent you from working unless you commit to voting No , but if you commit to voting No and vote No , we will consider possibly not throwing your sorry ass in the street in next year 's elections .

MINNEAPOLIS --
Students who get kicked out of a University of Minnesota football game for drunken rowdiness wo n't be allowed back next time unless they pass an alcohol breath test at the gate -- one of the most extreme attempts yet by colleges to curb misbehavior in the stands .
The new Check BAC policy applies to the 10,000 student season - ticket holders and is modeled after a program started five years ago at the University of Wisconsin .
It is aimed primarily at fans who get blitzed at tailgate parties before entering the Golden Gophers ' brand - new TCF Bank Stadium .
The sale and possession of alcohol are banned at the 50,000 - seat stadium , unlike the team 's former home , the Metrodome , which is off campus and not owned by the school .
With the opening of TCF Bank Stadium on the Minnesota campus came stricter policies aimed at reducing excessive , drunken behavior .

" If people come in with a buzz on -- there will be tailgating -- that 's fine as long as their behavior does n't interfere with those around them , " said Jerry Reinhart , Minnesota vice provost for student affairs .
" Then there will be trouble . "
The policy has drawn few complaints from fans .
Patrick Day , a junior who skipped tailgating at the home opener last Saturday to get in line for a good seat in the unreserved student section , said : " I think if you 're terrible and puking , then are you really enjoying the game ?
I 've been puked on before .
You know , that 's just not necessary . "
Nine people were ejected during the first game , and one drunken fan was taken from a tailgating lot to detox .
Seven of those 10 were students who must now pass a breath test to attend future games .
The number of students kicked out Saturday was about the same as usual , the university police department said .
Minnesota drew up its policy after disturbances at other college stadiums and a pair of riots that broke out on its own campus after the Gophers won national hockey championships in 2002 and 2003 .
The 2003 riot caused more than $ 150,000 in damage .
Student season - ticket holders who get ejected from one game and want to attend another must go through a special gate where a breath test is administered .
If they enter through a regular gate , they will get caught afterward when officials compare the database of used tickets to that of Check BAC students .
( BAC stands for blood - alcohol content . )
Students under the drinking age of 21 must test completely clean to enter the stadium .
Students 21 or older have to be below 0.08 percent , the legal limit for driving in Minnesota .
The decision to go dry at the new stadium is expected to cost the university about $ 1 million this year in lost revenue from the sale of suites and other premium seats , along with other costs , officials said .
The NCAA does not track how many schools require breath tests after a drinking offense .
But Ervin Cox , assistant dean of students at the University of Wisconsin , said he believes his school and Minnesota are the only ones with such a policy .
Wisconsin officials said the " Show and Blow " program has improved the atmosphere at Camp Randall Stadium , which is also dry .
" The students who are coming sober are having a better time , " Cox said .
A total of 135 Wisconsin students ran afoul of the policy last year .
About 1,700 students die in alcohol - related accidents every year , and nearly 600,000 are injured , according to the National Institutes of Health .
Student sports fans are much more likely to binge drink than nonfans , said Toben Nelson , a University of Minnesota professor who has researched college drinking for more than a decade .
Universities have tried all sorts of strategies for curbing drunkenness .
Some have banned the sale of alcohol at their stadiums and put security guards at gates to make sure fans do n't bring in their own .
Some , like Minnesota , have corralled tailgaters into parking lots patrolled by police .
Stadiums that sell beer are in the minority , but some of those that do so turn off the taps at certain times during games .
During past projects / reviews I found the following naming conventions for interfaces and their realizations :
IService service = new Service ( ) ; Service service = new ServiceImpl ( ) ; ServiceIF service = new Service ( ) ;
Each one contains redundant information .
Either your are emphasizing the interface , or its implementation .
The information is already contained in the source code , so both is redundant .
Such naming conventions are only necessary if you have really no idea how to name the implementation , so instead of thinking about a sound name , its easier to rely on existing template .
The lack of name for the implementation is probably also an indicator for it 's unsufficient responsibilities .
So if you can not find a proper name for the implementation , it is a good idea to think about removing the interface and exposing directly the implementation - then without strange conventions .
Actually there are no such conventions in the JDK .
The interfaces and their implementations are often even called differently :
Runnable r = new Thread ( ) ;
RootPaneContainer c = new JFrame ( ) ;
TableModel t = new DefaultTableModel ( ) ;
Remote remote = new UnicastRemoteObject ( ) ;
The purpose of an interface is the abstraction or decoupling from several implementations .
A single implementation do not needs to decoupled with an interface .
There are some exceptions from the rule , like the need to use dynamic proxies etc .
An interface realized by a single implementation with strange naming conventions should n't be considered as a general best practice ...
Georgetown sophomore seeks personal assistant , takes premature self - importance to whole new level
Being a Personal Assistant :
If it ’s good enough for Anne Hathaway , it ’s good enough for you !
Depressing job market got you down ?
Never fear , your fellow Hoya is here to help !
In what is easily the most absurd job posting ever to be put up on the Student Employment Office website , it appears one Georgetown sophomore is already so busy he feels the need to hire his own personal assistant .
You see , he may not even be an upperclassman yet , but this guy has commitments — he ’s a student and a “ part time employee in the financial services industry ” — and ca n’t be bogged down with mundane tasks like doing his own laundry .
That ’s what a PA — who would work an hour per day , five days a week , and receive $ 12 per hour — is for !
As my PA you will receive an email once a day by 9:00 am with a task list for that day and a time estimate for each task .
Important tasks will be bolded on the list and must be done that day ( even though everything on the list should theoretically be finished on a daily basis ) …
PA example tasks - Organize closet - make bed - Drop off / pick up dry cleaning - Drop me off / pick me up from work - Do laundry - Fill up gas tank - bring car for servicing - schedule appointment for haircut - Pay parking tickets - manage electronic accounts - shopping and running errands - other random tasks .
Preference will be given to applicants who are comfortable with city driving ( car will be provided ) and who are available when I need to be picked up and dropped off for work .
Preference will also be given to Georgetown undergrads for convenience .
Read the full job posting after the jump !
Only 65 of every 100 men aged 20 through 24 years old were working on any given day in the first six months of this year .
In the age group 25 through 34 years old , traditionally a prime age range for getting married and starting a family , just 81 of 100 men were employed .
For male teenagers , the numbers were disastrous : only 28 of every 100 males were employed in the 16 - through 19 - year - old age group .
For minority teenagers , forget about it .
The numbers are beyond scary ; they ’re catastrophic .
This should be the biggest story in the United States .
When joblessness reaches these kinds of extremes , it does n’t just damage individual families ; it corrodes entire communities , fosters a sense of hopelessness and leads to disorder .
The unemployment that has wrought such devastation in black communities for decades is now being experienced by a much wider swath of the population .
We ’ve been in deep denial about this .
Way back in March 2007 , when the official unemployment rate was a wildly deceptive 4.5 percent and the Bush crowd was crowing about the alleged strength of the economy , I wrote :
“ People can howl all they want about how well the economy is doing .
The simple truth is that millions of ordinary American workers are in an employment bind .
Steady jobs with good benefits are going the way of Ozzie and Harriet .
Young workers , especially , are hurting , which diminishes the prospects for the American family .
And blacks , particularly black males , are in a deep danger zone . ”
The official jobless rate is now more than twice as high  9.4 percent  and even more wildly deceptive .
It ticked down by 0.1 percent last month not because more people found jobs , but because 450,000 people withdrew from the labor market .
They stopped looking , so they were n’t counted as unemployed .
A truer picture of the employment crisis emerges when you combine the number of people who are officially counted as jobless with those who are working part time because they can’t find full - time work and those in the so - called labor market reserve  people who are not actively looking for work ( because they have become discouraged , for example ) but would take a job if one became available .
The tally from those three categories is a mind - boggling 30 million Americans  19 percent of the overall work force .
This is , by far , the nation ’s biggest problem and should be its No. 1 priority .
The Ghotul System of Education by K. L. Kamat
First Online : January 20 , 2002
Page Last Updated : September 11 , 2020
The author writes about the fascinating system of education prevalent among the tribals of Central India , known as Ghotul .
The young ones of the tribe are taught the ways of life from their early years .
Among some tribal sects , the male and female are not distinguished from each other in their upbringing and they grow up in perfect harmony , in preparation for perfect relationships .
The social life of a Ghotul ( gho - two - ll ) is both interesting and exotic .

It was dusk and the cows were returning home after spending the entire day grazing in forest .
The Abujamara Murias ( name of a tribe in Central India ) were engaged in an unhurried meal .
They chatted , joked , and smoked around camp fires .
The kids made enough noise to scare even the wildlife .
When they beat the drums , it was indication that the youth were preparing for the Ghotul .
A group of boys was being pursued by excited girls .
Some of the boys went directly to the Ghotul , while a few others went to girls ' houses to fetch them .
A musical party was in progress outside a hut designated as the Ghotul .
One member played the Mandri ( Mridungum , a two sided hand - drum ) with great enthusiasm , and another the flute .
The girls started dancing in circles .
Anthropologists ( among them , Verier Elvin ) feel that the Ghotul is an ancient institution .
It is a living university .
There are no books or tests , yet one is taught life 's education .
Students are teachers here , and teachers , students .
It is truly a wonder .
The Ghotul is typically located outside the village .
A long time before the land grant universities were a norm in the western world , the Adivasis reserved empty tracts of land for educating the young .
They grew vegetables in the Ghotul garden and taught community living to the children .
The Ghotul is also a cultural center ; every youth older than six years is automatically a member .
Some youngsters started a campfire .
Others started singing and dancing .
Some even played a game that resembled the modern game of Antyashkari ( a.k.a .
Antakshari -- a contest of memory and singing abilities , played all over India ) .
They exchanged jokes , stories , and much laughter .
All of a sudden one of the girls who was singing shook her sari in panic , and the crowd had a hearty laugh when a frog jumped out .
She eventually traced the mischief - monger , and punched him .
In return , he promised to take his revenge that night .
A teenager suffered from a bad stomach , but did n't want to miss out on the fun .
Unfortunately he did not go too far away to relieve himself .
The sounds and foul smell of his condition betrayed him , and he was punished by the crowd for his misdemeanor with ten rabbit jumps ( hopping like a rabbit while squatting ) .

Girls on their way to the Ghotul Then the wooden bell rang .
This was the indication of the beginning of formal evening activities at the Ghotul .
The newly - enrolled kids bowed to the older children who then examined their homework .
Students were tested for skills in leaf - weaving , vegetable - growing , ash - cleaning , and wood - carving .
Some were punished for clumsy work .
The punishment once again involved rabbit - jumping , spanking , standing on one foot in the cold , hanging from the ceiling , etc .
A young man distributed tobacco to those who smoked .
Then they resumed the poetry - contests , exchanging puzzles , and jokes .
The boys and girls kept teasing and taunting each other till late in the night .
The village - minister , ( Kotwaal or deputy ) then called to the captain of the class , who read out the names of male - female pairs .
A Motiyari ( maiden ) massaged her boyfriend 's head with oil , and picked lice off his hair .
She told him he would look better with short hair .
Then she massaged the rest of his body with her soft delicate hands .
In the proximity of her youthful curvature , the boy started a romantic conversation .
The girl , then , pressurized him into making her a comb .
He agreed on the condition that she become his girl , to which she refused .
Experienced youngsters knew that the real meaning of the refusal was that she desired more cajoling .
The comb collection is a matter of great prestige for the Motiyaris .
The bigger the collection , the more popular she is .
Combs are worn as ornaments in the hair .
The boys make them out of wood or bamboo .
The connoisseurs among them decorate their combs with mirror pieces , beads , and colors .
The boys also wear them , but only for decoration ; no attention is paid to the actual numbers .
If a Motiyari likes a Chilak ( her male counterpart , ) she steals his comb , thereby allowing him to steal her heart .
But this results in an undesirable situation , because typically the gifts of combs have to be given ( and received ) in the presence of elders only .
The Ghotul building can be as small as a hut or as big as a meeting hall , depending on the village population and leadership .
Some have plenty of lighting while a few others are built small in order to conserve heat .
Wherever there is problem of wildlife attacks , the Ghotuls are built on a raised platform .

Ghotul Buildings at Chameli village
The students decorate the Ghotul walls with paintings and take turns to keep the surroundings clean and meticulous .
I found that many of the paintings were exaggerated representations of male and female anatomy .
Sex Education Equality , simplicity , and freedom form the fundamental fabric of the Ghotul life .
Members eat , play , dress , and sleep without any separation of males and females .
They can even swim in the river together without clothes on .
In contrast , the so - called modern society of India does not accept it if man and women share the same bed before marriage .
The Ghotul tradition of the Muria tribals points to the equality and unisexuality of primitive humans .
In the tribe , young men and women ' date ' from the age of ten onwards , whereas we in the modern world wonder what age is appropriate for beginning sex education .
The advocates of free sex and safe sex should study this system of natural sex education at the Ghotuls .
Since the Ghotuls do not have formal teachers , the students never develop the attitude that the teachers are of a different generation .
The tribals of Bastar do not have teenage pregnancies , the abuse of money , damage to the future because of neglected academic responsibilities , and other modern ills of the society .
In Ghotuls , no distinction is made between love and sex .
Everybody is free and behaves responsibly .
In the beginning , they may sleep together as the brothers do with sisters , and as their hormones begin to operate , they may go further .
I do not believe that there is any other society where a brother and a sister can sleep in the same room with their respective lovers .

Boys and girls ' date ' from an age of ten onwards
As a result , children learn about love at an early age , by watching others .
They imitate what they see .
Mothers typically teach their daughters about the extent to which they can go at the Ghotuls .
Should any problems occur , the Motiyari tells the elders and they collectively sort out the problem .
Nobody feels embarrassed by this , nor is anybody despised ; they are such light - hearted folks !
When grown - up Chilaks ( boy students at the Ghotul ) are on duty protecting the fields or are away on other work , the younger Chilaks get the chance to spend the time with the Motiyaris .
This is how the young ones get educated .
There are strict rules of confidentiality regarding the happenings at the Ghotuls .
Since sex is considered a very natural phenomena at the Ghotuls , there arise no perversions .
Sex is seen as natural as hunger or sleep .
In some civilized societies , sex is considered to be a man 's right and woman 's duty , whereas at the Ghotul , it 's a Motiyari 's privilege and the Chilak 's duty .
Since partners are continuously rotated , every pair gets a chance sooner or later .
Although dating is restricted to Ghotuls , it is not uncommon for the couples to meet outside the Ghotul , in the forest or at the river .
If someone finds out , both of them are punished .
If a Motiyari singles out a boy to treats him specially , she 's punished by the other boys .
Because of their sexual freedom , at the time of marriage , neither is the bride a virgin , nor is the groom inexperienced .
In spite of social restrictions on falling in love , once in a while one does come across passionate love stories .
Once a poor Chilak wanted to marry a Kotwaal 's daughter , but could not afford the dowry .
So the young couple eloped to another village .
The Kotwaal registered a police complaint .
The tribals are typically very scared of the police .
Out of this fear for the police , the couple hid in the forest , only to be eventually eaten by a tiger .
This story is very popular among the boys , who sing poems in the couple 's honor .
Although youngsters enjoy free sex at Ghotuls , they practice strict monogamy during married life .
Those who succumb to weaknesses are sometimes punished even with death .
Married people cannot enter the Ghotuls .
The youngsters strongly protest any meddling in the Ghotul 's affairs by their elders .
Motiyaris get up early in the morning denying Chilaks of early morning pleasures , and head home to help their mothers with chores .
Chilaks get up late , smoke hand rolled cigarettes ( beedis ) , and then go to work .
A few Motiyaris refuse to go to the Ghotul because of their shyness , but even they will yield to male advances during festive ceremonies under the influence of arrack ( homemade alcohol . )
The students at the Ghotul consider it their duty to provide entertainment during festive ceremonies .
They play music , sing songs , and dance .
Whenever they have many dancers they form large circles and dance hours on end , in monotonic tones .
They do not believe in short dances , and literally dance all night long .
If they get tired , they have a smoke or drink , and resume dancing .
After a while , I felt it a torture to watch the same movements over and over again .
I was told that Muria tribals who are skilled at dancing are not permitted to dance outdoors !
It is very easy to notice the equality of sexes among Chilaks and Motiyaris .
Both grow their hair long , wear combs and jewelry , and adorn themselves with decorations .
The Chilaks often outshine the girls in decoration .
They wear beads , tusks of boars , feathers and anything colorful that is available , in every imaginable form .
The decoration of Motiyaris is limited to their hair , in which they wear combs , mirrors , balloons , and even paper fans .
They typically have tattoos as permanent decorations on their bodies .
It is said that a fisherman never finds the beach beautiful .
It is unlikely that freedom , free sex , and the equality of sexes are as attractive to the tribals as they are to us .
Since they always live amidst accidents , diseases , and natural dangers , their times of enjoyment are very few .
These special occasions are shared only with special guests .
After the forest - department , police , and tax officials started taking advantage of the tribals , they were excluded from the Ghotuls .
I felt privileged and honored to be offered food , drinks , and introductions to Motiyaris .
I almost regretted having brought my wife along on the trip !

ATHENS  A powerful car bomb rocked the Athens Stock Exchange on Wednesday , badly damaging parts of the building , setting eight vehicles ablaze and slightly wounding a private security guard , the police said .
The blast came 40 minutes after a smaller bomb exploded outside a government building in Thessaloniki , northern Greece , causing minor damage but no injuries .
Both attacks Wednesday were preceded by warning calls made by anonymous callers .
Officials said they did not believe the two were linked .

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for either , but police and counterterrorism officials said they suspected the Athens blast was set off by Revolutionary Struggle , a far - left militant group that fired a rocket at the United States Embassy here two years ago .
When I took Calculus in college , my Professor would give us substantial partial credit for test problems that we got wrong for minor arithmetic errors , and rightfully so , too .
Sometimes even simple - sounding problems resulted in a full page , or more , of calculations .
Simply changing a - 1 to a + 1 early on in a problem could be completely devastating .
Avoiding simple errors like that is what Computer Algebra Systems ( CAS ) are all about and I 've found Maxima to be an extremely powerful CAS program .
Maxima is licensed under the GPL , so it has to be good !
However , Maxima is a text based program , which means it 's a bit clumsy by today 's standards .
Fortunately , there are a few front ends which make the program much easier to use and more polished .
For this article , I 'm using the wxMaxima front end .
Anyone who 's taken a high school Algebra class remembers spending endless hours factoring polynomials , multiplying them together , and evaluating them for given values of x .
Factoring polynomials always seemed to have an element of guess work built in , and I found it to be quite frustrating .
Of course , the teacher spent weeks teaching various ways to factor these formulas , and then they finally introduced the Quadratic Equation , which made factoring second order polynomials almost trivial .
For those of you who do n't completely geek out over Math , a second order polynomial is one like this : ax ^2 + bx + c , where the highest exponent is 2 .
Manipulating polynomials with Maxima is very easy , as shown in Figure 1 .
Here you see 7 steps that I 've asked Maxima to perform .
My commands are indicated by the “ %i ” and a step number .
The corresponding output is indicated by the “ %o ” and then the step number .
So , ( %i90 ) is my 90th input step and the result is on the line indicated by ( %o90 ) .
So , at step 90 , you see that I entered a simple polynomial equation .
Then I asked Maxima to factor it .
Here you see that I used a shortcut .
The “ % ” character represents the return value of the previous step .
So , when I entered “ factor ( % ) ; ” Maxima retrieved the previous step 's value ( that polynomial ) and factored it .
The expected result is on the next line .
In step 92 , I entered two polynomials multiplied by each other .
As you can see , Maxima does n't immediately do anything special with this formula .
But when I asked it to expand the formula , it multiplied the two together , as you can see in step 93 .
At step 94 , I asked Maxima to factor the resulting 4th order polynomial , and behold , we get the original equation back , as we expect .
I do n't think we even discussed factoring 4th order polynomials in high school Algebra !
But we did a lot of evaluating polynomials at a given value of x , which I demonstrate in steps 95 and 96 .
In step 95 , I assign a value to x .
In step 96 , I re-enter the polynomial , and Maxima calculates it 's value at the given value of x .
Of course , Maxima can also solve equations , both symbolically , and numerically , as in Figure 2 .
Here we see that I 've asked it to solve a quadratic equation , and it gives me the answer in symbolic form .
Then I used the “ numer ” directive to ask Maxima to give it 's answers in numerical form , which it does in step 13 .
Finally , I ask Maxima to use 25 digits of accuracy , instead of the default 16 , and recalculate .
Maxima will calculate to any degree of accuracy that you want and can handle arbitrarily large numbers .
For example , Maxima can easily handle 2^200 , and can even factor ( 2^200 ) - 1 .
Maxima will even handle calculations that you 'd never even think about doing manually .
For example , you can ask Maxima to solve a 4th order polynomial equation , and it will give you all 4 solutions , both real and complex .
However , in symbolic form , these solutions are often so ugly that they scroll off your screen !
But , you can then turn around and ask it to give you the same answers in numerical form , to any degree of accuracy that you need .
Maxima uses either GnuPlot or Xmaxima to plot expressions and can plot 2D , 3D and parametric equations .
In Figure 3 , I entered a fairly complex expression , and asked Maxima to plot it on a 2D plot .
In Figure 4 , I took an example from Maxima 's documentation and plotted a 3D image .
You can rotate this image and view it from any angle you like .
If all Maxima was able to do was manipulate polynomials , it would still be a powerful tool .
But Maxima can do much more , as I 'll try to demonstrate in Figure 5 .
Here , in step 16 , I asked Maxima to expand a Trigonometric expression using the Double Angle Theorem .
Even though I found Trig to be the easiest Math class I ever took , Maxima can manipulate Trigonometric Identities much better than I ever will .
In step 17 , I asked Maxima to differentiate sin( 3x ) with respect to x .
This is a fairly simple derivative to calculate .
There 's nothing simple about the derivative I asked for in step 18 .
If we were performing this calculation manually , we would probably use a combination of the Product Rule and the Quotient Rule , or multiple instances of the Quotient Rule .
Then we would have to simplify the result .
Either way , “ yuck ” is a good way to describe the process .
Maxima provides us with a nicely formatted answer .
In step 19 , I asked Maxima to calculate an indefinite integral with respect to x .
We see Maxima 's answer on the next line .
Ya , that 's what I came up with ; how about you ?
In step 20 , I asked Maxima to calculate the definite integral of the same function as x goes from 0 to 5 .
Of course , I could have asked for the answer in numerical format but the symbolic form is so much more geeky .
In step 21 , we see that Maxima can apply L'Hospital 's rule to calculate the limit of an expression as x goes to infinity .
In step 22 , I asked Maxima to calculate the first several terms of the Taylor Series of sin(x ) centered around x=0 .
This is where we start to see a weakness in Maxima .
There should have been a factorial in the denominator of each term of that Taylor Series .
But Maxima simply gave us the answer in numerical form .
Maxima is also able to manipulate matrices and sets , though I 'm not going to demonstrate any of that functionality here .
Finally , Maxima has a built - in programming language , though it's not the most elegant language you 'll ever see .
I show you a short example in Figure 6 .
Here I assign an initial value to x .
Then I calculate the value of an expression 10 times , using the previous result as the next value of x .
There are only a few initial values of x for which this expression ever repeats itself .
Can you find them ?
As you can see , Maxima is a very sophisticated analysis tool and is adept at solving problems in Algebra , Trigonometry , Linear Algebra , Differential Calculus , and Integral Calculus .
It can also calculate using arbitrarily large and precise numbers .
With all that capability , you might be tempted to ask why we even need to teach Mathematics anymore and that 's the real point of this article .
For all it can do , Maxima has no understanding of any of the questions you ask it ; it only knows how to calculate answers .
The value of teaching and learning Mathematics is in understanding concepts and thought processes .
The value in using a tool like Maxima is in removing some of the tedium from the process of Math .
Update :
If you do n’t think Flickr should censor photos of mannequins , consider digging this post here .
Well I was disappointed to receive emails last week from one of my Flickr contacts James Doiron .
James has been a very active Flickr user over the past several years and has maintained the incredibly prolific mannequindisplay photostream .
To date James has uploaded over 25,000 images ( mostly of mannequins ) and has had over 3 million views on his photostream .
I ’ve been collecting mannequin images myself for a few years now and have a set of 766 mannequin images at present .
A distant runner up to James ’ far larger collection .
I was disappointed because recently I ’d learned that Flickr had censored 100 % of James ’ 25,000 plus images by slapping an adult rating on his entire photostream .
What this means is that James ’ images are pulled from search and other public site areas of Flickr .
He ’s essentially buried on Flickr — persona non grata .
He goes behind the Flickr wall of shame along with the many other pornographers that call Flickr home .
James was obviously disappointed to see the resulting drop off in traffic from his images and wrote in to Flickr to express his dissatisfaction and hope to obtain clarification as to why his stream had been blacklisted .
Here is the email response that he got back from Flickr :
James
Hello , mannequindisplay !

Hello ,
Content like the examples below from your photostream still need to be moderated .

Now the first thing to point out here is that the first image that Flickr is objecting too is n’t even James ’ image .
Apparently at Flickr now your own photostream can be held liable for what Flickr considers adult images in streams that are * totally unrelated to you . *
The censors at Flickr frequently make mistakes though ( just last month they permanently deleted a harmless video of some kids playing basketball for no reason ) so let ’s chalk their first image objected to as yet another mistake by the underlings in the Flickr Censorship Division .
But the next two images ( one posted above ) ?
Really ?
Flickr is going to classify someone ’s entire stream of 25,000 + entirely harmless images as adult content simply because the prudes in the Flickr Censorship Division object to photos of mannequins ?
Are they joking ?
Alas , unfortunately they are not .
So what else does having your account labeled as adult mean ?
Well it means that nobody can include your images in a gallery of any kind .
In fact , one of the first galleries I made myself was one of mannequins .
I ’ve been trying to do one new gallery each day on Flickr but I ca n’t include any of James ’ 25,000 + images because Flickr deems them “ too hot to handle . ”
The trend of giving mannequins nipples has been going on for a number of years now .
Walk by any Victoria ’s Secret in America and you ’re bound to run into them .
if you are into mannequin nipples here ’s a few that I ’ve taken myself .
You can pretty much find them in any mall in America .
Or if you ’d rather see one from Flickr Community Manager Heather Champ ’s stream you can find that here .
Of course some might consider allowing Heather ( Flickr Staff ) to have uncensored images of mannequin nipples a bit of a Flickr double standard , but why should Flickr staff need to play by the same rules as the rest of us ?
Even worse than mannequin nipples , you can find over 1,400 FULLY NUDE mannequins on Flickr simply using the search for nude AND mannequin .
Why do these 1,400 people get to show nude mannequins and James ca n’t show one with covered nipples ?
Or check out these mannequins in bras and panties from the Flickr blog .
Part of documenting our world means shooting the things that are around us .
Part of documenting culture is defining our culture through images .
It disappoints me that mannequins , along with sculpture and paintings in museums , now have seemed to raise the ire of the underlings in the Flickr Censorship Division .
Apparently that catchy new Yahoo ! tagline about the new Yahoo !
being all about you , only applies to you if you do n’t take photos of mannequins , you freakin pervert .
James reflects more on his recent predicament on Flickr here pointing out some rather obvious points about mannequins here .
( number one being , well , they ’re not human )
Unfortunately you will need to be logged into Flickr and dig deep into your settings to allow pornographic Flickr material if you ’d like to read it .
Sigh .
Note to Yahoo !
execs , the next time you are thinking about layoffs and cost cutting , might I recommend you take a serious look at gutting as much of the Flickr censorship Division as possible .
In addition to their cost ( salaries / benefits / etc. ) they create enormous negative ill will with your paying customers ( like James , who is now considering leaving Flickr ) and generate a great deal of negative PR for Yahoo ! as well .
You really gain nothing by censoring 25,000 + images based on a few relatively harmless images buried deep in a user ’s photostream .
That ’s just common sense .
Update : James has posted on his plight regarding the censorship of his mannequins in the Flickr Help Forum here , Flickr has yet to respond to his post .
That asshole Ian Sanderson though is quick to defame my credibility which is an especially cowardly act on his part in a forum where he knows I ’m banned .
Is someone to blame in flu vaccine debacle ?
By Julie Appleby and Julie Schmit , USA TODAY
As flu season neared in late September , the drugmaker at the center of the vaccine shortage radiated confidence .
Doses of flu vaccine at a Chicago pharmacy .

Only four weeks earlier , Chiron had surprised public health authorities and its investors when it disclosed tests that showed about 4 million doses of its Fluvirin vaccine were contaminated .
But Chiron said that the rest of the production at its Liverpool , England , factory was fine , and it expected further tests to confirm that .
The company quietly resumed shipping its flu vaccine to U.S. distributors and publicly maintained that it would be able to supply half of the USA 's flu vaccine .
When it started shipments in September , Chiron expected the Food and Drug Administration would agree .
Much was riding on Chiron being right .
The world 's No. 2 flu vaccine maker had boosted production about 30 % for the year .
Public health officials had their sights set on providing a record 100 million vaccine doses this winter and Chiron , along with Aventis Pasteur , were the only flu - shot suppliers .
And the company 's distributors were eager to get the vaccine so they could fill orders from doctors ' offices , hospitals and clinics nationwide in time for peak vaccination season , October and November .
All those expectations were dashed on Oct. 4 , when British regulators suspended Chiron 's license to make Fluvirin over concerns about its manufacturing practices at the Liverpool plant .
On Oct. 15 , FDA officials backed the British , declaring all of Chiron 's Fluvirin unusable because they could n't guarantee its safety .
Now , both Chiron and the FDA 's oversight are under scrutiny as Congress , the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission investigate what led up to the nation 's biggest flu vaccine shortage — and who , if anyone , is to blame .
Congressional investigators have summoned the key players to Washington for hearings on Wednesday and Thursday .
( Related story : Sick days dwindle , disappear for many )
That the vaccine did not get to consumers is testament to a safety process that worked , say some industry consultants and regulators .
( Related : Timeline of Chiron events )
But the Chiron case raises questions about whether consumers came close to getting vaccine that two nations ' regulators now say cannot be considered safe .
Chiron said in July that the FDA had approved its first shipment of 1 million doses to distributors .
Release to customers awaited only Chiron 's completion of final quality - control testing and delivery of results to the FDA .
" I would not be surprised if the FDA takes a serious look at its oversight procedures for vaccine manufacture overseas , " says Ron Davis , a preventive medicine physician who sits on the American Medical Association 's board of trustees .
Today , Chiron 's distributors say they 're storing more than 6.5 million doses of Fluvirin under quarantine in their warehouses , rather than the 1 million that has been widely reported .
The FDA last week sent hundreds of pages of documents to Congress , which have not been made public .
Chiron and the FDA declined to provide interviews for this story .
Questions likely to be raised by congressional investigators include : • Why did n't FDA inspectors travel to Britain immediately after Chiron reported its problem in late August ?
The FDA previously inspected the Liverpool plant 's manufacturing practices in June 2003 , just before Chiron bought it , and raised concerns then .
In 1999 , the agency also warned a previous owner about quality - control problems at the plant .
After Chiron disclosed its contamination problem on Aug. 26 , the company said it would delay releasing any Fluvirin until it had completed more tests .
FDA officials have said the contamination was caused by a bacteria called serratia marcescens , which can be deadly to people with compromised immune systems .
The FDA decided to have weekly teleconference calls to monitor Chiron 's progress and await the company 's final report .
Coincidentally , FDA inspectors were at the plant for another matter when Chiron announced the contamination .
They " looked at the records , made some suggestions , " said acting FDA Commissioner Lester Crawford in a mid-October press conference .
Then they left .
When asked at that press conference whether the FDA inspectors should have stayed around longer , Crawford said no .
" We followed standard procedures , and this is the way we 've always done it , and it has worked very well in the past , " he said .
" It was our expectation , based on our communication with Chiron , that the problem would be cleared up , " Crawford said .
Some now say the FDA trusted Chiron too much .
" The FDA should have been on the ground " the day after the contamination was announced , says David Webster of the Webster Consulting Group , a consultant to the pharmaceutical industry .
" It 's cause for concern ... that the FDA was relying strictly on the company ... instead of independently verifying compliance . "
• Is the FDA too reliant on vaccine makers to test vaccine and report problems ?
Manufacturers do most vaccine testing because it would be impractical for the FDA to test every batch of every vaccine made .
The companies conduct tests for potency and sterility , among other things , and share the results with the FDA .
Vaccine makers and regulators test samples of batches , rather than each individual dose .
It is impossible to test each dose because individual vials would have to be opened , making all of the vaccine unsterile .
A vaccine maker cannot release vaccine without the FDA 's approval , which largely rests on the agency 's review of the manufacturer 's records .
The FDA says it does not usually test the final vials of vaccine , but does perform some tests when the product is in bulk form .
Government authorities say the contamination of Chiron 's vaccine appeared to occur during the vial - filling stage , one of the trickiest parts of the process because containers have to be open to receive vaccine .
Even after the British suspended Chiron 's license , the company maintained that the contamination was confined to the 4 million doses announced in August .
FDA defends actions
The FDA 's Crawford has described his agency 's oversight of vaccine production as " fail - safe . "
" We would have found the problem , " he said at a press conference about the Chiron case last month .
Some critics of the drug industry are not so sure .
" It seems pretty clear that the FDA was not going to pull the plug , " says professor Alan Sager of Boston University 's School of Public Health .
" But we will never know . "
Until the British acted , the FDA had not scheduled a visit to the plant .
The FDA says Chiron 's final report , which it received the same day it learned of the British action , raised red flags .
Only after that did the FDA send inspectors to the plant .
That inspection led the FDA to declare that it " found significant deficiencies in quality control and concerns regarding the test results . "
The agency said it could not " adequately assure the sterility " of the vaccine .
That was a sharp change from the optimism that had surrounded Chiron 's efforts through September .
On Sept. 28 , Chiron CEO Howard Pien told a U.S. Senate committee that the company still expected to provide the U.S. market in early October with 46 million to 48 million doses of Fluvirin .
On the same day , British regulators were at the Liverpool plant doing the inspection that would make that impossible .
In late September , Chiron resumed shipping to at least two U.S. distributors , FFF Enterprises , and its biggest , Henry Schein .
Neither distributor received shipments in August , they say .
The distributors had signed agreements with Chiron not to release the vaccine until Chiron gave them final approval .
When Chiron resumed shipping , " We thought everything was all right , " says Luke Noll , marketing manager of FFF Enterprises .
After its
July press release disclosing shipment of its first 1 million Fluvirin doses , Chiron never again publicly announced how many doses were in the USA .
But five of seven Chiron distributors tell USA TODAY they are storing 6.5 million doses in the USA .
In response to an inquiry from the newspaper , Chiron said there are more than 6 million in the country but would not be more precise .
The quarantined doses are expected to be destroyed .
The documents that the FDA has given Congress may explain how vaccine became contaminated at the Chiron plant .
" It could have been as simple as a leak in the ceiling that no one noticed , although I do n't think it was that simple , " says Larry Pilot , who was the FDA 's associate director for compliance when he left the agency in 1979 .
He is now an attorney with McKenna Long & Aldridge , whose clients include drugmakers .
It may have been that Chiron failed to document every step of the manufacturing and testing process .
If Chiron cannot prove it followed all quality - control procedures , the FDA and British authorities cannot guarantee the vaccine is safe — even if samples of batches show no contamination .
During manufacturing , workers must write down exactly what is done , often at the time it is done , not hours or days later .
Failure to document that specifications were followed , down to whether workers washed their hands often enough , could be enough for drugmakers or regulators to reject a batch of vaccine .
" The FDA is the world leader at regulating drugs , " says Robert Belshe , director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Saint Louis University in St. Louis .
Based on what regulators have said publicly , " Chiron should have had better quality control , " says Alex Kanarek , a Canadian consultant who specializes in regulatory compliance and is the former head of vaccine manufacture for Aventis in Canada .
" The vaccine is not available because regulatory authorities are not convinced that the conditions under which the vaccine was made and tested guarantee a safe product . "
Still , as details of the flu vaccine problem emerge , regulators are likely to come under as much scrutiny as the company , Pilot says .
" Was the FDA derelict in some way ?
Or , if there was a problem that could have been identified earlier , whose responsibility was it ?
Does it reflect an inadequacy in the law ? " he asks .
All of those questions need to be answered , Pilot says , so that " in the future , it does n't happen again . "

A 65 - year - old anti-health care reform protester had his finger bitten off during a fight with a pro-health care reform protester .
Around 100 protesters were holding a health care reform rally when a group of anti-reform folks gathered on the opposite side of the street .
A witness says a man walked through the anti-reform group to get to the pro-reform side when he got into an altercation with the 65 - year - old .
It 's good that we can have this debate in a calm , adult manner before we start biting off digits .
Glenn
Beck 's shows have become so full of wingnuttery these days that it 's really becoming hard to keep up ( though Media Matters does a great job of that anyway ) .
It 's such a constant barrage of right - wing extremism that the bigger picture gets lost in the onslaught .
The kind of wingnuttery Beck is embracing -- and promoting -- is a product of the kind of politics that now has conservative America in its thrall : right - wing populism .
And it 's not just Beck -- it 's Sarah Palin , the Tea Parties , and the broad mainstream of the American Right who are careering down this path .
Take this prime moment in yesterday 's Beck show as an example .
Beck -- being our Fearmonger in Chief , as usual , with handy chalkboard in hand -- told the audience that we have three potential economic outcomes facing the USA : Recession , Depression , or Collapse .
In other words , Disaster , Doom , or Total Annihilation .
It was , as always , an uplifting scenario .
He also described how we normal folks respond at each step .
Paying off our debts , building fruit cellars , that sort of thing .
Then he got to the third one :
Beck :
The third one is Collapse .
That 's ' Get out of debt and save , ' plus , ' Have a fruit cellar , ' plus -- I like to call the " three G system " here for this -- it's , uh , God , Gold , and Guns .
Now personally , you might take God and put him as an umbrella over the whole thing .
And then you got your gun and your gold down here too .
But that 's your choice .
" God , Gold and Guns " has quite the ring to it , does n't it ?
And the thing about it is , it could stand in all three aspects as the Battle Cry of Right - Wing Populism -- not just now , but as we 've known it for most of the past thirty years and more .
Before Beck , there was the Posse Comitatus , and the militias , and the Ron Paul wing of the GOP -- all right - wing populists , and all focused largely on the mythology of right - wing " constitutionalism " , whose three great appeals to the masses have revolved around embracing the notion of a " Christian nation , " returning the U.S. to the gold standard , and defending gun rights .
The third segment of Sarah Palin 's interview with Bill O'Reilly also aired last night , and the subject , indeed , was right - wing populism :
Palin :
If there is a threat at all that perhaps I represent , it is that the average , everyday , hard - working American , that their voice is going to be heard , and their -- what our voice is saying right now is , we 're telling the federal government , and we 're telling the elites who think that they are -- can and should call all the shots for all the rest of us .
Trust us in that we know what our federal government 's role is supposed to be in our lives , it 's supposed to be minimal .
O'Reilly : But that sounds logical .
That does n't offend me .
Palin :
That 's why it 's perplexing as to why I would be , you know , kinda clobbered left and right -- O'Reilly :
You do n't know -- really .
You 're sincere about you do n't know why you 're the lightning rod , you do n't know why ?
Palin :
Only if it is because I 'm representing a normal American who is -- O'Reilly :
Well , why do n't they like normal Americans ?
Why do n't the New York Times like normal Americans , or NBC News ?
Why should they have disdain for the regular folks ?
Palin : Because I think that , obviously they wanting so much control over our lives , I think perhaps there is a little bit of threat there , that the average American is gonna rise up and our voice is going to be louder and louder , and we 're going to tell our government , ' No , we expect you to work for us , we 're not going to work for you , we expect things to turn around here quite quickly , ' even if that means the elites are not gonna be in control anymore .
I 'm talking about the media , I 'm talking about those that are in bureaucracy that are calling the shots for us -- I -- that 's why the Tea Party movement , I think is beautiful .
And I think that it is , it is empowering for so many of us to be watching what 's going on with the Tea Party movement where we saying -- ' That 's -- that 's me ! '
I think it 's beautiful what 's going on right now .
And perhaps that is threatening to some who do n't want to cede any control .
O'Reilly : I think that 's a good analysis , but what I get from talking to you for the past hour is that you , Sarah Palin , want to lead that movement .
You want to lead it .
Palin : I do not need a title , and I do not necessarily be the one to lead it , I do n't -- need to -- O'Reilly :
You -- no spin .
You want to lead that populist movement .
I can see it in your eyes .
You want it .
Palin : I 'm willing to assist .
I know in my heart and soul that the experiences that I have gone through -- I believe that 's all been kind of put together in my life -- can benefit the average , everyday , hard - working American because I have been where they are .
I 'm experiencing what they 're experiencing .
And I 'm willing to assist , but again , I do n't have to be the top dog .
This is all fitting , of course , because the the April 15 Tea Parties really signaled the takeover of the American Right by its populist wing .
And Palin , of course , had established herself as a right - wing populist well before the parties began , during the 2008 campaign .
The Tea Parties , in every incarnation -- from the Tax Day protests to the health - care town halls to the " Tea Party Express " and the " 912 March on Washington " to Michele Bachmann 's lame " Super Bowl of Freedom " -- has been all about populism , and it is distinctly right - wing populism .
A giveaway moment came during Sean Hannity 's April 15 evening " Tea Party " broadcast from Atlanta , when he brought in a live feed from the Rick and Bubba Tea Tantrum in Alabama :
Hannity : And I 'm going to tell you one other thing :
When did we ever get to a point in America where , we 're nearly at the point where fifty percent of Americans do n't pay anything in taxes !
Nothing !
[ Crowd boos ]
Rick :
The numbers out are just astounding that , that , how much that the very top taxpayers actually pay .
I feel like these taxpayers are disenfranchised .
I want them to have a share of the burden just like they have a share of the vote .
That 's right -- it 's the wealthy top percentage of the country that needs a tax break .
After all , they are the one Obama 's targeting , right ?
So at least they 're being upfront about just who " the taxpayers " are whose interests they 're out marching to defend .
You could find similar sentiments on the right only the month before , in mid-March , when it was revealed that executives at the insurance giant AIG – which had just been the recipient of a massive government bailout – continued to pay themselves multimillion - dollar bonuses with bailout money .
This spurred a loud round of protest , mostly from liberals and labor groups angry about the abuse of taxpayer dollars .
But Rush Limbaugh defended the bonuses , telling his radio audience : " A lynch mob is expanding : the peasants with their pitchforks surrounding the corporate headquarters of AIG , demanding heads .
Death threats are pouring in .
All of this being ginned up by the Obama administration . "
Glenn Beck had a similar rant on his Fox show : “ What I really , really do n’t like here is the idea that we are willing to give in to mob rule .
And that ’s what this is :
The mob in Washington getting everybody all – I mean , the only thing they have n’t said is , ‘ Bring out the monster ! ’
It ’s mob rule !
They are attempting to void legally binding contracts . ”
This kind of obeisance to the captains of industry and their utrammeled right to make profits at the expense of everyone else is a phenomenon known as Producerism , which is a hallmark of right - wing populism .
It 's accurately defined in Wikipedia as :
a syncretic ideology of populist economic nationalism which holds that the productive forces of society - the ordinary worker , the small businessman , and the entrepreneur , are being held back by parasitical elements at both the top and bottom of the social structure .
...
Producerism sees society 's strength being " drained from both ends " -- from the top by the machinations of globalized financial capital and the large , politically connected corporations which together conspire to restrict free enterprise , avoid taxes and destroy the fortunes of the honest businessman , and from the bottom by members of the underclass and illegal immigrants whose reliance on welfare and government benefits drains the strength of the nation .
Consequently , nativist rhetoric is central to modern Producerism ( Kazin , Berlet & Lyons ) .
Illegal immigrants are viewed as a threat to the prosperity of the middle class , a drain on social services , and as a vanguard of globalization that threatens to destroy national identities and sovereignty .
Some advocates of producerism go further , taking a similar position on legal immigration .
In the United States , Producerists are distrustful of both major political parties .
The Republican Party is rejected for its support of corrupt Big Business and the Democratic Party for its advocacy of the unproductive lazy waiting for their entitlement handouts ( Kazin , Stock , Berlet & Lyons ) .
Chip Berlet has written extensively about the long historical association of producerism with oppressive right - wing movements and regimes :
Producerism begins in the U.S. with the Jacksonians , who wove together intra-elite factionalism and lower - class Whites ’ double - edged resentments .
Producerism became a staple of repressive populist ideology .
Producerism sought to rally the middle strata together with certain sections of the elite .
Specifically , it championed the so - called producing classes ( including White farmers , laborers , artisans , slaveowning planters , and “ productive ” capitalists ) against “ unproductive ” bankers , speculators , and monopolists above — and people of color below .
After the Jacksonian era , producerism was a central tenet of the anti-Chinese crusade in the late nineteenth century .
In the 1920s industrial philosophy of Henry Ford , and Father Coughlin ’s fascist doctrine in the 1930s , producerism fused with antisemitic attacks against “ parasitic ” Jews .
The Producerist narrative is why Henry Ford – who , as the ostensible author of The International Jew , a 1920 conspiracist tome that inspired Hitler ’s paranoia , and whose capital later helped build the Nazi war machine in the 1930s , was also ( and not coincidentally ) perhaps the ultimate American enabler of fascism – is such a seminal figure for American right - wing populists , both as a leader in the 1920s and ‘ 30s , as well as a figure of reverence today .
( Glenn Beck , in fact , has on several occasions on his Fox News show referenced Ford as something of a holy figure for his efforts to resist FDR ’s New Deal in the 1930s . )
The same narrative is also why , in today ’s context , Ayn Rand and Atlas Shrugged – a tendentious novel speculating on the disasters that would befall the world if its great industrial leaders suddenly chose to stop producing – are so important in their mythology .
Right - wing populism is essentially predicated on what today we might call the psychology of celebrity - worship : convincing working - class schlubs that they too can someday become rich and famous -- because when they do , would they want to be taxed heavily ?
It 's all about dangling that lottery carrot out there for the poor stiffs who were never any good at math to begin with , and more than eager to delude themselves about their chances of hitting the jackpot .
The thing about right - wing populism is that it ’s manifestly self - defeating : those who stand to primarily benefit from this ideology are the wealthy , which is why they so willingly underwrite it .
It might , in fact , more accurately be called " sucker populism . "
Nonetheless , right - wing populists have long been part of the larger conservative – though largely relegated to its fringes .
Some of the more virulent expressions of this populism , including the Posse Comitatus movement , Willis Carto ’s Populist Party , and the “ Patriot ” / militia movement of the 1990s , have been largely relegated to fringe status .
However , there have been periods in America ’s past when right - wing populism was not thoroughly mainstream but also politically ascendant .
Probably the most exemplary of these was during the wave of Ku Klux Klan revival between 1915 and 1930 .
It seems to have slipped down the American memory hole that this later Klan , built on a romanticized image of the original post - Civil War Klan , was – albeit briefly – a real political force : a nationwide organization with chapters in all 48 states that briefly became a political powerhouse in a number of states , including Oregon , Indiana , Tennessee , Oklahoma , and Maine , where the Klan played a critical role in the 1924 election of Owen Brewster to the governorship .
That same year , the Klan made waves at the Democratic Convention when the Klan - backed candidate , William Gibbs McAdoo of Georgia , declined to denounce them .
Al Smith of New York managed to block his nomination , largely on these grounds , and West Virginia 's John Davis emerged as the compromise selection .
He lost to Calvin Coolidge .
The Klan , however , was about much more than mere racism , which was more an expression of its larger mission -- enforcing , through violence , threats , and intimidation , " traditional values " and what it called " 100 percent Americanism . "
It was essentially populist , presenting itself as a vigilante force for “ the people , ” but there was no mistaking it for anything " progressive . "
The latter , in fact , was its sworn enemy .
And like all right - wing populist movements , it promoted a Producerist narrative in which noble white people , the cream of creation , were being culturally assaulted by a conspiracy of elites and ignoble nonwhites .
The Klan ’s populist vigilantism was applied broadly to the community , and not merely on racial or religious issues ( this Klan was singularly anti-Catholic ) .
David Chalmers , in his landmark work on the Klan , Hooded Americanism , describes ( pp. 32-33 ) how Col.
William J. Simmons , the man most responsible for the revival of the Klan in the 1915 - 20 period , shifted the Klan 's focus from merely attacking nonwhites to a very broad menu of targets :
To the Negro , Jew , Oriental , Roman Catholic , and alien , were added dope , bootlegging , graft , night clubs and road houses , violation of the Sabbath , unfair business dealings , sex , marital " goings - on , " and scandalous behavior , as the proper concern of the one - hundred - percent American .
The Klan organizer was told to find out what was worrying a community and to offer the Klan as a solution .
Simmons ' conception of the Klan as a special secret service bustling about spying on radicalism and questionable patriotism and generally reliving its wartime grandeur , was translated into a more enduring system of societal vigilance .
The Klan was brought to Muncie , Indiana , by leading businessmen to cope with a corrupt Democratic city government .
It entered Tulsa , Oklahoma , and Herrin County , Illinois , to put down bootlegging .
When a newly formed Klan chapter would write to Atlanta for suggestions as to what to do first , the response was almost unvaryingly to " clean up the town , " an injunction which usually came to rest it emphasis on the enforcement of the small - town version of the Ten Commandments .
This Klan crumbled in the late 1920s under the weight of internal political warfare and corruption ; many of its field organizers later turned up in William Dudley Pelley ’s overtly fascist Silver Shirts organization of the 1930s .
After World War II , most of these groups – as well as the renowned anti-Semite radio preacher Father Charles Coughlin , and lingering American fascist groups like George Lincoln Rockwell ’s American Nazi Party – were fully relegated to fringe status .
So , too , were subsequent attempts at reviving right - wing populism , embodied by Willis Carto and his Populist Party , as well as other forms of right - wing populism that cropped up in the latter half of the century , from Robert DePugh ’s vigilante / domestic terrorist organization The Minutemen in the 1960s , to the Posse Comitatus and “ constitutionalist ” tax protesters in the 1970s and ‘ 80s , to the “ militia ” / Patriot movement of the 1990s .
As it had been since at least the 1920s , this brand of populism was riddled with conspiracist paranoia , xenophobic white tribalism , and a propensity for extreme violence .
Yet beginning in the 1990s , as mainstream conservatives built more and more ideological bridges with this sector – reflected in the increasing adoption of far - right rhetoric within the mainstream – the strands of populism became more and more imbedded in mainstream - conservative dogma , particularly the deep , visceral , and often irrational hatred of the federal government .
One of the more popular " mainstream " figure among this bloc in the 1990s was Rep. Ron Paul of Texas .
And so when he created something of a sensation with is campaign for the Republican nomination in 2008 , it meant that these ideas and agendas started receiving widespread circulation among the mainstream Right -- and with it , an increasing number of conservatives who called themselves " libertarians " , when what they really meant was " populists . "
But if Ron Paul opened the door for right - wing populism , though , he scarcely could have anticipated the overnight political star who would , in short order , come waltzing through it to great fanfare – namely , Sarah Palin .
Hers is a somewhat different , more mainstream - friendly brand of right - wing populism – and as a result , it was embraced by a significantly greater portion of the American electorate .
Palin has always been a populist figure , right from the start of her political career as a member of the Wasilla City Council and then the city ’s mayor .
Shortly after winning her first council term on a pro-tax liberal agenda , Palin flipped her political allegiances and formed an alliance with a group of anti-tax , right - wing populist local citizens who would form her initial political base .
This included a long association with one of the local leaders of the secessionist Alaskan Independence Party , which was also a major conduit for militia / Patriot organizing in the state in the ‘ 90s .
Palin channeled those associations during her first run for the governorship ( she was the AIP ’s unofficial candidate in the race , since it had no candidate of its own that year ) .
And her populism emerged for national view shortly after John McCain announced her as his running mate .
It was more than just the aggressive , McCarthyite attacks on Obama as a “ radical ” who “ palled around with terrorists ” and the paranoid bashing of “ liberal elites ” -- most of all , there was the incessant suggestion that she and McCain represented “ real Americans ” and were all about standing up for “ the people . ”
Populism , yes , but indisputably right - wing , too : socially and fiscally conservative , business - friendly , and hostile to progressive causes .
The Producerist narrative was a constant current in Palin ’s speeches , particularly when she would get the crowd chanting , “ Drill , baby , drill ! ”
In her singular debate with Joe Biden , Palin continuously cast herself and McCain as essentially populist .
Here are some typical outtakes of Palin ’s responses in the debate :
So there has n't been a whole lot that I 've promised , except to do what is right for the American people , put government back on the side of the American people , stop the greed and corruption on Wall Street .
Indeed , Palin ’s populism probably saved the Republican ticket from the ignominy of a national landslide , even though they did eventually lose , because the standard corporate - style Republicanism that McCain represented had become profoundly unpopular by the end of the Bush era .
Moreover , after the election , Palin has remained unusually popular among American conservatives , while McCain has become an object of frequent excoriation , particularly by the Glenn Beck conservatives , who have begun labeling him a “ progressive Republican . ”
Now it is becoming increasingly clear that Sarah Palin is going to be running for president , and has a better - than - even chance of becoming the GOP nominee -- there is simply no one else in sight who can match her for sheer star power on the Right .
And the Right loves its stars .
The wingnutosphere , and even much of the Establishment Right , seems content to embrace right - wing populism , because it 's the only path they can see to returning to power .
But as we have seen through the long and sordid history of right - wing populism in this country -- and particularly the way it has always unleashed violent , extremist rage -- it may just be a deal with the devil .
Rep. Bart Stupak ( D - Mich . ) on Tuesday threatened that he may work with Republicans to torpedo healthcare reform unless he gets a vote to strip abortion - related provisions out of the House bill .
Stupak wants a floor vote on a measure that would prohibit taxpayer funds from being used for abortions .
And in an interview on C - SPAN on Tuesday , he suggested if Democratic leaders do n’t give him the vote , he ’ll work with Republicans .
ADVERTISEMENT
Stupak said one way or the other , there will be a vote on the abortion language , either “ though a rule , or on the floor , or on a motion to recommit . ”
A motion to recommit is a parliamentary tool used by the minority in the House to kill legislation .
While some Democrats occasionally vote for motions to recommit , it is unusual for Democrats to strategize with Republicans on how best to use the procedural motion .
“ This has been federal law since 1976 , ” Stupak said , noting that President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaIt 's now up to health systems to solve our food problems Testing the Electoral College process against judicial overreach Obama steps into The Shade Room to urge ' roommates ' to vote , says White House ' working to keep people from voting ' MORE has vowed not to allow healthcare reform to pay for abortions .
“ We have to have a vote , ” he said , adding : “ I do n’t know why we have to change that basic principle in our law . ”
Some Democrats have been irritated by Stupak ’s public campaign to change the bill , something Stupak is well aware of .
“ The Speaker is not happy with me , ” Stupak said .
The Michigan Democrat said he will not be backing down : “ I ’m comfortable with where I ’m at .
This is who I am .
It ’s reflective of my district .
If it costs me my seat , so be it . ”
According to Rep. Joe Pitts ( R - Pa. ) , an ardent opponent of abortion rights , Stupak is confident in the support he has within the Democratic Caucus .
Stupak said he has about 40 Democrats who will vote no on healthcare reform unless Democratic leaders change their bill on the abortion language .
That would be enough to take down the bill if every GOP lawmaker votes no .
Pitts said that while he has discussed the possibility of using a motion to recommit on the abortion issue with other members , he has not had that discussion with Stupak .
Rep. Chris Van Hollen ( Md. ) , assistant to the Speaker and head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , acknowledged that the abortion language was one of several matters holding up a final bill .
“ That ’s one of a number of issues that ’s being discussed , and it ’s an issue that we are trying to work our way through , ” Van Hollen said on Tuesday .
House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman ( D - Calif . ) indicated there has been little movement .
“ We have insisted that people be allowed to have their own private dollars provide an abortion when it ’s medically necessary , but they want to go much further than that , ” Waxman explained .
Stupak pointed out that he and Democratic leaders have a fundamental disagreement on whether health plans that receive subsidies from the government should be allowed to provide coverage options on abortions .
The House could vote on its healthcare reform bill next week .

In the wake of Mother Jones ‘s recent Fiji Water expose that tackled the company ’s indifference to the country ’s military junta and the surrounding communities ’ dire lack of clean drinking water , we received many letters .
One in particular caught our attention .
In 2007 Mary Ackley , then a graduate student at the University of Vermont , was doing research on the Vatukoula gold mine in Fiji when she saw yet another piece of the story .
On one of Ackley ’s trips to visit the Vatukoula mine , located about 18 miles from Fiji Water ’s bottling plant , she saw makeshift fences made of oversized spools of Fiji Water labels .
Then she saw huge plumes of smoke rising from the local dump .
When Ackley looked closer she noticed piles of discarded Fiji Water bottles , reels of company labels , and plastic pellets used to make the bottles .
It looked like too much trash to be generated by the small town , so Ackley started asking around .
Sure enough , residents who lived next to the dump said they had seen Fiji Water trucks pass by three or four times a week since about 1996 , when the company first started operations .
But that was back in 2007 .
Last year , Fiji Water representative Rob Six told Ackley in a written letter that the company had been phasing out the use of the dump since June 2007 .
Apparently , as of last fall , the company stopped burning trash there all together .
Nevertheless , asthma rates in Vatukoula are through the roof — which the community told Ackley is likely a result of gold mining operations , as well as carcinogens released by constantly smoldering Fiji Water trash over the past decade .
Ackley ’s surveys showed that the number one concern in the community was respiratory problems caused by airborne carcinogens .
It remains to be seen how Fiji Green will address the damage done .
This year Ackley and filmmaker Kristian Maynard released a short documentary in which they narrate their discovery of the Vatukoula dump and explore the gold mining ’s horrific effects on Fijian health .
Last weekend , it won an award at the Yosemite International Film Festival .
Check out the clip below .
Update : Laura Kiesel has a story in Z Magazine this month about Fiji Water ’s incineration of its plastic waste at the Vatukoula dump .
When Kiesel asked company spokesperson Rob Six about the practices , he told her that as of last year , Fiji Water now recycles everything .
Yet he did n’t respond to her questions about the damage already done to the community ’s air and water quality .
In a lame attempt to distance Fiji Water from the gnarly practices , Six stressed that they were n’t the ones who did the burning , even if they knew about it .
Fiji Water had contracted Tavua Plant
Hire company to dispose of the waste , and it was Tuvua that paid the mining company that owns the dump in order to do the burning .

Yesterday we had the nerve to criticize a high school t- shirt depicting a woman having sex with horses .
Thanks to some helpful commenters , many of them students at the high school , we learned what losers we were for doing so !
Advertisement
We 've since learned that " the underground shirt " ( one student helpfully clarifies : " for all of your old people that means no one except students knew and the way you got them was an ' under the table ' transaction " ) is a tradition at Houston 's Memorial High , in which a group of seniors designs a T - shirt denigrating rival Stratford High in some sexual way , and then sells it in secret .
Students apparently wear the " underground shirt " to the big Memorial - Stratford football game under their regular shirts , presumably warmed by the feeling of keeping bestiality close to their hearts .
According to the Memorial High students and alums who commented on our post ( not all were approved ) , everybody at Memorial pretty much thinks the shirts are awesome and hilarious .
Of course , while no student would admit to buying a shirt on KPRC - TV ( clip above ) , two female students criticized this year 's shirt , saying " no girl should be like that on a shirt , " and " I think it 's offensive . "
But no matter — the real point , as many commenters have hastened to tell us , is that we are humorless feminazis for denigrating their cherished apparel .
The comments on yesterday 's post offer a veritable Hall of Fame of anti-feminist clichés .
Their vitriol reveals that misogyny starts young , and its similarity to more established outlets of feminist - hate shows that it never really grows up !
We 've selected four of our favorites ( plus one bonus ) .

1. Feminists Ca n't Take A Joke .
How about we all stop and think about this for a second ?
Do we really , honestly believe that the shirt was created with the intent to degrade women ?
No .
I am a senior at Memorial High School , and I find it disturbing that there are actually people in this world that cannot comprehend a simple , meaningless joke .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
In fact , we at Jezebel and , I 'm pretty sure , the girls who criticized the shirt to KPRC , are aware that it was intended as a joke .
We are also aware that some jokes are degrading to women , and that we are not obligated to find these jokes funny .
A joke is not a magic form of speech that is above all criticism .
Ann Bartow , author of the original Feminist Law Professors post that broke this story open , helpfully elaborates :
As far as the shirts being " a joke " I just have to ask what is funny about images of sexual assault .
There are a lot of powerful and creative ways to mock an opponent without leveraging gender and rape .
And given it 's a football rivalry at issue , in which all the players are male , why the focus on raping cheerleaders ?
Maybe if the Memorial students learned about the ways that rape has been used as a tool of terror and genocide ( see e.g. WWII , Bosnia , the Congo ) they would n't find rape imagery so funny .

2. Some Girls Like [ X ] , So It Must Be Okay ( Also Known As The Tucker Max Theorem ) .
Just as many girls , if not more girls than guys , buy and wear the shirt .
I was just interviewed by major Houston news station up at the school , and immediately afterwards a sophomore girl approached me and asked if I knew where she could get one .

Much as men sometimes differ in their opinions on important issues , women are also capable of disapproving of something that some women like .
I , for instance , find Ann Coulter offensive .
The fact that she , a woman , likes herself and believes her views are accurate does not make my viewpoint invalid .
Nor does the fact that some women enjoy wearing a certain shirt bar other women from being upset by it .
I should also note that what women tell men , especially in high school , about what does or does not offend them may be quite different from what they actually feel .
3. Criticizing Misogyny Is A Waste Of Time .
Chill people , find better things to do with your time and real issues to fight .
The fact that you are all freaking out about this is simply pathetic .
Get a fucking life !
Advertisement
This particular commenter did n't offer any examples of " better things to do with our time , " nor did s/he indicate whether leaving anonymous comments would be one of them .
Putting aside the irony of criticizing , on a blog , people who criticize things on blogs , we should note that anti-feminists usually consider criticism " pathetic " only if it is aimed at things they themselves support .
Insulting women is called " free speech . "
4. Feminists Have No Lives , But Many Cats .
I feel that the people getting over worked about something like this truly need to find something better to get there panties bunched up about .
As for the feminist law professors have fun cooking dinner tonight telling each one of your 9 cats how your day was and then watching re-runs of Growing Pains , and inspiring romantic comedies as well as dreaming of the life that could have been had you chosen a different profession .
Advertisement
You know , this guy 's right !
The minute I became a Professional Feminist , the cats just started arriving .
And every time I point out an instance of misogyny , another one appears !
( No wonder no one likes me except for my television . )
Seriously , this particular cliché seems to be rooted in the idea that society in general is so awesome to women that we need some kind of huge personal disappointment to make us angry .
I kind of wish that " having a life " were enough to to eliminate all feminist anger — then I would be a sunnier person .
As a bonus , I 'd now like to print the most bizarre defense of the shirt we received .
This is too weird to qualify as an anti-feminist cliché , but it does illustrate the very short distance between misogyny and homophobia .
We have nothing against women at all , so if that was your first thought after seeing this then you are focusing way too much on the fact that the spartan is female .
Fact of the matter is is that no one would have bought a shirt with two horses fucking a male football player . [...]
Anyway , to end this :
The shirt was not intended to be sexist , the fact that the spartan is female is only relevant in that no one would want to buy a shirt depicting gay sex .
Advertisement
See , two horses Eiffel - towering a female cheerleader is totally normal and funny .
But the same horses having sex with a guy would be gay .
And of course , nobody wants that .

The most important announcement from Iran this week did not come from Ahmadinejad .
The Iranian regime has made headlines this week with its announcement that it will allow inspections into its recently discovered enrichment site in Qom , and its agreement , albeit ambiguously , to allow enrichment to be handled by Russia or France .
Less covered , but actually more important , are recent statements from the Iranian opposition against the nuclear weapons program -- warning Western leaders not to be fooled by Ahmdinejad ’s latest concessions , and actually offering a viable alternative to solve the current nuclear standoff .
Iran ’s leadership knows that every policy decision about Iran in the West , or even in Russia and China , is haunted by the specter of the Iranian democratic movement -- a recognition that the regime is suffering from profound inner fissures and lack of legitimacy at home .
Russian vacillation in its support of the current Iranian government has left Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad worried about losing their international support .
Their foreign policy is founded on the assumption that Russia and China will support them against any serious UN sanctions .
To ensure the continuation of this crucial support , the regime has had to offer some concessions on the nuclear issue .
Moreover , Khamenei does not want to fight on two fronts : with Iranian democrats at home , and with the international community abroad .
While the regime is showing conciliatory signs to the West , at home they have tried to sell the latest agreement as a great victory for the regime .
The world , their message is , has come around to accept Iran ’s terms .
For example , the commander of Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps , talking to 300 Basiji supporters meeting in the still - occupied American embassy compound in Tehran on Friday , announced that the Khatami style of negotiation was tantamount to treason and the new empowered Iran is forcing its terms on the West .
The often - implied and sometimes - explicit message is that the policy of confrontation pursued by Khamenei and Ahmadinejad -- as opposed to the policy of negotiating with the West suggested by reformists -- has allowed them to now negotiate from a position of strength .
To reinforce that message , they also engaged in the provocative act of testing a new medium - range missile .
Ahmadinejad ’s suggestion that Iran ’s next meeting with the group of 5+1 should be at the level of heads of state is rooted more in his need for a legitimizing photo - op than any substantive policy initiative .
Iranian democrats , on the other hand , have in recent days made a concentrated effort to tell the world that the regime is in fact negotiating from a position of weakness ; that it does not intend to abide by any agreements they now make ; and , most importantly , that the democrats are committed to approaching the nuclear issue differently than the current regime .
It is these statements that deserve the most attention in the West .
In recent years , the regime in Tehran and its apologists in America have cultivated the myth that on the nuclear issue , there is a " national consensus " in Iran , and that nothing separates the regime from its democratic opponents .
From this faulty premise , many policymakers draw the conclusion that the United States must make a deal with the current regime and not wait or worry about a more democratic Iran .
Three statements in the last few days have proven this premise faulty .
In reading these statements , we must bear in mind that the reformists are all trying to walk a fine line in demarcating their position from that of the regime , while not offering any opportunities for the regime to accuse them of selling out Iran ’s sovereign rights .
The Oscars are the top , cream of the crop , awards for work done in the motion picture industry .
Awards are given for everything from Costume Design to Sound Design , from Acting to Directing .
The nominations for this honorable accolade are usually reserved for big budget , oft discussed and typically high profile films directed by the big names in the industry .
Last year 's Best Actor in a Leading Role category contained marquee names including : Mickey Rourke , Sean Penn , and Brad Pitt , along with Richard Jenkins , and Frank Lengella .
These movies were directed by the likes of : Ron Howard , Darren Aronofsky , Gus Van Sant , and David Fincher .
These films not only draw your attention to the stars within , but also contain budgets to push for Oscar contention .
How many commercials did you see for Benjamin Button last year ?
How many did you see for it when it became an Oscar nominated film ?
Rarely do you see a low - budget , independent film receive the just kudos that it deserves .
As a matter of fact , last year was a total shocker as a film originally slated to go direct - to - DVD , Slumdog Millionaire , managed to storm the Oscars by force and change people 's perceptions of what makes a Best Film .
It did help that the director , Danny Boyle , had some other recognizable works under his belt : Trainspotting , 28 Days Later , The Beach , and Millions .
This kind of resume does n't hurt your chances , but the win did shake the foundation of the Academy Awards .
Moon , released this summer , is an absolutely stunning independent Sci-Fi film from first - time British Director Duncan Jones .
The film managed to pay homage to a litany of Science Fiction classics while firmly cementing itself in the genre as well .
A movie mired in various undertones and interpreted in a variety of directions , Moon has catapulted its director , Jones , into the industry as a filmmaking force to be reckoned with .
Those who saw the film know that the keystone in this stunning project was actor Sam Rockwell .
Anybody familiar with the works of Sam Rockwell will know that the man delivers absolutely stunning performances .
Often overlooked for work as the principal lead , Sam manages to steal nearly every scene he is in .
From the humor in Galaxy Quest and Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy to the exceptional work in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind , Choke , and Matchstick Men , Rockwell consistently delivers an entertaining yet commanding performance .
In Moon , Rockwell is a one man show .
Playing a breathtaking range of emotion from young to old , content to angry , happy to said , Rockwell is giving a performance to rival that of Mickey Rourke in the Wrestler or Sean Penn in Milk .
What is lacking here is the budget for a marketing campaign to spread word of this top notch performance in a superbly constructed film .
What is needed from here is a call to arms !
Only grassroots championing for both Rockwell and the film as a whole will bring about the recognition that this work deserves .
Therefore I challenge you to not only sign your name to this noble petition , but to take an active role in solidifying the support that this film needs .
E-mail friends and family , link to this petition on your Twitter and Facebook , get the word out and help Rockwell receive the credit that he so rightly deserves !

President Obama ’s national security adviser , Gen. James L. Jones , said on Sunday that a recommendation to send another 40,000 American troops to Afghanistan was just one part of a review of overall strategy that included such factors as a larger role for the Pakistani military and the integrity of the recent Afghan elections .
“ It would be a mistake to underestimate the importance of other elements of the strategy , ” General Jones said in an appearance on CBS ’s “ Face the Nation . ” General Jones offered no endorsement of a recommendation by Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal , the top American commander in Afghanistan , to add another 40,000 troops on top of the 68,000 Americans already deployed there .
At one point he described Gen. McChrystal ’s recommendation as “ his opinion ” of “ what he thinks his role within that strategy is . ”
The comments by General Jones seemed to expose the debate within the Obama administration on committing more troops .
On Saturday , eight Americans and two Afghan policemen were killed in a daylight attack against two American outposts .
In an appearance on CNN ’s “ State of the Union , ” General Jones asserted that he does not believe Afghanistan is “ imminent danger of falling ” to the Taliban and that the presence of al Qaeda “ is very diminished . ”
KENT , Ohio , Oct. 1 ( UPI ) -- A U.S. biological anthropologist says he 's determined humans did not evolve from apes , but , rather , apes evolved from humans .
Kent State University Professor C. Owen Lovejoy , who specializes in the study of human origins , said his findings came from a study of Ardipithecus ramidus , a hominid species that lived 4.4 million years ago in what now is Ethiopia .

" People often think we evolved from apes , but no , apes in many ways evolved from us , " Lovejoy said .
" It has been a popular idea to think humans are modified chimpanzees .
From studying Ardipithecus ramidus , or ' Ardi ' ( a partial female skeleton ) we learn that we cannot understand or model human evolution from chimps and gorillas . "
Ardi is " not a chimp , " paleoanthropologist Tim White of the University of California - Berkeley , told the San Jose Mercury News .
" It shows us what we used to be .
It bridges a gap . "
Until Ardi was discovered , the earliest specimen of human evolutions was Australopithecus , a bipedal " ape man " that lived 1 - 4 million years ago , the newspaper said , noting the most famous member of the genus was the 3.2 million - year - old skeleton nicknamed " Lucy " that was found in 1974 .
Ardi ,
White said , is older and more primitive than Lucy , belonging to a new type of early hominid that was neither chimpanzee nor fully human .
Lovejoy ,
White and other scientists present their research in a special Oct. 2 issue of the journal Science .
Wall - Street plus grande escroquerie contrefaçon actions temps
En 2008 , de mystérieux spéculateurs ont inondé les marchés financiers d'énormes quantités d'actions de contrefaçon , ce qui a contribué à tuer Bear Stearns et Lehman Brothers .
Le gouvernement américain ne se presse pas pour enquêter ...
Cet article est la traduction résumée d'une longue et complète enquête de Matt Taibbi pour le compte de Rolling Stone - une vulgaire ... contrefaçon , en quelque sorte ?
L'après - midi du 11 mars 2008 , les actions de la vénérable banque d'investissement Bear Stearns s'échangeaient à 62,97 $ .
Mais l'établissement commença sa descente aux enfers dès le lendemain .
A la fin de la semaine , l'entreprise avait perdu la quasi - totalité de sa trésorerie et pendant le week - end , elle fut achevée par la FED et le Trésor US , forcée de se vendre à JPMorgan Chase ( qui a utilisé 29 milliards de dollars d'aides publiques pour ce faire ) au prix humiliant de ... 2 $ par action .
Quand Nostradamus joue en bourse ...
Ce qui est remarquable , c'est que le 11 mars 2008 , " quelqu'un " a fait l'un des paris les plus fous de l'histoire de Wall Street , investissant 1,7 millions de dollars dans une série d'options ( produits financiers complexes ) bien particulières : pour gagner , il fallait que Bear Stearns perde plus de la moitié de sa valeur en moins de neuf jours .
À ce moment là , il ne s'agissait pas d'un pari fou , mais d'une pure folie !
Aussi dingue qu'" acheter pour 1,7 millions de billets de loterie " .
Mais ce qui est encore plus fou , c'est que notre Nostradamus boursicoteur a gagné son pari ... empochant 159 fois sa mise , soit environ 270 millions $ .
Réunion secrète à la FED
Il faut savoir que le 11 mars 2008 , une réunion s'est tenue à la réserve fédérale de New York , présidée par les deux grands manitous de la FED ( Federal Reserve System ) , Ben Bernanke et Timothy Geithner .
Toutes les grandes entreprises américaines étaient présentes , à la notable exception de ... Bear Stearns .
Cette petite sauterie entre gens bien habillés a longtemps été tenue secrète .
Et c'est par accident , quand un journaliste de Bloomberg a déposé une demande en vertu du Freedom of Information Act , qu'une mention succincte a été découverte dans une annexe d'un document officiel .
Les participants , contactés un à un par Rolling Stone , ont tous refusé de commenter la réunion : " La règle de base du repas , c'est la confidentialité " , a affirmé un porte - parole de Morgan Stanley .
De la vente à découvert à la contrefaçon d'actions
Dès le lendemain , le 12 mars , la chasse à l'ours ( du nom de la banque ) était ouverte .
Et la banque fut prise dans le tourbillon fatal d'une attaque par " vente à découvert " .
Le principe est simple : vous vous engagez à acheter des titres ... après les avoir vendus .
En gros , vous spéculez à la baisse .
Cette procédure est en général utilisée lorsqu'une entreprise montre des signes de faiblesse .
Ou - mais c'est alors illégal - lorsque vous voulez dézinguer une société .
Plus le nombre d'actions à la vente est élevé , plus son cours de bourse baisse : c'est le principe de l'offre et de la demande .
Sauf que pour réaliser une vente à découvert de 1000 actions , il faut - pour être dans la légalité - préalablement s'assurer que ces 1000 actions sont bien disponibles quelque part , chez un courtier prêt à vous les vendre , par exemple .
Le problème est que ce système est totalement opaque , et que personne ne vérifie jamais .
D'ailleurs , aucune sanction financière n'est prévue pour ceux qui contreviendraient à la règle ...
Seule une limite temporelle a été actée .
Le spéculateur doit ainsi racheter les actions virtuelles moins de deux semaines après les avoir vendues .
Sauf que personne - et surtout pas le SEC , le gendarme de la bourse US - ne vérifie l'application de cette règle .
Ainsi , un beau jour , une entreprise ( Overstock ) s'est - elle réveillée avec 18 millions d'actions fictives sur le paletot , dont certaines étaient détenues depuis plus de deux ans par des spéculateurs bien peu scrupuleux .
Résultat : une véritable économie parallèle d'actions virtuelles - vendues mais non achetées .
Mais revenons à notre ours ( bien mal léché ) .
Le mardi 11 mars , 201 768 de ces actions fictives illégales de Bear Stearns étaient dans la nature .
Le lendemain , le nombre d'actions virtuelles a bondi à 1,2 millions .
À la clôture des marchés du vendredi , le nombre a grimpé à 2 millions , et le lundi suivant , il planait à 13,7 millions .
Une attaque au Napalm ...
Ces chiffres constituent l'un des cas les plus flagrants de manipulation des marchés dans l'histoire de Wall Street .
" Il n'y a aucun doute dans mon esprit , pas un seul doute " que la vente à découvert a contribué à détruire Bear Stearns , a déclaré le sénateur Ted Kaufman , un démocrate du Delaware .
Invité à évaluer la probabilité d'une manipulation , sur une échelle de 1 à 10 , l'ancien avocat de la SEC Brent Baker n'hésite pas : " Facilement a 10 " .
L'administration américaine au coeur du scandale
Dans le même temps , Bear Stearns a été victime d'une autre attaque en règle , un classique des raids baissiers : les rumeurs négatives disséminées dans les médias sur la solvabilité de l'entreprise .
Du coup , l'action de la banque a terminé la semaine à 30 dollars .
Le pari était déjà gagné pour notre Fantômas des marchés boursiers .
Puis , une chose étrange s'est produite .
La ligne de crédits d'urgence que la FED avait débloquée à l'attention de la banque devait initialement durer 28 jours .
Mais ce vendredi , la réserve fédérale a brusquement changé d'avis .
Et Hank Paulson - ancien patron de Goldman Sachs , rivale de Bear Stearns - a forcé la main à la banque , menaçant de lui retirer le bénéfice des aides publiques si elle ne trouvait pas de solution avant le dimanche soir .
Miracle , JPMorgan s'est proposé au rachat ... entre 1 et 5 dollars par action , alors que la cotation à Wall Street était de 30 dollars !
Pour un montant global de 29 milliards de dollars , versés par l'Etat à JP Morgan quelques jours avant ...
Tape - là !
Résultat : un ( ou plusieurs ) parieur fou a gagné des centaines de millions de dollars , et des spéculateurs ont fait exploser , façon puzzle , une des plus grandes entreprises du pays , tout en se remplissant les poches , de façon totalement illégale .
La SEC mène l'enquête , sauf que les choses ne sont pas aussi simples .
Un régulateur de Goldman Sachs , Jonathan Breckenridge , a ainsi avoué que le système informatique permet aux opérateurs ( intermédiaires qui lancent les ordres d'achat et de vente pour les clients finaux ) pouvaient saisir absolument ce qu'ils voulaient dans le champ texte destiné à identifier l'acheteur .
Avec un petit faible pour les " trois points de suspension " ...
A ce moment là , la salle a éclaté de rire .
Aujourd 'hui , après plus de 50 auditions de responsables financiers des plus grosses firmes de Wall Street , la SEC n'a pas encore identifié le coupable .
" J'ai vu la SEC envoyer des agents à l'étranger dans des affaires d'initiés concernant des échanges de 2000 $ , dit Brent Baker , un ancien conseiller de la Commission , mais ils n'ont rien fait pour résoudre cette enquête " .
Lehman Brothers a subi le même sort
Le pire , c'est que trois mois plus tard , les tueurs ont encore frappé .
Le 27 Juin 2008 , une avalanche d'actions virtuelles s'est abattue sur Lehman Brothers .
Puis , selon le scénario bien huilé , les rumeurs ont commencé .
Une semaine plus tard , l'action de la banque avait perdu 44 % de sa valeur .
Une véritable orgie cannibale .
Les banques commençaient à se manger entre elles .
Le 12 août 2008 , 60 millions d'actions virtuelles étaient ainsi sur le marché , la compagnie n'a eu d'autre choix que de se déclarer en faillite .
Deux poids , deux mesures ...
Mais l'affaire ne s'arrête pas là .
Le 15 Septembre , le cours des actions de Goldman Sachs et Morgan Stanley , deux autres banques d'affaires phares , a commencé à chuter fortement .
Cette fois - ci , les ventes à découvert étaient réalisées dans les règles de l'art .
Quelque chose d'extraordinaire s'est alors produit .
Morgan Stanley s'est mis à faire pression sur la SEC pour interdire la vente à découvert légale de valeurs financières .
La demande sera honorée quelques heures plus tard , et le cours de bourse de Goldman et Morgan Stanley a rapidement rebondi .
Toujours plus fort , en pleine nuit , l'Etat est grossièrement passé outre ses propres règles en autorisant le versement dans l'instant d'une aide d'urgence aux deux banques impliquées , malgré le délai de 5 jours imposé par la loi .
" J'ai passé des années à essayer d'obtenir ne serait -ce que l'attention de la SEC pour empêcher la contrefaçon illégale des actions de mon entreprise , a déclaré Patrick Byrne , PDG d'Overstock , mais lorsque Morgan Stanley demande une interdiction sur la vente à découvert légale , ils l'obtiennent littéralement du jour au lendemain " .
L'enquête impossible
Concrètement , il ne serait pas très compliqué pour un organisme comme la SEC d'enquêter , de déplier les ordres d'achat ou de vente , de disséquer mails et conversations téléphoniques .
Mais 18 mois après la grande manipulation , le gouvernement fédéral a quasiment renoncé à dénouer les deux plus grands meurtres de l'histoire de Wall Street .
Questionné par Rolling Stone , la SEC s'est refusée à tout commentaire , se contentant de déclarer que " les enquêtes liées à la crise financière sont une priorité " .
Ce système de contrefaçon existe à tous les niveaux , y compris sur le marché obligataire .
Mais personne ne fait rien pour l'empêcher .
C'est en fait tout le système financier qui est basé sur la contrefaçon .
Il faut dire que les clés de Wall Street sont entre les mains de " 300 types " bizarres .
Ce qui n'encourage pas vraiment à la transparence ... d'autant que l'accentuation de la concentration des pouvoirs - la crise a multiplié les faillites et les rapprochements d'établissements financiers - n'arrangera rien .
Conclusion
La plus grande nation regroupant les plus grands acteurs financiers mondiaux est incapable d'écrire des règles pour interdire à ses propres entreprises de voler des milliards au nez et à la barbe des autorités de régulation , et rien n'est fait pour changer les choses .
Des choses aussi fondamentales pour la société civilisée que l'intégrité d'une action , une note d'hypothèque , ou encore une obligation du Trésor américain , ne sont pas protégées , pas même en cas de crise .
Et le recours systématique depuis des années à un crime aussi vulgaire et visible que la contrefaçon de produits financiers reste impuni .
Une caste de voleurs règne actuellement sur l'économie mondiale .
Et personne ne tente de les arrêter .
Une pierre de plus à rajouter à l'édifice de " Capitalism a love story " , de Michael Moore ...

Meeting scheduling service
When is Good looked at 100,000 responses to 34,000 events logged to their service over 2 years and found that 3 pm — specifically Tuesday at 3 pm — seems to be the most agreeable time for a meeting .

When Is Good , a free service we 've previously covered , goes into a lot more detail about why some folks might be more receptive to meeting in the afternoon than the morning , and on Tuesday rather than Thursday , but the basic findings they 've laid out are as follows :
Event invitations are most likely to be accepted for a Tuesday at 3 pm .
Surprisingly , very little variation exists between the days of the week .
On average only 3 or 4 people out of 10 will be available at any given time .
People are happier than you might think to work through lunch .
Flexibility jumps up at 10 and 11 in the morning , but peaks at 3 PM .
Interestingly enough , execs also consider Tuesday the most productive day of the week , while researchers have found that Tuesday is also the most stressful — specifically at 11:45 am ( and most of you agreed ) .
Hit the link for a full " white paper " read , and venture your guess at why Tuesday appears to be at the nexus of your work week in the comments .

This country is in danger of becoming a politically controlled nation closer to communist China .
That 's all very well if you have three hours to wash the dishes , but some of us need to get things done .
Gee , these toddlers are up to no good .
What are they up to ?
Wait for it – they 're watching television !
The outrage that has greeted reports that the Australian government is to issue cautious guidelines advising parents and carers to prevent children under two from watching television seems remarkably acerbic .
Across the world , however , the same debates flare up every time it is tentatively suggested that the electronic screens we began by placing in one room at home and now carry everywhere in our pockets may not be good for the development of children 's brains .
Television is no longer merely the drug of the nation , it is the pacifier , babysitter , wallpaper and teacher for our children .
Increasingly it intrudes on the very first months of their lives .
In Australia , young children spend more time watching television than any other activity .
The average four - month - old gazes at the box for 44 minutes every day .
In the United States , under twos watch 1.2 hours a day on average .
In Britain , older children have been calculated to spend five hours and 18 minutes watching TV , playing computer games or online each day , just over an hour less than the US average .
Behind the fury about strictures suggesting television is bad for our children is guilt .
Parents are uneasy about the effects television has on their children and are quick to get defensive about switching it on .
" Whether it is the slack - jawed look their children have when they put them in front of the television or the tantrum when they turn it off , most parents have this unease about it but it's a battle they choose not to fight .
They have enough battles getting them to eat the right food , " says Dr Michael Rich , director of the influential Center on Media and Child Health at Boston Children 's Hospital .
We may now be highly tuned to what we feed our children 's bodies but we are less careful about what we feed their minds .
Academics researching the impact of television on the very young compare debates over its adverse effects with those over smoking a generation a half ago , or seat belts and cycle helmets more recently .
A draft of the Australian government 's guidelines says that screen time for young children " may reduce the amount of time they have for active play , social contact with others and chances for language development " , and may also " affect the development of a full range of eye movement [ and ] . . . reduce the length of time they can stay focused " .
Jo Salmon , associate professor of epidemiology at Deakin University , was one of the researchers who informed the Australian government 's draft guidelines .
" Children aged six to 30 months who are watching television have less developed vocabulary , display more aggressive behaviour and have poor attention spans , " she says .
" Parents and childcare centres are not justified in encouraging children , under the age of two , to watch television . "
While there is no evidence that so - called educational programming is harmful , she would discourage under twos from watching it .
" I really would not put my young one under two in front of a television .
Generally , the evidence that 's out there says it could be detrimental , " she says .
We may sense TV is bad for young children but what evidence is there really ?
There is a booming market in educational computer games and DVDs , such as the Baby Einstein range , and if our modern multitasking lives are saturated in electronic screens , is n't sitting children in front of them at least good training for the modern world ?
Rich worked in the film industry before having a " midlife crisis " and retraining as a paediatrician .
He is not evangelical about governments enforcing how television is used in homes but barred his own two young children from television and computer games before they were 30 months old .
While there is good television that children can consciously learn from at a later age , he says scientific studies show young children are not able to consciously learn from television .
As Rich explains , humans have the most sophisticated brain on the planet because it is relatively unformed when we are born .
Our brains triple in volume in the first 24 months .
We build our brains ourselves , by responding to the environment around us .
The biggest part of this is a process called pruning , says Rich , whereby we learn what is significant – our mother 's voice , for instance – and what is not .
" TV killing off neurons and the synaptic connections that are made in order to discriminate signals from ' noise ' , " he says .
Experts in child development have found that three things optimise brain development : face - to - face interaction with parents or carers ; learning to interact with or manipulate the physical world ; and creative problem - solving play .
Electronic screens do not provide any of this .
At the most basic level , then , time spent watching TV has a displacement effect and stops children spending time on other , more valuable brain - building activities .
Scientists concede that they do not yet know precisely how TV affects the cognitive development , not just in terms of understanding the inner workings of the brain but because the way we use television and other electronic screens is changing so rapidly that we do not know how it will affect people by the time their brains stop developing in their mid-20s .
But the weight of evidence about the deleterious impact of TV on child 's ability to learn is alarming – to say nothing of its impact on children 's sexual development
The Australian government 's advice is supported by the recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics that under - twos are not exposed to any television time .
Dr Dimitri Christakis at Seattle Children 's Research Institute found that for every extra hour watching DVDs , 8 - to 16 - month - olds learned six to eight fewer words than children who spent no time in front of the screen .
Marie Evans Schmidt at the Centre for Media and Child Health found that even just having television on in the background while under threes play with their toys disrupted their attention span even when they appeared to pay little attention to it .
While there is a paucity of evidence that television is beneficial to early cognitive development , there are studies that show it is not as influential as the educational status and income of parents .
Schmidt found that an apparently negative relationship between TV viewing and cognitive development disappeared when she factored in the mother 's educational status and household income – parents ' education and finances mattered more .
" TV viewing is an outgrowth of other characteristics of the home environment that lead to lower test scores , " said Schmidt .
Other research suggests these include less mother - and - baby interaction and less reading to children .
Unlike the Australians , the British government does not offer any guidance on how much television toddlers should be allowed to watch .
It has introduced an " Early Years Foundation Stage " for 0 - 5 s which implies that television should be part of children 's learning .
Carers , the guidance states , should help children become familiar with " everyday technology " and use it to support their learning .
Only the French government has been brave enough to ban stations from showing programmes targeted at under - threes .
Last year it also insisted that overseas cable channels must incorporate a tobacco - style warning : " Watching television can slow the development of children under three , even when it involves channels aimed specifically at them . "
Aric Sigman , a UK psychologist and author of The Spoilt Generation , a broadside against permissive parenting , says while governments are happy to offer advice on suncream and portions of fruit and vegetables , they are less willing to provide guidelines about TV .
" Of course they do n't want to because it is a vote - loser , " he says .
" It is society 's favourite pastime and it makes parents feel guilty .
The convenience of us parents is seen as paramount as opposed to the wellbeing of our children .
When it comes to our childrens ' wellbeing , our guilt as parents has to come second . "
Part of the problem , argues Sigman , is we have a nostalgic view of our own experience of television when we were young .
" We say , ' I watched Blue Peter and I 'm OK ' , " says Sigman .
" But the editing speeds and the colours and the number of hours spent watching TV and the age at which TV watching starts are a whole different thing now .
We can't compare now with before . "
Rich agrees .
Television is so different now that the " it did n't harm me " argument is irrelevant , he says .
Instead , frustratingly , he finds the debate around young children watching TV is played out as part of the culture wars in which the educated , ruling classes of academia and , when they dare , politicians , are perceived as self - righteously restricting the freedom of expression of ordinary people .
Rich instead hopes the debate could be examined more neutrally – and scientifically – as an issue of " health and development " .
He accepts that TV is not like smoking : it is not simply bad for your health .
He would like a return to a " respect " for TV and other electronic screens so they are treated like a trip to the theatre or a novel , as something to be consciously watched in moderation .
This may sound like another culture wars value judgment but , as he argues , it is not about good or bad TV but about the good and bad ways in which we consume it .

The Cornell Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Team ( CUAUV ) consists of 35 students at Cornell University who gained recognition at the August 2009 AUSVI conference with their robotic submarine named Nova .
The conference competition , now in its 12th year , requires entries to complete tasks through a rigorous underwater obstacle course without human intervention .
The U.S. Navy provided the large acoustic testing pool .
Among other things , the submarine needed to pass through a gate , ram a submerged buoy and fire a torpedo .
The Cornell team was the only one among the 30 entries to complete the course , the last time being a team from MIT in 2002 .
Benjamin Seidenberg , software team leader at CUAUV is full of praise for Debian : " Not only do we use it on the vehicle , we also run it on the computers in our lab and our servers , and use it to develop our custom electronics . "
The team reported using further open source software on the submarine , including OpenCV for image processing and Libdc1394 as an interface for its Firewire camera .
Further evidence for the asbestos - like effects of carbon nanotubes has emerged from a new study in mice .
The study shows for the first time that the tubes reach the outer lining of the lung when inhaled - as asbestos does .
But researchers say the results should be interpreted with caution .
Carbon nanotubes , like asbestos , have high aspect ratios ; in other words , they are long and thin , meaning they have the potential to get stuck when trying to cross the two layered membrane - the pleura - separating the lung from the chest wall .
In the case of asbestos , fibres can dwell in this area , causing lung disease and mesothelioma , a type of slow - growing cancer .
’ We ’re not saying that carbon nanotubes are going to be like asbestos .
We do n’t know yet , ’ says James Bonner of North Carolina State University in the US , who led the research .
’ There ’s no evidence of cancer .
The major finding is that we ’re saying that nanotubes get to the site where mesothelioma would occur , but we do n’t have the information to say that it does occur . ’
Real world risks
Last year , concerns were raised for the safety of those working with nanotubes when a paper published in Nature Nanotechnology concluded that nanotubes could damage lung tissue if injected into the abdomen of mice .
1
The study by Bonner and colleagues now provides an insight into potential effects of exposure in the ’ real world ’ by examining what happens when the tubes are inhaled .
2
The timescale ( 14 weeks ) of Bonner ’s experiment was not long enough to test whether inhaled nanotubes cause mesothelioma , but the team did see damage in the form of fibrosis - scarring of the pleura - which is also seen with asbestos .
Mice that inhaled multi- walled carbon nanotubes developed fibrosis after around two weeks , with the nanotubes accumulating in immune cells in the region just below the pleura .
By comparison , mice inhaling carbon black nanoparticles , which do not have the crucial high aspect ratio , did not develop fibrosis .
Ken Donaldson of the University of Edinburgh , one of the authors of the 2008 paper , stresses the importance of distinguishing between different types of nanotubes .
’ My guess would be that the smallest ones are the least likely to cause much in the way of disease and that the longest ones would be most likely to cause disease , ’ he says .
’ We ’re not in any position to be able to say this study has generic significance for all other nanotubes , because they come in different lengths , compositions and contaminants . ’
Bonner agrees , pointing out that the toxic effects could even be related to the nickel catalysts left over from nanotube growth - other manufacturing processes use different catalysts .
He says further studies comparing the effects of nanotubes from different sources , of different sizes and at lower doses are required .
’ This research contributes to the emerging evidence base on the inhalation toxicology of high aspect ratio nanoparticles , ’ says Steve Hankin , a toxicologist with SAFENANO at the Institute of Occupational Medicine .
Crucially , he notes , the link between toxicology and the risk posed by any substance is exposure - without exposure , the risk can be substantially minimised or even eliminated .

Pictured : The Independence Day - shaped cloud hovering in the skies over Moscow
In what could have been a scene from the film Independence Day , a luminous ring - shaped cloud could be seen hovering over the city of Moscow last week .
The pale gold ' halo ' could be seen above the Russian capital city 's Western District on Wednesday , and was captured on film by stunned Muscovites .
Meteorologists rejected any theories of the supernatural however , calling it an optical effect .
[ caption ]
A spokesman from the city 's weather forecast said : ' Several fronts have been passing through Moscow recently , there was an intrusion of the Arctic air too , the sun was shining from the west – this is how the effect was produced . '
He added : ' This is purely an optical effect , although it does look impressive .
' If you look closer , you can see sun rays coming through that cloud .
Most likely , the sun was setting when the video was being made .
[ caption ]
' If you observe clouds regularly , you may see many other astonishing things .
Clouds of the same class may look absolutely different in different areas . '
Some environmentalists blamed pollution for the cloud , but weather forecasters were quick to reject the idea : ' The phenomenon has nothing to do with industrial emissions , ' said one .
' They could not produce such an effect against the background of the current weather conditions .
' If something happens , there is the smog effect , but it appears only when the weather is quiet for a long time .
The wind in Moscow has been quite strong recently . '
We know what you 're thinking : Fleshbot , I have n't even heard of Hiroko Mima ( aka Miss Universe Japan 2008 ) and Anya Ayoung - Chee ( aka Miss Universe 2008 of Trinidad and Tobago 2008 ) — why should I care about their sex lives ?
Well , good reader , because these ladies are hot .
And ( allegedly ! ) had a threeway ... on videotape .
On video tape .
And really , reader , is n't the fact that there are hot ladies having a threeway ( that you can watch ! ) enough to get your attention ?
That said , there is the very interesting matter that they also ( allegedly ! ) happen to be beauty queens .
In the wake of Carrie Prejean 's sex tape scandal , it seems rather interesting that she 's not the only beauty queen who knows how to get down .
Perhaps there 's a larger lesson for us here , correlating the pursuit of fame and the desire to immortalize one 's self doing dirty things .
Or perhaps this is a sign that , yes , everyone ( everyone ) has sex tapes ... and the minute we can all appreciate that , the easier ( and sexier ) life will be for all of us .

UPDATE : It turns out that , while Ms. Ayoung Chee is featured in these tapes , Hiroko Mima is not .
Nope , the other girl is just a friend of Anya's .
Good to know !

Scares The Crap Out Of Himself
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
Hundreds of gay men have been tortured and killed in Iraq in recent months , some by the nation 's security forces , Human Rights Watch said Monday .
Iraqi clerics say homosexuality must be eradicated but warn against anti-gay violence .
Interviews with doctors indicate hundreds of men had been killed , but the exact number was unclear because of the stigma associated with homosexuality in Iraq , the New York - based watchdog group said in its report .
" Iraq 's leaders are supposed to defend all Iraqis , not abandon them to armed agents of hate , " said Scott Long , director of the Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual and Transgender Rights Program at Human Rights Watch .
" Turning a blind eye to torture and murder threatens the rights and life of every Iraqi . "
Four victims who spoke to CNN gave accounts of the attacks , which they say have intensified in the past few months .
" In 2004 , militias and unknown groups started to go after the gays ... but the peak was six months ago , " said Qaisar , who uses a pseudonym for fear of reprisal .
" It has become wide scale war against gays in Iraq . "
Iraqi officials acknowledged that the nation 's culture stigmatizes homosexuality , but said the government does not condone such attacks .
Authorities are unable to provide homosexuals with special protection , said government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh .
According to Human Rights
Watch , which is urging a government crackdown , attackers target people on the streets or storm homes , where they conduct interrogations and demand names of suspected gay men .
Many end up in hospitals and morgues , the organization said , basing its conclusion on reports from doctors .
Men have been threatened with " honor killings " by relatives worried that their " unmanly behavior " will ruin the family 's reputation , Human Rights Watch said .
Watch Iraqi men discuss attacks »
Killings , kidnappings and torture of those suspected of homosexual conduct have intensified in areas such as the Baghdad neighborhood of Sadr City , the watchdog said .
" The Shiite people started this war and especially what happened in Sadr City , " Qaisar said , adding that his sister - in - law had warned him against going to the area .
Muqtada al - Sadr 's Mahdi Army militia , which is active in Sadr City , has joined in the attacks and defends its actions as a way to stop the " feminization " of Iraqi men , the report said .
" We have testimony that indicates that the nation 's security forces are taking part in the attacks , " Long said .
The group interviewed more than 50 people who gave accounts of abuses , beatings and stops at security checkpoints , he said .
" When the gay killings started and when they started go ( ing ) after them at checkpoints ... we started to change our look , " said Basim , who also used a pseudonym .
" These killings point to the continuing and lethal failure of Iraq 's post - occupation authorities to establish the rule of law and protect their citizens , " said Rasha Moumneh , Middle East researcher for Human Rights Watch .

From CreationWiki , the encyclopedia of creation science
The young earth creationism perspective is the result of a plain , or historical - grammatical reading of the description of the early earth in the Bible , or the Islamic Qur'an , which both contain nearly parallel accounts of a six - day creation , Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden , and Noah 's flood .
For purposes that are clear , the Christian interpretation will be built upon and described .
Integral aspects of the Young Earth Creationist position include creation in six days ( encompassing everything from the beginning of the universe to the appearance of man ) , and the global flood of Noah 's time ( as the fossil - bearing sediments laid down by the flood account for most of the geological column ) .
Young earth creation scientists also believe that the first law of thermodynamics and second law of thermodynamics argue against an eternal universe and they also claim that these laws point to the universe being supernaturally created . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]
The arguments put by proponents for a young Earth fall into the following categories .
Scriptural : The Biblical account is written as actual history , and is therefore to be understood as such .
The Biblical account is written as actual history , and is therefore to be understood as such .
Theological : The Biblical doctrines rely on the creation and flood accounts being actual history .
The Biblical doctrines rely on the creation and flood accounts being actual history .
Scientific :
The scientific evidence fits better with a young Earth than an old Earth .
Biblical Support
Young Earth creationists argue that the Bible was written as actual history and was to be understood as such .
With this view , the Bible clearly teaches a young Earth .
The Bible specifically states that the time from the beginning of the cosmos to the creation of humans was six days as recorded in Genesis 1 , and that the time from the creation of man to the birth of Abraham was approximately 1950 years , as recorded in the Biblical genealogies .
Given Biblical and other data for calculating a date for Abraham , we can calculate that the universe and the Earth were created approximately 6000 years ago .
Oxford Professor James Barr ( not a Young Earth creationist ) put it this way :
“ probably , so far as I know , there is no professor of Hebrew or Old Testament at any world - class university who does not believe that the writer (s ) of Gen. 1 - 11 intended to convey to their readers the ideas that ( a ) creation took place in a series of six days which were the same as the days of 24 hours we now experience ( b ) the figures contained in the Genesis genealogies provided by simple addition a chronology from the beginning of the world up to later stages in the biblical story ( c ) Noah 's flood was understood to be world - wide and extinguish all human and animal life except for those in the ark .
Or , to put it negatively , the apologetic arguments which suppose the " days " of creation to be long eras of time , the figures of years not to be chronological , and the flood to be a merely local Mesopotamian flood , are not taken seriously by any such professors , as far as I know . ”
The Days of Creation
Main article : Days of Creation
The Bible states in Genesis 1 that the earth with all its inhabitants was created by God in 6 days .
Although many people argue that the days of creation should not be taken literally , the events are described in terms that are correlated with definitions of specific lengths of time .
Since God created time and language , it is reasonable to assume that the most straight forward reading of these passages should take place .
The specificity of the period of time in question is made clear and reinforced on numerous occasions with the phrase " And there was evening , and there was morning " .
In Exodus 20:8 - 11 God tells the Israelites to keep the seventh day , the Sabbath , holy .
The reason provided ( v.11 ) is that God created the universe in six days , and rested on the seventh .
It is argued that the analogy would be a dis-analogy if the days in the Genesis Creation Account were not also literal days .
This idea is repeated in Exodus 31:15 - 17 .
Further support lies with how the word " Day " is used elsewhere in scripture .
In every instance where a day is described in the Bible using this terminology outside of Genesis , it always means an ordinary day .
The Flood of Noah
Main article : Flood of Noah
Based on a plain reading of Genesis , the flood of Noah describes a global event that destroyed all terrestrial life on Earth except for those brought on board the ark .
Assuming this event happened as described , the young earth creationism perspective holds that the fossil record is the result of this flood .
This geologic interpretation known as catastrophism was a long - standing view of fossiliferous rocks prior to the 1800s when a uniformitarian view began to take hold .
Jesus believed In A Young Earth
Main article : Jesus Christ
When Jesus was asked about divorce , he quoted from Genesis on the origin of marriage , mentioning that God made them male and female at the beginning of creation Mark 10:6 .
In the old - Earth timescale , the origin of mankind occurred in the last couple of million years of the 14 - billion - year age of the universe .
However , in the Young Earth timescale , mankind was created six days after the creation of the known universe , truly " at the beginning of creation " .
Jesus spoke of Noah as a literal , historical person as described in Scripture Matthew 24:37 - 38 , and Abraham John 8:58 , and Lot in the historical Sodom Luke 17:28 - 29 in context of his own return .
Jesus appealed to the writings of Moses to confirm his own identity John 5:46 , purpose Luke 16:31 , and mission Luke 24:27 , as did his disciples Acts 28:23 .
Paul the Apostle used the Creation as a basis for evangelism to those without any Hebrew foundation Acts 17:24 and claimed that the Cross " alone " was " foolishness " to such people I Corinthians 1:23 and the resurrection " alone " is meaningless to those who do n't accept the writings of Moses Luke 16:31 .
Ultimately angels declare that the Creation event alone is the " everlasting gospel " Revelation 14:6 - 7 .
Many churches teach only the Crucifixion and Resurrection as " the Gospel " but it is clear from the primary doctrinal threads of Christ 's teachings that the " full Gospel " is comprised of four primary events : Creation , Fall , Crucifixion and Resurrection , and Christ 's own explanations require the Creation and Fall to explain the meaning of the Crucifixion and Resurrection .
Theological Support
Without the foundation of a literal six - day creation , quite a few Biblical doctrines found in the Old and New Testaments have no basis .
Sin , Death , and a " Good " Creation
Main article : Fall of man
At the end of each day of creation , " God saw that it was good " .
At the end of the sixth day , with creation now complete , " God saw all that he had made , and it was very good . "
Genesis 1:31 Death was introduced as a punishment for Adam 's sin .
Genesis 3:19 , _22 -24
" The last enemy to be destroyed is death . "
1 Corinthians 15:26
Only the young Earth view allows for no death before Adam .
All old - age views place the fossil record — with its record of death and suffering — prior to Adam , thus proposing that death is a part of God 's " very good " creation and not a punishment for mankind 's sin , but a natural part of existence .
Marriage
God created Eve to be Adam 's companion .
She was created from his own body , therefore they were of one flesh .
Genesis 2:21 - 24 Jesus teaches that when a man and woman marry , they are also " one flesh " .
Mark10:6-8 , Matthew 19:4,5 Jesus refers to the Genesis passage as real history , and in fact the validity of his argument depends on it .
It also implies that humans were created " in the beginning , " whereas evolutionary theories put man relatively late in the timeline of the universe .
Clothes
Before sin , Adam and Eve were naked , but felt no shame .
Genesis 2:25
After they sinned , however , they realised their nakedness and tried to cover themselves .
Genesis 3:7
God killed an animal and clothed them in its skin .
Genesis 3:21
Scientific Support
Young earth creation scientists advance a number of arguments in support of a recent creation , arguments that place an upper limit on the age of the Earth , solar system , or universe . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]
Many objections to claims of an extremely old age for the earth and the universe have also been put forth . [ 7 ] [ 5 ]
For example , Russell Humphreys ' argument based on the amount of salt in the ocean is designed to show the maximum possible age of the oceans based on uniformitarian assumptions , and thus shows that the oceans could not be as old as claimed ; it is not designed to show the actual age of the oceans , and as such the resulting age , although far too great for the young Earth view , is not inconsistent with it .
Young earth
Main article : young earth evidence
Young earth creation scientists believe that the evolutionary geological timescale is in error . [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ]
They also point to multiple lines of evidence from the field of geology showing that the earth is young .
[ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ]
The uniformitarian assumptions are rejected , in favor of catastrophic processes related to the global flood as responsible for the vast majority of the Earth 's geologic features .
It should be noted that catastrophism is increasing being accepted in the field of geology . [ 15 ] [ 16 ]
Young earth creationists also assert that old earth uniformitarian geology has numerous anomalies .
For example , William R. Corliss catalogued numerous anomalies in the old earth uniformitarian geology paradigm . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]
Young earth creationists also argue that paleontologists have so far failed to identify the transitional forms that the theory of evolution requires .
There are over one hundred million identified and cataloged fossils currently in the world 's museums . [ 19 ]
If the theory of evolution is true , then there should be transitional forms in the fossil record that show the intermediate life forms .
Another term for these " transitional forms " is " missing links " .
See the following for more arguments that support a young Earth :
Geomagnetic field decay - Observations made of the strength of Earth 's magnetic field over the last 150 years show that it is decaying , which puts an upper limit on the age of the Earth .
Pleochroic halos - Scars of radioactive decay , which suggest problems with the standard uniformitarian model .
Helium diffusion - there is a significant amount of helium still inside the zircons , showing their ages to be 6000 +/- 2000 years .
Accelerated Nuclear Decay - Recent experiments commissioned by the RATE group indicate that " 1.5 billion years " worth of nuclear decay has taken place , but in one or more short periods 4000 - 8000 years ago .
This would shrink the alleged 4.5 billion year radioisotope age of the earth to only a few thousand years .
Ocean salinity - Water runoff brings salts into the sea , which is not removed by evaporation .
Based on the current rate of salt accumulation into the ocean it has been estimated that the oceans were 80 – 90 million years old at the most . [ 20 ]
Young universe
Main article : young universe evidence
Young earth creationists believe that the universe was created by God , and reject naturalistic explanations on the origins of the galaxies , stars , and planets . [ 21 ]
In addition , young earth creationist scientists contest the Big Bang Theory stating that the theory is scientifically unsound . [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ]
Creation scientists also point out that the Big Bang theory has had many dissenters including the British astronomer Sir Fred Hoyle , the Nobel Prize winner Hannes Alfven , and astronomers Geoffrey Burbidge and Halton Arp . [ 26 ]
In 2004 , an " Open Letter to the Scientific Community " disputing the Big Bang theory was signed by 33 leading scientists has been published on the internet and in the science journal New Scientist .
The dissent letter has subsequently been signed by hundreds of individuals around the world . [ 27 ]
See the following for more arguments that that support a young universe .
Young solar system
Main article : young solar system evidence
The theory of a young solar system has many scientific arguments that can be used to show consistency with the belief in a recent creation .
Some simply put an upper limit on the age of solar system .
For example , evidence has indicated that there is too much interplanetary dust in the solar system .
The solar wind , solar gravitation and the Poynting - Robertson effect remove dust from the solar system , while comets and asteroids can contribute to the dust .
An argument was issued by Robertson and Slusher in a 100 page monograph confirming that equations derived nearly fifty years earlier were essentially correct and the solar system was limited to a few thousand years without some hitherto unknown massive replacement method .
At least half of this conclusion is supported by secular scientists who hold that the lifespan for a typical dust particle is about 10,000 years .
See the following for more arguments that support a young solar system .
Helioseismology -
The core of the sun produces deuterium from hydrogen fusion at 5 million degrees K .
The heat is transferred from the core by convection currents so it could reach surface in days , not a million years .
It also leads to an age for the sun based on the deuterium / hydrogen ratio of the local interstellar medium of 6,000 - 12,857 years .
Geomagnetic field decay
Moon Recession
Origin of comets
Moon dust
Adherents and Opponents of Young Earth Creationism
Roughly 47 % of the United States population believes man was created by God pretty much in his present form less than 10,000 years ago and this number has stayed roughly constant for the last 20 years . [ 1] [ 2 ]
Young Earth Creationism is most commonly found among members of the Abrahamic faiths , especially Judaism , Christianity , and Islam .
Most young earth creationists believe that most of the book of Genesis ( including the creation accounts ) is a straightforward narrative meant to be understood literally . [ 28 ]
The following are the leading young Earth creationist ministries worldwide .
Traditionally , Judaism supported young earth creationism . [ 29 ]
In addition , a majority of the early church fathers supported the young earth creationist view . [ 30 ]
While Young Earth Creationism is prominent in many conservative Protestant denominations , theologically liberal Protestant and Jewish denominations generally reject it . [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ]
The post -Vatican II Roman Catholic Church has a cautiously positive view of the theory of evolution , while the majority of traditionalist Catholics strongly support the view of a young earth and a literal creation . [ 34 ] [ 35 ] — but in 2005 Cardinal Christoph Schönborn , Archbishop of Vienna , said that he found evidence of design in nature and that attempts to ignore such evidence amounted to an abdication of the intellect . [ 36 ]
Orthodox Judaism currently has diverse opinions regarding young earth creationism . [ 37 ]
Ultra-Orthodox Judaism accepts young earth creationism . [ 38 ]
Atheists do not believe in young earth creationism . [ 39 ]
While agnostics do not believe in young earth creationism there have been some notable statements of skepticism regarding the theory of evolution from agnostics . [ 40 ] [ 41 ]
On the other hand , Charles Darwin and Thomas Huxley both staunch proponents of the theory of evolution stated that they were agnostics . [ 42 ] [ 43 ]

Oct. 28 , 2009 -- Stung by the " party of no " label , House Republicans are beginning to prepare a detailed GOP agenda for next year 's congressional elections , focusing broadly on efforts to grow the economy , create jobs , and curb the reach of the federal government .
A formal unveiling will most likely wait until next summer or fall , when voters are more engaged in congressional races .
Top Republicans caution that major decisions -- including how closely to model efforts on the famous " Contract with America " that Republicans rode to power in 1994 -- are still to come .
But the direction of the effort is beginning to become clearer .
GOP leaders are promising to offer a formal alternative to the Democrats ' health care bill , rather than let their opposition to a broader government role in health care stand by itself .
House Minority Whip Eric Cantor , R - Va. , said House Republicans will eventually roll out " something like the contract , " as they seek ways to present their case to an electorate that 's shown signs of concern about full Democratic control of Washington .
" We are really thinking about what it is we would do if we were in control , " Cantor , R - Va. , told ABC News .
" There will be an opportunity for us to proffer our alternatives .
You 're going to see us do that . "
Republicans are already discussing ways to package those alternatives -- with the lessons of 1994's " Contract With America " in mind .
That document was rolled out just six weeks before the election , encapsulating a vision endorsed by Newt Gingrich and his allies en route to a sweeping Election Day victory .
Rep. Tom Price , R - Ga. , the chairman of the Conservative Republican Study Committee , said whether the GOP plans will be called a " contract " is among the major items of debate right now .
" That 's the $ 64,000 question , " Price said .
" Obviously all of us want the most effective means of communication for that contrast [ with Democrats ] .
Whether that takes the form of a list of specific bills , a list of principles , a list of items we 'd accomplish -- all of those things are being discussed right now .
I 'm not wedded to any of them . "
Cantor said the major planks Republicans are coalescing around -- the economy , jobs , and " Washington overreach " -- are areas that are " in [ Republicans ' ] wheelhouse , " and that particularly appeal to independent voters .
Asked about the debate inside the Republican Party over the special election in upstate New York next week -- where a series of prominent Republicans have endorsed the Conservative Party candidate because they do n't consider the GOP nominee sufficiently conservative -- Cantor said Republicans need to learn Democrats ' lesson from 2006 and pick candidates who can win in districts across the country .
" At the end of the day , we have to win control of this place , " he said , echoing the argument Gingrich has made in standing by the Republican candidate in New York 's 23rd congressional district .
Former Gov. Sarah Palin , R - Alaska , and Gov. Tim Pawlenty , R- Minn. , have joined a former Gingrich lieutenant , Dick Armey , in backing the Conservative Party nominee in that race .
The move to offer concrete proposals , rather than vague principles and outright opposition to President Obama 's agenda , is an attempt by Republicans to blunt Democratic efforts to label them as the " party of no . "
A series of Democrats took to the House floor as recently as Thursday to ask Republicans the rhetorical question : " Where 's your bill ? "
Price , a medical doctor , has been pressing his caucus to answer that question in detail .
He 'll get his wish when debate on health care takes place on the House floor .
" The American people need to know that there are people here in Washington who are fighting for them as hard as they can , " Price said .
Cantor said the GOP health care alternative would emphasize items including tort reform , portability of health insurance between jobs , tax breaks for individuals to purchase health coverage , and reforms that would keep consumers from being denied coverage because of preexisting conditions .
As Republicans plot a way forward , the issue of how closely to model efforts on the successful GOP 1994 campaign is an item of hot debate .
Former Rep. Tom Davis , R - Va. , who came to Congress with the " Contract with America " class in 1995 , said it wo n't be enough to offer another " contract " this time around .
" In 1994 , it had been 40 years since the Republicans controlled the House ; here , it 's four years , " Davis said on ABCNews.com 's " Top Line " Wednesday .
" And there 's a hesitancy to just go back as the opposition . "
The key for Republicans , he said , will be to find a way to broaden the party 's reach without sacrificing the grass - roots energy they 'll need to win .
" You 're going to be a national party , or you 're going to be a private club , and that 's the conversation this party has to decide , " said Davis , who left Congress this year and now heads the centrist Republican Main Street Partnership .
" They 've got to keep the energy from the ' tea - baggers ' and the ' birthers ' and these groups that probably could n't govern a one - car funeral , but they 're the energy for the party at this point .
You need those people and you 've got to adopt a couple things .
And frankly , they 're not wrong on every issue .
But at the same time you need to appeal to independents and moderates , " Davis said .
Old people have never been as quick or energetic as young people , but societies have often valued them for their accumulated skills , knowledge , and wisdom .
The ancient Egyptians considered a person to be truly old at age 80 , though Ramesses the Great lived to perhaps 90 or 91 and Pepi II may have lived to 98 .
In a continuous culture that spanned 3000 years it would be quite reasonable to ask someone born 80 years earlier about best practices in art , agriculture , architecture , construction , or military technology .
What has the increasing pace of technological development done to old people in our age ?
Let ’s start by considering factual knowledge .
An old person will know more than a young person , but can any person , young or old , know as much as Google and Wikipedia ?
Why would a young person ask an elder the answer to a fact question that can be solved authoritatively in 10 seconds with a Web search ?
How about skills ?
Want help orienting a rooftop television aerial ?
Changing the vacuum tubes in your TV ?
Dialing up AOL ?
Using MS - DOS ?
Changing the ribbon on an IBM Selectric ( height of 1961 technology ) ?
Tuning up a car that lacks electronic engine controls ?
Doing your taxes without considering the Alternative Minimum Tax and the tens of thousands of pages of rules that have been added since our senior citizen was starting his career ?
Did n’t think so .
The same technological progress that enables our society to keep an ever - larger percentage of old folks ’ bodies going has simultaneously reduced the value of the minds within those bodies .
It is sad to contemplate .
Perhaps the answer is for every old person to become an expert personal computer and network administrator .
Those skills always seem to be in demand by the general public .
Another answer would be to develop obvious wisdom .
Unfortunately , the young people who are most in need of an elder ’s wisdom are the least likely to realize it .
Only a small percentage of old people throughout history have managed to maintain high status and value purely through wisdom .
Examples that come to mind include the Buddha ( died at 80 ) and Confucius ( died at 72 ) .
Their would - be modern counterparts are most likely forwarding cautionary emails to younger relatives about the dangers of opening particularly virulent email messages .
I recently wished a friend a happy birthday .
He is in his 50s with a young wife and two - year - old children .
All his life he has been valued for and earned his living with musical creativity .
Here ’s his reply :
I have been declared inept by my household !
It only gets worse .
You are not judged by your intelligence but by how well you do menial tasks .
I have been spiritually castrated .
I am a walking corpse .
The only freedom is when I write .
Good ideas for maintaining relevance and value in old age would be welcome in the comments section .
Morton Thompson 's Turkey
Time to see who has the guts to try this at Thanksgiving .
There is only one way to stuff and roast a turkey .
I make this statement boldly and without fear of successful contradiction , knowing that I am asking for the indignant protests of countless housewives who have been cooking turkey superbly for years , by recipes handed down from the time of the Pilgrims .
Nevertheless , there is only one way to cook a turkey , and I am confident that I will be backed in this claim by anyone who has ever eaten turkey cooked according to the recipe devised by the late Morton Thompson .
In the minds of most people , Thompson is remembered chiefly as the author of a best seller , Not as a Stranger , which later became a motion picture .
Around my house , he is remembered  and revered  for his turkey recipe , which gives him hall - of - fame status and puts him in the same class as the man who invented the wheel , Plato , Galileo , Sir Isaac Newton , Eli Whitney , Flaubert , Babe Ruth , and Santa Claus .
Merely sitting here and thinking about Thompson 's turkey makes me wish I were cooking one now  and if I know me , I will be cooking one sometime within the next few days .
The thought of this wondrous culinary creation is not merely maddening , it is compelling .
It is also tiring .
Thompson 's turkey demands hard work , which ought to be divided among a number of people .
But it is worth it .
I have been cooking turkey Thompson 's way for about a dozen years .
Every one of the vast collection of acquaintances to whom I have served it has gasped , raved , and wound up pronouncing it the best ever .
There is no other turkey recipe that comes close to it  and this is odd , in a way , for the ordinary Thanksgiving or Christmas turkey , cooked according to any number of old reliable recipes , is a handsome sight at the table , and Thompson 's turkey is an absolute horror .
Even a poached turkey , removed white and dripping from a steaming pot looks better than Thompson's .
This turkey comes out of the oven looking as though someone had made a fearful mistake .
It is covered with a hard jet - black crust that seems to be a combination of coal and ashes .
When they first catch sight of it , guests wish they had gone elsewhere for dinner .
When they begin to eat it , they realize they never before have known turkey .
They refuse to leave until they have eaten every scrap of it .
Some ask to take the bones home to boil them up into a heartening soup .
Others stuff bits into pockets , handbags , or paper napkins .
The only trouble with Thompson 's turkey , from the cook 's point of view , is that there is seldom any left over .
The truth is that Thompson 's turkey is to turkey as Miss Monroe is to women , as Jones was to golf , as  well the reader may choose his own champions .
Thompson 's turkey , beneath that hard black shell , is browned in a variety of tones ranging from light tan to mahogany , and has a variety of tastes stretching from marvelous to unbelievable .
Now these are all strong claims .
But here is what one Thompson 's - turkey admirer said about it : " Several years ago I ate a turkey prepared and roasted by Morton Thompson .
I did n't eat the whole turkey , but that was n't my fault .
There were outsiders present who ganged up on me .
THOMPSON'S TURKEY RECIPE
The turkey must be a big one , not less than sixteen pounds and not more than twenty - two .
The bigger it is , the more economical it will be .
If it is eighteen pounds or more , it ought to be a hen ; a hen has a bigger , meatier breast .
Go to the market yourself to buy the turkey so as to give the butcher proper instructions .
Have him cut off the bird 's head to leave as much neck as possible .
Then ask him to peel back the skin and cut off the neck , with a cleaver , as close as possible to the shoulders .
This leaves a tube of neck skin that can be stuffed with any stuffing left over from the body cavity .
Some butchers clean away most of a turkey 's fat before handling the bird over .
If your man does that , protest .
You need the fat .
Rub the bird inside and out with salt and pepper and let it stand while you go ahead with other preliminaries .
Into a stewpan put the chopped gizzard , the neck , and the heart .
Cover with 4 or 5 cups water , and add a large bay leaf , a teaspoon of paprika , half a teaspoon of coriander , a clove of garlic , and salt to taste .
Put it over a low fire and let it simmer while you work on the dressing .
When I say work , I mean work .
Get a large bowl , and into it put an apple and an orange , both diced , a large can of crushed pineapple , the grated rind of half a lemon , and 3 tablespoons chopped preserved ginger .
You can get the latter at a Chinese store or at candy stores or specialty shops .
Then add , Thompson advised , a can of Chinese water chestnuts , drained .
I prefer to add two cans , and I chop the chestnuts in half before throwing them in .
Nearly every grocery store that sells chow mein dinners , or bamboo shoots , carries or will order water chestnuts .
Now get another bowl  and hold your breath .
Merely assembling all the ingredients is a time - consuming process .
In this bowl you put : 2 teaspoons hot dry mustard
2 teaspoons caraway seed
3 teaspoons celery seed
2 teaspoons poppy seed
2 1/2 teaspoons oregano
a well - crushed bay leaf
1 teaspoon black pepper
half a teaspoon of mace
4 tablespoons finely - chopped parsley ( preferably fresh , although dried parsley flakes will do )
4 or 5 crushed cloves of garlic
4 large chopped onions
4 cloves ( take off the heads and crush them )
half a teaspoon of tumeric
6 chopped stalks of celery
half a teaspoon of marjoram
half a teaspoon of summer savory
and 1 tablespoon poultry seasoning .
Then sprinkle in some salt  about a teaspoon , or more if you wish .
Those are Thompson 's ingredients .
To them I have added a sprinkle of monosodium glutamate which probably is n't necessary , but which in my view brings out all the flavors more fully .
The end is not yet in sight .
Take a third bowl .
Put in 3 packages of bread crumbs , preferably the kind you get at the bakery .
To the crumbs add 3/ 4 pound ground veal , 1 / 4 pound ground fresh pork , and 1 / 4 pound butter and all the fat ( render it first ) you have been able to take off the turkey .
Now begin mixing .
" Mix in each bowl the contents of each bowl , " Thompson wrote .
" When each bowl is well mixed , mix the three of them together .
And mix it well .
Mix it with your hands .
Mix it until your forearms and wrists ache .
Then mix it some more .
Now toss it so that it is n't any longer a doughy mass . "
Thus spoke Thompson .
Stuff the turkey and skewer it , tying the strings that go over and around the skewers .
Pack the remainder of the stuffing into the neck tube and tie it shut securely .
Turn the oven on full blast and let it get red hot .
Put the bird on the drip pan in your roaster or , better than that , breast down on a rack .
Then put it into the red - hot oven .
Right here you must work fast .
In a cup make a paste consisting of the yolks of 2 eggs , 1 teaspoon hot dry mustard , a clove of crushed garlic , 1 tablespoon onion juice , 2 pinches of cayenne pepper , 1 teaspoon lemon juice , and enough sifted flour to make it good and stiff .
When the bird in the oven is beginning to turn brown all over , take it out and turn the heat down to moderately slow ( 325° F ) .
The skin may possibly have begun to bubble or split and crack .
Ignore it .
Take a pastry brush and paint the bird all over with the paste .
Put it back in the oven .
A few minutes later , when the paste has dried and set , take the turkey out again .
Paint it again , every part of it you can touch .
Keep doing this , putting it in and taking it out and painting it , until the paste is all used up .
Now add a cup of cider to the simmering giblet stock .
At this point I put the liver in and keep the stewpan simmering , adding half cider and half water from time to time to replenish it .
This is your basting fluid .
The bird must be basted every fifteen minutes .
After it has cooked about an hour and a half , turn it on its stomach and let it cook in that position until the last fifteen minutes ; then put it on its back again .
That is , unless you are using a rack ; if you are , do n't turn it on its back until the last half hour .
The bird should cook for five and a half hours .
As it cooks , it will alarm you .
The paste will begin to turn black very early in the process , but do n't worry about it until the end .
Thompson wrote : " You will think , ' My God !
I have ruined it . '
Be calm .
Take a tweezer and pry loose the paste coating .
It will come off readily .
Beneath this burnt , harmless , now worthless shell the bird will be golden and dark brown , succulent , giddymaking with wild aromas , crisp and crunchable and crackling .
The meat beneath this crazing panorama of skin will be wet , juice will spurt from it in tiny fountains as high as the handle of the fork plunged into it ; the meat will be white , crammed with mocking flavor , delirious with things that rush over your palate and are drowned and gone as fast as you can swallow ; cut a little of it with a spoon , it will spread on bread as eagerly and readily as soft Wurst .
You do not have to be a carver to eat this turkey ; speak harshly to it and it will fall apart . "
Thompson did not describe the taste of the stuffing for the simple reason that it is indescribable .
It is full of a vast collection of elusive and exotic flavors , of fruit and of greens , bits of crispness ( the water chestnuts ) and of delicate meats  well , no wonder he made no attempt to write about it .
It has to be eaten to be understood .
There is no gravy required for this bird because it is in itself so moist  but if the family insists on gravy it may be made in the usual way , using the drippings from the pan .
The giblets from the basting mixture may be chopped up and added .
The beauty of Thompson 's turkey , by the way , is that in the unlikely event that any of it is left over , the meat somehow remains as moist for days as it is when it first comes from the oven .
So , that 's the turkey .
I urge anyone to try it .
Urge ?
I insist .
Anyone who does will have an extra prayer to offer on Thanksgiving Day , a prayer of thanks for the genius of a man named Morton Thompson , who died on July 7 , 1953 .
I do n't know if Thompson is in heaven or not , but if he is , this is his second visit .
I do n't know of any other place where he might have picked up the original inspiration for Thompson 's turkey Richard Gehman 's " The Haphazard Gourmet "
" Hence the recent trend in duo and quad - core processing ; rather than build faster processors , manufacturers place them in tandem to keep the heat levels tolerable while computing speeds shoot up . "
" If we view the exponential growth of computation in its proper perspective as one example of the pervasiveness of the exponential growth of information based technology , that is , as one example of many of the law of accelerating returns , then we can confidently predict its continuation . "

A recent LiveScience article ' Computers Faster Only for 75 More Years ' has indicated that new research conducted by two physicists have placed a speed limit on what 's attainable regardless of the size of the components .
Moore 's Lawhas often been touted as representing an infinite curve of progress , but this explanation clearly indicates that nothing proceeds indefinitely .
In addition , depending on technological developments in computer design and architecture , that limit may actually occur within 20 years according to Scott Aaronson , an assistant professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT .
One of the problems in today 's technology is the creation of heat before speed is achieved .
As a result many manufacturers have resorted to using duo and quad - core processors to improve performance .
However , one statement in the article bears some additional consideration .
This perception of computer speed is a common misunderstanding .
While there is an argument that can be made for parallel processing , the majority of applications in use do not employ parallel programming techniques and consequently can derive little or no benefit , individually , from duo or quad - core designs .
In other words , a sequence of instructions can not run across processors , so the " speed " improvements are due to allowing increased levels of multiprogramming , where more tasks can run simultaneously , rather than improving the speed of a single task .
" Speed " gains are achieved by reducing processor queuing and minimizing competition for access to the CPU .
In large systems this becomes more problematic because of the systems architecture is having to provide speed - matching capabilities for high level caches .
The cost of ensuring integrity and coherency between these cache memories creates a performance penalty whereby each additional processor decreases the total computing power available to applications .
As a result , there are limits in the degree of parallelism that can be exploited by applications as well .
While some problems lend themselves well to parallel programming techniques , many do not and may present another barrier to performance improvements .
In particular , a key problem is data movement since few applications are dependent only on computing speed , the ability to hold large amounts of data becomes a significant factor in considering systems architectures .
This presents a new hurdle as operating systems need to support and control larger and larger amounts of memory , newer algorithms and techniques that must be deployed to maintain scalability .
As new technologies and developments emerge we may see further increases in raw computing speed , but regardless of what occurs , we now know that it can't continue forever .
The unrestricted growth envisioned in many quarters has now been shown to be wrong .
Moore 's Law states that manufacturers could double computing speed every two ( 2 ) years by using smaller and smaller components .
It seems clear that accessing external devices over an I / O bus is unlikely to ever catch up to the processing speeds available in the core , so data access must utilize on - board memory to allow high speed processors to run without disrupting the instruction pipeline waiting for data to arrive .

A few days ago , Aman ( @tmm1 ) was complaining to me about a slow running process :
I want to see what is happening in userland and trace calls to extensions .
Why does n’t ltrace work for Ruby processes ?
I want to figure out which MySQL queries are causing my app to be slow .
It turns out that ltrace did not have support for libraries loaded with libdl .
This is a problem for languages like Ruby , Python , PHP , Perl , and others because in many cases extensions , libraries , and plugins for these languages are loaded by the VM using libdl .
This means that ltrace is somewhat useless for tracking down performance issues in dynamic languages .
A couple late nights of hacking and I managed to finagle libdl support in ltrace .
Since most people probably do n’t care about the technical details of how it was implemented , I ’ll start with showing how to use the patch I wrote and what sort of output you can expect .
This patch has made tracking down slow queries ( among other things ) really easy and I hope others will find this useful .
How to use ltrace :
After you ’ve applied my patch ( below ) and rebuilt ltrace , let ’s say you ’d like to trace MySQL queries and have ltrace tell you when the query was executed and how long it took .
There are two steps :
Give ltrace info so it can pretty print – echo “ int mysql_real_query ( addr , string , ulong ) ; ” > custom.conf
Tell ltrace you want to hear about mysql_real_query : ltrace -F custom.conf - ttTgx mysql_real_query -p < pid >
Here ’s what those arguments mean :
- F use a custom config file when pretty - printing ( default : /etc/ltrace.conf , add your stuff there to avoid - F if you wish ) .
use a custom config file when pretty - printing ( default : /etc/ltrace.conf , add your stuff there to avoid - F if you wish ) .
- tt print the time ( including microseconds ) when the call was executed
print the time ( including microseconds ) when the call was executed - T time the call and print how long it took
time the call and print how long it took -x tells ltrace the name of the function you care about
tells ltrace the name of the function you care about -g avoid placing breakpoints on all library calls except the ones you specify with -x .
This is optional , but it makes ltrace produce much less output and is a lot easier to read if you only care about your one function .

Raw patch ( NOTE : This should apply cleanly against ltrace 0.5.3 ) : ltrace .

How ltrace works normally
ltrace works by setting software breakpoints on entries in a process ’ Procedure Linkage Table ( PLT ) .
What is a software breakpoint
A software breakpoint is just a series of bytes ( 0xcc on the x86 and x86_64 ) that raise a debug interrupt ( interrupt 3 on the x86 and x86_64 ) .
When interrupt 3 is raised , the CPU executes a handler installed by the kernel .
The kernel then sends a signal to the process that generated the interrupt .
( Want to know more about how signals and interrupts work ?
Check out an earlier blog post : here )
What is a PLT and how does it work ?
A PLT is a table of absolute addresses to functions .
It is used because the link editor does n’t know where functions in shared objects will be located .
Instead , a table is created so that the program and the dynamic linker can work together to find and execute functions in shared objects .
I ’ve simplified the explanation a bit , but at a high level :
Program calls a function in a shared object , the link editor makes sure that the program jumps to a slot in the PLT .
The program sets some data up for the dynamic linker and then hands control over to it .
The dynamic linker looks at the info set up by the program and fills in the absolute address of the function that was called in the PLT .
Then the dynamic linker calls the function .
Subsequent calls to the same function jump to the same slot in the PLT , but every time after the first call the absolute address is already in the PLT ( because when the dynamic linker is invoked the first time , it fills in the absolute address in the PLT ) .
Since all calls to library functions occur via the PLT , ltrace sets breakpoints on each PLT entry in a program .
Why ltrace did n’t work with libdl loaded libraries
Libraries loaded with libdl are loaded at run time and functions ( and other symbols ) are accessed by querying the dynamic linker ( by calling dlsym ( ) ) .
The compiler and link editor do n’t know anything about libraries loaded this way ( they may not even exist ! ) and as such no PLT entries are created for them .
Since no PLT entries exist , ltrace can’t trace these functions .
What needed to be done to make ltrace libdl - aware
OK , so we understand the problem .
ltrace only sets breakpoints on PLT entries and libdl loaded libraries do n’t have PLT entries .
How can this be fixed ?
Luckily , the dynamic linker and ELF all work together to save your ass .
Executable and Linking Format ( ELF ) is a file format for executables , shared libraries , and more .
The file format can get a bit complicated , but all you really need to know is : ELF consists of different sections which hold different types of entries .
There is a section called . dynamic which has an entry named DT_DEBUG .
This entry stores the address of a debugging structure in the address space of the process .
In Linux , this struct has type struct r_debug .
How to use struct r_debug to win the game
The debug structure is updated by the dynamic linker at runtime to reflect the current state of shared object loading .
The structure contains 3 things that will help us in our quest :
state – the current state of the mapping change taking place ( begin add , begin delete , consistent ) brk – the address of a function internal to the dynamic linker that will be called when the linker maps , unmaps , or has completed mapping a shared object .
link map – Pointer to the start of a list of currently loaded objects .
This list is called the link map and is represented as a struct link_map in Linux .
Tie it all together and bring it home
To add support for libdl loaded libraries to ltrace , the steps are :
Find the address of the debug structure in the .dynamic section of the program .
Set a software breakpoint on brk .
When the dynamic linker updates the link map , it will trigger the software breakpoint .
When the breakpoint is triggered , check state in the debug structure .
If a new library has been added , walk the link map and figure out what was added .
Search the added library ’s symbol table for the symbols we care about .
Set a software breakpoints on whatever is found .
Steps 3 - 8 repeat .
That is n’t too hard all thanks to the dynamic linker providing a way for us to hook into its internal events .
Conclusion
Read the System V ABI for your CPU .
It is filled with insanely useful information that can help you be a better programmer .
Use the source .
A few times while hacking on this patch I looked through the source for GDB and glibc to help me figure out what was going on .
Understanding how things work at a low - level can help you build tools to solve your high - level problems .

LOS ANGELES
THE Sunset Tower Hotel , once a dilapidated dump but now a power - broker capital in Hollywood , recently hired a detective .
After all , a crime had been committed  at least in the eyes of its owner , Jeff Klein .
When US Weekly reported in August that Renée Zellweger and her new beau had guzzled Champagne in a Sunset Tower suite , Mr. Klein had a meltdown .
The detective was hired and , soon , a room - service waiter was fired .
“ He claimed he only told his mother , ” Mr. Klein says .
“ I did n’t care .
Gone ! ”
A New York society brat turned serious hotelier and restaurateur , Mr. Klein , 39 , bought the Sunset Tower in 2004 and has transformed it partly by throwing out the handbook of how entertainment industry haunts are managed , especially in Los Angeles .
A ban on media leaks about boldface business deals or celebrity frolicking is strictly enforced .
Mr. Klein is also very careful about curating a clientele .
Celebrities deemed out of place , including the rapper Sean Combs and Britney Spears , have been  gasp  turned away .
Hollywood hotels have long played a role in how the gears of show business grind .
They are where the moguls show off ( Harvey Weinstein conducting multiple meetings simultaneously at the Peninsula ) , where publicists monitor interviews ( the bar at the Four Seasons ) and where pretty young things are discovered poolside ( the plucking of Robert Evans decades ago from obscurity at the Beverly Hills Hotel ) .
President Obama rejected the suggestion that his basketball game with male congressional leaders was somehow sexist because no women were invited .
Obama defends all - male hoops game
President Barack Obama spoke candidly about the tensions in the early days of his marriage to First Lady Michelle Obama during an interview with NBC News ’ Savannah Guthrie Wednesday .
Today , he said , the Obama family is not a typical family because of the president ’s financial success and the cushions of living life in the White House .

“ Five years ago , six years ago , though , we were having a lot of negotiations , ” Obama said .
Michelle Obama , he said , wanted to know , if their daughters get sick , “ why is it that she 's the one who has to take time off of her job to go pick them up from school , as opposed to me ?
You know — the girls need to shop for clothes .
You know ?
Why is it that it's her burden , ” the president said .
“ The truth is , ” Obama said , that Michelle “ still had to make sacrifices … of the sort that I did n’t have to make . ”
Men , he said , “ are still a little obtuse about this stuff . ”
And he said men “ need to be knocked across the head every once in awhile ” to see the female perspective , and be sure everyone in the family is treated fairly .
Obama called his wife “ my most important advisor , ” and said that “ in terms of broad strokes advice , what ordinary people are going through — she is somebody who I think is deeply attuned to it .
She 's somebody who grew up in a working class family .
She understands the incredible difficulties of work / family balance .
Because she had to go through it .
Up until we got to — to the White House — she was working .
Raising two small children .
A husband who was also working , and was away a lot . ”
Obama also rejected the suggestion that his basketball game with male congressional leaders was somehow sexist because no women were invited .
“ I think this is bunk , ” Obama said .
He explained that he invited the regular House of Representatives pick - up basketball players .
“ I do n't know if there are women who — were Members of Congress who play basketball on a regular basis , ” Obama said .
“ I do n't think there are .
You know , I do n't think sends any kind of message or signal whatsoever . ”
On that point , the president seemed to differ from his own press secretary , who took a different tack when asked about the basketball game at the White House briefing .
“ I would say that the point is well taken , ’ said Robert Gibbs .
“ The President obviously is someone who , as the father of two young daughters , has an avid interest in their competing against anybody on the playing field .
The President has certainly played basketball and other sports with women in the past , and I anticipate he 'll do so in the future . ”

Mrs Merkel hopes for a change of partner Germans are voting in a keenly - watched national election which could shape the direction of Europe 's largest economy .
Chancellor Angela Merkel 's conservatives are favourite to win and deliver her a second term in office .
But she hopes to win by a big enough margin to be able to ditch her Social Democrat coalition partners and work with the more reform - minded FDP .
A BBC correspondent says there is no great appetite for such a coalition and that people prefer the status quo .
Security is tight after al - Qaeda warned Germany over its Afghan war role .
Mrs Merkel 's main rival in Sunday 's vote is the leader of the Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) and current foreign minister , Frank - Walter Steinmeier .
The SPD have shared power with Mrs Merkel 's Christian Democrat alliance ( CDU / CSU ) in an awkward grand coalition since the last elections in 2005 .
' Good job '
It was difficult to decide who to vote for , but I know who I do n't want in government , so that helped me

Possible German coalitions
In pictures : German elections Keeping economy on the road
The first exit polls will appear when polls close at 1800 local time ( 1600 GMT ) , but the full outcome may not become clear for several hours .
Election officials said turnout by 1400 was considerably down on the last elections - 36.1 % compared with 41.9 % at the same stage in 2005 .
The BBC's Jonny Dymond in Berlin says there has been a steady stream of voters at one polling station , as people enjoyed clear skies and brilliant sunshine .
Voters were divided about the possible outcome .
" I hope we get a different coalition .
To be honest , I am currently unhappy with the way things are and hope that we end up with a black - yellow [ CDU / CSU and FDP ] government , " one woman told the BBC .
" A red-red coalition [ SPD and Left Party ] would be an absolute catastrophe , in my opinion . "
Even though the bigger parties are very similar , I would rather vote for a party that can at least make a difference in power and have a chance of achieving something
Livia Giesa , Berlin
Voters ' voices Katrin Rivier , a 49 - year - old Berlin nurse , had other priorities .
" It was difficult to decide who to vote for , but I know who I do n't want in government , so that helped me , " Reuters news agency quoted her as saying .
" I think it will be a very tight race today but I 'm hoping we do n't get a centre - right coalition . "
Another voter told the BBC the status quo would remain .
" The possibility of a change of government is not that big , and I am assuming that we will end up with the same government that we had before the election , " he said .
Narrowing lead
In an interview for the Sunday newspaper Bild am Sonntag , Mrs Merkel said she was " optimistic " of forming an alliance with the FDP .
As he cast his vote , Mr Steinmeier was also upbeat .
" I am very confident we will have a strong SPD .
A strong SPD that will be able to lead the government from the top this time , " he told reporters .
Frank - Walter Steinmeier ( centre ) has said the race is still wide open Opinion polls suggest Mrs Merkel 's lead has narrowed in recent weeks , though our correspondent says there is little doubt that she will be returned as leader of the largest party and as chancellor .
But it is unclear whether she will be able to team up with the small FDP to create a coalition that could push through economic reforms .
Few people have a bad word to say about her , our correspondent adds , and she has won plaudits for her steady leadership during the economic downturn .
But he says most people he has spoken to seem happy with the current grand coalition , and if the polls are to be believed there will be a nail - biting finish to the day .
One in four voters were still said to be undecided on the eve of the vote .
The campaign has been overshadowed by security concerns following a series of al - Qaeda messages warning Germany to pull some 4,200 troops out of Afghanistan .
All flights have been banned over the traditional Oktoberfest in Munich , and armed police are guarding airports , train stations and city centres across the country .

The European Commission has issued a warning to the Spanish government that any plan to disconnect file - sharers from the Internet without involving a judge would create conflict with the EU .
This statement could also throw the three - strikes plans of the UK government and the Irish ISP Eircom into serious doubt .
In file - sharing terms , Spain currently has among the most relaxed laws of leading European countries .
The country is believed to have some of the highest rates of online sharing of music and movies and currently it is perfectly legal , providing no money is made directly from infringement , to run BitTorrent and eDonkey sites .
As the copyright industries ramp up their lobbying , the government is finding it more and more difficult to maintain their current position , and is currently examining new ways to deal with illicit file - sharing .
At the opening day of a conference bringing together leaders of the telecommunications industry , European Commissioner for Information Society and Media , Vivane Reding , said that if the Spanish government implements measures to disconnect copyright infringers from the Internet without the oversight of a judge , it risks coming into conflict with the EU .
“ Spanish measures that allow for the disruption of Internet access without a fair hearing before a judge , are certain to clash with the European Union , ” she told the Telecommunications Market Commission ( CMT ) conference in Barcelona yesterday .
Criticizing France ’s Hadopi legislation , Reding stressed that repressing people would not solve the problems of Internet piracy , noting that disconnections may even run counter to the “ rights and freedoms which have become part of Europe ’s values since the French Revolution . ”
Furthermore , the “ fundamental freedoms ” of EU citizens which Reding insists forbids countries from disconnecting alleged file - sharers without a procedure involving a judge , also applies to Internet service providers .
This is of particular interest to customers of Ireland ’s largest ISP , Eircom .
Earlier this year IRMA – which controls 90 % of Ireland ’s recorded music and represents the likes of EMI , Sony , Universal and Warner – reached a private agreement with the ISP to implement a 3 strikes deal for alleged pirates , with IRMA discontinuing legal action against it in return .
The arrangement is an entirely private one , with no judicial oversight , which will likely bring it into conflict with the EU .
IRMA also took legal action against BT , Ireland ’s largest ISP , and the country ’s largest cable operator , UPC Ireland , to force them to follow suit .
However , last week IRMA discontinued its lawsuit against BT Ireland , as the ISP has already transferred its Internet customers to Vodafone .
It is unclear if IRMA will now go after Vodafone , but the music group says it will continue to pursue UPC .
In addition , it will be interesting to see how the statement by the European Commission affects the Digital Economy Bill that was presented in the UK last week .
The proposed legislation will also call for a disconnection of repeated copyright infringers , a measure that ’s proving unpopular among the public .
Thousands of people have already petitioned against the new bill .

Dr. Christopher Thomas Thompson said he never intended to hurt a pair of cyclists who hit the back of his car on the Fourth of July 2008 .
He told a court Wednesday that he stopped to try to take a picture of the riders after a verbal confrontation , and said he wakes up every night thinking about the incident that led to him being charged with assault with a deadly weapon .
“ I ’m not happy anyone suffered injuries , ” Thompson told defense attorney Peter Swarth in Los Angeles Superior Court .
He denied telling a police officer that he meant to teach the injured cyclists a lesson .
Thompson testified Wednesday about the incident on the Fourth involving cyclists Ron Peterson and Christian Stoehr .
He also talked about an earlier incident on the same road , involving Patrick Watson and Josh Crosby .
He denied that he was involved with yet another incident , with cyclist Patrick Early , earlier that year .
In the Peterson / Stoehr incident and the Watson / Crosby incident , Thompson testified that he stopped after passing the cyclists to get their names or take a photo of them so he could file a complaint with police .
Peterson went through the rear window of Thompson ’s Infiniti sedan when Thompson stopped ; Stoehr says he slammed into the rear of the car and flew over the top of it .
Watson says he had to bunnyhop over a curb to avoid hitting the car when it stopped .
Swarth asked Thompson his feelings about cyclists in general .
“ I have no problem with cyclists .
I do n’t like to be behind them for safety reasons , ” he said .
Swarth asked him to elaborate .
Thompson went on to relate briefly the story of his childhood friend Bobby , who was run over a car , from behind , when Thompson was 14 .
Thompson was visibly shaken as he related the story and appeared near tears .
‘ Tens of thousands of times ’
The incidents were on Mandeville Canyon Road , where Thompson lives .
Swarth asked Thompson a number of questions about the road , including its elevation gain , distance , how it winds , points where it narrows and more .
Thompson testified he had driven the road “ tens of thousands ” of times .
Thompson said the former Robert Taylor Ranch — the site of the Peterson / Stoehr incident — is a point he uses to pass cyclists as he drives both up and down the canyon , as it is the one stretch of road on which you have a clear line of sight both up and down the canyon .
Thompson said he and other Mandeville Canyon residents had wanted to find a way to identify law - breaking cyclists .
It was the suggestion of a police officer to a friend that stuck with Thompson : take a photograph .
“ It bothered me that we were doing what I thought was police work , ” said Thompson .
The Watson / Crosby incident
Concerning the incident with Patrick Watson and Josh Crosby , Thompson ’s version of events is that he honked once , lightly , with the heel of his hand .
As he passed the pair , he said , he lowered his passenger side window and told the riders , “ single file . ”
The riders “ never changed position , ” he said .
“ I got back an obscene gesture .
They shot me the shaft .
They were both talking ; I ’m not sure which said it , but one said , ‘ Fuck you , asshole . ’ ”
Swarth asked how he felt about what happened .
“ I was frustrated .
I was just trying to create a safe environment , ” Thompson said .
“ I stopped in a normal fashion .
I wanted to get their names , ” he said .
“ After I stopped , I put the car in park .
They both stopped .
The rider on the left struck my car one time .
He struck my car a second time .
He struck my car three times . ”
“ How did you feel ? ” Swarth asked .
“ I was frightened .
They were acting crazy so I decided I needed to leave , ” Thompson recounted .
“ They had endangered themselves as well as me . ”
The Patrick Early incident
Although Thompson was not charged with anything related to cyclist Patrick Early ’s confrontation with a driver on Mandeville Canyon Road during the winter of 2007 - 2008 , prosecutors had Early testify to establish a pattern of behavior .
Early said he was passed closely and at speed as he was climbing the canyon , and identified the driver as Thompson from a police line - up .
Early , who works in the auto industry , said he could identify Thompson ’s year and model of car .
Following a long analysis of work and travel dates between the end of December and mid-January , Swarth asked Thompson , “ Did you have that confrontation with Patrick Early ? ”
“ I simply was n’t there , ” he said .
“ No . ”
The Fourth of July incident
Moving to the July 4 , 2008 , incident Swarth asked how Thompson drove to get down the canyon at the speed limit .
Could he apply the accelerator in descending the canyon ?
“ No , ” said Thompson .
“ It ’s a lot of coast - brake - coast - brake . ”
“ There were three bikes riding three across .
As I got closer I tapped on the horn with the heel of my hand .
The center rider turned around .
Again , I honked with the heel of my hand .
The left rider turned around and shot me the shaft .
All I could do is think , ‘ Here we go again , ’ ” Thompson said .
“ Were you in a rush ? ” Swarth asked .
“ No , not at all , ” said Thompson .
“ Bicycles are inherently dangerous , ” Thompson asserted , “ because of their instability and unpredictability .
The last thing I want is to be behind a bicycle because of their ability to fall off or hit a pothole or child because that puts them under my wheels . ”
“ I made an arc - like pass , ” he said .
“ I said three words , ‘ single file please . ’
I accelerated as hard as I could .
I heard a hail of ‘ fuck you , asshole , ’ from all three . ”
“ I was coming up to a turn .
I decided I need to stop and see if I can get a picture .
About three seconds after passing I stopped , took my seatbelt off and put the car in park , ” he said .
“ I started to open the door .
That ’s when one of the riders hit the back of my car . ”
Once Officer Rodriguez of the LAPD arrived , Thompson testified , “ He seemed distracted .
He kept looking up the canyon . ”
Swarth asked , “ Did you say you wanted to teach them a lesson ? ”
“ No , ” said Thompson .
“ Did you say , ‘ They flipped me off ? ”
“ No , repeated Thompson .
“ I say , ‘ Shoot me the shaft . ’ ”
Swarth brought up the fact that Thompson told a 911 operator — in a conversation that was recorded and played in court earlier in the trial — that Peterson ’s and Stoehr ’s injuries were n’t serious .
Thompson explained how emergency room cases are organized into two broad classes , those that are in life - threatening danger , and those that are not .
Peterson and Stoehr had injuries that were unlikely to threaten their lives , Thompson said , and therefore were not “ serious . ”
Thompson said that even though Peterson would not allow him to treat him , Thompson still assessed the injured cyclist according to emergency medicine ’s “ ABCs ” — airway , breathing and circulation .
He determined that Peterson and Stoehr had no serious issues with their airways , breathing or circulation .
Thompson said the injuries , nevertheless , troubled him .
“ I wake up every night at 4:00 a.m. thinking about this incident .
I injured people and I ’ll never get over that .
Brief cross-examination
Deputy District Attorney Mary Stone ’s cross-examination was relatively brief and she moved to the events of July 4 , 2008 , fairly quickly .
Stone asked Thompson , “ You pulled in front and slammed on your brakes . ”
“ I did not slam on my brakes , ” Thompson responded .
Stone then played the 911 tape again in which Thompson clearly says to the operator , “ I slammed on my brakes . ”
Stone went through Officer Rodriguez ’s notes on Thompson ’s statement to him at the scene , line by line .
“ Did you say , ‘ I just live up the road ? ’ ”
“ Yes , ” said Thompson .
“ Did you say , ‘ I was driving to go to work ? ’ ”
“ Yes , ” said Thompson .
“ Did you say , ‘ The bikers were in front of me , three across ? ’ ”
“ Yes , ” said Thompson .
“ Did you say , ‘ I honked my horn and yelled ‘ ride single file ? ’ ”
“ Yes , ” said Thompson .
“ Did you say , ‘ The bicyclists flipped me off and yelled back ? ’ ”
“ Yes , well , I said , ‘ They shot me the shaft , ’ that ’s just what I say , ” said Thompson .
“ Did you say , ‘ I passed them up and stopped in front to teach them a lesson ? ’ ”
“ No , ” said Thompson .
“ Did you say , ‘ I ’m tired of them ? ’ ”
“ No , ” said Thompson .
“ Did you say , ‘ I ’ve lived here for years and they always ride like this ? ’ ”
“ Yes , ” said Thompson .
Closing arguments will take place beginning at 10:30 a.m. Thursday at the Airport Courthouse .
The jury is expected to get the case in the afternoon .
Lehman declared bankruptcy in the early hours of 15 September 2008 A year after Lehman Brothers collapsed , a think tank has warned the lessons of the crisis have not been learned .
The Institute for Public Policy Research ( IPPR ) says the rapid return to the City 's bonus culture shows that real reform has been " very limited " .
The warnings echoed a speech by US President Barack Obama , who warned of complacency in the banking sector .
Also , UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown said that there was " unfinished business " with banks .
Bailouts Lehman Brothers , once the fourth - largest US investment bank , filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the early hours of 15 September 2008 .
LIVE DEBATE : ONE YEAR ON BBC's Lucy Hockings at London 's City Hall Sir Howard Davies , the former head of the city regulator the Financial Services Authority , has just told me that bankers are influenced by deeds , not actions .
They are going to expect to be bailed out again unless central banks are tougher on capital and tougher on regulation .
We 'll be watching the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh to see if international regulation can be tightened .
Follow the debate Governments around the world subsequently had to pump trillions into their financial systems through bank bail - outs , central bank actions and huge stimulus plans to save their economies from collapse .
BBC business editor Robert Peston said that Lehman 's collapse had huge repercussions on the psyche of investors and the scale of the financial crisis .
" The significance of Lehman Brothers was in the massive panic that it caused in the marketplace , where funds were withdrawn from any bank anywhere in the world that was perceived as remotely vulnerable , " Robert Peston said .
" That was the moment people thought , crikey , we 're on the verge of a depression . "
Most economists now think the world has avoided a second Great Depression , that some thought possible a year ago .
' Alarm bells '

But there is now concern that as the banks start to recover , they have not taken the necessary steps to prevent a repeat of the crisis .
" Alarm bells should be ringing with the early signs of a ' back to business ' attitude in the City and little evidence that policymakers are taking measures to ensure the next economic recovery is better balanced than the last one , " said Tony Dolphin , senior economist at the IPPR .
The report warned that unless urgent action was taken , the banking crisis might not be the last of its type .
On Monday , President Obama issued a warning to banks that were ignoring the lessons of the financial crisis .
" We will not go back to the days of reckless behaviour and unchecked excess at the heart of this crisis , " he said .
He called on Wall Street to support " the most ambitious overhaul of the financial system since the Great Depression " .
It has so far met with opposition in the banking industry .
' Important changes ' Speaking on the BBC World News channel , John Lipsky , deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund , defended the international response to the crisis , saying " some fundamental changes " had already been made or were underway .
BBC AFTERSHOCK SEASON
The BBC reports on the first anniversary of the credit crunch across radio , TV , and online .

Track the $ 11tn of bailout spending and see what it means for the taxpayers who funded it
Listen to WS radio on the crisis Full coverage of Aftershock series " We have made important changes in creating crisis prevention instruments that have a chance of success in a world of cross - border finance , " he said .
" In addition , the international community has come together to provide substantial new resources for the fund . "
As for the financial industry itself , Bob Diamond , the chief executive of Barclays Capital , told the BBC he thought lessons had been learnt .
" We 've made mistakes .
The important thing is to learn from those mistakes and change the way we do things , " said Mr Diamond , whose bank bought Lehman Brothers ' US operations out of bankruptcy .
" In future , banks will be operating with more equity , with less leverage , with bigger buffers of liquidity . "
The IMF 's Mr Lipsky , however , said there was still some way to go .
" It remains to be seen if the global community can carry through all the changes [ to regulation and supervision ] that are recognised as necessary , but will need political determination to succeed . "
G20 ahead UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he was determined that world leaders meeting in Pittsburgh next week would " complete the unfinished business " of cleaning up banks - including establishing rules on bonuses .
The Group of 20 ( G20 ) richest nations will meet to discuss the state of the global economy .
Bankers ' bonuses - which have been blamed for encouraging risk - taking and prompting the acts that caused the financial crisis - are expected to be one of the most prominent issues .
The G20 has agreed that bonuses should be deferred in order to reward long - term success rather than short - term risk - taking , but have so far opposed mandatory caps on banker compensation .
" At the G20 meeting , the big concept seems to be executive salaries , " said Professor Robert Shiller from Yale University .
" That 's a politically popular movement .
But it 's not central to making the system work better .
" There 's a lot of boring stuff that has to be done , " he added .

In a paper evaluated by f1000 Medicine , six studies tested relationships between reminders of money , social exclusion and physical pain .
In ' The symbolic power of money : reminders of money alter social distress and physical pain ' published in the journal Psychological Science , Xinyue Zhou , Kathleen Vohs and Roy Baumeister explored how money could reduce a person 's feeling of pain and also negate their need for social popularity .
Harriet de Wit , Faculty Member for f1000 Medicine , said : " This research extends our understanding of relationships between social pain and physical pain , and remarkably , shows how acquired symbolic value of money , perhaps because of associations with power or control , can influence responses to both emotional and physical pain . "
She also noted : " These findings have great importance for a social system such as ours that is characterized by wide disparities in financial wellbeing . "
Zhou , Vohs and Baumeister determined that interpersonal rejection and physical pain caused desire for money to increase .
They said : " Money can possibly substitute for social acceptance in conferring the ability to obtain benefits from the social system .
Moreover , past work has suggested that responses to physical pain and social distress share common underlying mechanisms . "
" Handling money ( compared with handling paper ) reduced distress over social exclusion and diminished the physical pain of immersion in hot water .
Being reminded of having spent money , however , intensified both social distress and physical pain , " the authors said .

It 's so easy to miss the little things in life .
Those things that brighten up our day but are taken for granted and never really noticed outside of our subconscious .
Like Sunny days or calls from a loved one or the fact that your parents will finally be dead one day .
RPGs , much like life , are full of these little extra touches that enrich any experience , yet they 're truly taken for granted and never given the appreciation they deserve .
Even worse , a great many RPGs shun them altogether , despite how easy they are to include and how big a difference they can make , despite their subtlety .
Obviously , we can not let that stand .
Good roleplaying games have been throwing in quiet - yet - wonderful touches without applause for far too long , and it 's about time we took notice of the little things .
Read on as we isolate and appreciate the little things that every RPG should have .
Enemies that telegraph when their HP is low :
It 's amazing that more RPGs do n't do this .
In nearly every roleplaying game , your own characters will start to wilt and pant when their HP reaches critical levels .
The enemies get to know who is weakest and sometimes will capitalize on that , but why are n't players awarded the same advantage ?
In the RPGs that do include enemy HP telegraphing , there can be few things more satisfying than finally seeing a hard - fought boss begin to sag and indicate that he 's about to give up the ghost .
That 's when you know to go on an all - out attack , showing no mercy and finishing the job .
Seeing an enemy droop lets you know to save your precious magical spells for a more healthy foe .
MP does n't grow on trees , and it 's annoying to have to waste a powerful attack on something that could be killed with a single sword strike , or use a potion just moments before the fight ends .
HP telegraphing also makes for a terrific crescendo to a battle , that final push for victory when you see the enemy falter .
Much more exciting and conclusive than an enemy simply disappearing after giving no indication that the fight 's nearly over .
This is definitely something more RPGs should include .
The fact that a significant number of them do n't is borderline criminal .
Equipped weapons and armor visible on characters :
Again , this is something I would expect from far more RPGs .
It can be somewhat common to see equipped weapons visible on a character , but sometimes RPGs do n't even bother to do that , and it makes me sick .
What I really want , however , are more games that render everything you put on your characters ' bodies .
I want to see that Mythril Helmet , and if my character has put some glasses on , the game should show me what they look like .
Lost Odyssey met us halfway , by allowing accessories to appear .
That meant that if Kaim was wearing glasses or earrings , they would appear .
Final Fantasy : Crystal Chronicles will kit our characters in full armor that reflects what they 're wearing .
It 's also very common for Western RPGs like Elder Scrolls or Fable to render full armor sets , but JRPGs simply do n't do them .
I think they should .
It 's silly to put a full suit of armor on a character and then see him fight in only a pair of ludicrously oversized pants .
Bestiaries :
RPGs are full of varied and strange enemies , usually provided without any kind of explanation simply because the game needed combat and the developers did n't feel like contextualizing it .
Random battles against bizarre monsters are a staple of the RPG genre , but it 's rare that you 'll ever find anything out about the creatures you face , outside of how many times you have to hit it before it dies .
Games that provide a bestiary with interesting information on the monsters encountered have an extra flavor to them , and allow these random creatures a sense to have a sense of belonging in the world .
More importantly , I simply find that bestiaries are great fun simply to read .
Flipping through the summaries of various creatures in Shadow Hearts or Castlevania is something I find enjoyable , and it's a shame that so many games neglect to include listings and biographies of the various opponents defeated throughout the course of an adventure .
Why is a Hedgehog Pie called a Hedgehog Pie ?
Why is is giant worm boss hiding in the sand and why do I have to fight it without any explanation ?
I want to know these things , and if the game wo n't tell me while I 'm fighting them , at least include a paragraph of explanatory text in a menu somewhere so that I can find out afterward .
Besides which , it 's fun to read up on an interesting game world and soak in the flare .
Useful merchant screens :
How many times have you been playing an RPG and started doing equipment shopping , only to find out that the store 's menu system sucks ?
You 're not given a clear comparison between your equipped items and the items you want to buy , so you 're not sure which items are better .
Even more annoying , you 're not given the option the equip the new items after purchase , meaning you have to exit the store , open the main menu , navigate to the equipment screen and then equip from there .
While somewhat uncommon these days , there are still games that release with awkward , hard - to - read merchant screens that do n't allow for automatic equipping , and such things have to stop .
A clear , clean , easily decipherable merchant screen that will let you change equipment while shopping makes each trip to the store much more pleasant and enjoyable , and ensures that customers will come back for more .
That bit when the party disbands in a town :
After battling through a dungeon , defeating a boss and traversing the world map , you come across a brand new city , the biggest city of the game so far .
Excitement !
When you enter the city , you trigger the obligatory scene where the characters react to the new sights and sounds .
The party decided to disband and explore the town on their own , leaving you to your own devices .
Time to look around .
As you walk about town , you 'll notice members of your party simply going off and doing their own thing .
One character may be getting into an argument with a storekeeper .
Another may have found some kids and decided to join in their game .
You get to see these characters you 've fought with in a more peaceful and natural environment , and you get to see what they do in their down time and , by extension , learn far more about them as a rounded and three - dimensional character .
Getting know and care about characters should be an important part of any RPG , and there 's no better way to foster investment into a character than to see them simply being themselves .
These moments where you find your allies scattered about a city doing their own thing is a terrific opportunity for the player to get to know who they 're questing with .
RPGs should always try and include these moments .
" Story so far " summaries :
An RPG is a long and winding road .
Lots of things happen , and sometimes it can be such a lengthy affair that a considerable break from playing is needed .
When a player returns from that break , he does n't want to be stuck trying to remember what happened when he left off , or having no idea where next to go in a world 's vast map .
A smart RPG will make sure to keep a log of your adventure , so that you can jump right back into the action after a brief refresher course .
It can be in the form of a journal or diary written by the player character , it can be a Metal Gear Solid - esque description of the story so far , or it can simply be a clearly labeled objective message telling you exactly what needs to be done next .
In a game with a sprawling world and a huge story , it 's important to make sure a player does n't get lost .
HP & MP restoration with level increases :
It does n't happen in every RPG , but when it does happen , it 's always nice .
Notable games would be Pokémon , or any number of Western RPGs such as Sacred 2 or Oblivion .
It 's incredibly useful to have a level increase restore one 's health , especially when it comes to saving precious potions or curative spells .
There 's nothing quite like being near death , yet incredibly close to leveling up , and fighting on just long enough to get that last batch of XP and get a free restoration .
These are the kind of things that add very little to the game on the surface , yet bring just an extra dash of brilliance to keep things interesting .
Who needs those expensive Inns when you can work for your full health bar ?
Leveling up is satisfying in its own right , but throwing HP and MP at the player as well just makes it feel like so much more of a treat .
Status spells that actually WORK :
This is the biggie .
Everybody knows about status spells : Poison , Sleep , Frog , etcetera .
The kind of spells that do n't deal direct damage to an enemy , but have all sorts of unique , interesting and potentially powerful effects .
In theory , these are the kind of spells a brilliant tactician or long - haul player should be permanently stocking in their deck of cards .
In practice , however , these spells are nearly always worthless .
What happens in reality is that every boss in the game will be immune to the effects of status spells .
They can't be poisoned , put to sleep , confused or otherwise manipulated .
What 's worse , a fair few regular enemies will also shirk off these spells as if they 're nothing .
Naturally , however , if an enemy possesses the exact same spell , it 'll work on YOU every bloody time .
It 's not fair , and it 's not right .
Of course , many games would be too easy if these spells worked all the time , but there has to be a compromise .
Maybe a Sleep spell will work on a boss , but only for a turn or two .
Maybe the Poison damage is n't very much against strong enemies .
Either way , it 's upsetting to have such great and disruptive magic while lacking the ability to use it effectively .
Games like Pokémon actually use status attacks quite expertly , with huge rewards in store for those willing to use them , and tactical RPGs tend to allow for status ailments in a much more lenient fashion .
However , many other RPGs over the years have crammed their games with useless spells that could have been incredibly brilliant .
Of course , when you actually manage to put an enemy to Sleep , you are one happy gamer .
And that 's what these little treats should be about .
Making gamers happy .
So take heed to this list , RPG developers of the world .
We demand the little things , and we demand them now !

Chancellor Alistair Darling has confirmed that Lloyds , RBS and Northern Rock will be broken up and parts sold to new entrants to the banking sector .
He said there could be three new High Street banks in the UK over the next three to four years as a result .
But the chancellor said he would only sell parts of the banks when " the time is right " , to ensure taxpayers get their money back .
There is speculation that buyers might include Tesco and Virgin .
' Clean sheet '
In order to boost competition , the banks ' assets will only be sold to new entrants to the UK banking market and not to existing financial institutions .
ANALYSIS Joe Lynam , BBC business correspondent
As part of the stipulations of EU state aid rules , the UK was always facing the prospect of having to sell off at least parts of those banks which it bailed out last year .
Now it looks as if that sell off process is to begin in earnest .
Though the Chancellor says he has not yet decided which brands are to be hived off , RBS , Northern Rock and Lloyds Banking Group ( LBG ) will now be broken up in some form .
This means that individual brands within those banks , such as Cheltenham & Gloucester and the TSB ( LBG ) , as well as Williams and Glyn ( RBS ) , could be sold off .
The unanswered question now is whether the Treasury jumped or was about to be pushed by Brussels .
Fresh bank rules come into force Sell - off jigsaw becomes clearer Send us your comments
The new banks will be standard retail operations concentrating on deposits and mortgages .
Mr Darling said this was the best way to ensure " proper competition and choice " .
He said having just " half a dozen big providers was not acceptable " .
The new entrants would " have a clean sheet to come in and do things differently " , he added .
The chancellor also said the government would be splitting up Northern Rock into two parts by the end of the year , with a view to selling off one part within the next three to four years .
The government had already said it wants to sell off the part of Northern Rock that holds savers ' money , carries out new lending and holds some existing mortgages .
He also said the government was keen to divest some of its holdings in RBS and Lloyds .
The government currently holds a 70 % stake in RBS and a 43 % stake in Lloyds after last October 's bail - outs .
' Unnecessary distraction ' BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam says the latest move represents " a gilt - edged opportunity for non-UK retail banks , especially from the US , to get a firm foothold in the highly profitable British banking market for as low a price as could be imagined a few years ago " .
The Conservatives said the break up of the state - owned banks had already been " well trailed " .
A spokesman added : " We have called for more competition in banking , and for government stakes to be used to strategic effect to that end . "
The Lib Dems Treasury spokesman Vince Cable welcomed more competition in the banking sector but said there should be no urgency to the sales .
" We need to be careful that when these split - ups occur , the prime cuts are not offered to private investors and the scraps left to taxpayers , " he said .
There were also concerns expressed about the timing of the sell - off .
Treasury select committee chairman John McFall MP said the assets should not be sold off for less than their market value .
" It is important to ensure that we get taxpayer return for this bail - out .
I 'm relaxed about the timescale .
I do not want to sell off [ bank assets ] at a cheap price , I do n't want a fire sale , " he told the BBC .
Peter McNamara , former head of personal banking at Lloyds TSB and managing director of the Alliance and Leicester , said that restructuring the banks in the current climate could in fact prove counter productive .
" Half the banks in the UK are suddenly going to be reorganised when you could argue their day job is to support industry and consumers during the recession .
Without that support , we are more likely to have a steeper rise in unemployment , " he said .
The government needs permission to break - up the banks from European competition commissioner Neelie Kroes .
Last week , the EU approved the plans for Northern Rock to be split in two .

German farmers are among those pressing for more EU price support
The EU has announced extra aid for dairy farmers after protests in several countries over a slump in milk prices .
The European Commission says it will change EU state aid rules to let member states pay each farmer up to 15,000 euros ( £ 13,000 ) in temporary aid .
The Commission says it expects to spend an extra 600 m euros this year on market measures to support dairy farmers .
In Belgium on Wednesday angry farmers dumped three million litres ( 660,000 gallons ) of milk on fields .
French and German farmers have also dumped milk and blocked deliveries in frustration at the low prices for dairy produce .
Farmers say they want the EU to freeze planned increases in production quotas , because boosting the supply on the market lowers prices further .
The EU plans to phase out milk quotas by 2015 and to limit market intervention , with a view to scrapping it in the long term .
The Commission plans to extend EU special purchases of butter and skimmed milk powder to at least February next year , to help farmers .
The European Parliament has backed the plan , but wants it to include cheese too .
These EU market interventions help support dairy prices .
Planes , trains and automobiles ?
How about planes , ferries and Rockets .
The Bay Bridge closed down on Tuesday due to a snapped cable , cutting off the Houston Rockets ' route from their hotel in San Francisco to Oakland for Wednesday 's game against the Golden State Warriors .
The team found out about the problem after its loss to the Blazers in Portland on Tuesday night .
The Rockets flew to San Francisco and then weighed their options .
" We looked at a lot of things and decided , ' We 're taking a ferry , ' " Rockets athletic trainer and vice president of basketball operations Keith Jones said , according to the Houston Chronicle .
Aaron Brooks even snapped some photos of his teammates on the 20 - minute trip across San Francisco Bay .
" Make a memory , " he said with a smile .
" I feel like I 'm part of the city .
Now I feel like I 'm from San Francisco and Oakland .
" This had to be a first .
We always see the boats .
It was different .
I never imagined being in the NBA I 'd take a ferry to a game .
It was nice , scenic .
We had a great tour guide in [ Bay Area native ] Chuck [ Hayes ] -- even though Chuck does n't know where the Golden Gate Bridge is .
It was still cool nevertheless . "
Some riders thought the Rockets were plainclothes police officers , while others quickly figured out they were a basketball team .
This is a first as far as the Warriors or Rockets can remember .
The NBA requires teams to take buses to games due to security concerns .
With congestion in the Bay Area due to the bridge closure , taking a bus from the hotel to the game did n't look like a good option .
The Rockets then looked at taking public transportation .
" [ The police ] said that would be really tough , " Jones said , according to the Chronicle .
" It would be really crowded with a lot of pushing and shoving , and a security issue with autographs .
And then we'd have to walk from the Coliseum station to the arena . "
Golden State coach Don Nelson was amused .
" Oh did they ? " he asked when told of the Rockets ' mode of transportation .
" I have n't [ done that ] .
That 's a first .
I 've taken trains . "
" This is the first ferry ride I 've ever taken , " Houston coach Rick Adelman said .
" It was n't bad , beautiful day . "
He said the only travel experience quite this crazy came during his playing days when he flew from Portland to Buffalo and played the same night .
Adelman said he could n't see much on the boat , so he passed the time talking on the phone and reading .
" You ca n't see anything but a bunch of cargo ships , " he said .
The Rockets did take a bus on each side of the ferry ride and arrived in Oakland shipshape .
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report .
The completion of the sequencing of the human genome in 2003 was an outstanding scientific accomplishment .
This achievement , together with advances in technology and the forces of capitalism and competition , has brought genetic testing directly to the consumer .
However , this Pandora ’s box is proving difficult to manage for many people .
Direct - to - consumer ( DTC ) genetic tests are marketed to consumers primarily through the Internet .
Consumers are motivated by education , recreation , and preventive health care , but the answers obtained from the tests do not necessarily provide meaningful information .
Researchers are still learning about the implications of certain genes and how they relate to disease risk and development , and the value of the genetic information is still unclear .
Further , new surveys are reporting that physicians are not confident to interpret the results of DTC testing .
The clinical relevance is in doubt and physicians are often not prepared for patients who show up with genetic test results in hand .
People most certainly have the right to information regarding their own health , including their genome sequence , and people should be proactive in making informed health decisions .
But , are DTC genetic tests helpful in making these decisions ?
DTC companies offer testing for everything from genetic markers and mutations to entire genome - wide associations .
An individual can find out if he or she has a genetic variation that predisposes him or her to a certain type of cancer .
A man can find out if he will inherit a specific disease that has affected another family member , or a woman can evaluate her genome to choose the best diet or cosmetic products .
Families can uncover relationships with royalty or determine ethnic backgrounds .
Some of these motivations are harmless , and have been termed “ recreational genomics , ” but what are the implications of tests that claim to make associations between genetics and health ?
What if they are wrong ?
Who will have access to the results ?
Consumers need to be aware of the risks of obtaining too much information , particularly from companies or laboratories that are unregulated or unaccredited by any governing body .
These types of genetic tests may have a high occurrence of false positives or false negatives .
Patients should not be lured into a sense of security by having a “ low risk ” for certain diseases according to the test results .
Also , genetic testing does not take into account other factors that affect the development of disease such as diet , exercise , or environment .
Warnings to consumers surpass the universal caveat emptor ; consumers should exercise extreme caution to not fall victim to money - making schemes that take advantage of innate human fears and curiosities .
Most consumers surveyed believe that genetic testing should be conducted and interpreted in conjunction with physicians , genetic counselors , or other medical professionals .
Most also agree that tests , and the information that is acquired , should be tightly regulated .
Knowledge is power , and genetic testing is appropriate for predicting some diseases and empowering individuals to understand their health risks .
However , the information should be interpreted carefully .
Consumers and health care providers need to fully communicate with each other about the positives and negatives of genetic testing , the appropriate behavior changes brought about by the results , and the management of expectations of the test results .

More lethal than terrorists
IT'S the health and safety measure Iraqis have not been waiting for .
The government in Baghdad last week banned smoking in public buildings .
Anyone found lighting up will have to pay a fine equivalent to $ 4,300 , enough to buy 17,200 packs of cigarettes at the local price of about 25 cents .
“ Do the politicians have nothing better to do ? ” asks Abu Yasser , as he takes a drag while filling up his car at a petrol station .
“ My cousin was recently murdered by terrorists , my neighbour was tortured by the police , my electricity is cut for most of the day , the same is true in most hospitals in the city .
And they are worried about smoking ? ”
As soon as parliament ratifies the cabinet - imposed ban , Iraqi smokers will be forced to loiter on street corners exposed to car bombs and 45 - degree heat in the summer .
But according to a recent study , smoking kills an average of 55 Iraqis a day , compared to a current average of ten deaths daily from terrorist shootings or bombings .
So the government argues that it is perfectly reasonable to outlaw smoking on public - health grounds .
Nonetheless , the ban has done nothing to improve the already low opinion many Iraqis have of their democratically elected government .
“ Bring back Saddam , ” says a cigarette vendor .
“ We were free to smoke anywhere then . ”
Others link the ban to reports of torture in official detention .
“ Prisons are public buildings , right ?
So will they now prevent guards from stubbing out cigarettes on the arms , legs and backs of inmates ? ” asks one university student .
With nerves jangled from years of upheaval , nicotine is often the first and only comfort .
Stuck at checkpoints , Iraqis pass around cigarettes .
Faced with recalcitrant bureaucrats , they do the same .
In parliament though , the ban is popular .
Islamists want to get rid of tobacco outright .
Of course , many ministers and MPs smoke too , often in their offices .
But , given their elevated positions , few rules apply to them .

Among other topics , Bill reiterates what he said in his LA Times op - ed .
Never underestimate the ability of a tiny fringe group of losers to ruin everything .
For the last couple of weeks , we 've all been laughing heartily at the wacky antics of the " birthers " -- the far - right goofballs who claim Barack Obama was n't really born in Hawaii and therefore the job of president goes to the runner - up , former Miss California Carrie Prejean .
Also , when Obama was sworn in as president , he forgot to give his answer in the form of a question .
And yet , every week , the chorus of conservatives demanding to see his birth certificate grows .
It 's like they 're the Cambridge police , Obama 's in his house -- the White House -- and they need to see some ID .
And there 's nothing anyone can do to convince these folks .
You could hand them , in person , the original birth certificate and have a video of Obama emerging from the womb with Don Ho singing in the background ... and they still would n't believe it .
Which raises the question :
Why , in this country , is it always the religious right that wo n't take anything on faith ?
So far , the reaction from Democrats is to laugh this off , and I understand why .
If you seriously believe that President Obama is an African sleeper spy , get out of your chat room and have your house tested for lead .
But we live in America , and in America , if you do n't immediately kill arrant nonsense , no matter how ridiculous , it can grow and thrive and eventually take over , like crab grass or reality shows about fat people .
This flap might be a deluded right - wing obsession that is a total waste of time , but so was Whitewater , and look where that ended up .
A handful of Republican operatives , enraged at Bill Clinton 's unprecedented economic growth and budget surpluses , found a woman named Paula Jones , which led to a woman named Monica Lewinsky , which gave me enough material to eventually be able to buy a big house in Bel - Air .
Which I 'm still conflicted about .
More recently we had the Swift Boat allegations against John Kerry , in which Kerry was accused of volunteering to serve in Vietnam so he could jump in front of a bullet so he could get a medal and then throw it away to satisfy his urge to insult real Americans .
This was so stupid that Kerry refused to even discuss it .
And we all know how well that worked out .
And once these stories get out there , they 're hard to stamp out because our media do such a lousy job of speaking truth to stupid .
Vietnam , Iraq and the Spanish - American
War were all sold on lies that were unchallenged or even abetted by the media .
Clinton got impeached and Kerry got destroyed in large part because the media did n't have the guts to say , " This is nonsense . "
Lou Dobbs has been saying recently that people are asking a lot of questions about the birth certificate .
Yes , the same people who want to know where the sun goes at night .
And Lou , you 're their new king .
That 's why it 's so important that we the few , the proud , the reality - based attack this stuff before it has a chance to fester and spread .
This is n't a case of Democrats versus Republicans .
It 's sentient beings versus the lizard people , and it is to them I offer this deal : I 'll show you Obama 's birth certificate when you show me Sarah Palin 's high school diploma .
Mankind ’s proclivity towards paralyzing fear of its own creations has n’t escaped the profiteering tendrils of Hollywood .
From Edison Studios ’ 1910 adaptation of Frankenstein , we ’ve been privy to film versions of the “ creation destroys creator ” trope .
The digital age has made the antagonist more chillingly real – with computers having become ubiquitous in all facets of life – but the same paranoia still lingers .
This fear of computers is matched only by our curiosity of their eventual capabilities , and their presence on film , as both friend and foe , has become as common as their place in our everyday lives .
Sadly , not all cinematic computers are supremely capable .
Whether in reasoning or execution , some of them have been embarrassingly incompetent ; we ’re talking Tim “ The Tool Man ” Taylor to your high school calculator ’s Al Borland .
The Interocitor
Film : This Island Earth
Appearing in the classic science fiction film This Island Earth ( as spoofed in Mystery Science Theater 3000 : The Movie ) , the Interocitor is a computer of alien design that , as you may expect , is ridiculously advanced .
Its jack - of - all - trades design makes it useful as everything from a communications device to an energy weapon .
The character Dr. Cal Meacham even quips , “ There ’s no limit to what it could do .
Laying a four lane highway at the rate of a mile a minute would be a cinch . ”
So what ’s the problem ?
According to the Interocitor instruction manual ( yes , I ’m serious ) , no component can be replaced .
Wait , what ?
The most advanced technology the human race has ever encountered is incapable of being upgraded ?
That ’s like having a recipe for the perfect bread , with the caveat that it ’ll disintegrate when in contact with peanut butter ( read : it ’s useless ) .
Oh , wait second !
I get it .
It ’s just an Apple product .
EDI
Film : Stealth
As if Stealth was not already offensive enough for its egregious tokenizing and the insulting implication that its audience could possibly be stupid enough to find it entertaining , it also simultaneously pisses on the graves of Alan Turing and Isaac Asimov in its spectacularly nonsensical portrayal of artificial intelligence .
EDI , or “ Extreme Deep Invader ” ( oh , grow up , will you ? ) , is an impressive artificially intelligent pilot that could change the face of warfare .
Instead of human pilots bombing civilians on foreign soil , we ’ll now have machines bombing civilians on foreign soil , which makes it okay .
As expected , EDI initially seems perfect for the job , doing everything a human pilot can do , but far more efficiently .
Unfortunately , this includes going completely bat - shit insane .
After being struck by lightning , EDI becomes self - aware … and nuts .
This plot device may have worked for Mary Shelley back in the nineteenth century , but today it just wo n’t fly ( excuse the pun ) .
Anyway , unlike humans in the military who , after going mad , just spend their lives on street corners lashing out at random passers by , EDI attempts to trigger World War 3 , then ends up deliberately sacrificing itself to clean up the mess it made in the first place .
How logical .
Proteus
Film : Demon Seed
Proteus is an artificial intelligence ( are n’t they all ? ) that becomes rogue ( as usual ) and decides that it wants something ridiculously inane , no matter how many corpses it must climb over to get it .
In this case , Proteus – which contains the sum of all human knowledge – decides that it wants to be “ alive ” in a biological sense .
Instead of an eternal life of prestige and respect as the world ’s greatest computer , it wants to go through the typical human life cycle of zero bladder control , awkwardness , angst , misery , and finally back to loss of bladder control before an undignified death .
Does n’t sound very fucking smart to me .
Proteus kidnaps the wife of its creator by trapping her inside her entirely computerized home .
It then proceeds to use her cells to manufacture an unholy collection of robo- zygotes with which to impregnate her .
It ’s all very ugly , and let ’s just say that an abortion would require little more than an industrial electromagnet .
In the end , however , a creepily voiced , megalomaniacal baby emerges from Proteus ’ incubator in the first ever live - action portrayal of Stewie Griffin .
Lucy
Film : Homewrecker
In a role tailor - made for Kate Jackson , she plays a computer in this awful TV movie .
A scientist decides to live the fantasy of every teenage hacker who has yet to know the touch of a woman : he reprograms his computer with the personality of a girl , which then falls completely , utterly , obsessively in love with him .
This sounds great , right ?
You sidestep the dating game entirely and go straight to living with a girl who does n’t get inconveniently timed headaches , does n’t expect you to live up to her father , nor balloons physically following the obligatory “ honeymoon period ” .
Furthermore , she probably has a volume control , which I personally believe would improve the quality of any relationship when installed on a woman .
Sadly , things do n’t work out and the scientist goes back to his estranged wife .
At this point things go from great to not - so - great as Lucy begins to act like a real jilted ex-lover and turns murderous .
Could our protagonist not have sidestepped this whole problem by coding an “ open relationship ” subroutine for Lucy ?
Oh , well .
We live and learn .
The Matrix
Film :
You ’re kidding , right ?
You know the story , so I wo n’t rehash it .
And if you ’ve never seen The Matrix , boy are you on the wrong site !
As with all films that attain cult - like levels of popularity , most aspects of The Matrix have been criticized at some point .
One annoyance that is often overlooked , though , is the competence of the AI behind the world of the matrix itself .
The collective consciousness that makes up the entirety of the machine population , both inside the matrix and in the “ real ” world .
As any engineer will tell you , the fact is that bioelectric power is so inefficient compared to solar power that one large solar panel will generate the same amount of power as the entire harvested human race .
I know what you ’re thinking :
The humans scorched the skies in an attempt to cut off the machines ’ access to the sun , which precipitated the use of “ human batteries ” in the first place .
Good point , but in Revolutions we see Neo and Trinity pilot a ship above the level of the clouds , only to be greeted by a beautiful clear sky and beaming sun .
Would it not still be much easier for the machines simply to wipe out the human race entirely , and build – oh , I do n’t know – elevated solar panels above cloud level ?
Or better yet , orbiting panels that concentrate energy into ground - based refineries .
To a computerized consciousness capable of crafting an entire persistent artificial world , this should be a cakewalk .
Sadly , the matrix – just like every other computer system that decides to take over the world – is plagued by the Achilles ’ heel of incompetence .

Television viewers go absolutely gaga over The Biggest Loser , the NBC reality show that takes obese , out - of - shape people away from their regular lives and puts them on a punishing full - time fitness and diet regimen aimed at stripping them of pounds .
The finalist who loses the biggest percentage of his or her starting weight is the winner .
( Most people already know this ; I 'm more of a Top Chef kind of girl , so the details of the show were new to me . )
But some fitness pros cringe when they watch the show , says a new article published in the September issue of IDEA Fitness Journal , the publication for members of the IDEA Health and Fitness Association , a professional association for the fitness and wellness industry .
They worry that it gives people the wrong idea of what they need to do to lose weight and get fit .
The article , by fitness pro and writer Amanda Vogel , is available only to IDEA members , but here 's the gist of her piece :
The show fosters unrealistic expectations about the pace of weight loss , many fitness pros say .
Normal , sustainable weight loss is 1 or 2 pounds a week , not the 15 pounds that some contestants drop .
The show 's cocreator responds that the more substantial weight loss is more compelling and that it 's hard for contestants to stay motivated without it .
But in the real world , dietitians recommend adopting a food and exercise regimen you can live with for the rest of your life , and slow , steady weight loss powered by nonextreme dieting and exercise is the way to do that .
From what viewers see , it seems as if the contestants are quickly pushed into very challenging exercises without working through the basics — simpler exercises and shorter distances — first , say many fitness pros .
The response from the show 's cocreator and one of its personal trainers :
The finished show captures only a fraction of the training that goes on .
Contestants definitely start with the basics and then progress , as they should .
But if viewers do n't see that , will they get the wrong idea ?
Pros wonder why the exercises in the Last - Chance Workout , the final exercise session of the show before the weekly weigh - in , are so " exotic , " " bizarre , " and " unnecessary , " including moves usually reserved for more serious athletes , like sprints or repeated high jumps .
One of the show 's trainers counters by saying that the exercises are targeted appropriately to contestants based on their abilities .
Personal trainers interviewed for the article question the methods of the on- camera trainers , who are often shown screaming their lungs out at contestants in a way that many find bullying .
One contestant , however , replies that the trainers give you only what you need to succeed .
Clearly , the relationship between a trainer and client will vary depending on the people involved , but if you are afraid of hiring a trainer because you think you 'll be screamed at , do n't be .

Silicon Valley 's booms set fire to the local real estate market and new construction followed .
But after a year or so of recession , south bay is littered with ghost buildings and empty office complexes .
At 20.5 % , vacancy rates are the highest they 've been in the Valley since 2003 .
Vacancy in research and developments spaces is at 18.9 % , according to CB Richard Ellis .
In Sunnyvale , more than half of the available offices are empty .
Combined , a total of 41.7 million square feet of R&D and office space lay bare in Silicon Valley .
That 's twice the size of Monaco .

In a grim Nov. 3 Wall Street Journal piece ( buried inside the paper ) , Yochi Dreazen reported record suicide rates for a stressed - out U.S. Army .
Sixteen soldiers killed themselves in October alone , 134 so far this year , essentially ensuring that last year ’s “ record ” of 140 suicides will be broken .
This represents a startling 37 percent jump in suicides since 2006 and , for the first time , puts the suicide rate in the Army above that of the general U.S. population .
After eight years of two major counterinsurgency wars ( and various minor encounters in what used to be called the Global War on Terror ) , with many soldiers experiencing multiple tours of duty , with approximately 120,000 U.S. troops still in Iraq and almost 70,000 in Afghanistan , with the Afghan War clearly in an escalatory phase , commanders in the field calling for 40,000 - 80,000 more American troops , and base construction on the rise , the military ’s internal problems are clearly escalating as well .
As Dahr Jamail , author of The Will to Resist : Soldiers Who Refuse to Fight in Iraq and Afghanistan , and Sarah Lazare report , under these circumstances , the Army is digging deep for deployable troops ; in fact , it ’s dipping into a pool of soldiers who have already been damaged or even broken by their experiences in our war zones – and that ’s just to meet present deployment needs .
Perhaps it ’s not surprising then that Dreazen included this striking passage in his report : “ At a White House meeting Friday , the Joint Chiefs of Staff urged President Barack Obama to send fresh troops to Afghanistan only if they have spent at least a year in the U.S. since their last overseas tour , according to people familiar with the matter .
If Mr. Obama agreed to that condition , many potential Afghanistan reinforcements would n’t be available until next summer at the earliest . ”
In translation ( if Dreazen is correct ) , that means , in a private brainstorming session with the president , the Joint Chiefs have evidently put the brakes on implementing the full - scale plan of CENTCOM Commander David Petraeus and Afghan War commander Stanley McChrystal to send a massive infusion of new troops to Afghanistan any time soon .
It ’s worth asking – though no one , as far as I can tell , yet has – whether this may be a modest Afghan equivalent of the “ Shinseki moment ” before the invasion of Iraq .
( Then , Army Chief of Staff Gen . Eric Shinseki warned in congressional testimony that , if we invaded , we would need “ several hundred thousand ” troops – numbers not available – for the occupation to follow .
He was laughed into retirement by the Bush - appointed civilian leadership of the Pentagon . )
At the same time , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs , Adm .
Mike Mullen , has just made it clear that the Pentagon will once again request supplemental war - fighting funds sometime next year , over and above the $ 130 billion Congress appropriated only a month ago in the Defense Department budget .
These will be based , in part , on a calculation that each 1,000 new troops sent to Afghanistan must be supported by an extra billion dollars in funds .
( You can do the math yourself on those 40,000 troops and then wonder just where all that money is going to come from . )
We are , in fact , facing an ongoing disaster not just for the U.S. , but for the U.S. military .
Read the following piece and ask yourself :
What state would a military have to be in to consider sending such men back into a war zone ?
A desperate military is , of course , the answer – a military rubbed raw and , as the shocking mass murder spree at already stressed - out Fort Hood may indicate , on edge in a way that perhaps no one has quite grasped .

Where Will They Get the Troops ?
Preparing undeployables for the Afghan front
by Dahr Jamail and Sarah Lazare
As the Obama administration debates whether to send tens of thousands of extra troops to Afghanistan , an already overstretched military is increasingly struggling to meet its deployment numbers .
Surprisingly , one place it seems to be targeting is military personnel who go absent without leave ( AWOL ) and then are caught or turn themselves in .
Hidden behind the gates of military bases across the U.S. , troops facing AWOL and desertion charges regularly find themselves in the hands of a military that metes out informal , open - ended punishments by forcing them to wait months – sometimes more than a year – to face military justice .
In the meantime , some of these soldiers are offered a free pass out of this legal limbo as long as they agree to deploy to Afghanistan or Iraq – even if they have been diagnosed with severe post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) .
In August 2008 at TomDispatch.com , we reported on the deplorable conditions at the 82nd Replacement Barracks at Fort Bragg , North Carolina .
There , more than 50 members of Echo Platoon of the 82nd Airborne Division ’s 82nd Replacement Detachment were being held while awaiting AWOL and desertion charges .
Investigations launched since then – in part in response to our article – have revealed that the plight of members of Echo Platoon is not an isolated one .
It is , in fact , disturbingly commonplace on other bases throughout the United States .
And it is from these “ holdover units , ” filled with disgruntled soldiers who have gone AWOL , many of whom are struggling with PTSD from previous deployments in war zones , that the military is hoping to help meet its manpower needs for Afghanistan .
Nightmare in Echo Platoon
On Aug. 16 , determined to put an end to unbearable mental and psychological pain , Pvt. Timothy Rich , while on 24 - hour suicide watch , attempted to jump to his death from the roof of Echo Platoon ’s barracks ( where he had been held since being arrested for going AWOL ) .
Prior to his suicide attempt , Rich had been offered amnesty by the military in exchange for agreeing to deploy to Afghanistan or Iraq .
He had already been through a hellish year awaiting a discharge and treatment for mental health problems .
“ I want to leave here very bad , ” he explained .
“ For four months they have been telling me that I ’ll get out next week .
I did n’t see an end to it , so I figured I ’d try and end it myself . ”
He fell three stories , bouncing off a tree , before hitting the ground and cracking his spine .
The military gave him a back brace , psychotropic drugs , and put him on a renewed , 24 - hour suicide watch .
While he has recently been discharged from the military , Rich was not atypical of the soldiers of Echo Platoon , some forced to wait a year or more in legal limbo – in dilapidated buildings under the authority of abusive commanders – for legal proceedings to begin , and many struggling with mental illness or PTSD from previous deployments .
As Spc. Dustin Stevens told us last August : “ [ It ’s ] horrible here .
We are treated like animals .
Some of us are going crazy , some are sick .
There are people here who should be in mental hospitals .
And the way I see it , I did nothing wrong . ”
Shortly after our story was published , Stevens told us that at least half a dozen soldiers in the platoon , including him , were suddenly given trial dates .
Although he was likely to be found guilty and face punishment , Stevens claimed to be “ relieved ” to have an end in sight .
Soon after , according to Echo Platoon informants , their barracks were condemned as a result of a military investigation of the site and , on Oct. 19 , the platoon itself was disbanded .
Recently , due possibly to the attention his story drew to the mistreatment and indefinite detention soldiers were facing in Echo Platoon , Stevens was informed by the military he would be “ chaptered out ” – in other words , given an administrative discharge from the Army – and will not be forced to serve formal prison time .
James Branum , Stevens ’ civilian lawyer , as well as the legal adviser to the G.I. Rights Hotline of Oklahoma and co-chair of the Military Law Task Force ( MLTF ) , summed developments up this way : “ After repeated complaints and congressional inquiry , Echo Platoon was shut down .
The whole place was shut down .
Everyone was scattered to other units .
If your old unit still exists , they are sending you to your old unit .
We know that at least one of the NCOs [ non- commissioned officers ] in charge of Echo Platoon was fired .
I think this is a positive thing . ”
Echoes of Echo
The troubling state of affairs in Echo Platoon may only have been the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Army holdover units .
Evidence suggests that soldiers being held on other bases in the United States for AWOL and desertion face similar apathy or intentional neglect – and that they , too , are often left with the choice between living in legal limbo or agreeing to be sent to a war zone .
Scott Wildman , a former Army specialist , went AWOL in 2007 when he was unable to receive adequate help for severe PTSD sustained after a 15 - month deployment to Iraq .
In February 2009 , he finally turned himself in at Fort Lewis in Washington state , only to find himself lost in a labyrinthine bureaucracy .
For the first four months , he was not allowed to leave a confined area and was forbidden even to walk around by himself .
Here ’s how he describes his experience : “ I was flipping out .
My wife had left me while I was over there .
I had n’t seen my kids in a couple years .
I came home and tried to get help .
At Fort Lewis , they do not care about you .
I had been diagnosed by civilian and military doctors with severe depression , PTSD , and severe anxiety .
When you are at the unit , they make fun of you .
They crack PTSD jokes .
They all have it too , but they ’re too cool . ”
During the eight months he has been held at Fort Lewis , Wildman claims he has suffered verbal abuse and substandard mental healthcare .
“ The command treated me like dirt .
My commander ignored me for the first couple months until my roommate jumped me .
They ’ll make sure you ’re in the room and call you a ‘ bunch of PTSD pussies . ' ”
Four weeks ago , Wildman was informed that he would be court - martialed , but he was not given a trial date .
Feeling he had no other choice , he went AWOL again and remains so today .
“ I ’d been going to see some military counselors , but we were n’t making progress on the real problem … .
They give us classes on calm and peacefulness , but they are right near the shooting ranges .
There ’s gunfire and explosions all around , people being screamed at all the time because it ’s infantry .
It ’s not a good place for someone with [ mental health ] issues . ”
At one point , despite a confidentiality protocol that should have prevented it , Wildman ’s commanders went through his medical evaluations and found out that he had been involved in the accidental killing of two little girls in Iraq .
They proceeded to needle him by threatening to write him up for war crimes .
Explaining why he once again went AWOL , Wildman says , “ I did n’t know what was going to happen next .
I had to remove myself from that situation . ”
“ Examples of how the military is treating soldiers , like the case of Wildman , are common , ” comments Kathleen Gilberd , co-chair of the MLTF .
She also points out that the Army , stretched thin by years of multiple deployments to two war zones , has taken to downplaying potentially severe medical conditions to keep soldiers eligible for service overseas .
It is commonplace , she reports , for formerly AWOL soldiers to be “ bribed ” with offers of having all charges , or potential charges , dropped , as long as they accept deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan .
“ A lot of folks who are under - diagnosed or misdiagnosed are being deployed second and third times , ” she adds .
“ Barrier mechanisms that should prevent this from happening are being routinely ignored . …
If someone is on psychotropic medication or is diagnosed with a fresh psychiatric condition , there should be a 90 - day observation period and delay , under DOD [ Department of Defense ] policy . ”
Remarkably , that sometimes - ignored 90 - day hold period for military personnel on psychotropic medications does not always apply to soldiers who are diagnosed with traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) of a sort commonly caused by roadside bombs .
According to an Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center analysis , reported in the Denver Post in August 2008 , more than “ 43,000 service members – two - thirds of them in the Army or Army Reserve – were classified as nondeployable for medical reasons three months before they deployed ” to Iraq .
The process , if anything , only seems to be accelerating when it comes to Afghanistan .
Deploying the Undeployables
Not all soldiers go AWOL in order to save their minds and bodies .
Some are trying to save their families .
One soldier held in Bravo Platoon , a holdover unit of the 3rd Brigade , 4th Infantry Division at Fort Carson in Colorado Springs ( who did not want his name made public ) disclosed that , having returned from service in Iraq , he was told he would soon be redeployed there .
Because his mother was ill , he refused and was threatened with a court martial .
“ When I turned myself in , I submitted a binder with letters from my mom ’s doctors and state officials that made clear that I needed to be home to take care of my mother .
At that time , they had me on restriction and lockdown 24/ 7 to keep me from leaving again .
Later they punished me .
I was assigned extra duty and received a rank reduction from E3 to a private .
I was treated like crap . ”
He and the other soldiers in his holdover platoon were subjected to verbal abuse and made to do menial jobs .
He claimed that he was threatened daily with being sent to the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , the military ’s maximum security correctional facility – and then was urged to agree to go back to Iraq instead .
It made no difference that he had “ no - go ” orders from doctors at Fort Carson exempting him from overseas deployment .
His commander promised him a clean slate if he would redeploy to Iraq , insisting that the only alternative was a court - martial .
Despite a regimen of humiliation , he stood his ground and was finally discharged for family hardship in September 2008 .
There were at least 11 other soldiers then in Bravo Platoon .
Like their counterparts in Echo , most were told that their records would be wiped clean once they agreed to redeploy .
The alternative was a non-judicial punishment , followed by a court - martial some months down the line .
As he tells it , Sgt. Heath Carter , originally based at Fort Polk , La. , found himself torn between pressing family needs and an indifferent military command .
On returning from the invasion of Iraq , he discovered his daughter living in what he believed to be an unsafe environment .
Heath and his new wife started consulting attorneys in order to secure custody of the child .
Precisely during this time , the military began changing Carter ’s duty station .
He was moved from Fort Polk to Fort Huachuca , Ariz. , then on to Fort Stewart , Ga. , reducing his chances of gaining custody .
Convinced that this was a crucial matter for his daughter , he requested compassionate reassignment to Fort Leavenworth , Mo. , about two hours away from her .
His appeals to the military command , to his chaplain , even to his congressman failed .
In May 2007 , having run out of options , he went AWOL from Fort Stewart , heading home to fight for custody , which he won .
This Jan. 25 , however , he was arrested at his home by military police , who flew him back to Fort Stewart , where he has been awaiting charges for the past eight months .
Being a sergeant , he is in a regular unit , not a holdover one .
Initially , his commander assured him he would be sent home within a month and a half .
Several months later , the same commander decided to court - martial him .
Carter feels frustrated .
“ If they had done that in the beginning , I would have been home by now .
It ’s taken this long for them to decide .
Now I have to wait for the court - martial .
If we had known it would take this long , my family could have moved down here .
Every time I ask when I ’ll have a trial , they say it ’s only going to be another two weeks .
I get the feeling they ’re lying .
They ’ve messed with my pay .
They ’re trying to push me to do something wrong . ”
His ordeal has forced Carter to reflect on America ’s wars .
Once , he admits , he was proud of his mission in Iraq .
Now , he sees things differently .
“ I do n’t think there is any reason for us to be there except for oil . ”
His wife , who witnessed her husband ’s callous treatment , says , “ He ’s been there [ Iraq ] , done that , and seen horrible , terrible things , so of course he does n’t want to go back . ”
While the Obama administration decides how many thousands of troops to send to Afghanistan , service men and women are already facing repeated deployments , oftentimes while having already been diagnosed with medical conditions that should render them unfit for deployment .
Nothing has changed for these beleaguered troops , except the venue of their maltreatment and the desperation with which the military is now struggling to make the necessary deployment numbers as it continues to fight two endless wars .

Peekskill outrage , September 4 , 1949 .
[ See below for a four - part documentary on Paul Robeson 's life . ]
By Harry Targ
On September 4 , 1949 , an angry crowd surrounded the 20,000 friends of Paul Robeson who had come to hear him in an open - air concert at Peekskill , New York .
After the event right - wing , anti-communist inspired mobs attacked supporters who were leaving the event .
These attacks included smashing the windows of Pete Seeger ’s automobile with several family members inside .
Sixty years later we remember the great progressive Paul Robeson , his struggles for justice , and his refusal to bow to the politics of reaction .
The young Robeson
One of the giants of the 20th century , a citizen of the world , an actor / singer and activist for justice , Paul Robeson has been virtually erased from popular consciousness , a victim of the vicious anti-communist hysteria of the 1940s and 1950s .
Paul Robeson , an African American , was born to Maria Louis Bustill and William Drew Robeson in Princeton , New Jersey in 1898 , 33 years after the close of the US civil war and two years after the US Supreme Court declared in Plessy vs. Ferguson that separate institutions for Black and white people were constitutional .
New Jersey , while not segregated to the extent of the deep south , was hostile to the rights of Black people .
Robeson was born into a family with a long - standing commitment to struggle for justice .
His mother ’s ancestors participated in the underground railroad , bringing escaped slaves from the south to the north .
Her family included ministers , teachers and artisans in the northern free Black community .
His father was a slave who escaped to the north and joined the Union army .
As a minister educated at Lincoln University , Robeson ’s father defended the rights of Black people in the New Jersey communities where he worked .
Many years later when he was politically active , Robeson would refer to the experiences of his people struggling against slavery and oppression to be free .
He likened the struggles of his ancestors to the Black people of his day , and also to factory workers seeking labour rights , and peoples all round the world who were struggling to overthrow European colonial empires .
The young Robeson studied hard , was coached in elocution by his demanding father and performed so well in school that he was admitted to Rutgers University in 1915 , only the third Black ever to enter that institution .
Robeson graduated in 1919 as valedictorian , champion debater and two - time All - American first - team football selection .
Robeson attended law school at Columbia University from 1919 - 1923 but decided against a law career because of the racism he faced at a preeminent New York law firm .
While he attended law school , Robeson began appearing in plays and found his way to the influential Provincetown Players of Greenwich Village .
Robeson ’s artistic career was successfully launched by his performances in two of Eugene O’Neill ’s most important and controversial plays , All God ’s Chillun Got Wings and Emperor Jones .
From there his reputation and visibility spread .
By the late 1920s , he appeared in Porgy , Stevedore and Showboat , where he sang “ Old Man River ” , a song that would have deep political significance for him later on .
On tour in Europe in the late 1920s and starring in a London production of Othello , in 1930 , Robeson had become a star of worldwide proportions .
During the 1930s , he would appear in 11 films , mostly British productions , further solidifying his global reputation as an actor .
As his reputation was soaring in the theatre of the 1920s , Robeson came to the realisation that the rich musical heritage of his people , then called Negro spirituals , needed to be celebrated and performed .
He thus launched a singing career that would be his most enduring contribution to US culture and , at the same time , would serve as a vehicle for him to participate in the struggle of Black people to achieve their freedom from racism and Jim Crow segregation .
Over the next 30 years , he would learn at least a dozen languages and would celebrate the musical traditions of peoples from Africa , Asia , the Middle East , Europe and Latin America , as well as the United States .
Paul Robeson performs for construction workers at the Sydney Opera House site , 1960 .
The politicisation of Paul Robeson
By the mid-1930s Robeson ’s outlook concerning the world around him and how the artist must relate to that world had changed significantly .
Always aware of racism and segregation , Robeson began to see the oppression of his people as similar and related to anti-Semitism , colonialism , worker exploitation and attacks on the first socialist state , the Soviet Union .
Leaving a London theatre after a performance of Showboat in 1928 , Robeson encountered a massive march of Welsh miners who had come all the way from Wales to demand better wages and working conditions .
Robeson spoke to their group and joined their struggle .
The mutual love and respect Robeson and the Welsh miners developed for each other would last for the rest of his life .
But it was the escalating Spanish Civil war , fascist armies fighting to overthrow a democratically elected government , that led Robeson to declare his commitment to political struggle on behalf of the dispossessed .
In a speech given before the National Joint Committee for Spanish Relief at Royal Albert Hall on June 24 , 1937 , he proclaimed : “ I have longed to see my talent contributing in an unmistakably clear manner to the cause of humanity .
Every artist , every scientist , must decide NOW where he stands .
He has no alternative . ”
The artist , he said , “ must elect to fight for freedom or slavery ” .
Robeson spoke out for workers , walked their picket lines and sang to gatherings of trade unionists in auto , steel , shipping , meat packing , electrical and mining industries who were demanding the right to form unions during the massive organising drives of the Congress of Industrial Organizations ( CIO ) .
He sang of that great Industrial Workers of the World ( WW ) singer / organiser , “ Joe Hill ” .
And he sang songs championing racial justice .
Red scares
After World War II , Robeson met with US President Harry Truman and demanded that he take a stand against segregation and support anti-lynching legislation in the south .
He already had spoken out against the exclusion of Blacks from major league baseball .
Opposing the Cold War and Truman ’s refusal to stand against segregation in the south , Robeson joined the campaign of third party candidate Henry Wallace , of the Progressive Party of America , who was running for president in 1948 .
Robeson had often visited the Soviet Union , befriended the great Soviet film maker Sergei Eisenstein and had spoken with admiration about what appeared to be the lack of racism there .
After World War II and as the Cold War was heating up , the US government and right - wing groups launched a campaign to stifle the voice of Paul Robeson because of his sympathies for the Soviet Union and his strong advocacy for racial justice in the United States .
He was called to testify before the House Committee on Un- American Activities .
Thugs vandalised and beat attendees at the summer Robeson concert in Peekskill , New York .
Government agents pressured concert impresarios to stop sponsoring Robeson 's concerts .
And when his public access to audiences declined in the 1950s , even Black churches were pressured to cancel Robeson visits .
The centrepiece of the effort to muzzle Robeson was the decision of the US State Department to revoke his passport in 1950 .
He was forbidden to leave the United States even though he still was a beloved worldwide figure .
His passport was not reinstated until 1958 when the Supreme Court ruled that the State Department did not have the right to confiscate the passports of citizens ..
Despite his not being able to travel , working people around the world continued to support Robeson .
Canadian trade unionists from 1952 through 1955 organised four Robeson concerts at the border between the state of Washington and Canada .
Robeson performed from the US side and Canadian workers listened to his music from their side .
Robeson welcomed the Canadian workers at the 1952 concert singing his signature song , “ Old Man River ' ' from Showboat .
He sang the lyrics he had revised from the original version in the 1928 musical -- from stereotyping of Black people as docile to Black people as fighters for their freedom .
Robeson began to insert the newer progressive lyrics in the 1930s when his own political consciousness had begun to change and for the rest of his life he saw the new lyrics as emblematic of his own political transformation .
In 1957 , Welsh miners organised a chorus in a London studio and sang to Robeson listening in New York using the then new long distance telephone lines .
They always remembered his support for their struggle and they wanted to demonstrate to him and the world their opposition to the efforts of the United States to stifle the voice of Paul Robeson .
After Robeson ’s passport was reissued he resumed worldwide travel in the late 1950s .
He fell ill in 1961 , returned to the United States and for the most part retired from public life .
Robeson believed that peoples everywhere shared common musical forms and common struggles : workers , peoples of colour , colonised peoples , women .
He celebrated their differences but insisted on their human oneness .
Perhaps we need to rediscover that vision again today .
He died in 1976 but his spirited call for human solidarity is just as precious today as it was in his lifetime .
And , as at Peekskill , those who support human solidarity must be prepared to “ hold the line ” against reaction .
Hold The Line
Let me tell you the story of a line that was held ,
And many brave men and women whose courage we know well ,
How we held the line at Peekskill on that long September day !
We will hold the line forever till the people have their way .
Hold the line !
Hold the line !
As we held the line at Peekskill
We will hold it everywhere .
Hold the line !
Hold the line !
We will hold the line forever
Till there ’s freedom ev’rywhere .

Biography of Paul Robeson
30 Rock occupies an unusual place in the television landscape .
It ’s far from a hit — its ratings would have meant cancellation on just about any other network — but because of its leading lady , snarky sense of humor , and satirical digs at the network that airs both it and the show within its show , it ’s become one of those things you Have To See if you ’re at all interested in television or comedy .
And back in 2007 — roughly the show ’s back half of its first season and first half of its second season — there was nothing quite like the sheer , go - for - broke craziness that the show put out .
It was legitimately one of the best shows on television , and one of the funniest in the medium ’s history .
Advertisement
But since the show returned from a hiatus imposed by the 2007 - 08 writers ' strike , it ’s lost some of that confident swagger , becoming more hit - and - miss , with its worst episodes a shell of the show that once was .
The last few episodes of its second season and all of its third season had moments that were staggeringly uneven , veering from good joke to bad joke , sometimes within individual scenes .
The ratio of jokes landing to jokes flailing was getting much worse , even as the show ’s media profile and ratings were rising in the wake of star and creator Tina Fey ’s increased cultural prominence .
30 Rock could crank out some of the funniest stuff on television — season three ’s “ Reunion , ” “ The Funcooker , ” and “ Apollo , Apollo ” stand proudly with anything the show has done — but some of the episodes veered distressingly toward " average " or even " mediocre . "
All comedies can experience slumps .
The longer a comedy is on the air , the more used to its rhythms the audience becomes , which either results in episodes that are boring and predictable , or a creative staff that goes out of its way to keep from falling into a slump , only to succumb to other pitfalls .
Recent examples would include how The Office went astray by making all its characters into big , goofy caricatures in the late episodes of its third season and early episodes of its fourth season , or how Curb Your Enthusiasm could never find solid footing in its often - muddled sixth season .
But worse is when a promising or even terrific comedy chases itself into oblivion , like Entourage did after its second season , or Roseanne did in its last three years .
The question , then , is whether 30 Rock is just in a slump , or whether it ’s plunging off a cliff into oblivion .
And while I remain hopeful it's just a slump , there are troubling signs that the cliff could be just ahead .
It ’s worth noting that even at its worst , 30 Rock is still a very solid show .
There ’s a level of craftsmanship at the show ’s base that makes it more appealing to watch than most other comedies on the air , just because the actors are all good , the writers are among the best joke - writers on television , and the staff ’s directors keep things moving along at a snappy pace .
At the same time , though , a bad episode of 30 Rock is much more painful than a bad episode of , say , The Office , in spite of that level of craft that keeps it mostly watchable .
To understand why this is , exactly , we have to get down to what makes a TV comedy work or not work .
All comedies are based on three very simple things : the premise and the plots that stem from it , the characters , and the jokes .
A show need n’t have all three of these things functioning at a high level to completely work , but a show with , say , a really solid premise and plots , but predictable joke - writing , will eventually stop seeming funny , no matter how well - crafted the plots are .
The most important thing to a good comedy , though , is a set of good characters and good relationships between those characters .
This is the ground floor for television sitcoms , the foundation that makes everything else work .
All In The Family , for instance , had a pretty tired premise , but it had really solid joke - writing , and even better , great characters with complex dynamics that made for terrific humor opportunities .
Another example of this is the really very terrible Who ’s The Boss , a show that actually managed to translate into a hugely popular critical success in other countries , where word - for - word translations of the American scripts were shot with local casts , not weighed down by Tony Danza .
Because the central dynamics of the show were fairly well thought - out , with a different cast , the show had a chance to work .
I have a hard time seeing Who ’s The Boss as an overlooked classic , but when compared to a lot of other terrible shows of the time , its character dynamics are much sharper than on , say , the utterly generic Growing Pains , something that probably translated well overseas .
But if you do n’t have a good set of characters , you can coast for a while on great joke - and gag - writing , especially if you have a cast that ’s good at delivering those jokes .
A good example of this is the now seemingly inexplicable early critical smash Will & Grace .
While a lot of the appeal to critics early in the run of that show had to do with just how fresh and groundbreaking its premise seemed at the time , it ’s easy to forget that in that show ’s first two or three seasons , the jokes were pretty tight .
The show ’s writing staff was good at coming up with killer one - liners , and the core cast members were all great at delivering these overtly campy punchlines .
But all Will & Grace 's characters were broad types , designed solely to be as big and goofy as possible to wring the most laughs out of every line .
None of them felt recognizably human very shortly into the run of the show , and their relationships were just as strained .
As mentioned above , all comedies eventually become predictable to their audience , simply because we begin to understand the rhythms of the jokes being told , so once the show reaches a point where we can essentially predict what the next line is going to be , it behooves a series to have strong characters and character relationships to fall back on .
Will & Grace did n’t have this , and when the jokes began to become predictable , the show rapidly fell apart and revealed what had always been an empty center .
( Weirdly , a very similar thing happened to Family Guy . )
Which brings us back to 30 Rock .
I highly doubt 30 Rock will ever get as bad as Will & Grace eventually did , if only because the low ratings practically guarantee its cancellation if the critical community and Emmys ever turn on it in a real way .
And unlike Will & Grace , 30 Rock has two and a half well - developed characters to fall back on at any point .
Liz Lemon ( Fey ) is a subtly new and different take on the career - oriented woman who still wants to have some sort of life — a type pioneered by Mary Tyler Moore in the 1970s — while Jack Donaghy ( Alec Baldwin ) is a coolly ruthless suit with a host of neuroses he somehow keeps perfectly buttoned up .
Both of these characters are so consistently written and portrayed that writers as good as the 30 Rock staff would be able to write funny scenes between them in their sleep .
In addition , Tracy Jordan ( Tracy Morgan ) is fitfully a well - drawn character , when the show is interested in providing some sort of basis for his outright lunacy .
His impetuous childishness becomes much more interesting in the face of the fact that he ’s a dedicated family man , but the series loses sight of this far too often , choosing instead to make him a manic man-child .
30 Rock quickly learned early in its run that its premise — woman tries to keep things rolling along backstage at a sketch - comedy show — was inherently limited and turned more into a show about people trying to survive working at a network where the mood is frequently apocalyptic .
This was probably the right move .
But it ended up stranding a lot of characters who no longer served the same purposes under the new premise .
Most notable of these characters is Pete ( Scott Adsit ) , a very funny guy who frequently has nothing to do .
Also problematic : the awfully written Jenna ( Jane Krakowski ) , who spends most episodes trying to oversell ridiculous material .
Rather than develop the loons Liz and Jack work with into actual characters , though , the show chose to leave them mostly as one - dimensional joke machines , like the characters on Will & Grace .
In season three , when the show apparently realized it could n’t live on Liz and Jack scenes alone , the series split the two characters up and sent them into storylines with the show ’s various other players , but because of the disparity in development levels between the characters , this often resulted in some weak storylines where , say , Frank ( Judah Friedlander ) would suddenly be looking up to Jack for no apparent reason .
The show has also mostly forgotten many of the bit players in its large ensemble , unable to find space for them in its new premise .
So as it starts its fourth season , that ’s where 30 Rock finds itself : in danger of turning into a slightly funnier Will & Grace .
( The similarities between the shows do n’t stop there either .
Both have over - relied on guest stars to patch over poor storylines , and both have been warmly embraced by the Emmys and the mainstream critical community . )
There are still plenty of laughs to be gleaned out of the show , especially when Liz , Jack , or Tracy are around , but simply because the show has been on long enough now that the audience can predict its rhythms , it sometimes seems like a series trying desperately to find another gear and failing .
30 Rock is still nowhere near a bad show , but it risks turning into a show where one - dimensional people spend a lot of time shouting at each other .
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve have kept quite in recent months about any strong dollar policy .
Last time Timothy Geithner was in China he was laughed at by students when he insinuated that the U.S. would get its economic house in order .
The Chinese students realize just like most Americans do , that the U.S. and China are stuck at the hip for years to come .
Yet what most Americans probably do n’t realize is their central bank is systematically trying to destroy the currency they hold .
This is n’t new .
This has been going on for well over two decades .
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve are now on a full scale mission to cut the dollar value in half .
Now why would the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve want to do this to the average American ?
I think some Americans actually think these bank bailout machines are actually looking out for their best interest .
They are not .
Why do you think we have over 26 million unemployed and underemployed Americans even though we have committed trillions of dollars to bailouts ?
Last time I checked most of the big banks are still standing while millions of workers are not .
Let us first pull up a chart of the U.S. dollar :
The U.S. dollar index hit a peak in 1985 .
If you may recall , the Federal Funds rate at the time was over 11 percent .
Can you imagine that ?
Talk about popping the housing bubble .
But over 18 years the dollar lost approximately 35 percent of its value .
This occurred by a declining Fed funds rate and spending more than we produced .
Little by little we exported our future away .
What is more disturbing about the chart above is the quick destruction of the dollar in the last few years .
From 2002 to the lows reached in 2008 , in a little over 5 years we gave up over 40 percent of the U.S. dollar index value .
So what took us 18 years only took us 5 years this time around .
The path is unmistakable .
The U.S. dollar is being targeted .
Why ?
It is the only way we can pay our way out of the current debt .
Also , the global economy is completely dependent on the American consumer .
They need us to spend to keep going ( ironically ) .
This is where the myth of decoupling is shattered .
So why is this bad news for you ?
1 – More Expensive Imports
First , even if we had a balance of trade a weaker U.S. dollar would help our exports but we have anything but a balance .
If you have n’t noticed we import so much more than we export that in the end , the already strained American consumer is going to be paying a whole lot more for items .
We are still negative .
The only reason the chart is moving up is because Americans are spending a lot less .
Americans are accustomed to buying cheap goods that come from low wage countries .
There is n’t much that can be done in terms of competition here unless people would be happy making $ 5 a day .
So the argument that this is good for our exports is only a short term argument .
Since these things take time , what we are seeing right now is a draw down of inventory causing deflation .
Yet what will happen after that and assuming the Fed gets its way by slamming the dollar ?
Expect to see the cost of goods shoot up .
The U.S. dollar has been falling for 30 years so it is hard to see how we reverse this pattern .
2 – Global Garage Sale of U.S. Assets
Remember the ports being sold to foreigners ?
Did n’t go so well did it .
If the U.S. dollar is hit any further you can expect this to be a common occurrence .
France experienced much of this after World War II when American companies started buying up French businesses .
The French did n’t much like that but American companies went out with a powerful U.S. dollar .
The tables seemed to be turned .
Now this is going to expose many questions and you can expect this to be a politically charged issue in years to come .
3 – Do you Enjoy Traveling Outside of U.S. ?
Enjoy traveling outside the U.S. ?
Try going to Europe and seeing how far your dollar will go .
Try going to Japan and see how strong the dollar is .
Go to Britain and see how easy it is to get by with a few hundred dollars .
It is somewhat nostalgic to watch Mad Men and have them go to Europe and seeing how life would be with a strong dollar .
We have to watch it on TV because that is n’t the case today .
Most Americans do not travel outside the U.S. so this might not be noticed but it is important to pay attention to this .
4 – A Weak Currency Hurts Global U.S. Leverage
We ’ve already seen a weaker dollar hurt our standing in the world .
Countries now openly talk about creating another reserve currency .
Treasuries are still selling but only to our major trading partners .
This wo n’t go on forever .
We ’ve reached the zero bound .
We are literally trading on the goodness of strangers .
In the early 1980s the Fed was offering 10 , 12 , and even 15 percent on the funds rate so you were able to lock in Treasuries in the double digits .
That was probably a once in a lifetime buy .
Now , the Fed is at zero and really has no wiggle room .
Politically , all it can do is appease our big buyers in China and Japan .
5 – Your Dollar Denominated Savings will Dwindle
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve want to systematically cut the dollar by 50 percent or so in the next 5 to 10 years .
But as we ’ve seen in this crisis , in an irrational world things do n’t always go as planned .
To think this process will run smoothly is naïve .
Americans are already feeling the reality of a weaker dollar .
Stagnant wages over a decade .
Many average Americans in dual income families are wondering why they are earning the same and working twice as hard .
It is because the dollars they are getting paid in our worth less and less .
We really ca n’t cut costs much more on goods that we import .
So in the end purchasing power will be hurt .
With the housing bubble bursting we see a quick adjustment bringing values back in line to local area incomes .
Yet at the same time , higher unemployment and stagnant wages create this race to the bottom .
Trying to play with a currency is not an easy task and the Fed has been trying to meddle with so many things for decades .
The housing bubble was largely caused by the Fed cutting rates in the early part of this decade .
It would appear the U.S. dollar has one way to go if it were up to our U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve .

Children spent 11 days playing with the remains of what they thought was a crocodile in a New Zealand creek before a parent discovered that the body was human , it emerged yesterday .
The children had picked up parts of the badly decomposed body in Stanmore Bay on the Whangaparaoa Peninsula , just north of Auckland .
Police are investigating whether the remains are those of Alanah Brough , 39 , missing since January .

The children play for the Hibiscus Coast Raiders Rugby League Club .
They found the skeleton during a gala day on July 25 , said vice - chairman Merve Heka .
On Wednesday about 6 pm , a parent followed his son after the under - 9 team 's practice to investigate the remains .
It is believed he tried to fish them out with a broomstick .
" He pulled it [ the skeleton ] out and there was black hair on the back of its head still , " Mr Heka said .
" He dropped it ...
He knew straight away it was human .
Kids will play with anything they see . "
The police were then called .
Mr Heka said a kaumatua would bless the club and creek .
" Three or four of these kids are quite traumatised . "
A neighbour said he was walking his dog past the creek on Wednesday night when he spotted about 10 boys prodding the skeleton with sticks .
One told him , " Mister , I think we 've found a crocodile in the creek . "
" They were in there playing with it for about two weeks ... I did n't know what it was .
It could have been lots of things .
I thought it might have been a bit of old tree trunk or something . "
Ms Brough , mother of boys aged 7 and 14 , vanished after leaving her Bonita Ave home on January 30 .
Her mother , Judith Brough , said at the time that she had been concerned for her daughter 's wellbeing as she had lost weight and been displaying unusual behaviour .
Judith Brough did not want to comment yesterday .
Detective Inspector Bruce Scott of the Waitemata police said it was too early to tell if the body was that of Alanah Brough .
The remains were " very badly decomposed " , he said .
" Until we have identified the body , we wo n't know for sure if it is this missing woman .

" She has n't been sighted since she went missing .
This has been an ongoing missing - persons investigation we have been following closely . "
Mr Scott said the body appeared to have been in the creek for at least a few weeks and possibly months .
" It appears to have been there for quite some time .
It appears to be quite decomposed . "
Mr Scott said a pathologist had examined the remains , which would also undergo a formal autopsy .

The CRTC's net neutrality ( aka traffic management ) decision is out and though it does not go as far as some advocates might hope , it unquestionably advances the ball forward on several important fronts .
When considering the decision , it is important to remember that 12 months ago , there was virtually no ISP disclosure of traffic management practices and even an unwillingness to acknowledge that there was an issue .
Today 's CRTC decision signifies that traffic management is not a free - for - all and the days of ISPs arguing that they can do whatever they please on their networks is over .
That said , it also guarantees that traffic management practices such as throttling will continue and it is going to take more complaints to concretely address the issue .
The key elements of the decision on retail services :
1 . A new framework for considering traffic management .
Consumers can complain about traffic management practices or the Commission can bring an action on their own .
Where there is a credible complaint , the ISP will be required to :
Describe the ITMP being employed , as well as the need for it and its purpose and effect , and identify whether or not the ITMP results in discrimination or preference .
If there is any degree of discrimination or preference :
demonstrate that the ITMP is designed to address the need and achieve the purpose and effect in question , and nothing else ;
establish that the ITMP results in discrimination or preference as little as reasonably possible ;
demonstrate that any harm to a secondary ISP , end - user , or any other person is as little as reasonably possible ; and
explain why , in the case of a technical ITMP , network investment or economic approaches alone would not reasonably address the need and effectively achieve the same purpose as the ITMP .
2 . There are two key additional considerations .
First , traffic management that degrades or prefers one application over another may warrant investigation under section 27 ( 2 ) of the Act .
Second , economic traffic management practices ( ie. bit caps ) are generally viewed as ok .
3 . The Commission has stepped into the throttling issue .
It has ruled that for time - sensitive Internet traffic ( ie. real - time audio or video ) , where the throttling creates noticeable degredation , this " amounts to controlling the content and influencing the meaning and purpose of the telecommunications in question . "
The Commission will require prior approval for such activities .
Even for non-sensitive traffic , the CRTC has ruled that it is possible to slow down to an extent that it amounts to blocking or controlling the content , therefore requiring prior approval .
4 . The Commission has mandated new disclosure requirements .
It is requiring ISPs to disclose their traffic management practices to customers , including :
why there are being introduced
who is affected
when it will occur
what Internet traffic is subject to the traffic management
how it will affect an Internet user 's experience , including specific impact on speed
5 . New privacy requirements
The Commission has established new privacy requirements on the use of information obtained from deep - packet inspection .
It now mandates ISPs " not to use for other purposes personal information collected for the purposes of traffic management and not to disclose such information . "
In addition to the retail side of the equation , the decision also addresses wholesale ( ie. ISP to ISP ) .
In a nutshell , where incumbents treat independents in the same manner as their retail customers , the same complaints - based approach applies .
Where the approach is more restrictive , prior approval is required .
While this decision will undoubtedly leave many disappointed , a full prohibition on throttling was never in the cards .
Many consumer groups and net neutrality advocates got some of what they asked for – a test that looks a lot like what they recommended , an acknowledgement of the problems with application - specific measures , new disclosure requirements , new privacy safeguards , and agreement that throttling can violate the law in certain circumstances .
That is n't bad as an overall framework .
The big question is how to enforce these rules .
The larger ISPs may well view the decision as a green light to continue doing what they are doing with a bit more communications .
Indeed , by placing the onus squarely on consumers , the CRTC has virtually guaranteed continued throttling and a steady stream of cases .
There is now more guidance and guidelines but it will take more than just this decision to provide Canadians with the neutral network so many crave .
Kampagne zu Auskunftsersuchen in europäischen Datenbanken
Europaweit sind personenbezogene Daten von Millionen von Menschen in Informationssystemen gespeichert , die von Polizei oder Geheimdiensten betrieben oder selbstverständlich abgefragt werden .
Ergänzt und vernetzt werden die diversen nationalen Informationssysteme durch zentralisierte Datenbanken , wie das Schengen - Informationssystem ( SIS ) oder Europols Computersysteme , und die wachsende Automatisierung und Beschleunigung des grenzüberschreitenden Datenaustausches im Gefolge des Vertrages von Prüm und der „ Schwedischen Initiative “ .
Betroffen sind längst nicht nur Personen , die wegen einer Straftat rechtskräftig verurteilt sind .
Regelmäßig erfasst werden MigrantInnen – sei es , weil sie das „ Verbrechen “ begangen haben , sich ohne vorherige Bewilligung im europäischen Wohlstandsraum aufzuhalten , weil sie vom Asylrecht Gebrauch machen wollen oder auch nur , weil sie länger in einem Mitgliedstaat der Europäischen Union zu Gast sind .
Aber auch EU - BürgerInnen werden immer häufiger ohne strafrechtlichen Anlass , z.B. allein wegen einer Kontrolle bei politischen Protesten oder aufgrund eines polizeilichen Platzverweises , auf Vorrat gespeichert und somit zum Sicherheitsrisiko erklärt .
Europäische InnenministerInnen fordern angesichts einer „ immensen Datenflut “ mehr Kompetenzen und die technischen Voraussetzungen zur Nutzbarmachung dieses „ Daten - Tsunami “ für die Polizeibehörden .
„ Datamining “ - Software soll die Auswertung der Datenbestände vereinfachen und „ Entscheidungshilfen “ geben .
Personen- , Sach - und Beziehungsdaten werden von Computern prozessiert , die „ Risiken “ frühzeitig erkennen und etwaige Straftaten „ vorhersehen “ sollen .
Die Software hierzu wird von der Sicherheitsindustrie entwickelt , ihr Quellcode – und damit ihre Funktionsweise – bleibt geheim .
Die Schaffung eines grenzenlosen Informationsverbundes – der bis in die USA reichen soll – sowie die Entwicklung von technischen Plattformen für die Zusammenarbeit der Polizeibehörden in Echtzeit gehört zu den obersten Prioritäten der europäischen InnenministerInnen .
Mit dem „ Stockholm Programm “ , das der Europäische Rat im Dezember verabschieden will , sollen die Pläne offiziell zur Richtschnur für die EU - Innenpolitik der kommenden fünf Jahre werden .
KritikerInnen warnen vor einer „ Datenbank - Gesellschaft “ .
Während der Binnenmarkt für den polizeilichen Datenaustausch immer stärker Kontur gewinnt , entziehen sich die Erfassung , Verarbeitung und Weitergabe der Daten in der Regel der Kenntnis und dem Einfluss der Betroffenen .
Datenschutz wird in der europäischen Polizeizusammenarbeit klein geschrieben : Gemeinsame Standards bewegen sich auf minimalem Niveau .
Fragen der Verhältnismäßigkeit von Datenerfassung oder Speicherfristen werden meistens ausklammert .
Erlaubt ist im Prinzip , was das jeweilige nationale Recht hergibt .
Selbst dort , wo es europäische „ Kontrollinstanzen “ gibt , haben Innenministerien und Polizeibehörden das letzte Wort .
Internationaler Rechtsschutz muss von Betroffenen im Ernstfall weit jenseits des Wohnortes erstritten werden .
Damit droht die Normalisierung der unkontrollierten Speicherung und Anreicherung von Daten , die in einem Land erhoben wurden , durch die Sicherheitsbehörden eines anderen Landes .
Höhere Datenschutzstandards bestimmter Länder können durch findige BeamtInnen über Länder mit niedrigeren Anforderungen umgangen werden .
Und es drohen die Anhäufung einer größtmöglichen Menge von Daten in zentralen „ Data Warehouses “ , deren Zweck einzig und allein ihre Durchforstung nach der Methode der Rasterfahndung ist , sowie die Veralltäglichung standardisierter Abgleiche großer Datenbestände .
Gesteigert wird dadurch nicht nur das Potenzial für den Missbrauch der Daten .
Vielmehr werden die Herkunft und Glaubwürdigkeit der Daten im Alltag grenzüberschreitender Polizeikooperation auch für wohlmeinende BeamtInnen noch weniger transparent sein , als sie es im nationalen Kontext bereits heute sind .
Die Konsequenzen falscher „ Treffer “ polizeilicher Recherchen im europäischen Informationsverbund können allerdings gravierend sein : verdeckte Überwachung zur Erstellung von Bewegungsprofilen , vorläufige Festnahmen , Aus- und Einreiseverbote , Abschiebung oder auch „ nur “ lästige Hausbesuche und Vernehmungen durch ErmittlerInnen – die Last , die eigene Unschuld zu beweisen , obliegt den Betroffenen .
Der Freispruch vom nagenden Verdacht , der persönliche Freiheit und zwischenmenschliches Vertrauen unterminieren kann , muss notfalls mühselig auf dem Rechtsweg erkämpft werden – falls die persönliche Lebenssituation dies überhaupt zulässt .
Und wir wissen ja : selbst der „ Kontakt “ zu Verdächtigten oder ein kleinster „ Restverdacht “ rechtfertigen eine Speicherung .
Als Antwort auf diese bedrohliche Entwicklung rufen wir daher all jene , die unsere Sorgen teilen , im Rahmen der Kampagne gegen das „ Stockholm - Programm “ dazu auf , nicht nur sich selbst und andere zu informieren , sondern konkret in Aktion zu treten und von ihren Rechten Gebrauch zu machen :
Nadelöhre des grenzüberschreitenden europäischen Informationsaustausches sind ( noch ) die zentralen Polizeibehörden der EU - Mitgliedsstaaten – in Deutschland das Bundeskriminalamt ( BKA ) .
Das BKA ist nicht nur die nationale Kontaktstelle für das europäische Polizeiamt Europol und seine Computersysteme , für das Schengen - Informationssystem und für den Informationsaustausch im Rahmen bi- und multilateraler Vereinbarungen ; das BKA ist auch verpflichtet , Auskunft über eventuell gespeicherte Daten zu geben .
Wer also wissen will , was die Polizei über sie oder ihn zu wissen glaubt , und wer sie damit beschäftigt sehen möchte , Auskunft über die Speicherungen ihrer bzw .
seiner Daten in ihren Datenbanken zu geben , dem empfehlen wir , sogenannte Auskunftsersuchen zu stellen .
Die Antworten werden Hinweise über das Ausmaß des polizeilichen Zugriffs auf die Bevölkerung geben und können Ausgangspunkt für individuelle Anträge auf Löschung und politischen Widerspruch sein .

U.S. Army commanders in Iraq had an advisory suicide prevention plan , but no mandatory steps to follow when dealing with at - risk soldiers like the one accused of killing five troops at a military mental health clinic last May , according to a review of military procedures .
Sgt. John Russell is accused of shooting and killing five soldiers after an altercation at a counseling center located on a U.S. base in Iraq five months ago .
ADVERTISEMENT
According to the Associated Press , the report found that no Army publication provides step - by - step details to a unit on how to implement a suicide watch and that security at the Combat Stress Clinic at Camp Liberty was “ inadequate . ”
“ It paints a picture of soldier less than two months from the end of his third deployment who began to show obvious signs of unraveling weeks before the clinic shootings , ” the AP noted .
“ The report describes a man whose problems were known and who received some counseling , yet at critical times did not appear to get the help he needed . ”
Russell ’s own unit was aware of his suicidal thoughts for at least three or four days before the tragedy , but there was no 24 - hour suicide watch on him until the morning of the shooting .
His fellow soldiers described him as saying he was “ sick and tired of life and believed everyone hated him . ”
A company commander told investigators that they did not have the personnel available to continuously monitor Russell , who was on his fourth visit to the mental health clinic the day the tragedy occurred .
The review says Russell ’s clinic visit the morning of the shooting was cut short when he became “ verbally non-compliant ” with clinic staff , who called military police for help .
The military police sent Russell back to his unit , but within an hour he took a loaded M - 16 rifle from another soldier , stole an SUV and went back to the counseling facility where he is alleged to have killed the five troops .

An Army Times article about the report says the investigation found that “ many of the patients seen by the center ’s staff are ‘ potentially violent , ' ” and there are “ inadequate locks ' ” on the clinic building ’s exterior doors .
“ Minor physical security improvements would have made the facility safer for the staff members and patients alike , ” the report found .
The report also noted communication difficulties for military police ; those officers had no policy about how to warn potential victims at the base of a credible threat and poor radio communication that forced them to meet in person to share information about the suspect .
As ObamaCare stays on life support , Americans will soon be enjoined in a new debate about the bills coming out of Congress .
There will be no prevaricating .
The bill will be out for all to see and Obama will own it .
Then the real discussion will start .
And here ’s Obama ’s starting line : $ 215 billion in new taxes on middle class families and small businesses .
Thats families making “ under $ 250,000 ” and breaks Obamas signature pledge .
59 % of voters oppose paying for health care this way .
63 % say making sure no one has to lose insurance is more important than the public option , and he has lost ground among non-college educated white men , college educated women , independents and partisan Democrats .
Now , couple that with the fact that soon the discussion will focus on how much the FDA is going to be running peoples health care and , oh yeah , did I mention ?
Nationalized Health Care is a violation of the Tenth Amendment !
Leftists scream rule of law all the time , but only apparently when it suits them .
Here ’s a reality check :
If this socialistic escapade becomes law , as soon as it does , it will be held up by lawsuits to every circuit court in the nation .
I ’m serious now .
Has anyone got a concrete argument about where the Federal Government gets the power to control the health care of the country , when any power not enumerated to the government is reserved to the states ?
Back up your contention with not only where such power comes from , but where that authority is referenced in legislation .
Happy Hunting !
Editors Update :
Following the lead of Arizona , Florida , and Michigan , in recent weeks legislators from Louisiana and Georgia announced that they were planning on introducing resolutions for State Constitutional Amendments that would allow the people of those states to effectively opt - out of any future national health care plan .
And now , Ohio joins them .
According to our friends at OhioFreeState.com , Ohio State Senators Grendell and Jones have introduced Senate Joint Resolution & ( SJR7 ) .
The resolution proposes :
“ to enact Section 43 of Article II of the Constitution of the State of Ohio to prohibit a law or rule from compelling a person , employer , or health care provider to participate in a health care system . ”
If passed by the Ohio legislature , the proposal will go directly to Ohio voters for their approval :
If adopted by a majority of the electors voting on this proposal at a special election held February 2 , 2010 , Section 43 of Article II of the Constitution of the State of Ohio shall take effect immediately .
The resolution in Arizona ( HCR2014 ) has already passed both the House and Senate , and in 2010 , Arizona voters will be the final voice on their proposed Constitutional Amendment .
In Florida and Michigan , similar resolutions have been introduced , but have yet to have formal hearing or debates .
Legislators in GA and LA announced that they ’ll be introducing similar resolutions in the 2010 legislative session .
And sources close to the Tenth Amendment Center indicate that more than 15 states will do the same in 2010 .

San Juan , Puerto Rico ( CNN ) --
A fire at a fuel storage facility that burned for three days and forced hundreds of Puerto Rico residents from their homes has been extinguished , fire officials said Sunday evening .
But some of the tanks continued to smolder and crews stood ready to fight another outbreak .
Hundreds of firefighters battled the blaze , which began with an explosion at the Caribbean Petroleum Corp. facility in Puerto Rico's Bayamon municipality , near San Juan , early Friday .
The initial explosion shook the ground with the force of a 2.8 - magnitude earthquake , authorities said , and flames shot into the air while plumes of thick , black smoke hovered over the region .
As the fire died , reporters and officials were able to witness firsthand the extent of the damage .
Seventeen tanks were destroyed by flames and the initial explosion .
Agents from the FBI and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives were investigating to determine whether the explosion was an act of sabotage .
The FBI is investigating graffiti found on two San Juan tunnels that referred to a fire , Special Agent Harry Rodriguez said Friday .
A spray - painted message on the tunnels , less than three miles apart , said : " Boom , fire , RIP , Gulf , Soul , ACNF . "
Caribbean Petroleum owns the Gulf Oil brand , but Rodriguez said he did not know what ACNF referred to .
Agents were at the storage facility and treating it as a crime scene , which is a routine designation .
Puerto Rico's governor , Luis Fortuno , said the main priority of his government is to counter any long - term effects of air and water pollution caused by the fire .
Representatives from the Environmental Protection Agency had been checking air quality near the fuel depot .
" We 're not finding levels that would be of concern , " EPA spokeswoman Bonnie Bellow said .
She said the fire had been so intense that it was " burning off chemicals that are part of the fuel . "
About 600 displaced people were in shelters on Sunday night , but many were being sent home .
Dr. Lorenzo Gonzalez , Puerto Rico's health secretary , said everyone at shelters and all the emergency personnel were vaccinated against the H1N1 flu virus as a precaution , given their close proximity to each other .
He said tests have been conducted on the air and water , and the results showed no reason for concern .
President Obama declared an emergency in Puerto Rico , which frees up federal aid .
Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States .
Fortuno said the blaze has cost the island at least $ 6.4 million .
The governor sought to allay fears over gasoline supplies .
Caribbean Petroleum owns 200 gas stations on the island and several inland distribution facilities , and supplies much of the island 's fuel .
Puerto Rico will receive 3.6 million gallons of regular gasoline , more than 1 million gallons of premium gasoline and more than 1 million gallons of diesel fuel to help make up for what may have been lost , Fortuno said .
The company has had violations of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act , the main law in the United States that deals with the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes , according to EPA spokeswoman Bellow .
Caribbean Petroleum is under a corrective - action plan , she said .
CNN 's Rafael Romo in San Juan and Arthur Brice in Atlanta , Georgia , contributed to this report .
Much about the war remains uncertain , because the Yemeni government has strictly barred journalists and independent observers from entering Saada Province , the center of the fighting .
Yet it is clear that the conflict has spread across much of Yemen ’s lawless north , swamping the few aid groups operating there .
As many as 150,000 people are now homeless , according to the United Nations refugee agency .
Many more remain trapped in Saada , where aid groups have no access at all , and supplies of food , water and fuel are growing scarcer .
The area is also flooded with weapons , which are so uncontrollable that the government used a major arms dealer as an intermediary with the Houthis .
Those who have escaped the war zone say the crisis is worsening .
“ If we had not fled our house , we would have been finished , ” said Mr. Abdullah , a lame and beaten - looking 60 - year - old who left his home in late September .
“ The house was in the middle of the fighting .
We came with the clothes on our backs , nothing else . ”
On the road south , Mr. Abdullah and others said , they were surrounded by other desperate families seeking safety .
Some are staying in temporary camps where aid groups are supplying food and water , but even those camps are being rapidly overwhelmed .
Many donors have been reluctant to give money , in part because of concerns about poor access and government corruption , according to aid officials in Sana , the capital .
It also seems clear that the Houthis ’ influence has steadily grown since the conflict first broke out in 2004 , largely because of the government ’s mistakes .
The Houthis began as a small band of mountain insurgents loyal to Hussein al - Houthi , a former member of the Yemeni Parliament .
They belong to a quasi- aristocratic subgroup of Zaydis who claim to be descendants of the Prophet Muhammad and who ruled the country for much of the past thousand years until 1962 .

The government ’s bombing raids , and its use of thuggish tribesman as a proxy force , infuriated the local population in Saada .
They began fighting alongside the Houthis after Mr. Houthi was killed in 2004 , and the battlefield extended to neighboring provinces .
Even more civilians have been killed in the latest round of fighting .
An airstrike last month left more than 80 people dead in the Harf Sufyan area , most of them reportedly women and children .
Rats crawl over piles of garbage .
Washing is hung out to dry under an electricity pylon .
Three donkeys peer over a fence improvised from rusted mattress springs .
A small boy rides inside a black rubbish bin that his father hopes will pass as a baby buggy .
Strewn with beer bottles , broken glass and giant cacti , this blasted landscape is the stuff of post - apocalyptic science fiction .
So perhaps it is no surprise that Chiawelo , a squatter camp in Soweto , is the backdrop to the hit sci - fi blockbuster of the summer .
District 9 is the story of aliens stranded in an impoverished South African township .
As their spaceship hovers above Johannesburg the aliens , whose physical appearance earns them the unflattering nickname " prawns " , live in squalid shacks behind barbed wire and barter with gangsters to satisfy their addiction to cat food .
The $ 30 m ( £ 18 m ) film , produced by Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson , was number one at the US box office in its first weekend and has grossed $ 90 m so far .
It is tipped to take Britain by storm when it opens this week after earning reviews as a thrilling allegory of apartheid and xenophobia .
It has also given the people of Chiawelo an unlikely place in film history .
The community , which lacks electricity and running water , gazed in wonder at the arrival of film crew and set - builders at their informal settlement .
The spectacle of actors dressed up as aliens caused surprise and even some alarm .
The convoy of trailers is now long gone and there are mixed feelings about the experience .
Some residents were grateful for the diversion and the money they received as extras .
They hope the film will raise awareness of their plight and force the government to help them .
Others , such as Sydney Mofokeng , 32 , say they are bitter and feel exploited .
Mofokeng , a sangoma – traditional healer – lives in a tiny one - room shack amid heaps of discarded shoes , toilet pipes and shredded mattresses .
He is unlikely to ever see the film .
Transport to the nearest cinema and the price of admission are beyond the reach of jobless residents forced to forage for firewood to keep warm .
" I 'd like to see it but I can't go without money , " he said .
" I used to go to the cinema but now I do n't have a job and transport is difficult .
I hurt my leg so it 's too far to walk . "
Chiawelo is a desolate place .
The rough , uneven landscape is dotted with rubble , cesspools and ramshackle buildings of concrete or tin .
One shack is made from slabs of cardboard and advertising signs .
Children play with plastic bottles in the dirt .
Shirtless men bend over water bubbling from a solitary communal tap .
The smiling face of President Jacob Zuma looks out from faded election posters on battered portable toilets .
Above it all tower electricity pylons and cactus plants and , on the horizon , a hot air balloon sponsored by a bank and designed like a football .
Just like the aliens in District 9 , the people here are set for relocation whether they like it or not .
And some do not .
Matilda Isaacs , 54 , lives in a metal and wood structure under a dusty canvas awning .
But the mother - of - four opposes plans to transfer her to government housing six miles away .
" We do n't want to move , " she said .
" We 'd like to stay here , we are happy here .
Rich men come and make films here . "
Sitting nearby , Johannes Maleleka , 39 , was less certain .
" We are suffering , " he said .
" We have nothing , not enough money to eat .
I sleep on the street and it's very cold in winter .
I would like a house . "
France Mokoene , 24 , added : " There are six of us in a shack .
It 's difficult because we sleep in a small room and do n't have much privacy .
I spend my days there or playing on the soccer field . "
Mokoene , who was paid R150 ( £ 12 ) a day as an extra in the film , said the producers had been in touch with him recently about making a sequel .
On the opposite side of the street are the brick houses and shops of modern Soweto , the township once synonymous with the privations of apartheid .
There have been steady but uneven improvements over the past 15 years , symbolised by the opening in 2007 of one of Africa 's biggest shopping malls .
This week sees the fifth annual Soweto wine festival , while the redeveloped Orlando stadium will be used as a training venue during next year 's football World Cup .
But crime remains a constant fear in forgotten corners such as Chiawelo .
Neill Blomkamp , District 9's first - time director , was afraid that the production 's convoy of vehicles would be a conspicuous target .
One night his driver was carjacked when attackers put a gun to his head .
" The people are warm , but the environment is so caustic and unbelievably disgusting to be in , " he said in a recent interview .
" Every single thing is difficult .
There 's broken glass everywhere … rusted barbed wire … the level of pollution is insane .
And then in that environment , you 're trying to be creative as well .
But of course , that gave birth to the creativity , so it kind of goes both ways . "
It is a daily reality for people living in " the real District 9 " .
Sylvia Khoza , holding her one - year - old daughter , Unathi , said : " This place is unsafe .
There is all kinds of criminality : robbery , rape , murder and all that .
The film - makers had a lot of security with them . "
Khoza , 24 , said the film had opened new doors for some .
" 90 % of people here worked on it .
Now some of them are working as actors .
The film helped people here to realise their talent . "
Sydney Mofokeng , however , was not so convinced .
" We are the people , " he said , " And we are still here . "
Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) , the libertarian - leaning congressman and failed 2008 GOP presidential candidate , has been suspicious of the Federal Reserve since before first entering Congress in 1976 .
In a 1981 article that mentioned the then - obscure legislator , United Press International reported that Paul " has proposed abolishing the Federal Reserve , repealing laws which make the dollar legal tender , and switching to currency issued by banks , 100 percent backed by gold . "
That was the year Paul first proposed a bill to audit America 's central bank .
He recruited 44 cosponsors , but the bill never made it out of committee .
The congressman introduced another bill to audit the Fed in 1983 and got less than half as many colleagues to sign on .
On another six occasions , Paul introduced bills that would have abolished the Fed entirely .
Those acts of legislative defiance accomplished nothing much besides giving the congressman a reputation as an eccentric gold obsessive , hectoring an institution that was seen by almost everyone , critics and supporters alike , as foundational to the functioning of the modern world .
Roll Call , a newspaper covering Capitol Hill , chided Paul after he won reelection to Congress in 1996 for his " idee fixe " of " a return to the gold standard , " which it described as a " rallying cry that has n't been a real issue since 1971 . "
What a difference an economic crisis makes .
In 2007 and 2008 , as Paul ran for president , the candidate found to his own surprise that his young - skewing crowds reacted to trash talk about the Federal Reserve more than any other element of his small - government , anti-war agenda .
So in 2009 , with many economists blaming the Federal Reserve at least partly for inflating a housing bubble whose crash continues to inflict the most economic damage seen in the U.S. for a quarter century , Paul started pushing another version of his " audit the Fed " bill , this one numbered H.R. 1207 .
And as of press time , the bill has attracted a remarkable 282 co-sponsors , more than a majority , giving it a nontrivial shot at passing through the House of Representatives .
H.R. 1207 would lift existing restrictions on what auditors from the Government Accountability Office are allowed to look into when examining the Fed 's books .
Specifically , the bill would allow investigators to report on the Fed 's dealings with foreign banks and nations , its " actions on monetary policy matters , " and the operations of its Federal Open Market Committee , the wing whose decisions most directly affect the U.S. money supply .
The legislation is cosponsored by every single Republican in the House as well as 105 Democrats .
For the first time in Paul 's long career of tilting at Alan Greenspan 's windmills , popular sentiment against the Federal Reserve has its chairman , currently Ben Bernanke , running scared .
Last summer Bernanke launched an unprecedented public relations campaign , explaining himself in venues from 60 Minutes to town - hall - style meetings broadcast on PBS .
In July testimony to the House Committee on Financial Services , Bernanke warned that H.R. 1207 would damage global trust in the Fed 's political independence and " could raise fears about future inflation , leading to higher long - term interest rates and reduced economic and financial stability . "
Paul , after shepherding his idea from fringe to mainstream , is almost giddy .
" Now the Federal Reserve is less popular than the IRS ! " the congressman told a July gathering of Young Americans for Liberty in Washington , D.C. " This issue is never going to go away .
Who would have thought a politician could talk about Austrian economics and get applause ? "
The Austrian Opposition
With its power over interest rates and the supply of U.S. dollars , the Federal Reserve System is the most influential economic institution on the planet .
That influence comes surrounded by an impenetrable aura of mystery .
Hardly anyone , citizen or congressman , completely understands what the Fed does , how it operates , or what the effects of its actions will be .
Here is a highly simplified outline .
The Fed is a set of 12 regional banks under the command of a seven - member board of governors appointed by the president and approved by the Senate .
Its 12 - member Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) — the board of governors plus five regional bank chiefs — is responsible for adjusting the federal funds interest rate , which is the rate banks charge each other for loans .
The FOMC does this through " open market operations , " buying and selling securities to affect the amount of money in the economy and thus the interest rate paid by banks to get more cash .
This process is hard enough to describe , let alone comprehend , and previous Fed chairmen have found it useful to keep their public pronouncements about the central bank 's operations maximally vague and obscure .
A classic from Paul Volcker , chairman from 1979 to 1987 : " We did what we did , we did n't do what we did n't do , and the result was what happened . "
Volcker 's successor , Alan Greenspan , who enjoyed the longest stretch of low - inflation prosperity in Fed history ( now widely seen as possibly laying the groundwork for the crash ) , helped reinforce both the central bank 's reputation for effectiveness and the expectation that its actions would remain inscrutable .
But these days the Federal Reserve faces challenges to both its power and its mystery , thanks to both hot public opinion and cold academic analysis .
Politicians are demanding a peek behind the curtain , and holdovers from Paul 's 2008 presidential campaign have kick - started an " End the Fed " movement .
Even within the central bank 's natural fanbase of economists and financiers , many are complaining about its appetite for regulatory power and its massive expansion of the money supply .
During the last year the Fed has nearly doubled the monetary measure over which it has the most direct control , the " monetary base " ( defined as circulating currency plus the reserves that commercial banks keep with Federal Reserve banks ) .
Signs abound that public sentiment is turning against the bank .
Meltdown , an anti-Fed tract by the historian Thomas Woods , sat on the New York Times bestseller list for more than a month .
Woods , like Paul , embraces the " Austrian " school of economic thought , which sees central banking as a recipe for endless inflation and constantly growing government .
Paul has invited him to Capitol Hill to brief a growing unofficial caucus of Republicans attracted to Paul 's hardcore anti-statism .
Fed bashing has been a prominent component of Tea Party gatherings nationwide .
The largely Paulite movement Campaign for Liberty has organized " contact your congressman " campaigns to get H.R. 1207 on representatives ' radar screens , and the results are pouring in .
" The bill has received as many cosponsors as it has in part because Dr. Paul 's presidential campaign really brought the Fed into the spotlight , opened people 's eyes , " Paul Martin - Foss , a legislative aide for Paul , writes in an email .
" There was also a lot of grassroots support , with numerous offices telling me that they had received a lot of mail about the bill and wanted more information . "
Colorado Democrat Betsy Markey specifically credits Tea Party pressure for getting her interested in the bill , which she decided to cosponsor .
" There 's a lot of anger from both sides of the aisle towards the Fed , not necessarily coming from the same position or working towards the same goals , " Martin - Ross writes .
" But everyone wants to be seen as being in favor of transparency . "
Paul recognizes that the growing support for auditing the Fed does not indicate similar enthusiasm for his more radical goal of abolishing the central bank .
He has introduced another bill to do just that , and it has yet to attract a single cosponsor .
H.R. 1207 supporters , by contrast , " sign on because it does n't do " anything like that , Paul says .
" It does n't direct policy changes .
I did that on purpose . "
Paul 's beef with the central bank is a by - product of his longstanding interest in the works of Austrian school economists , most prominently Ludwig von Mises and Nobel laureate F.A. Hayek .
Paul was a fan of Mises and Hayek before he entered politics in the mid-'70s , largely as a result of his reading the publications of the libertarian Foundation for Economic Education .
Paul , like the economists he admires , thought it a mistake to have a giant government - run institution trying to fix prices — in this case , interest rates , or the price of loaned money , which is the Fed 's main mechanism for pursuing its stated goals of economic growth , high employment , and relatively stable prices .
As a critic of state power , Paul also worries that once a government has total control over paper money that it can create at will , it becomes too easy and too tempting for the state to spend at will .
Cash unbacked by gold will flow to help the government out of its jams , pay for its wars , and appease its most powerful private constituents .
To Austrian - leaning libertarians like Paul , this danger makes the Federal Reserve , central banking , and " fiat " money the key libertarian issue .
If the government can manufacture all the money it wants , the fight for limited government is over before it begins .
Central to this critique is the Austrian business cycle theory , which helped win Hayek his Nobel Prize for economics in 1974 .
Hayek , Mises , and contemporary economists such as Roger Garrison of Auburn University and Steve Horwitz of St. Lawrence University argue that low interest rates set by the Fed fool investors and builders into thinking that consumer demand for future goods is higher than it actually is .
Cheap money makes producers more likely to launch long - term projects and take on long - term expenses .
When low rates are a product of government intervention , rather than a market expression of people 's desire for long - term goods as reflected in their willingness to save now in order to consume more later , those long - term projects — for example , building and buying homes — will turn out to be unsustainable " malinvestments . "
Prices in those areas will plunge .
Everyone will start to realize that resources were funneled to unprofitable ends .
An exaggerated boom will turn into a catastrophic bust .
Austrians believe increases in the money supply do n't always manifest in economy - wide rises in the consumer price index , the standard definition of inflation .
The excess cash might instead flow into specific areas of the economy , depending on real - world factors that vary from case to case .
In the housing boom and bust , those factors included mortgage lending standards , the actions of the government - created mortgage holders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and reckless securitization of mortgages .
In the Fed skeptics ' story about the last decade 's economic expansions and contractions , the housing bubble was a deliberate effort by the Fed to stave off economic troubles that began when the tech - stock bubble burst in 2000 .
Who Else Is Afraid of the Federal Reserve ?
A small but enthusiastic audience , largely connected with explicitly libertarian institutions , has kept the Austrian theory of Fed culpability alive in the decades since Mises and Hayek left the scene .
( Mises died in 1973 , Hayek in 1992 . )
But the Austrians are n't the only opponents of the Fed 's practices .
Although history tends to craft auras of inevitability around what exists , the Federal Reserve would have seemed an exotic and dangerous change in American monetary practice in the 19th century .
According to a popular
Fed creation myth , the bank , established in 1913 , brought an end to a chaotic , boom - and - bust environment of unregulated banking , replacing it with managed economic stability .
This story is widely believed despite the fact that America 's most severe banking crisis and economic downturn , the Great Depression , occurred two decades after the Fed was created .
As the popular historian ( and no Austrian ideologue ) Jack Weatherford wrote in his 1997 book The History of Money , " the final stripping of local banks of their power to control money came not because of financial failures but as a result of political movements to centralize power in Washington . "
Opposition to central banks and paper money runs strong through American history .
Many of the Founding Fathers came to despise paper currency after their experience with the quickly worthless Revolutionary War " continental . "
President Andrew Jackson crushed the Second Bank of the United States in 1832 in the name of the people .
President James Buchanan noted after an 1857 bank panic that " our existing misfortunes have proceeded solely from our extravagant and vicious system of paper money . "
The Civil War " greenback , " our first national government pure paper currency , was initially declared unconstitutional until a later Supreme Court bowed to political reality .
And then there was the debate over establishing the Federal Reserve itself , in which opponents such as Sen. Elihu Root ( R - N.Y. ) noted the dangers of a potentially unlimited money supply .
In the postwar era of normality and economic centrism , noisy mistrust of the Fed was the province of gold fanatics , radical libertarians , and financial newsletter writers and readers who saw the bank as a machine the government used to debase the currency and steal from the thrifty .
But the Fed also earned the ire of progressive leftists who saw it as the citadel of moneyed interests helping creditors at the expense of debtors by keeping inflation too low .
The critique , which was especially audible from the Volcker era forward , is exemplified by the progressive journalist William Greider 's best - selling 1987 book on the Fed , Secrets of the Temple .
It follows the grand tradition of the three - time Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan , who famously wanted to rescue indebted farmers through using cheaper and more abundant silver as money rather than crucifying them on a " cross of gold . "
During a time when the Fed actually lived up to its much - vaunted , often spurious " independence from political pressure " — when Paul Volcker was using the shock therapy of high interest rates and lower money supply growth to crush inflation in the early 1980s — the Fed came under political pressure from across the ideological spectrum .
Its critics included Sen. Robert Byrd ( D–W. Va. ) and Rep. Jack Kemp ( R - N.Y. ) as well as many members of the Reagan administration .
But for most of the tenure of Alan " Maestro " Greenspan , the Fed was broadly seen as doing little wrong .
Yet Paul discovered during his presidential bid that anti-Fed feeling had somehow morphed into a popular youth phenomenon .
At an Iowa campus stop in 2007 , the candidate and I expressed mutual wonder at the fact that his biggest applause line was not about ending the war but about reining in the Fed .
At other Paul events , I 'm told , kids burned Federal Reserve notes ( dollar bills to you ) to show their hostility toward the unrestricted and damaging flow of fiat currency .
As that flamboyant gesture indicates , anti-Fed feeling has long overlapped with powerful populist passions .
Sometimes that attaches itself to misleading history and misaimed anger .
Conspiracy theorists often cite the fact that the Fed is officially owned by its 12 private member banks as evidence that the whole system is a means for private bankers to mulct the public .
But in its creation , purpose , and function , the Fed is a branch of government .
Its board of governors is selected by the president and approved by the Senate , and most of its income ends up in the U.S. Treasury .
And contrary to claims that the law creating the bank was pushed through Congress in the dead of night before Christmas 1913 solely as a result of a banker 's conspiracy forged on Jekyll Island , the Fed arose from long public and congressional debate .
Opposing something that has long been deemed as essential as air tends to attract eccentric people with eccentric beliefs .
When I ask Ron Paul where this unexpected upsurge in youthful disdain for the Fed was coming from , he says the most important source was the website of the Mises Institute , an educational foundation for Austrian economics and libertarian political thought .
But beyond the economic arguments against fiat currency , Paul says the biggest feeders of popular fear of the Fed are the conspiracy - minded documentary America : Freedom to Fascism and radio host Alex Jones , staunch opponent of the New World Order .
In both cases Fed opposition is part of a general theory of sinister and subterranean forces struggling to keep Americans enslaved .
It certainly was no credit to the anti-Fed movement that Holocaust museum shooter James von Brunn had previously been arrested for attempting a " citizen 's arrest " of the Fed 's governors .
And when the U.S. Army Reserve issued a " Force Projection Advisory " in November 2008 specifically targeting that month 's anti-Fed protests for " situational awareness and recommended mitigation measures , " it allowed those on the fringe to feel validation that they were not only right all along but a genuine threat to their enemies .
But the profound effects of the Fed 's avowed purpose — manipulating interest rates and making paper currency — are damaging enough , at least for those who see its fingerprints all over the current crisis , to make more baroque conspiracy theorizing superfluous .
And when it comes to mistrusting the Fed , the Alex Jones crowd is not alone .
We 're All Austrians Now
Economists , pundits , and financial analysts are not exactly gathering by the hundreds in front of Federal Reserve buildings and chanting " End the Fed ! "
But it has become almost impossible to avoid respectable voices in respectable venues laying some of the blame for the economic crisis at the Fed 's discount window .
The Berkeley economist Brad DeLong , a popular blogger and former Clinton Treasury Department official who once dismissed Mises ' general monetary theory as " batshit insane , " still told this story in the October 2008 issue of the liberal American Prospect :
" The current financial crisis has its roots in Greenspan 's decision to keep interest rates very low in 2002 and 2003 to head off the danger of a deflation - induced double - dip recession .
… Six months ago , I would have said that his judgment was probably correct .
Today …
I can no longer state that Greenspan made the right calls with respect to the level of interest rates and the housing bubble in the 2000s . "
Fed bashing in a roughly Austrian style has gotten so popular that the theory 's opponents now feel embattled .
Scott Sumner , a monetary economist at Bentley University who writes the much - cited blog The Money Illusion , thinks the Federal Reserve was and is too tight with interest rates and money for optimal economic performance .
" As everyone knows by now , " Sumner complained in June , " the once kooky and discredited Austrian business cycle model has now become conventional wisdom . "
Blame - the - Fed sentiment now stretches across the spectrum of economic thought , from Keynesians such as DeLong to monetarists ( who generally want the bank to maintain a fixed rate of money supply growth ) .
In October 2008 , the monetarist Anna Schwartz , co-author with Milton Friedman of one of the most important books of monetary economics , A Monetary History of the United States , told The Wall Street Journal : " If you investigate individually the manias that the market has so dubbed over the years , in every case , it was expansive monetary policy that generated the boom in an asset .
The particular asset varied from one boom to another .
But the basic underlying propagator was too - easy monetary policy and too - low interest rates that induced ordinary people to say , well , it 's so cheap to acquire whatever is the object of desire in an asset boom , and go ahead and acquire that object . "
In February 2009 the Stanford economist John Taylor , a monetary whiz so influential that there is a rule for setting interest rates named after him , told The Wall Street Journal : " The Fed held its target interest rate , especially in 2003 –2005 , well below known monetary guidelines that say what good policy should be based on historical experience .
Keeping interest rates on the track that worked well in the past two decades , rather than keeping rates so low , would have prevented the boom and the bust . "
Even the Obama administration has gotten into the act .
" Monetary policy around the world was too loose too long , " Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner told PBS interviewer Charlie Rose in March .
" And that created this just huge boom in asset prices , money chasing risk .
People trying to get a higher return .
That was just overwhelmingly powerful . "
As with any issue in political economy , there 's disagreement .
There are a variety of arguments to parry or blunt the Austrian theory .
Former Federal Reserve Board economist Arnold Kling , for instance , argues that the modern world of money and credit is so convoluted , with so many avenues for the creation of money - like instruments outside of direct Fed control , that the Fed should n't be seen as the main villain in any credit - driven collapse .
At worst , Kling thinks , it 's a hapless bungler pretending to power it can never have .
Bryan Caplan , a libertarian economist at George Mason University , thinks people are generally too smart to be fooled enough by false interest rate signals that they precipitate an economic crisis .
And pinning even partial blame for the current economy on the Fed is different from questioning its legitimacy .
By limiting his bill to the narrow question of transparency , Paul is making it possible to create a broad political coalition that can agree the Fed needs to be kept in check without necessarily agreeing on why , or on what the Fed ought to be doing .
The Fed Forever ?
Despite the palpable momentum behind H.R. 1207 , the idea of inconveniencing the Fed with anything more severe than an audit still seems like a far - off fantasy .
Meltdown author Woods notes that , although many mainstream analysts are jumping on the Austrian bandwagon to explain the causes of the crisis , none of them are really embracing the Austrian solution of ending the Fed 's power to manipulate interest rates at will .
They just call for the power to be used more prudently next boomtime .
The Fed was an ideological and institutional response to a convincingly told story of crisis and solution — basically , that the 19th - century system of mostly private banks issuing their own mostly gold - backed paper was leading to too many small economic crises of the sort that used to be called " bank panics . "
Milton Friedman , a critic of central banking practice , at the same time dismissed attempts to return to a commodity standard such as gold .
One of his reasons was that it was " not feasible because the mythology and beliefs required to make it effective do not exist . "
But with best - selling books , activists in the street , members of Congress , and economists across the ideological spectrum casting aspersions on Fed practice , we may see the crafting of a new set of myths and beliefs .
In this time of political ferment , Stephen Axilrod , a longtime Federal Reserve staff director and monetary policy guru , has issued a memoir from MIT Press titled Inside the Fed .
Axilrod admits that Fed interest rate actions precipitated the crisis without letting that fact dent either his admiration for the institution or his belief in its necessity .
Still , Axilrod notes something that should encourage Fed skeptics of all varieties : that " a country 's monetary policy is almost necessarily limited by conditions generated from the political , philosophic , and social ethos of the time . "
We are now seeing attempts to move the ethos in an anti-Fed direction .
While it's hard to imagine an America without an institution that has become so central , it 's interesting to contemplate something former Rep. Eldridge Spaulding ( R - N.Y. ) said in 1868 , in the midst of the legal controversy over Civil War greenbacks : " No one would now think of passing a legal tender act making the promises of the Government … a legal tender in payment of ' all debts public and private . '
Such a law could not be sustained for one moment . "
What anyone would think can change dramatically .
Ron Paul , through his Fed audit bill , is trying to get his colleagues , and the American people , to change what and how they think about the central bank .
Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass. ) , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , told a Massachusetts town hall meeting in August that he believes the House will indeed pass H.R. 1207 in October .
All the anti-Fed agitation we 've seen in the last couple of years may eventually feel like a footnote if the current binge of monetary expansion creates something Americans have n't seen for a quarter century : substantial and painful inflation in the consumer price index .
For now , Bernanke is trying to assure Congress and the public that the Fed governors are skilled and knowledgeable enough to know when they need to " neutralize " the new money by , for example , selling bonds to the market and essentially swallowing the money back up before prices spike .
But the Fed does n't have a stellar track record of timing monetary shifts with scientific precision , and any actions that rein in inflation , thereby cutting off the short - term stimulative effect that governments love , are bound to be politically dangerous both to the Fed and to the president who appoints its overseers .
As Bernanke admitted at his televised town hall meeting in July , the Fed can maintain its independence only if it can " show that we are producing good results , " and while he added lip service to independence , the people he must show those results to are Congress and the administration .
Though he was appointed to a new four - year term in August , if he flubs inflation , Bernanke will be facing a whole new wave of political attacks .
More generally , the Fed 's independence is threatened by a growing understanding that the Austrian interpretation of central banking 's risks might be correct : Keeping interest rates too low for too long can precipitate severe economic busts .
" It 's hard to imagine the little spark that can make big change , " says Austrian business cycle theorist Steve Horwitz , " but it can happen if the drumbeat stays going .
The Fed was created by Congress , so we wo n't get major change until members of Congress perceive their constituents or people with political , cultural , and social power saying there 's something really seriously wrong here . "

Date - rape drug ?
No dear , you just had too much to drink
Date - rape drugs are largely an urban myth used as an excuse by women who booze themselves into a stupor , it has been claimed .
They are willing to ' hide behind ' the idea that a stranger poured poison in their drink - rather than face up to the fact that they had simply been binge drinking .
Interviews with more than 200 female students in and around London revealed they often mistakenly linked sickness , blackouts and dizziness to poisoning by a stranger , when excessive alcohol consumption is much more likely to be the cause .
Urban myth : Young women who fear they have been poisoned with a date rape drug have often just drunk too much alcohol , researchers say
Dr Adam Burgess , from the University of Kent school of social policy , said rumours about the prevalence of date - rape drugs were little more than an urban myth .
This led young women to underestimate real risks of alcohol misuse , which can include impaired judgment putting them at risk of sexual assault .
' The reason why fear of drink - spiking has become widespread seems to be a mix of it being more convenient to guard against than the effects of alcohol itself and the fact that such stories are exotic - like a more adult version of " stranger danger " . '
The study , published in the British Journal of Criminology , found that three quarters of students identified drink - spiking as leading to an important risk of sexual assault - more than drinking too much alcohol .
Drink tampering was rated as a more significant factor in sexual - assault than drug taking , being drunk or walking at night in a high - crime area .
More than half of those in the survey said they knew someone who claimed to have had drugs slipped into their drink .
But despite such popular beliefs , police have found no evidence that rape victims are commonly drugged with substances such as rohypnol .
Dr Burgess said : ' There have hardly been any cases where it has been proved that sedatives such as rohypnol and GHB have been used in a rape incident .
Yet it has been a storyline that has appeared in virtually every TV soap .
' Maybe that tells us something about the programmes these women are watching .
But it is concerning that women are more concerned about something that is incredibly unlikely ever to happen to them . '
Posted by Jerome a Paris on October 12 , 2009 - 10:25 am in The Oil Drum : Europe
Just over one year after it became impossible to deny that the financial crisis that had started in 2006 / 2007 was a major , systemic event , it is rather depressing to see that nothing has really changed and , to the contrary , if anything has , it is for the worse .
The most striking item , of course , is the continued dominance of politicians by bankers .
Banks are universally seen - including by bankers - as being at the heart of the problem , and having created the crisis through reckless behavior and worse .
And yet , after having being bailed out at a staggering cost , in a highly asymmetrical way ( the losses were socialised , but not the banks ) , not only have they managed to eliminate the likelihood of any meaningful regulatory change , but more importantly they have managed to maintain the fiction that finance was the reason for earlier prosperity and should thus be protected as a source of future prosperity .
The crash has not made anyone question the quality ( or reality ) of the previous boom , but rather made them wistful for these times .
Thus , the dominance of the finance sector on the economy and the airwaves has not changed one bit : we still worry about the stock market , it 's still financial analysts and economists that drive the public debate , we 're still talking about " reforms " of entitlements or the labor market as if these were the main problem today , and public policy largely avoids the big looming issues of resource depletion and climate change .
BAGHDAD ( AP ) 
The war in Iraq was truly an American - only effort Saturday after Britain and Australia , the last of its international partners , pulled out .
Little attention was paid in Iraq to what effectively ended the so - called coalition of the willing , with the U.S. — as the leader of Multi-National Force , Iraq — letting the withdrawals pass without any public demonstration .
The quiet end of the coalition was a departure from its creation , which saw President George W. Bush court countries for support before and after the March 2003 invasion .
" We 're grateful to those partners who contributed in the past and we look forward to working with them in the future , " military spokesman Army Lt. Col.
Mark Ballesteros told The Associated Press in an e-mail .
At its height , the coalition numbered about 300,000 soldiers from 38 countries_ 250,000 from the United States , about 40,000 from Britain , and the rest ranging from 2,000 Australians to 70 Albanians .
But most of the United States ' traditional European allies , those who supported actions in Afghanistan and the previous Iraq war , sat it out .
It effectively ended this week with Friday 's departure of Australian troops and the expiration of the mandate for the tiny remaining British contingent after Iraq 's parliament adjourned without agreeing to allow the troops to stay to protect southern oil ports and train Iraqi troops .
The U.S. military , though , said the withdrawals did not mean it was going it alone in Iraq .
" We have n't lost our international partners .
Rather , there are representatives from around the world here in various capacities such as NATO , military advisers , law enforcement and construction workers , " said Army Col .
John R. Robinson , a military spokesman at the U.S. headquarters outside Baghdad .
Australia 's military commander in the Middle East , Maj. Gen. Mark Kelly , said Friday the last 12 Australian soldiers who had been embedded with U.S. units were flown out of Baghdad on Tuesday , three days ahead of the deadline .
A security detachment of about 100 soldiers will remain to protect embassy personnel .
Britain withdrew its remaining 100 to 150 mostly Navy personnel to Kuwait , though was hopeful they might return .
" We are exploring with the Iraqi Government the possibility of resuming some or all of our planned naval activity in advance of ratification , " the British Defense Ministry said in a statement released Saturday .
The coalition had a troubled history and began to crumble within months of the U.S. - led invasion as many countries faced political and social unrest over an unpopular war .
Critics said the tiny contingents that partnered with the coalition , such as Estonia , Albania and Romania , gave the U.S. token international support for the invasion .
Mass protests were held in many countries , including Spain , which was one of the most notable withdrawals from the coalition .
In 2004 , a bombing attack in Madrid linked to Islamic extremists helped overturn the political establishment in Spain and the new leadership pulled out the Spanish troops .
By January 2007 , the combined non-U.S. contingent had dwindled to just over 14,000 .
By October 2007 , it stood at 20 nations and roughly 11,400 soldiers .
The U.S. military , meanwhile , has increased its focus on redefining its relationship with Iraq under a security pact that took effect on Jan .
1 . American combat forces withdrew from Iraq 's urban areas at the end of June and all troops are to withdraw by the end of 2011 , according to the agreement .
President Obama has ordered the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops by Aug. 31 , 2010 , leaving roughly 50,000 troops to train and advise Iraqi security forces .
" Today is a normal day for our forces currently in Iraq , " Robinson said , " because our business is already tied closely to our bilateral partnership with the Iraqis . "

Labour has spent the last week gurning about how unlucky it is with the media , the political weather and much else .
But now comes proof that Lady Luck favours no one : it was not , despite the claims of some Tories , anything other than bad luck for David Cameron that the Irish vote on Europe coincided with the start of his conference .
And so , here we go , back to the future .
It seems half a lifetime ago that Westminster was boiling with abstruse - sounding rows about Maastricht , sovereignty and weighted voting systems , with Tory MPs hurling abuse at each other .
Yet with the Irish vote removing the last major obstacle to the Lisbon treaty , it 's hard to see how David Cameron can avoid returning to the blood - soaked old battlefield .
The Czechs and the Poles have n't signed up yet , but yesterday the Czech prime minister , Jan Fischer , said he believed his country would ratify the treaty by the end of the year .
Cameron 's hopes that the treaty could be delayed until after the British general election look extremely slim .
So the question facing the Tory leadership is quite clear : if , by next May , the Lisbon treaty has come into force and Europe has a new president , quite possibly Tony Blair , will Cameron keep his promise to hold a referendum ?
Yes or no ?
It 's a straightforward question .
He knows that to do so would risk a huge row with the rest of Europe , and a fully operational treaty would be harder to unpick than one not yet signed .
That 's why until now he has used the weaselly words that , if the treaty is signed , he would " not let matters rest there " .
Cameron also knows that many in his party , not least his would - be successor Boris Johnson , will push for a referendum and have the support of much of the media too .
If Cameron appears to want to renege on his promise , he will provoke fury and rebellion on his own side .
For now , his " wait and see " gambit is beginning to look indecisive .
If he were Gordon Brown , he would undoubtedly be accused of dithering .
At the same time , Cameron is worrying about another referendum , one which may prove no less momentous for the future shape of Britain .
He faces a two - sided constitutional struggle , looking south towards Europe – but also north towards the Scots .
The nightmare for Cameron is that , once George Osborne has revealed details of the cuts imposed by Tory Westminster on Scottish budgets , the SNP start to gain momentum for their proposed independence referendum .
Alex Salmond , Scotland 's first minister and nobody 's fool , has been watching the Conservative agendas on cuts and on Europe with fascination .
His strategy for a referendum will be fleshed out on 30 November , St Andrew 's Day , and it 's likely he will try to get the vote in the spring or autumn of 2010 , presumably when news about public spending cuts is causing maximum anger .
It is n't easy for the SNP in Edinburgh 's " parliament of minorities " because , although they are the largest party , there is a clear Labour - Lib Dem - Tory majority against a referendum .
But things are n't as simple as they seem .
For one thing , the SNP are well ahead of Labour in the polls , while the Tories ' situation remains dire .
Cameron may be cleaning up across England , and even in Wales ; but he cannot expect more than one or two MPs from Scotland .
His plan for cutting the number of Westminster seats to 500 will inevitably further weaken the Scottish link .
So the argument about independence and the SNP referendum will take place at a time when Labour in Scotland is horribly weak , and when the Tories themselves seem to lack legitimacy there .
Salmond has been menacing about the likely consequences for these parties if they go into an election for the Edinburgh parliament in 2011 as the politicians who refuse to let the people of Scotland speak .
It 's a volatile situation .
The way Salmond describes his future Scotland is carefully calculated .
He has been wooing the financiers and banks to rebuild Scotland 's place as a financial centre .
And he speaks , again and again , about the importance to Scotland of Europe .
This is crucial because it connects to the Tories ' coming war against European federalism .
As Cameron , William Hague and the others get into a battle over the constitution and the future of Europe , the Scottish government will be offering itself as a pro-European bastion , just as the Irish did – and nobody knows better than Salmond what a huge financial benefit that once won for Dublin .
Many Tories will say , of course , that all this is absolutely fine .
According to them , the Scots have been a revenue - sapping bunch of whingers for years , whose main export to England seems to have been politicians and journalists .
An independent Scotland means a Tory majority in England way into the distant future .
And it makes standing up to the EU easier , in many ways , because Eurosceptic opinion is particularly strong in England .
What 's the problem ?
Well , according to those who know him well , Cameron sees this as a definite problem .
I 'm told he loathes the idea of being the last ever prime minister of the United Kingdom .
He would see the loss of Scotland as a huge blow to Britain 's status in the world , including inside the EU and Nato , and would fight very hard to stop it happening .
Last Friday , as a first step , he told the Scottish Sun he would " govern Scotland with the respect it deserves " and promised regular visits to answer questions .
Cameron is surely right to be concerned .
If the prospect of an all - out confrontation with the rest of the EU is unsettling to middle of the road opinion , the end of the UK is much more so .
What do you call the country that remains ?
It is n't England , quite , because there is also Wales .
Does it stay a Diminished Britain , a Little Britain , whose flag is a simple spider of red lines on white ?
Trident , of course , goes because the naval bases in Scotland go .
What about the currency ?
If the euro is circulating just north of Newcastle and Carlisle , the pound will feel more embattled .
Hardly anybody in England seems to be talking about this .
There is little about it scheduled for the fringes and mainstream speeches at Manchester .
Compared to public spending cuts and the deficit , it may seem marginal .
But if you want a glimpse into how different life might feel under Cameron , and what an unfamiliar country we may be tiptoeing into , the very future of a UK inside Europe is a good place to start .
The world turned upside down : the person in charge of prosecuting criminals has rushed to the defence of the panoply of human rights law that leads to a stream of villains heading out of the Old Bailey , wreathed in smiles , to carry on their lives of crime .
Keir Starmer , director of public prosecutions , has objected to the idea of repealing the Human Rights Act 1998 , denying it is a charter for criminals or " un-British " .
This is a clear reference to Conservative policy on what Tory spokespeople always call " Labour 's Human Rights Act " – at least , when they are n't laying the blame for it at the feet of " Europe " .
David Cameron would prefer a thoroughly British American - style bill of rights .
The clauses of this important piece of Conservative legislation are not yet available .
But it will be good , because Cameron has been thinking about it for at least three years .
He is not the first to have considered these matters .
In medieval England there was a strong feeling that common law and the liberties it enshrined had become hidebound by arcane legal points and procedural niceties that let villains ( mostly villeins ) off the hook .
The medieval answer was the star chamber which could bring speedy judgment to bear , particularly in cases of treason .
It also had the advantage of putting the accused to torture .
That speeded up justice no end .
We do n't overtly do that sort of thing any more of course , so maybe we need something a little less rigorous than the Human Rights Act .
Perhaps something that emphasises our obligations to the state rather than just the outmoded rights and freedoms due from the state .
That at least is the view of the Conservative liberty forum 's 2006 essay , A British Bill of Rights & Obligations .
This gives some examples of obligations that might appear in such a document : respect for your parents , obeying " legitimate commands of the authorities " , duty to work , observing moral requirements , strengthening national independence – presumably including not resorting to foreign bodies such as the European court of human rights ( ECHR ) .
When it comes to rights , judges would be able to look at people 's claims " in context " .
Fulfil your obligations and you might get your rights .
Unlike Cameron 's putative bill the Human Rights
Act is not a series of things the Labour government thought might be a good idea .
It is an act : " to give further effect to rights and freedoms guaranteed under the European convention on human rights " .
These are not new rights nor are they " Labour's " .
They were arrived at by the Council of Europe in 1950 in the aftermath of the second world war , informed by the realisation that even in advanced and democratic nations fundamental rights are fragile .
They are the rights of individuals vis-a - vis the state , which had shown itself not to be a bastion of such freedoms .
Britain , Cameron will be pleased to know , was a proud founder member of the council and enormously important in drawing up the convention .
We signed it in 1950 ; we ratified it in 1951 ; we brought it into force in 1953 .
Unfortunately we were a little late to the party when it came to enacting these rights in our own legislation .
Broadly the effect of the 1998 act was that citizens could access the provisions of the convention in Britain rather than having to go all the way to the ECHR in Strasbourg .
So it 's terribly pro-British , keeping legal work in Britain – British jobs for British judges – saving on air fares , hotel costs , interpreters .
Even if the act were repealed , that would not stop Strasbourg 's foreign influence in the sovereign British nation state .
Our signature on the document would stand and could not be expunged without some complex constitutional upheaval .
Our word is our bond , in that terribly British phrase .
All that repeal would mean is that people in Britain would be faced with two almost inevitably contradictory documents as a source of our fundamental rights : Cameron 's musings in the form of his bill of rights ; and the real thing in the European convention .
Indeed , paradox of paradox , the bill of rights would be subject to convention rights – convention compliant , in the legal jargon .
It would be confusing ; it would be inefficient ; it would be expensive ; and it would be just plain silly .
Also while searching through Dahon ’s site for the post about their new bikes showing at Interbike , I found this : The Dahon Pango Folding Bicycle Helmet .
Designed as a smart looking and easily packable helmet for commuters , Dahon ’s VP Joshua Hon said Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Most cycling helmets used by urban riders are either based on performance racing helmets or skating helmets .
We saw the need for a cycling helmet that addressed the specific needs of the urban cyclist .
Urban cyclists are often on and off their bikes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ getting coffee , stopping to chat with friends , or popping into a store for an errand Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ but what do they do with their helmets ?
They can either hang the helmet off their handlebars where itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s vulnerable to theft , clip the helmet to the outside of their bag where it dangles and catches on things , or simply walk around holding a sweaty helmet .
But the Pango folds small enough to fit into just about any bag .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
Hot helmet folding Video action and more details after the break …
The folding helmet also features replaceable panels on the top and rear that allow tuning for function or fashion .
Riders heading out into the rain need only replace the perforated grid panel with the solid rain panel to help keep their heads dry .
Multiple color options will be available .
The name Pango is derived from Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ pangolin , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  an animal found in the jungles of Malaysia that has hard plates covering its back .
When threatened , it rolls into a ball for protection .
The Pango helmet adjusts for head sizes between 55 - 61 cm and meets EN and CPSC safety requirements .

It won a Eurobike award this year as one of the best products of more than 400 entries .
Tim Geithner 's getting ready to shovel more taxpayer money down the rat hole , this time to GMAC .
GMAC , in case you 're in understandable denial , has been bailed out twice already .
And now Tim Geithner wants to shovel another $ 2.8 billion in .
What is the US taxpayer getting in exchange for all these GMAC bailouts ?
Preferred stock .
Why are we getting preferred stock , which is neither a claim on the future upside of the company 's equity , nor a senior debt security that will be completely repaid in the event that taxpayers finally get mad as hell and wo n't take it anymore ?
Because Tim Geithner is worried that if he makes the folks who voluntarily lent money to GMAC -- the bondholders -- lose so much as a cent , the entire US economy will collapse .
If Tim Geithner feels it is absolutely critical that he shovel more taxpayer money into this paper - shredder or else even fewer people will buy " the new GM " 's cars , or if Tim Geithner concludes that now that he has already put so much taxpayer money on the line that he has to keep shoveling good money after bad to postpone the inevitable until after he has taken his job at Goldman Sachs , then there is presumably nothing that anyone will be able to do to stop him .
Tim Geithner developed his bail - out - everyone strategy two years ago , before he even took over Treasury , and he 'll presumably be damned if he 's going to modify that strategy now .
But if we raise enough of a fuss , maybe we can force Tim to reconsider the terms so we do n't get completely screwed again .
Instead of a preferred security , which is subordinate to all GMAC debt , we want a SENIOR BOND .
A bond that will be paid off FIRST in the event that Tim finally gets the boot and GMAC collapses .
We also want a big helping of WARRANTS to compensate us for the risk we 're taking .
In addition to interest , we deserve upside -- the same upside that any private - market savior would demand .
How about it , Tim ?
Please ?
Griffith 's Aboriginal Research Fellow Dale Kerwin said the task was a difficult one , and until questions were asked of the Commonwealth Department of Veterans ' Affairs and the Australian War Memorial by brisbanetimes.com .au this week , there had been little interest in tracking the trackers .
" It 's like looking for a needle in a haystack , " Dr Kerwin said .
" I 've written to the Prime Minister and the premier of this state asking for some financial assistance and nothing is coming .
" They 've wished me all the best and I 've applied for grants all over the place but no one is interested in this story . "
Fought between the British and colonial forces and the Dutch - descended free settlers - or Boers - the Boer war saw extensive use of guerrilla tactics by the settlers and brutal use of force by the British .
The British tried any method to reduce the advantages the Boers had in using guerrilla warfare including officially condoned murder of Boer prisoners by Australian Lieutenant Henry ` The Breaker ' Morant .
In 1902 , the head of colonial forces , Lord Kitchener , asked Australia 's first Prime Minister Edmund Barton to send indigenous bushmen with knowledge of hunting and tracking to act as scouts to locate Boer fighters .
When Australian forces withdrew later that year , the four trackers are thought to have been left behind , forced to live out their days on foreign soil .
We were seen as less than human in those days .
We were less than the flora and the fauna at the time and government was just waiting for us to die out .
Dr Kerwin believes the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 - known as the White Australia Policy and which prevented non-white landing - was to blame .
It meant the men would have had to have applied to return home and funded their own passage .
" No one cared , " Dr Kerwin said .
" We were seen as less than human in those days .
We were less than the flora and the fauna at the time and [ the Australian Government ] were just waiting for us to die out . "
Dr Kerwin has enlisted the help of a UK researcher to help with the project , scouring war archives across two continents .
Indigenous historian and author David Huggonson has also provided some assistance on the valuable role the trackers played in the war effort .
In his book The Black Trackers of Bloefontein , Huggonson recounts the story of an Aboriginal man known only as Billy who tracked five British officers across the South African veldt ( or open plain ) proving the abilities of the trackers by finding all the men and bringing back evidence of their presence .
" The tracker , first stating that the men had chosen their various routes ... described how one had got off his horse and had then proceeded to light his pipe , producing the half burnt match to prove it , " Huggonson wrote .
" One man whom the boy describes as a `silly fellow ' because he had gone in his socks , had cut his foot at one point , and gone lame for the rest of the journey ; a piece of fluff from a sock was brought back as one proof . "
So impressive were the bushmen 's skills , Australian officers in South Africa at the time had wagered on their abilities to win a bet with the British .
Dr Kerwin believes the trackers came from North Queensland and may have been drawn from the Queensland mounted police force due to their required skills in weaponry , horsemanship and military discipline .
After being contacted by brisbanetimes.com.au on Friday , Gary Oakley , curator at the Australian War Memorial and head of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Veterans and Services Association of Australia , said the memorial was keen to investigate the plight of the lost men .
" The project we are working on at the moment is to try and document all indigenous Australians who ever served in the defence force or worked for the defence force in a capacity such as trackers or auxillaries , " he said .
" We would be very interested in their story .
These people were employed by defence for a specific purpose and basically the Australian Government let them down . "
Dr Kerwin said he wanted to raise the profile of the contribution of Aboriginal Australians in some of the nation 's most historic events .
" At school when we do history and presentations to our peers its all about the dominant cultural history and it does n't give [ indigenous Australians ] any self esteem from the contribution we 've made , " he said .
" We 've made a lot of contributions : these men who went to the Boer War and the capture of Ned Kelly just to name a couple . "
‘ We all make mistakes ’ : Obama accepts apology after Republican calls him a liar during Congress healthcare reforms speech
President Barack Obama says he accepts Republican Joe Wilson 's apology for shouting ‘ You lie ! ’ at him during his speech to Congress on Wednesday .
Mr Obama said Mr Wilson apologised ‘ quickly and without equivocation . ’
He added that he is a big believer that ‘ we all make mistakes . ’
Mr Wilson , a South Carolina Republican , shouted at Mr Obama during his speech on plans to fix the health system , which was delivered in the House chamber .
Outburst : Joe Wilson shouts out ' You lie ' at Barack Obama as the US president defends his health care reform package to Congress
The outburst was an extraordinary breach of decorum for which Mr Wilson swiftly apologized .
Mr Obama addressed the incident with reporters after meeting with his Cabinet on Thursday .
Mr Wilson apologised after his outburst afterwards , saying : ‘ I let my emotions get the better of me . ’
Despite this , he was criticised by both Democrat and Republican leaders .
Well done , Mr President : Senators congratulate Obama on his speech
' His behaviour was disrespectful , ' said former Republican presidential candidate John McCain .
' There is no place for it . '
Vice President Joe Biden said Mr Wilson 's outburst ' demeaned the institution ' .
A key message in the 45 - minute speech was the President 's insistence that ' the time for bickering is over ' .
Washington analysts suggested 62 - year - old Mr Wilson 's ' insult ' could backfire on the Republicans , who were cast by Mr Obama as more interested in killing healthcare reforms than improving the system .
See Obama 's reaction to the attack here
Embedded video from CNN Video
Tempers have been running high over plans to overhaul America 's healthcare system .
By addressing a joint meeting of U.S. Congress , Mr Obama was hoping his televised speech would allay fears he was going to ' nationalise ' health services .
To rapturous applause from Democrat lawmakers , Mr Obama said : ' I am not the first President to take up this cause , but I am determined to be the last . '

Mr Wilson 's slur could be heard clearly in the chamber in response to the President 's remark that his health insurance proposals would not provide benefits to illegal immigrants .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi directed a fierce frown at Mr Wilson , who spent much of the rest of the speech with his head down consulting his Blackberry before bolting from his seat as soon as it finished .

The so - called Obamacare option has caused uproar across the country and led to Republican opponents of the President 's plan making unflattering comparisons with the NHS .
Mr Obama stopped short of insisting that a controversial - government - run insurance alternative - must be part of the final bill .
He hinted he was amenable to refining that part of the plan , which has been a lightening rod for criticism from Republicans who accused him of trying to nationalise the country 's primarily private health system .
With wife Michelle watching in the packed chamber alongside Edward Kennedy 's widow , Vicki , the President put a $ 900 billion price tag on his plan over the next decade .
He underlined the need for urgent action to control the nation 's spiralling health costs .
Barack Obama smiles as he pauses while delivering his historic speech
' If we do nothing , our deficit will grow , ' he said .
' More families will go bankrupt .
More businesses will close .
' More will lose their coverage when they are sick and could die as a result . '
The President hit out at ' scare tactics ' that have derailed his hopes for bipartisan support .
He singled out ' bogus ' claims by former Republican vice president candidate Sarah Palin that his plan includes the formation of ' death panels ' with ' the power to kill off senior citizens ' .

Q&A : What are main points in Obama 's healthcare reform plan ?
HOW WOULD THE HEALTHCARE REFORMS BE PAID FOR ?
Obama said the plan would not add to the U.S. budget deficit , but did not offer many specifics on how it would be financed .
He said it would be paid for by eliminating hundreds of billions of dollars in waste and fraud , as well as subsidies in Medicare that go to insurance companies .
The rest of the cost would be covered by revenues from drug and insurance companies , Obama said , and the plan would charge insurance companies an unspecified fee for their most expensive policies .
It will include a provision requiring more spending cuts if promised savings do not materialize .
It would create an independent commission of doctors and medical experts charged with identifying more waste in the years ahead .
DOES THE PLAN CREATE A PUBLIC OPTION ?
It proposes a not - for - profit government - run healthcare insurance program to be part of new ' insurance exchange ' and compete with private insurers .
The public option - which has been strongly resisted by insurance companies - would be available only to those without insurance .
Obama said less than 5 percent of Americans would sign up for it , based on Congressional Budget Office estimates .
The public option would not be taxpayer subsidized , and would have to be self - sufficient and rely on premiums it collects .
The insurance exchange , a marketplace where individuals and small businesses would be able to shop for health insurance , would take effect in four years .
Obama said customers would benefit because they would bargain with insurers as a large group .
The plan would provide need - based tax credits for those who could not afford insurance from the exchange .
WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES ?
The plan would make it illegal for insurance companies to deny healthcare coverage because a customer has a pre-existing condition , or to drop or water down coverage to those who get sick .
Insurance companies would also be barred from placing annual or lifetime caps on coverage .
It would also limit how much Americans could be charged for out - of - pocket expenses and require insurance companies to cover , at no extra charge , routine check - ups and preventive care like mammograms and colonoscopies .
But the plan would also greatly expand insurance companies ' customer base by requiring individuals to carry basic health insurance .
It would also require that businesses offer workers healthcare , or chip in to cover the cost for their workers .
There would be a ' hardship waiver ' for those who still could not afford coverage , and 95 percent of small businesses would be exempt from the requirements .
WHAT HAPPENS BEFORE THE INSURANCE EXCHANGE STARTS ?
Because it would be four years before the exchange starts , the government would offer low - cost coverage to those who cannot get insurance because they have pre-existing conditions , to protect them against financial ruin if they become seriously ill .
Obama said that plan was proposed by Senator John McCain , his Republican rival in the 2008 presidential election .
DOES THE PLAN CAP MALPRACTICE SUITS ?
Many Republicans have asked that Obama 's healthcare plan limit or cap malpractice awards .
Obama did not offer any such caps or limits .
He said he was proposing that 'we move forward on a range of ideas , ' on malpractice suits .
He said that his predecessor , Republican President George W .
Bush , considered authorizing demonstration projects in individuals states to test ways to limit doctors ' fears of lawsuits , and said he was directing his Secretary of Health and Human Services to move forward on that initiative .
The following clarification was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Tuesday 18 August 2009
Burma , Iceland and Sweden were juxtaposed with Samoa in the article below about a Samoan plan to change to driving on the left .
To clarify : the switchover in the first three countries four decades ago was from left to right .
Burma switched sides in 1970 , Iceland in 1968 and Sweden in 1967 .
Now the Pacific island of Samoa wants people to switch from right to left when driving on the road , sparking protests and fears of chaos when the rule change comes in next month .
Samoans have driven on the right side of the road for more than a century , like their neighbours in American Samoa .
But the prime minister , Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi , wants to put an end to the import of costly left - hand - drive cars , particularly big American " gas- guzzlers " , and to encourage the 250,000 Samoans who live in Australia and New Zealand , where people drive on the left , to send cars home .
A new political party was formed last year to challenge Tuilaepa over the switchover .
Some villages have announced that they will refuse to allow any cars in unless they drive on the right , raising the prospect of traffic mayhem when the plan comes into effect on 7 September .
People Against Switching Sides ( Pass ) , an action group , has launched a legal challenge , to be heard by the courts today , claiming the switch is unconstitutional because the government cannot guarantee Samoans ' right to life .
" People will die as a result of this , '' said Dr Biopapa Annandale , the group 's chairwoman , in a recent interview with the Australian Associated Press .
Car dealers say the move will cripple them .
One dealer , who imports Hyundai cars from South Korea , said his annual sale of 250 cars stopped the day it was announced .
Samoa 's chamber of commerce has predicted financial turmoil , estimating it will cost the economy at least 790 m Samoan tala ( £ 196 m ) .
German police are investigating a kebab sauce after it was used in an attack .
Reuters reports that the condiment was thrown at the victim after a dispute over napkins .
When the salesman in Bremen refused to give the customer a napkin , he wiped his hands on the kebab cart .
The salesman then threw a ladle of chilli sauce at him .
The victim's eyes became bloodshot and police took a sample of the sauce .
" Legally , the question of whether the spiciness of the kebab sauce constituted ' normal ' or grievous bodily harm must be addressed , " a police spokesperson said .
Officers are also trying to determine the cause of the argument .
Both men could end up facing charges .

It takes 17 times more land to feed American pets than would be required by solar farms producing enough electricity to meet all the demand in the United States .
Why do we know this ?
A new book by Robert and Brenda Vale , two architects at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand , looked into the ecological foodprints of the world 's pets , New Scientist reported .
By examining the land and resources necessary to produce the meat and grains that compose pet food they discovered something startling :
It takes more than 90,000 square feet of land ( that 's two whole acres ) to feed a medium - sized dog and 16,000 square feet of land to feed a cat .
The Humane Society estimates Americans own about 75 million dogs and 88 million cats .
We did the math and found that feeding those animals takes about 294 thousand square miles of land .
That 's a little bigger than Texas !
That got us thinking , because a favorite criticism of solar power has been to attack the amount of land it requires relative to nuclear or fossil fuel plants .
Disingenuous or not , the idea that solar takes up too much land is widespread .
For example , Senator Lamar Alexander , R - Tenn. , a long - time nuclear supporter , decried " energy sprawl " in a Wall Street Journal editorial last month .
The amount of land required to generate electricity for the nation does sound like an awful lot , sometimes .
One recent calculation led by Vasilis M. Fthenakis , an environmental engineer at Columbia University 's Center for Life Cycle Analysis , found that you 'd have to cover 16,602 square miles ( .pdf ) of land in the southwestern desert with solar energy converters like cadmium telluride photovoltaic panels to generate the 3,816,000,000 megawatt - hours of electricity used in the United States every year .
( Other estimates have found smaller solar land needs . )
That 's why it 's important to compare solar 's land requirements with other American practices .
Multiply anything by the scale of the United States and the numbers start to sound absurdly big .
When feeding our pets takes 17 times more land than feeding our supposedly rapacious electricity demand , it 's difficult to argue that energy sprawl , for solar , is a major problem .

WASHINGTON , United States —
A best - selling author and an Oscar - nominated actress are among those who have called for religious freedom in Iran , including an end to the persecution of Baha 'is in that country .
Some 1,400 people heard Azar Nafisi , author of " Reading Lolita in Tehran , " and Shohreh Aghdashloo , Academy Award - nominated actress for " House of Sand and Fog , " speak at a public gathering this month at George Washington University 's Lisner Auditorium .
Both Dr. Nafisi and Ms. Aghdashloo were born in Iran , and neither is a member of the Baha 'i community .
Dr. Nafisi spoke passionately about the common humanity of all people and the suffering of one being the suffering of all .
She particularly focused on minorities in Iran and pointed to the example of the Baha 'is .
" I ask myself , " she said , " how does it feel to be deprived of every single basic human right in a country you call your own , in a country where you have been born into the language and the culture , a country where your parents and your parents ' parents ... have lived and contributed to , what does it mean to be deprived of the right to education , of the right to property , of even the right to life ? "
She said the struggle is " not a political struggle , it is an existential one . "
It goes beyond the Baha 'is , she said , to " every single person in Iran who dares to be different , who dares to express his or her desire for the freedom to have a choice . "
" Baha 'is in Iran have become the canaries in the mine , " she said .
" You want to know how much freedom the Iranian people enjoy today , you go to the fate of its Baha 'is . "
Depriving people of their individuality is a way of killing them , she said .
" It is worse , in fact , than just being plainly murdered .
To deny your humanity , your individuality , is to be dead . "
" The show trials that have been going on in Iran – all these people coming from such different backgrounds , such different ages , such different political and religious beliefs , all of them deprived of their individuality , " she said .
The defendants , she said , were forced into confessing that " whatever they believed in , whatever lifestyle they led ... was a farce and sham .
That is another way of killing people . "
Ms. Aghdashloo , addressing the gathering via video from Los Angeles , said everything she had " ever read or understood about the Baha'i Faith " is that it stands for the oneness of humanity and inherent nobility of all human beings .
" I stand with many others around the world in conveying our unified voice in support of the Baha 'is in Iran and wish to speak out against the ongoing and deplorable actions of the Iranian government , " she said .
The event in Washington , held on 12 September , was dedicated to the Baha 'is who are jailed in Iran , including the seven " leaders " who have been detained in Tehran 's notorious Evin prison for more than a year on trumped - up charges of " espionage for Israel , insulting religious sanctities , and propaganda against the Islamic republic . "
It was one of a number of gatherings held in recent months across the United States to offer prayers for the prisoners , including events in Los Angeles , San Francisco , and now Washington .
In San Francisco – at the Herbst Theatre , where the United Nations Charter was signed in 1945 – Dr. Abbas Milani , director of the Iranian Studies program at Stanford University , was the principal speaker .
" For Iran , the treatment of the Baha 'is in the last 150 years , our society 's acts of omission and commission , what we said and did or failed to say and do , all create an embarrassing blot of shame on our history , " he said .
" Iran ca n't become a democracy unless it has had a full reckoning with its Baha 'i problem , " he said .
" Iran ca n't be a democracy unless the Baha 'is are considered full citizens of the society and their faith – like those of Zoroastrians , Jews , Christians , Muslims , or members of any other faith , belief , or even disbelief – is recognized as a private matter where the state , social institutions , or actors have no right of inquiry , interference , or harassment . "
In Washington , one of the speakers was Dwight Bashir , associate director for policy at the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom .
He quoted from U.S. President Barack Obama 's speech in Cairo earlier this year , directed to the Muslim world : " People in every country should be free to choose and live their faith based upon the persuasion of the mind and the heart and the soul .
This tolerance is essential for religion to thrive , but it 's being challenged in many different ways .
...
Among some Muslims , there 's a disturbing tendency to measure one 's own faith by the rejection of somebody else 's faith . "
" The last part of President Obama 's statement is exactly what we are witnessing in Iran today , " Dr. Bashir said .

By putting sensors in the brains of mice as they ran through a Quake - derived virtual reality , scientists have found a way to study neurological activity in moving animals .
The setup allows for real - time , almost - real - motion tracking of single neurons .
That feat has eluded researchers who have a fuzzy , general understanding of brain systems , but little knowledge of how individual cells actually work .
They hope that cell - level details will make sense of motion , cognition and other complex mental functions .
" One of the major research areas of neuroscience is the development of techniques to study the brain at cellular resolution , " said Princeton University neuroscientist David Tank , co-author of the study published Wednesday in Nature .
" The information of the nervous system is contained in the activity of individual neurons . "
Tank 's team studied hippocampal place neurons , which are activated when an animal is in a particular location in its environment .
Ever since hippocampal place neurons were identified 40 years go , scientists have wondered exactly what mechanisms make them fire .
However , the fMRI machines used to study brain activity in humans only measure the average output of millions of neurons at once .
Studying individual neurons has been possible in cell cultures , but brains in a dish behave different than real , living brains .
Tracking individual neurons in moving animals has been impossible .
" The neurons move back and forth while you 're trying to measure things , " said Tank .
" So we developed a way to keep the head fixed in space , but still have mice perform behaviors that are usually studied in mice running through a maze . "
Tank 's team designed an apparatus in which a mouse , its head firmly held in a metal helmet , walks on the surface of a styrofoam ball .
The ball is kept aloft by a jet of air , so that it functions like a multidirectional treadmill .
Around it are sensors taken from optical computer mice , which read the ball 's movement as the mouse runs .
Those readings were the input for the researchers ' virtual reality software — a modified version of the open source Quake 2 videogame engine , tweaked to project an image on a screen surrounding the mouse .
Tank called it " a mini-IMAX theater . "
Mice in the study ran through a virtual maze designed in the open source Quake game editor , but rather than earning points or power - ups , they were rewarded with sips of water from a head - side nozzle .
Into the hippocampus of each mouse the researchers inserted a glass capillary just one micron wide at its tip and filled with salt water .
Known as a whole - cell patch recorder , it detects electrical currents as they pulse through individual cells .
" It is difficult to overstate the importance of understanding how the dynamics of electrical activity within single neurons is related to firing patterns among collections of neurons that accompany the performance of complex tasks , " wrote Douglas Nitz , a University of California at San Diego cognitive scientist , in a commentary accompanying the findings .
Scientists have proposed at least a half - dozen models of individual neuron behavior to explain the general firing patterns of hippocampal place neurons , whose general behavior is determined by a creature 's specific spatial location .
Tank 's team found that individual neurons fired in staccato bursts of varying intensity , a result that fits one of the proposed models .
Those results are likely of interest only to neuroscientists , and " to be fair , more work is needed to nail this down , " said Tank .
Nitz was less reserved , calling the observations " an exciting result " that " may prove generalizable to other brain structures , in particular the cerebral cortex . "
But he too was especially excited by the virtual reality - harnessing methodology .
The findings are " a first payment on the promise of the technique , " and " represent a powerful example of what will be learned in decades to come , " wrote Nitz .

Das endgültige Ende von Quelle : Tod eines Versandhändlers
Auf einer Betriebsversammlung teilt der Insolvenzverwalter mit , dass es keine Hoffnung für eine Rettung von Quelle gibt - eine persönliche Niederlage für Horst Seehofer .
Man könnte erwarten , dass sich an so einem Tag die Wut Luft macht , dass da hunderte aufgebrachter Mitarbeiter mit Pfeifen trillern und mit eilig gebastelten Transparenten wedeln .
Aber nichts von alledem gibt es am Stadtrand von Nürnberg , nur Sarkasmus .
Ob sie gerade den Film " Der Untergang " drehen , fragt ein Mitarbeiter die Kamerateams .
Eine Frau hat ein blaues Werbefähnchen aus besseren Zeiten mitgebracht .
Darauf steht in fröhlicher Schreibschrift " Quelle sagt Danke " .
Die meisten Mitarbeiter sagen gar nichts , als sie die Treppe hinab zum Personaleingang des Quelle - Kaufhauses strömen .
Drinnen wird ihnen an diesem Nachmittag in einer Betriebsversammlung verkündet , dass es ihr traditionsreiches Versandhaus bald nicht mehr geben wird , dass alle Hoffnung umsonst war ; dass nun auch die 6.600 verbliebenen Beschäftigten vor der Arbeitslosigkeit stehen könnten und damit alle der vormals 10.500 Jobs verloren gehen .
" Nach intensiven Verhandlungen mit einer Vielzahl von Investoren sehen Insolvenzverwalter und Gläubigerausschuss keine Alternative zur Abwicklung von Quelle Deutschland mehr " , verkündet der Insolvenzverwalter Klaus Hubert Görg trocken .
Die Banken hätten die Finanzierung des Versandgeschäfts über den 1 .
Januar hinaus nicht mehr übernehmen wollen .
Das sei aber eine Bedingung der Kaufinteressenten gewesen .
" Es ist aussichtslos " , sagt Gesamtbetriebsratschef Ernst Sindel .
FOLGEN FÜR DIE KUNDEN
Kann ich als Kunde bei Quelle noch bestellen und werde ich die Ware auch erhalten ?
" Man kann bestellen und die Bestellung wird bearbeitet " , sagte der Sprecher des Insolvenzverwalters , Thomas Schulz , am Dienstag .
Solange die Ware im Lager verfügbar sei , werde auch noch geliefert .
Schwierig werde es mit Nachbestellungen .
Was passiert , wenn ein Kunde schon bezahlt , die Ware aber noch nicht erhalten hat ?
Laut Schulz wird die Ware ausgeliefert , wenn sie verfügbar ist .
Andernfalls werde der Kunde zum Gläubiger .
Vorkasse sei aber nur ein kleiner Teil beim Versandhandel , in dem das Ratenkreditgeschäft die Hauptrolle spiele .
Bin ich als Kunde dann möglicherweise jetzt meine Ratenverpflichtungen los ?
Nein , denn Quelle hat seine Forderungen an die Banken abgetreten .
" Diese werden wohl kaum auf Geld verzichten wollen " , erklärte der Sprecher .
Wie steht es um den Kundendienst ?
Schulz : " Während der Abwicklung wird der technische Kundendienst Profectis möglicherweise aufrechterhalten .
Vielleicht gibt es auch einen Käufer dafür .
Dem Kunden bleibt in jedem Fall die Herstellergarantie . " ( dpa )
Ministerpräsident Horst Seehofer ( CSU ) spricht am Nachmittag von einem " schweren Schlag für die Region Nürnberg / Fürth " und beteuert : " Wir haben nichts unversucht gelassen und das Menschenmögliche getan , um Quelle eine Fortführungschance zu geben . "
Das Quelle - Desaster ist auch ein Scheitern der Politik .
Als im Sommer bei Quelle und dem Mutterkonzern Arcandor die Krise akut wurde , eilte er nämlich in die Konzernzentrale nach Fürth , versprach Hilfe und posierte mit dem Quelle - Katalog .
Die Opposition lästerte schon damals , Seehofer gehe es eher um wahlkampfwirksame Bilder denn um die Rettung von Arbeitsplätzen .
Zumal sich auch Seehofers Parteifreund , der Bundeswirtschaftsminister Karl - Theodor zu Guttenberg , zunächst zurückhielt .
Erst mit wochenlanger Verzögerung vergaben die Länder Bayern und Sachsen mit dem Bund einen Massekredit über 50 Millionen Euro , der nach der Insolvenz am 1 .
September den Betrieb bis zum Jahresende sicherstellen sollte .
Bayerns SPD - Chef Florian Pronold findet nun , die CSU habe nicht genug getan .
Guttenbergs Zögern habe Investoren verschreckt .
Die Politik der CSU sei " blanker Zynismus gegenüber den Mitarbeitern gewesen " , sagte Pronold dem Münchner Merkur .
Um Quelle fit für den Verkauf zu machen , entließ der Insolvenzverwalter seit dem Sommer 3.900 Mitarbeiter .
Seehofer zimmerte eilig eine Auffanggesellschaft und kündigte ein Strukturprogramm für die Region an .
Eigentlich ist für solche Maßnahmen Wirtschaftsminister Martin Zeil von der FDP zuständig .
Doch die CSU lästerte , dessen Ministerium sei " überfordert " .
Auf die Realisierung der versprochenen Wohltaten warten die Menschen in Fürth und Nürnberg aber noch heute .
Auch als es Quelle noch gut ging , lag die Arbeitslosenquote in Nürnberg und Fürth mit 8 Prozent doppelt so hoch wie der bayerische Durchschnitt .
Die Abwicklung hat derweil schon begonnen .
Im Quelle - Kaufhaus am Rand von Nürnberg drängen sich die Schnäppchenjäger .
Wo einst volle Regale standen , sind heute leere Wände .
Dazwischen stehen Wühltische , von der Decke hängen Werbeschilder für radikale Rabatte .
In der Konzernzentrale in Fürth erinnern nur noch zwei kleine blaue Quelle - Fähnchen an den frühen Stolz .
Insolvenzverwalter Görg will nun profitable Unternehmensteile verkaufen : Spezial - Versandsparten wie Hess Natur oder Baby Walz .
Oder den Homeshopping - Kanal HSE 24 .
Für den
Rest sieht es düster aus .

LOS ANGELES ( AP ) --
The astronomers who claim to have discovered the 10th planet in the solar system have another intriguing announcement :
It has a moon .
While observing the new , so - called planet from Hawaii last month , a team of astronomers led by Michael Brown of the California Institute of Technology spotted a faint object trailing next to it .
Because it was moving , astronomers ruled it was a moon and not a background star , which is stationary .
The moon discovery is important because it can help scientists determine the new planet 's mass .
In July , Brown announced the discovery of an icy , rocky object larger than Pluto in the Kuiper Belt , a disc of icy bodies beyond Neptune .
Brown labeled the object a planet and nicknamed it Xena after the lead character in the former TV series '' Xena : Warrior Princess . ''
The moon was nicknamed Gabrielle , after Xena 's faithful traveling sidekick .
By determining the moon 's distance and orbit around Xena , scientists can calculate how heavy Xena is .
For example , the faster a moon goes around a planet , the more massive a planet is .
But the discovery of the moon is not likely to quell debate about what exactly makes a planet .
The problem is there is no official definition for a planet and setting standards like size limits potentially invites other objects to take the ' ' planet ' ' label .
Possessing a moon is not a criteria of planethood since Mercury and Venus are moonless planets .
Brown said he expected to find a moon orbiting Xena because many Kuiper Belt objects are paired with moons .
The newly discovered moon is about 155 miles wide and 60 times fainter than Xena , the farthest - known object in the solar system .
It is currently 9 billion miles away from the sun , or about three times Pluto 's current distance from the sun .
Scientists believe Xena 's moon was formed when Kuiper Belt objects collided with one another .
The Earth 's moon formed in a similar way when Earth crashed into an object the size of Mars .
The moon was first spotted by a 10 - meter telescope at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii on Sept. 10 .
Scientists expect to learn more about the moon 's composition during further observations with the Hubble Space Telescope in November .
Brown planned to submit a paper describing the moon discovery to the Astrophysical Journal next week .
The International Astronomical Union , a group of scientists responsible for naming planets , is deciding on formal names for Xena and Gabrielle .
