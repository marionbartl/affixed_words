There 's a gem of a story — one of many — in Leander Kahney 's new book , Inside Steve 's Brain , about the biggest OS X mistake Apple never made :
The original plan UI was to take the old crusty crap interface from Mac OS Classic and drop it on top of the core .
Thankfully Steve Jobs called the entire UI team a " bunch of idiots " and they used the beautiful tech demo mockups as the basis for what you see on leopard 's OS today .
Close call , eh ?
After buying NeXT , Apple had to figure out how to turn NeXT - step into a Macintosh operating system .
At first , the job looked so big that Apple 's programmers decided they should take the old interface in Mac OS 8 and try to graft it on top of the NeXT - step codebase ...
" We assigned one designer to OS X , " he recalled .
" His job was pretty boring : make the new stuff look like the old stuff . "
But Razlaff thought it was a shame to put an ugly facade on such an elegant system , and soon , had designers creating mockups of new interface designs ... to show off advanced technologies under NeXTstep 's hood .

Jobs called Razlaff into a meeting before ever seeing the prototypes , immediately called them " a bunch of idiots " and complained about the old Mac interface .
One of the things he hated most were all the different mechanisms for opening windows and folders .
There were at least eight different ways ...

The meeting ended with Jobs and Razlaff , now a creative at Frog Design , figuring out how to fix the UI issues , and Jobs asked for the mockups to be made into prototypes .
Three weeks later Jobs dropped a compliment on the man .
This is the first evidence of three - digit intelligence at Apple I 've seen yet .
And this was just the start .
And over the next few weeks , Jobs and Ratzlaff 's team would meet once a week where the CEO would pore over mockups and code based executions , pixel by pixel , until the UI was done .

I got through a copy of Leander 's book this weekend , and to my delight it was very fact , quote and anecdote dense , not only relying on many previous interviews but lots of original reporting , as well .
( Like the story above . )
There are people at Portfolio complaining that Jobs did n't participate in the book , but anyone who knows anything about Jobs knows that he does not typically comment on these projects .
What you 'll find is some crossover with previous historical treatments by other authors , but put together in a unique way .
Leander 's does not dote on the history or sequence because it is organized by , well , mannerisms of Steve 's Brain , dissecting how the man thinks between many anecdotes like the one above .
The book is pretty good at highlighting the evidence of his genius , chalking up the control - freakiness that he has a rep for as a strategy .
( As a comparison , his Pixar is relatively open with news . )
But I would have liked a little more discussion here about one or two things .
Like Apple TV 's lack of support for DivX , while Jobs is lauded for being open to new business models even if they threaten old ones , for example .
But this is a minor point — the book covers a lot of ground and does it over a nice stretch ; to about the time where the iPhone launched plus the SDK and bricking debacles .

And even though it 's meant for business nerds , who is to say that we all could n't use a little bit more evil / genius ?
One could use this as a guide to pretending to be Jobs , at work , at home , and in bed I mean at work .
I call everyone here on staff a friggin idiot every day , and it seems to be working ok .
CHEN WHERE ARE MY TPS REPORTS !?
And of course , there are dozens of new interesting stories in the book like the one above .

P.S. Leander adds " please buy my book . "
I told him I 'd just photo copy the whole thing and mail it by US Postal to whoever wants a copy and send him the bill for the stamps .
That might take awhile , so if you want , pick up a copy before then .

P.P.S. BoingBoing 's Rob B. did this funny treatment of the book .
You 'll have to see it for yourself .
Almost one year ago , in April 2007 , Matthew C submitted the following suggestion for an Overcoming Bias topic :
" How and why the current reigning philosophical hegemon ( reductionistic materialism ) is obviously correct [... ] , while the reigning philosophical viewpoints of all past societies and civilizations are obviously suspect — "
I remember this , because I looked at the request and deemed it legitimate , but I knew I could n't do that topic until I 'd started on the Mind Projection Fallacy sequence , which would n't be for a while ...
But now it 's time to begin addressing this question .
And while I have n't yet come to the " materialism " issue , we can now start on " reductionism " .
First , let it be said that I do indeed hold that " reductionism " , according to the meaning I will give for that word , is obviously correct ; and to perdition with any past civilizations that disagreed .
This seems like a strong statement , at least the first part of it .
General Relativity seems well - supported , yet who knows but that some future physicist may overturn it ?
On the other hand , we are never going back to Newtonian mechanics .
The ratchet of science turns , but it does not turn in reverse .
There are cases in scientific history where a theory suffered a wound or two , and then bounced back ; but when a theory takes as many arrows through the chest as Newtonian mechanics , it stays dead .
" To hell with what past civilizations thought " seems safe enough , when past civilizations believed in something that has been falsified to the trash heap of history .
And reductionism is not so much a positive hypothesis , as the absence of belief — in particular , disbelief in a form of the Mind Projection Fallacy .
I once met a fellow who claimed that he had experience as a Navy gunner , and he said , " When you fire artillery shells , you 've got to compute the trajectories using Newtonian mechanics .
If you compute the trajectories using relativity , you 'll get the wrong answer . "
And I , and another person who was present , said flatly , " No . " I added , " You might not be able to compute the trajectories fast enough to get the answers in time — maybe that 's what you mean ?
But the relativistic answer will always be more accurate than the Newtonian one . "
" No , " he said , " I mean that relativity will give you the wrong answer , because things moving at the speed of artillery shells are governed by Newtonian mechanics , not relativity . "
" If that were really true , " I replied , " you could publish it in a physics journal and collect your Nobel Prize . "
Standard physics uses the same fundamental theory to describe the flight of a Boeing 747 airplane , and collisions in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider .
Nuclei and airplanes alike , according to our understanding , are obeying special relativity , quantum mechanics , and chromodynamics .
But we use entirely different models to understand the aerodynamics of a 747 and a collision between gold nuclei in the RHIC .
A computer modeling the aerodynamics of a 747 may not contain a single token , a single bit of RAM , that represents a quark .
So is the 747 made of something other than quarks ?
No , you 're just modeling it with representational elements that do not have a one - to - one correspondence with the quarks of the 747 .
The map is not the territory .
Why not model the 747 with a chromodynamic representation ?
Because then it would take a gazillion years to get any answers out of the model .
Also we could not store the model on all the memory on all the computers in the world , as of 2008 .
As the saying goes , " The map is not the territory , but you can't fold up the territory and put it in your glove compartment . "
Sometimes you need a smaller map to fit in a more cramped glove compartment — but this does not change the territory .
The scale of a map is not a fact about the territory , it 's a fact about the map .
If it were possible to build and run a chromodynamic model of the 747 , it would yield accurate predictions .
Better predictions than the aerodynamic model , in fact .
To build a fully accurate model of the 747 , it is not necessary , in principle , for the model to contain explicit descriptions of things like airflow and lift .
There does not have to be a single token , a single bit of RAM , that corresponds to the position of the wings .
It is possible , in principle , to build an accurate model of the 747 that makes no mention of anything except elementary particle fields and fundamental forces .
" What ? " cries the antireductionist .
" Are you telling me the 747 does n't really have wings ?
I can see the wings right there ! "
The notion here is a subtle one .
It 's not just the notion that an object can have different descriptions at different levels .
It 's the notion that " having different descriptions at different levels " is itself something you say that belongs in the realm of Talking About Maps , not the realm of Talking About Territory .
It 's not that the airplane itself , the laws of physics themselves , use different descriptions at different levels — as yonder artillery gunner thought .
Rather we , for our convenience , use different simplified models at different levels .
If you looked at the ultimate chromodynamic model , the one that contained only elementary particle fields and fundamental forces , that model would contain all the facts about airflow and lift and wing positions — but these facts would be implicit , rather than explicit .
You , looking at the model , and thinking about the model , would be able to figure out where the wings were .
Having figured it out , there would be an explicit representation in your mind of the wing position — an explicit computational object , there in your neural RAM .
In your mind .
You might , indeed , deduce all sorts of explicit descriptions of the airplane , at various levels , and even explicit rules for how your models at different levels interacted with each other to produce combined predictions —
And the way that algorithm feels from inside , is that the airplane would seem to be made up of many levels at once , interacting with each other .
The way a belief feels from inside , is that you seem to be looking straight at reality .
When it actually seems that you 're looking at a belief , as such , you are really experiencing a belief about belief .
So when your mind simultaneously believes explicit descriptions of many different levels , and believes explicit rules for transiting between levels , as part of an efficient combined model , it feels like you are seeing a system that is made of different level descriptions and their rules for interaction .
But this is just the brain trying to be efficiently compress an object that it cannot remotely begin to model on a fundamental level .
The airplane is too large .
Even a hydrogen atom would be too large .
Quark - to - quark interactions are insanely intractable .
You can't handle the truth .
But the way physics really works , as far as we can tell , is that there is only the most basic level — the elementary particle fields and fundamental forces .
You can't handle the raw truth , but reality can handle it without the slightest simplification .
( I wish I knew where Reality got its computing power . )
The laws of physics do not contain distinct additional causal entities that correspond to lift or airplane wings , the way that the mind of an engineer contains distinct additional cognitive entities that correspond to lift or airplane wings .
This , as I see it , is the thesis of reductionism .
Reductionism is not a positive belief , but rather , a disbelief that the higher levels of simplified multilevel models are out there in the territory .
Understanding this on a gut level dissolves the question of " How can you say the airplane does n't really have wings , when I can see the wings right there ? "
The critical words are really and see .
“ I was like , ‘ this guy is way too young looking , short , with too high a voice to run for Congress . ’
Then I talked to him for 10 minutes and I thought , this motherfucker might just do it . ”
2006 .
Unrated .
Out on DVD .
On - demand on Netflix .
Directed by Frank Popper .

When I was a freshman at Washington University in St. Louis , I had an awesome TA who taught my American Politics discussion section — he was energetic , articulate , knowledgeable and told great stories .
But on the first day of class , when he walked in , standing about 5 ’ 3 ″ , looking about 16 with a tie two sizes too big , and then started talking with a slight lisp , I thought , “ you have got to be kidding me . ”
Within five minutes though , Jeff Smith converted me and the rest of the class , and eventually his popularity in our department was unmatched .
In 2004 Jeff decided to run for Congress , adding his name to a crowded field of contenders for the seat left open by the retiring Rep.
Dick Gephardt , despite having no money , little support , no name recognition , and going against Russ Carnahan , a member of Missouri ’s version of the Kennedys and the son of the late Gov. Mel Carnahan and U.S. Senator Jean Carnahan .
I knew that if anyone could overcome these odds , and the fact that he does n’t look or sound like a typical candidate , it would be Jeff .
The 2006 documentary Can Mr. Smith Get to Washington Anymore ?
follows
Jeff ’s campaign from start to finish , following him as he canvasses neighborhoods for votes , speaks in front of small groups in homes and coffee shops , and works out of his first campaign headquarters in what could be best described as a shithole .
As his campaign and student volunteer army grows and becomes more effective , we see him wrangling for endorsements , calling donors and voters and dealing with the media .
Obviously , knowing him and seeing many of my classmates , including those from my initial TA section , working for him , gave me a natural interest in the subject material .
But this is a story that really transcends that and holds a much more universal appeal .
Everyone loves an underdog and a David / Goliath story , and Jeff Smith is about as much of an underdog as you can get .
Not only that , but the film gives you a great look at how a campaign works and the realities of politics and political establishments in this country .
The film is often frustrating as Jeff struggles to break through against a far inferior candidate with name appeal , but ultimately it gives you hope .
The raw idealism of Jeff and his campaign workers and the effectiveness of grassroots campaigning is enough to convince even a cynic like me that change is truly possible .
It is an inspiring , often funny , always enthralling , emotional roller - coaster of a story — a documentary at its best .
The production values are not too high , but Popper does a good job editing and presenting a pretty fair picture of Jeff — we do see him crack a couple of times under pressure — without idolizing him .
But mostly , the story here speaks for itself .
Can Mr. Smith Get to Washington Anymore ? is a fascinating movie and anyone with an interest in politics should check it out .
It ’s available on DVD , and if you ’re a Netflix subscriber you can watch it for free online .
Of all the movies I ’ve reviewed thus far , it may not be the best , but it would be my most highly recommended .

We can't say we 'd follow in this guy 's footsteps for any amount of money , but boy , does it make for fantastic drama .
Shortly after the famed Zune Guy ( you know , that cat with a trio of Zune - inspired tattoos ? ) decided to legally change his name to " Microsoft Zune , " the plan was put on hiatus after hearing that it cost a whopping $ 500 to get a name swap .
After getting curious , investigating and discovering that he only needed $ 150 to have it done , he put the mission squarely back on the front burner .
Unfortunately , there still stands a chance of the aforesaid name being denied , so he 's posted up a poll in order to let the general public give him a list of backups .
Personally , we 're feelin ' McZunin .

OTTAWA–There is a curious twist in the history of some long - serving Canadian prime ministers and their reputations .
They come to office with one reputation and – fairly or unfairly – gain the opposite one .
Pierre Trudeau was all about ideas and not concerned about being liked ; he is most remembered for his charisma .
Brian Mulroney wanted to be liked , but his policies such as free trade and the GST is what endured .
Jean Chrétien was the little guy from Shawinigan who came to be viewed as a dictator ; Paul Martin was the supremely competent finance minister who was castigated in power as indecisive and a ditherer .
And now , we have Stephen Harper , who marked two years this week since being sworn into office .
That 's long enough to see whether the twist applies to him , too , despite his best efforts to remain scripted , aloof – and unknowable .
It 's hard to imagine now , but Harper actually used to speak quite often to reporters , casually and off the record .
As a young Reform MP on Parliament Hill in the early to mid-1990s , he was known as one of the most media - friendly members of the caucus – a regular on political panels and a reliable sounding board for off - the - record insights about the state of his party and politics in general .
He did not like political - image affectation .
It was Harper who blew the whistle on his boss , then Reform leader Preston Manning , for the party - financed wardrobe allowance .
Contrast this to the Harper , as boss , who now has a makeup artist on retainer , a hostile stance to the media , and whose attention to shallow political optics is so acute that he rarely appears in public without backdrops and props .
Most incredulous , for those who knew the more low - key , rather humble Harper , there 's the bizarre photo gallery that has recently come to grace the government lobby in the Commons – pictures of the Prime Minister in various action poses , replacing all the old photos of former prime ministers .
" Now that surprises me , " says Deborah Grey , the woman who was the first Reform MP in the House of Commons , who hired Harper as her aide in 1989 .
Grey , like most of Harper 's cabinet , cannot claim she is particularly close to him these days .
Harper keeps a tight leash on his cabinet and discourages participation in much of the socialization that is part of Ottawa life .
For the most part , Grey finds Harper is the kind of prime minister she thought he would be .
As her right - hand man , he was smart , cerebral , strategic ; the qualities Grey believes he 's parlayed into his current position as Canada 's longest - serving Conservative prime minister in a minority government .
Sometimes , when Grey is watching the news , she sees vivid reminders of the Harper she 's always known .
" It 's just the look in his eye that he 's going to do it .
He has his face set – focused , intent , " she says .
In her travels in her post - political life , Grey says she 's often asked what Harper really is like .
She says she tells folks that he's not as hard and distant as his public persona , that you have to see him with his wife , Laureen , and two children to take the real measure of the man .
But the most vivid picture the public 's seen on that score was the now famous one , shortly after his election win , when Harper shook the hands of his children to send them off to school .
When Harper left elected politics in 1997 , disenchanted with the whole Ottawa scene , he went to work at the National Citizens ' Coalition , an unapologetically right - wing advocacy group known for its crusades against political excess , especially MPs ' pensions and rampant government spending .
Gerry Nicholls worked there then , and assumed the leadership of the NCC when Harper went into politics .
But Nicholls was fired from the NCC in the wake of some vocal criticism of Harper 's government – criticism he continues today , revolving around how Harper has turned his back on the principles he voiced when he was head of the NCC .
Some things about Harper 's image in office have n't surprised Nicholls .
Was he a tough , take - no - prisoners kind of boss ?
Most certainly , though Nicholls says Harper did n't yet have the habit of kicking furniture , swearing and throwing tantrums with staff , as several reporters and authors have documented .
" He was tough to work for , " Nicholls said .
" It was not a pleasant thing , being raked over the coals by Stephen ... I think you could say that intimidation was part of his management style . "
What has stunned Nicholls , however , is Harper 's reluctance to use his prime - ministerial post to advance conservative values and principles .
Nicholls has publicly debated Tom Flanagan , Harper 's old mentor and confidant , about what seems to be the Harper government 's preferred route of turning Canada conservative through incrementalism .
Flanagan laid it all out in Harper 's Team , the book he released last fall , which advises Conservatives to borrow from Liberal methods to gradually paint the country Tory blue .
Nicholls is alarmed by the increase in government spending under Harper and his other more Liberal - like policies – on Quebec accommodation or the environment , for instance .
But over and above that , Nicholls sees Harper 's time in office so far as a squandered opportunity .
" What gets me is that he 's not even talking like a conservative .
The great Conservative leaders , people like Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher , used their position to inspire conservatives around the world ...
Stephen Harper does n't do that , " Nicholls says .
Some people saw Harper more as a libertarian than a hard - line conservative in his life before becoming prime minister .
He 's remained true to that libertarian streak , by and large , with his refusal to get his government drawn into social - conservative policies such as abortion or capital punishment .
But the way Harper runs his government , with all its Big Brother , grudge - match discipline and expansive , central control , does n't exactly fit with the libertarian philosophy of " maximizing individual rights and minimizing the role of the state . "
New Democratic Party Leader Jack Layton has worked with Harper in opposition , in concert against the Martin Liberals , and now in the occasional negotiation with the Prime Minister in yet another minority Parliament .
He can't say they have much of a relationship .
Now , as then , their talks are all business , cut and dried .
" Things were more fluid with Martin , " Layton observes .
What 's surprised Layton most , however , is the way in which Harper seems to have turned his back on the respect for Parliament he espoused when in opposition .
Remember all those demands Harper made of Martin to defer to the will of the majority in the Commons ?
Now , as Prime Minister , Harper is more likely to give Parliament the back of his hand and regard it as an obstacle to be overcome .
" I thought he meant it , I 'll be honest , " Layton says .
" Well , I now realize he can't be trusted .
Not that I was particularly trusting of him .
But it was a surprise to me . "
SEVERAL YEARS ago , when Harper was in opposition and still having those casual conversations with reporters , he got drawn into a discussion about the upside - down rule of prime ministers and their reputations .
He said it had already happened to him – everyone thought he was a rigid ideologue who could n't unite conservatives and he 'd already defied those predictions .
But that was a caricature , much like the various , scripted appearances that seem to preoccupy Harper and his team in power .
These days , Harper would prefer to be judged by his portraits than his personality .
An anonymous hacker claims to have used computer magic to
peer through the extreme secrecy surrounding the ending of
the Harry Potter saga and posted online
unverified details from the soon - to - be released final book
in best - selling series .
The hacker , posting under the handle Gabriel , claims to
have gotten a copy of the seventh and final installment of
the blockbuster Harry Potter series that chronicles the
adventures of a child magician by hacking into Bloomsbury ,
the series ' London - based publisher .
Gabriel said he wanted to spoil the ending to Harry
Potter and the Deathly Hallows to protect people
from its " Neo Paganism " and was able to get into the
publisher 's computer network by convincing an Bloomsbury
employee to open an email with malware attached .
" We make this spoiler to make reading of the upcoming book
useless and boring , " Gabriel [ wrote ] ( http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2007/Jun/0380.htm
l ) ( Alert : Possible Spoiler Link ) .
" It 's amazing
to see how much people inside the company have copies and
drafts of this book . "
In advance of the novel 's July 21 publishing date , fans
have been rabidly debating which characters the series '
author J.K. Rowling might kill off .
The hacker made the claim and posted some plot details Tuesday to
a security mailing list called Full Disclosure , which is
re-posted on insecure.org , a website run by a white hat
hacker known as [ Fyodor ] ( https://www.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/01/myspace_all
eged.html ) .
However , no portions of the novel were posted , casting
doubt on the veracity of the claim .
Kyle Good , a spokeswoman for the book 's U.S. publisher
Scholastic , said she could not verify the plot details ,
saying there is a lot of material on the internet claiming
to be from the book .
" Anyone can post anything on the internet and you can't
always believe what you read , " Good said .
" The only way to
know for sure is to read the book on July 21 . "
However , the claimed method of attack – known as spear
phishing – is completely believable , according to Rick
Wesson and Adam Waters , the top officers at the computer
security firm Support
Intelligence .
" This is being used against the State Department often , "
Wesson said .
" This is how you steal any kind of
intellectual property . "
" We have so lost fundamental trust [ in the security of
networks ] we can't tell if the story is true or not , "
Waters added .
" Say it was a corporation 's financial
numbers for next month – you could move a market with
that information . "
Even if the hack happened and the plot details are proven ,
the revelations are unlikely to affect the sales of the
book , given the series ' intensely loyal fan base .
But Wesson and Waters say the story illustrates that
secrets – including copies of unreleased movies , policy
statements by politicians and Federal Reserve
announcements – are extremely vulnerable to targeted external
attacks from hackers who can find their way into a
corporate network as easily as sending an email to a
summer intern .
Electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) has a bad reputation , due in part to the graphic media portrayals we see in films like One Flew Over the Cuckoo ’s Nest and A Beautiful Mind , and probably also in part to an innate distaste for the idea of receiving electrical shocks to the brain .
Despite the popular disgust for this treatment , ECT is still used in patients with psychiatric disorders that have not responded to other therapies , most commonly major depression and bipolar disorder .
In these severely affected patients , who have tried counseling , medication and hospitalization to no avail , ECT often provides a huge improvement in their mental state , with 80 to 90 percent of patients responding to ECT .
New research suggests that the effects of ECT may be associated with proliferation of brain cells .
Researchers used rats to looked at the effects of ECT on the prefrontal cortex , an area of the brain linked to emotional function , and with physical connections to the amygdala and hypothalamus , also involved in emotional processing .
Patients with mood disorders have decreased activity and a reduction in glial cells ( “ support cells ” to the active neurons ) in the prefrontal cortex .
In this study , rats were treated with ECT and then evaluated for cellular changes in this area .
The study showed ECT to stimulate increased production of glial cells , the exact cells that are decreased in mood disorders .
The increase in cellular growth persisted for four weeks after treatment .
These findings agree with earlier studies that showed ECT to increase cell proliferation in other emotional control centers , including the amygdala and hippocampus .
ECT was initiated as therapy many years ago , long before the mechanisms behind its effects were understood .
Most rational people would scoff at the idea of electrocuting the brain to treat any disease , and this is reflected in popular culture .
I do n’t doubt that there are plenty of people out there with horror stories related to ECT and its adverse effects .
But there is also a large population of people who can thank ECT for saving their life when nothing else worked .
However , desperate times call for desperate measures .
ECT is now reserved for only the most severe cases , and can provide life - changing improvements for very sick people .
It ’s nice to see scientifically sound support for a treatment that has such a negative connotation .
Hopefully , evidence such as this will allow patients to feel a measure of ease with a procedure that , in and of itself , is frightening .

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO7xwnZA124In 1971 , Vietnam vets , frustrated by the lack of official investigation of the atrocities they had both witnessed and perpetrated , gathered to provide their own testimony .
Their harrowing stories were captured in a film , Winter Soldier , that , due to its explosive nature , never reached theaters or TV .
( It 's now available on DVD ) .
Some 37 years later , anti-war vets , thanks to the Internet , should have far fewer problems getting their timely stories out into the world .
At Winter Soldier : Iraq and Afghanistan , held last weekend in Washington , soldiers presented videos ( Michael Moore posted this one , with U.S. soldiers blasting two mosques , apparently just for fun , along with another featuring a soldier bragging that he " just killed half of the population of Northern Ramadi .
Fuck the red tape , it does n't matter " ) that surely will be YouTubed .
The group Iraq Veterans Against the War , which organized the event , seems to be having technical problems : their liveblog and video testimony pages are both down , but The Real News channel has posted several already .
With consumer - grade cameras wielded both by soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan and by family members and the media in Washington , expect some harrowing images and testimony to emerge .
Should these videos reach enough Americans , they will reignite the smoldering debate over American military conduct that began with the Abu Ghraib photos and the controversies over Guantanamo .
Update : video and full audio of the events can be found at KPFA - FM's The War Comes Home project .

What 's wrong with this picture ?
Click image for real - time views from the
Solar and Heliospheric Observatory at the Earth - Sun L1 point .
The last 11 - year sunspot reached minimum about a year ago , in March 2007 .
( Here 's what the Sun looks like near maximum . )
Since then there have only been a few , very small , isolated sunspots : far fewer than would be expected a year into a new cycle .
The deepest minimum in the Little Ice Age , 1645 –1715 , coincided with the Maunder Minimum , a period of extremely low solar activity , suggesting , along with other evidence , that solar activity is correlated with terrestrial climate , with low sunspot counts associated with periods of global cooling .
The Australian
Writing in Phil Chapman notes that the apparent rapid temperature decline in 2007 is aligned with the delayed onset of the expected next sunspot cycle and sketches the possible consequences if what we 're observing is indeed the onset of another Little Ice Age or even a Big One .

When Sunni and Shiite scholars disagreed over the ethics of cloning animals , I wondered whether there were other bioethical conflicts in the Muslim world .
Are Muslims split over stem cell research and genetically engineered crops ?
Generally speaking , do they approach biotechnologies in the same way – or variety of ways – as Western cultures ?
I posed the question to a handful of Muslim bioethicists .
The first to respond was Brown University anthropologist Sherine Hamdy .
Wrote Hamdy ,
I think it would be easy and reductionist to make this into yet another ' Shiite vs. Sunni ' issue , but there has always been a wide space of interpretation and widely debate even within the Sunni Muslim world about various biotechnologies including cloning .
Most religious sources say that if a given technology , e.g. cloning is for beneficial purposes and the good outweighs the negative ( if there is potential for human cures , etc. ) then it is permissible , others have cautioned about the potential danger of creating a ' super race ' of people , animals .... so most of the disagreement is actually about the understanding of the technology itself and what impact it might have .
Would it be a bit too easy and reductionist , I asked , to then say that
Muslims are less inclined to take an absolutist position and instead base their judgments by weighing the risks and benefits of each case ?
Replied Hamdy ,
Yes , that is generally how Islamic law characterizes itself , as one sensitive to contingencies ; as taking the social context into account
( see for example , the intro to Harvard scholar Baber Johansen 's book Contingency in Sacred Law . )
Of course there are always people who are extremists and who take absolutist positions – but as a scholarly orthodox tradition , Islamic scholars have generally incorporated social contingencies into their opinions about the permissibility of modern practices , especially with the legal tool of " maslaha " – which is a calculus of weighing particular benefits against risks ( measured both socially and spiritually ) ; the current Grand Mufti of Egypt , Shaykh Ali Gumaa is an example of a scholar who is trying to educate ordinary Muslims against the dangers of absolutism because the context is always so important .
King Faisal University bioethicist Hamza Eskandarani [ pdf ] followed up with a list of medical and reproductive technologies permitted under Sharia law :
[ Intra-uterine insemination ] , [ In vitro fertilization ] , [ Intra cytoplasmic sperm injection ] , etc. are permitted for married - only heterosexual couples .
No donation of any sort is allowed .
Surrogacy is also not permitted .
However , some Shea clerics permit the use of donated embryos and oocytes as practiced in Iran .
Freezing of sperm , oocyte , embryo , and ovarian and testicular tissues are permitted so long as the samples are kept in conditions which will not permit them to be mixed , donated , or utilized outside marriage .
Sex selection can be performed in case of medical necessity or family balance ( although some Islamic scholars object to it ) .
Embryo reduction is still debatable and we have to wait for clear Fatwa
( casting of opinion or non-binding but authoritative religious proclamation ) ; some scholars permit it on the ground of life - threatening to the mother and other fetuses .
Micromanipulation is permitted to overcome infertility cases as well as investigate the resulting embryo but not to mix cells or DNA .
It is believed that ensoulment of the embryo happens after 40 days of fertilization and research on embryo should not be permitted after day
14 of the fertilized egg . [...]
Gene therapy is permitted which as long as the benefits outweigh the detriments .
Reproductive cloning is not permitted , however , therapeutic cloning is allowed as long as the cloned cells are derived from a completely legal source .
Interesting stuff , and in some ways more progressive than I expected .
It reminded me of the article that turned me into a Wired reader : Howard Rheingold 's account of cell phone adoption among the Amish .

With our economic and financial crises deepening , government insiders reportedly are debating whether we need to restore some regulation — or not .
Given the state of things , we can expect further woes and no regulation .
Why have regulation when JPMorgan can gobble up Bear Stearns for peanuts , with the backstage encouragement and acquiescence of the Federal Reserve Board ?
The Fed ’s concern for the big investors is no surprise , and it needed no cue from John McCain to reject any thoughts of helping the victims of the banks ’ sting operations .
Meanwhile , JPMorgan has offered bonuses to Bears Stearns ’ top brokers to stay on , though many of them are probably responsible for the subprime loans Bear Stearns so aggressively pursued .
George W. Bush and his cohorts have quietly dismantled more than a century of regulatory history — and good history at that .
If we truly are to have “ change ” in Washington , the “ changers ” must begin by restoring those proven , efficient and protective elements of the regulatory state .
Last week also brought news of a “ passport scandal , ” and it reflects the other side of the Bush administration ’s coin of the realm .
Accounts of the incidents consistently say that the perps involved were “ contractors . ”
Not until later did we learn the names of several District of Columbia - area State Department private contractors in the case , and the information reflects the exponential explosiveness of private contract work in the public sector .
Perhaps the unauthorized scrounging around in the passport files is merely an instance of mischievous political elves and fairies anxiously seeking to expose controversy .
Imagine an Ann Coulter acolyte : “ Let ’s riffle through Obama ’s files . ”
Or a Rush Limbaugh Dittohead : “ Let ’s find the dirt on Hillary , and do n’t forget McCain . ”
That is the benign view .
Just as likely , they were planted political apparatchiks — who probably never heard the word — deliberately deputized to seek out political “ intelligence . ”
Here we have private “ contractors ” working for the State Department in a sensitive area .
Why not ?
The Bush administration has substituted a vigorous program of “ privatization ” to both replace and expand government programs .
Top - secret security clearances are routinely granted to private companies that now do “ analyses , ” “ reviews ” and “ critical studies ” for the Pentagon or the CIA .
We are now familiar with DynCorp International and Blackwater USA and their operations as a private , free - booting , unaccountable arm of government .
We talk of a “ surge ” to provide security within Iraq , but it is clear that the security will be maintained by Blackwater and others to shore up an undermanned , overworked American military .
The last eight years have profoundly altered the nature of government operations .
Coincidentally , with the passport news we learn that the State Department ’s use of private contractors has grown on an immense scale .
Much of that has been for Iraq operations for which the State Department maintains oversight functions , though not too well as it turns out .
The State Department has created the Office of the Procurement Executive .
Its Web site , written in advanced bureaucratese , portrays itself as the facilitator , not the auditor , for all dealings with private contractors — without mentioning them , however .
Its self - proclaimed mission is “ to ensure the timely delivery of quality goods and services that directly results in creating a more secure , democratic , and prosperous world for the benefit of the American people and the international community . ”
Enter the keepers of passport files in this Brave New World .
Privatization is a prevailing creed for this administration .
It readily takes credit for “ limiting ” the growth of government by freezing or depleting the mandated bureaucracy , but at the same time it provides boundless largess to the private sector .
Meanwhile , less than sensational stories expose the myth that privatization is a cost - saving venture .
A new report of Pentagon auditors found excessive reliance on outside contractors , who often cost more .
Last year , the Defense Department spent $ 158.3 billion on services , a 76 percent increase over the past decade .
Buried in that report was the observation that private contractors assume unintended responsibilities .
The dismantling of government programs and regulation with the concurrent growth in privatization goes beyond the present regime .
The Bush administration merely has implemented a radical extension of a process long under way .
For 30 years , so - called centrist Democrats , anxious to shed any scarlet mark of liberalism , have eagerly sought consensus and accommodation with conservatives , largely by adopting their creed of small , cheap government — government that would fuel the private sector .
Thus the seduction of “ deregulation ” and the accompanying creed of “ privatization . ”
How and why they abandoned a faith that had served them and the nation so well and for so long is a mystery .
The irony is that the failures and crimes of Richard Nixon so discredited , so debilitated the ideology of their opponents .
Anyway , the result has been the prominence of the Democratic Leadership Council , the crippling compromises of the Clinton administration , and the spectacle of Good Old Joe Lieberman accompanying John McCain on his foreign tour — as what , vice president in waiting ?
Secretary of state - designate ?
Sancho Panza ?
We always have recognized the place of the “ Fourth Branch ” of government — meaning the plethora of alphabet - soup agencies with an admixture of executive , legislative and judicial functions , which exist largely to regulate the economy .
Now , it appears , 20th century political science is mostly consigned to the dustbin of history .
As always , “ reform ” and “ change ” have had their unexpected consequences .
The unwarranted search of private passport files raises important issues for the future of government and our familiar constitutional order .
Juvenal ’s timeless conundrum will not go away : Quis custodet ipsos custodes ? —
Who will guard these self - same guardians ?
What is the future of all this privatization ?
Will we insist on the accountability — the checking and the balancing — which has been the hallmark of our constitutional system ?
Or will we continue the administration ’s weapon of choice : a blanket policy of legal immunization , such as is enjoyed by Blackwater ?

Credit cards make it easy for us to buy now and pay later .
This mindset is pervasive and dominant in the United States , and it keeps many Americans financially imprisoned .
I can still remember when there was no credit card , and I had to save for what I want .
Morpheus offers him the chance to learn the truth about the Matrix .
Neo accepts by swallowing the red pill , and abruptly wakes up naked in a liquid - filled pod , his body connected by wires to a vast mechanical tower covered with identical pods .
The connections are severed and he is rescued by Morpheus and taken aboard his hovercraft , the Nebuchadnezzar .
Neo ’s neglected physical body is restored , and Morpheus explains the situation .
Buy Now and Pay Later ( Blue Pill )
Last night , I was looking around the Discover Card Account Center and found a neat little tool that shows my “ Purchasing Power . ”
I plugged in some numbers , which you can see in the image below .
Basically , I can charge $ 5,000 to my Discover Card and pay back $ 185 a month for 36 months ( at my current interest rate ) .
That sounds great , until I do the math .
At $ 185 a month , I ’d end up paying $ 6,660 for my $ 5,000 item .
In other words , the cost of instant gratification is $ 1,660 .
I think that ’s steep .
Save Now and Buy Later ( Red Pill )
Now let ’s see what ’d happen if I save $ 185 a month instead .
Assuming a modest 5 % interest rate , it would take about 25.5 months to save $ 5,000 .
Better yet , the monthly contributions only add up to $ 4,810 , so I saved $ 190 !
Sure , waiting two years is not as exciting as instant gratification , but I think saving $ 1,850 feels pretty darn good .
So , which one would you choose ?
“ FREE goods are worth what you pay for them ” is the cynic 's approach to the world , shared by hard - headed poverty - busters .
Charging even a nominal price for things such as mosquito nets and condoms makes people take them more seriously , it is argued .
Given away free , the nets may end up being used to catch fish rather than protecting sleeping people .
That does happen .
Even so , a recent study in Kenya suggested providing malarial areas with large numbers of free bed nets brought better results than selling them .
Now a new survey carried out by the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) on behalf of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Malaria and Tuberculosis , which is to be published on Friday February 1st , has shown that the approach works well in other countries , too .
Unlike most big do - gooding outfits , the Global Fund is flexible and iconoclastic .
It was one of the first international aid organisations to come up with the radical idea of seeing whether its interventions actually work .
Since it consists of a small secretariat in Geneva and a few local offices , it lacks the scientific and managerial infrastructure to do this itself .
So it subcontracts the job — in this case to Arata Kochi , the head of WHO 's anti-malaria operation .
Dr Kochi and his team reviewed antimalaria operations in Ethiopia , Ghana , Rwanda and Zambia , looking mainly at under - fives , who are most threatened by the disease .
WHO says that over 1 m people die each year of malaria , mostly in Africa .
In Ethiopia , the amount of childhood malaria reported at clinics fell by 60 % and the death rate halved within two years of the beginning of the mass - distribution programme .
In Rwanda , things were even more spectacular : both cases and deaths dropped by two - thirds within a single year .
In Zambia the fall in both was around a third .
Only in Ghana were the data equivocal .
Cases fell by an eighth and deaths by a third , but that was against a background of generally improving health in which the amelioration rates for malaria were worse than those for non-malarial illness and death .
In other countries , the rate of malaria tracked the general disease rate until the programmes began , and then fell suddenly ( see chart ) .
Giving away insecticide - impregnated nets free to anyone visiting a clinic ( the nets stay potent for about five years ) was not the only new thing about the operations .
In all cases , the countries rolled out nationwide campaigns instead of relying on local ones .
In many cases , they also gave away drugs based on artemisinin , a substance to which the malarial parasite has yet to develop widespread resistance .
Nets and artemisinin are two planks of malaria control .
The third is to spray the inside of people 's houses with DDT , to kill female mosquitoes when they settle to digest their blood meals .
The objective is to achieve 80 % take - up in each village .
At that point , the cycle of transmission from mosquito to human to mosquito is broken in a way similar to the action of a vaccine ; this stops the spread of the disease , and thus protects everyone .
Based on the new results , Dr Kochi reckons that a five - year campaign costing about $ 10 billion would be enough to bring malaria under control in most of Africa , reducing the death rate to a matter of thousands a year .
Eliminating malaria altogether , though , would be a far harder task , involving destroying mosquitoes in the remaining pockets of infection .
That is controversial : some — not least Dr Kochi — see it as a dangerous distraction until the easier job of bringing the disease under control is completed .
Others want to aim straight away for elimination .
In the long run , that should surely be the objective .
But , as the old saying has it , the best can often turn out to be the enemy of the good .
And the good now looks to be in sight .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A New York judge ordered CNN reporter Richard Quest to undergo six months of counseling on Friday after Quest was arrested in Central Park for possession of a controlled substance , his lawyer said .
The British reporter is known for his boisterous and quirky style , especially on CNN International .
He was arrested at 3:40 a.m. on Friday in New York ’s Central Park for being in the park after a 1 a.m. curfew .
Police discovered a plastic bag containing what was believed to be methamphetamine in his pocket , police spokesman John Grimphel said .
Quest , 46 , later appeared before State Court Judge Anthony Ferrara , who told him the case would be dismissed if he attends counseling , Quest ’s lawyer , Alan Abramson said .
“ Mr. Quest did not realize that the park had a curfew and was returning to his hotel with friends .
The matter is scheduled to be dismissed , ” Abramson said .
Quest is a well - known business news reporter on CNN International and hosts “ CNN Business Traveler , ” as well as his own feature program , “ Quest . ”

Artist
What is artist
Artist is an Emacs lisp package that allows you to draw lines , rectangles , squares , poly - lines , ellipses and circles by using your mouse and / or keyboard .
The shapes are made up with the ascii characters | , - , / and \ .
Features
Intersecting
When a ` | ' intersects with a ` - ' , a ` + ' is drawn , like this : | \ / --+-- X | / \ Rubber - banding
When drawing lines you can interactively see the result while holding the mouse button down and moving the mouse .
If your machine is not fast enough ( a 386 is a bit to slow , but a pentium is well enough ) , you can turn this feature off .
You will then see 1 's and 2 's which mark the 1st and 2nd endpoint of the line you are drawing .
Arrows
After having drawn a ( straight ) line or a ( straight ) poly - line , you can set arrows on the line - ends by typing < or > .
Flood - filling
You can fill any area with a certain character by flood - filling .
Cut copy and paste
You can cut , copy and paste rectangular regions .
Artist also interfaces with the rect package ( this can be turned off if it causes you any trouble ) so anything you cut in artist can be yanked with C- x�r�y and vice versa .
Drawing with keys
Everything you can do with the mouse , you can also do without the mouse .
Aspect-ratio
You can set the variable artist - aspect - ratio to reflect the height - width ratio for the font you are using .
Squares and circles are then drawn square / round .
Note , that once your ascii - file is shown with font with a different height - width ratio , the squares wo n't be square and the circles wo n't be round .
Drawing operations
The following drawing operations are implemented : ���lines straight - lines ���rectangles squares ���poly - lines straight poly - lines ���ellipses circles ���text ( see - thru ) text ( overwrite ) ���spray - can set size for spray ���vaporizing line vaporizing lines ���erase characters erase rectangles Straight lines are lines that go horinzontally , vertically or diagonally .
Plain lines go in any direction .
The shapes in the right column are accessed by holding down the shift key while drawing .
You can also erase characters and rectangles .
It is possible to vaporize ( erase ) entire lines and connected lines ( rectangles for example ) as long as the lines being vaporized are straight and connected at their endpoints .
Vaporizing is inspired by the drawrect package by Jari Aalto < jari.aalto@poboxes.com >.
Picture mode compatibility Artist is picture mode compatible ( this can be turned off )
Artist is written by Tomas Abrahamsson .

A mixed economic picture sent stocks tumbling Tuesday , with the Dow Jones industrials falling more than 100 points after investors were unnerved by weakness in consumer confidence and home sales .
Wall Street ’s slide dragged European markets lower as well in late trading there .
One day after a number of broad U.S. market indexes hit record highs , some investors bailed out amid a weak reading on February consumer confidence and a report showing a decline in sales of previously owned U.S. homes in January .
Those reports overshadowed the government ’s revised estimate of fourth - quarter economic growth .
Real gross domestic product grew at a 1.6 % annualized rate , up from the 1.1 % the Commerce Department initially estimated .

The Dow index fell 104.14 points , or 0.9 % , to 10,993.41 .
Among broader indexes , the Standard & Poor ’s 500 fell 13.46 points , or 1 % , to 1,280.66 , and the Nasdaq composite lost 25.79 points , or 1.1 % , to 2,281.39 , hurt by a sharp decline in Google .
The Russell 2,000 index of smaller stocks , which was among the market gauges that hit record highs Monday , dropped 1.4 % to 730.64 .
Falling stocks outnumbered winners by more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange and on Nasdaq as trading volume jumped .

Investors ’ mood about the market has shifted back and forth in recent weeks with economic data .
On Tuesday , “ if you were looking for an excuse to sell , you got a few things pushing you towards that , ” said Kurt Brunner , a money manager at Swarthmore Group in West Chester , Pa . “ I ’m a little more cautious , a little more nervous . ”
The weak housing and consumer confidence numbers heightened demand for long - term U.S. Treasury bonds , sending their yields lower .
The 10 - year T - note yield slipped to 4.55 % from 4.59 % on Monday .
In other trading , crude oil futures rose 41 cents to $ 61.41 a barrel in New York trading .

With scant earnings reports and few Federal Reserve speeches , economic data should continue to dominate the week , said Alexander Paris , economist and market analyst for Chicago - based Barrington Research .
One hurdle stock bulls face is “ resistance levels . ”
As the Dow and S&P ; 500 have flirted with 4 1/2 - year highs , those highs have become in effect a ceiling for stock prices , with investors selling off their holdings when the indexes neared those highs .
Stocks ended February mixed .
The Dow gained 1.2 % and the S&P ; rose 0.05 % , but Nasdaq lost 1.1 % .
So far in 2006 , the Dow is up 2.6 % , the S&P ; is up 2.6 % and Nasdaq is up 3.5 % .

A trained psychologist could probably say a lot about our society 's fascination with hot female robots .
In fact , the inability to produce a lifelike female sexbot was named as the single biggest scientific failure of the modern era in one survey of Cracked .com staff .
5 Terminatrix : Terminator 3 : Rise of the Machines
While Skynet began its campaign to send robots to exterminate the human race with Arnold Schwarzenegger , each robotic assassin since has looked more and more effeminate since .
This is probably because even a Speak - and - Spell knows that humans will forgive a lot when it comes from a smoking hot blond wearing a red leather outfit that looks like she was poured into it .
Or failing that , vaguely handsome character actor Robert Patrick .

Special Talents :
Ever since the second film , evil Terminators have come with morph - like shape - shifting abilities .
In T2 they just make weapons out of their forearms , but that does n't mean they 're all work and no play : at one point in T3 the Terminatrix increases the size of her breasts to distract a policeman who pulled her over .
If , at the thought of having a girlfriend who can enhance any part of her body at will makes you say , " Hey , that could get us out of countless traffic tickets ! " then you 're probably not using your imagination enough .
The Downside :
There is the thing with her ultimate goal being the death of all humanity , and she seems to really enjoy her work : in order to " analyze " her victim 's DNA , she has to lick their blood .
( More machines like this would make watching CSI infinitely more enjoyable . )
We 're not saying you should n't have sex with a Terminator , we 're just saying that you really need to establish a " safe word " first .

... we 're pretty sure they did n't have a reason to include genitalia in the design .
Note :
While we are aware of a similarly hot Terminator in Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles , we expect , and hope , that the show will be canceled very , very soon , and so we 'll not be including her in this list .
Except to say that Summer Glau , who plays her , is very attractive , and should feel free to call us at any time .
An Illustrated Frugal Lunch
Almost 1 year ago , I posted Frugal Lunch by my Registered Dietitian wife , Stacie .
She put together a sample menu of frugal , yet nutritious , lunches including peanut butter and jelly ( PBJ ) sandwiches .
Well , since beginning my new job , I ’ve been trapped at work and getting out for lunch is just too much of a pain .
Now that I ’m stuck in the office during lunchtime , I have begun to rely on a staple diet of PBJ sandwiches ( and side dishes ) for lunch .
In fact , I ’ve developed a way to make a work - month ’s worth of sandwiches in 25 minutes !
I ’ll even give you a near - exact price per sandwich for your own budgeting AND step - by - step photos !
I ’ve even gotten my boss and a classmate to try it just by mentioning my method and they ’re hooked !
The Idea
When I worked in PA for 5 months and lived there by myself , I did n’t want to take time to make lunches every morning , and there were no restaurants near our office building .
Being the lazy yet resourceful guy that I am , I developed a method where I made a week ’s worth of lunch on Sunday night .
I just made a whole bunch of PBJ sandwiches at one time and froze them .
I would grab 1 - 2 sandwiches out of the freezer each morning and by lunch they would thaw and still taste perfectly fine .
In the last article , so many people complained that it took too long every morning to make lunch and it ’s just not worth it .
Well how about taking an average of 2 - 3 minutes per day for the central part of your lunch instead ?
At the time , I would only make 1 loaf at a time , but now I make 2 loaves of sandwiches at once .
And not counting the time I took to take pictures , this time only took 25 minutes from setup to cleanup .
The Cost
So how much does it cost to make 2 loaves of PBJ sandwiches .
In my example , I was able to make 23 sandwiches .
I was cheated out of a slice of bread , so I could n’t make an even 2 dozen .
For the jellies , I used a standard Welch ’s grape as well as a fancier strawberry jam ( for a change of pace ) .
So here ’s the per- sandwich cost roundup using my example :
Bread : $ 0.09 .
I got 2 loaves of wheat bread for $ 2 .
It ’s the cheap store brand so the slices are smaller , but you should easily find wheat bread at this price in your local grocery chain .
I got 2 loaves of for $ 2 .
It ’s the cheap store brand so the slices are smaller , but you should easily find wheat bread at this price in your local grocery chain .
Peanutbutter : $ 0.12 .
I used half of a 40 oz jar of Jif creamy peanut butter ( so 20 oz ) .
I bought it in bulk at Sam ’s club ( $ 0.11 / oz ) , but I ’ll use the regular price of $ 0.14 per ounce .
So 20 oz divided by 23 sandwiches times $ 0.14 per ounce is 12 cents .

So 20 oz divided by 23 sandwiches times $ 0.14 per ounce is 12 cents .
Grape Jelly : $ 0.07 .
I used 10 oz of grape jelly for 12 sandwiches ( the other 11 were jam ) .
I also bought the jelly in bulk , but the regular per ounce price for Welch ’s is currently 8 cents so I ’ll use that .

I also bought the jelly in bulk , but the regular per ounce price for Welch ’s is currently 8 cents so I ’ll use that .
Strawberry Jam : $ 0.12 .
I got Knott ’s Strawberry Preserves in bulk from Sam ’s for $ 0.13 per ounce and used 10 ounces of it across 11 sandwiches .
Total per grape jelly sandwich : 28 cents
Total per strawberry jam sandwich : 33 cents
That ’s $ 6.99 for a full month of sandwiches !
Do you know how much Panera charges for a PBJ sandwich ?
Well I do n’t either because they ’re too embarrassed to print it on their website , but I know it ’s at least $ 2 - 3 from experience !
These are real numbers based on my actual grocery bill , and even rounded up since not everyone buys in bulk .
This is even cheaper than Stacie ’s original prices because I got the cheaper wheat bread .
Also , I wo n’t count the baggies I used since they ’re so cheap , but you might want to use reusable plastic containers or wash the baggies and reuse them .
Step - by - Step Illustrations ( and some tips )
If you need more than just numbers , I ’m going to lay out every step I went through to make 23 sandwiches .
Along the way , though , I found some tips such as :
– Wheat bread does n’t absorb the jelly juices like white bread , so your sandwich is n’t soggy when it thaws
– Knott ’s Strawberry Preserves has some giant strawberries in it .
It makes spreading difficult , so I ’ll probably skip the preserves next time .
– I recommend stirring up the jelly before spooning it out .
It makes spreading it MUCH easier .
– The messiest part is trying to stuff 2 sandwiches into a single baggy , not actually making the sandwiches .
Step One : Lay out the bread .
Our kitchen island was a perfect spot to make these sandwiches as you can see .
Step Two : Plop the peanutbutter onto the bread .
Of course you want to only put it on half the slices of bread .
I put a generous amount on each slice because I really like peanutbutter .
You ’ll spread out the PB in the next step .
Step Three : Spread the peanutbutter .
I do each step for all slices first in a true assembly line fashion .
If I spent time making each sandwich in its entirety , I ’d get tired of it and probably stop after one loaf .
Step Four : Lay out the jelly .
I just dropped a glob of jelly on top of the PB , not the empty slice , because it ’s easier to close up the sandwiches when one slice is plain .
Step Five : Spread the jelly .
Sounding familiar ?
Step Six : Close up the sandwiches .
This is the best part because it ’s the fastest .
just place the lids on each sandwich .
A tip is to match up the shape of the top with the bottom so you do n’t have unneeded overhang .
Oh , and yes I use the crusts .
Step Seven : Bag them up .
This is my least favorite part because I cram 2 sandwiches into a single baggy .
I used one baggy because it ’s less wasteful .
Seriously , it took me 25 minutes , not counting the picture times , to get out all my materials , make them , bag them , put them in the freezer and clean up the counter ( watch out for all the crumbs ) .
Now stop complaining that it takes too long to make your lunch .
Also , since you ’re freezing them , you do n’t HAVE to eat PBJ every day , but at least they ’re there to grab if you ’re in a hurry or know you wo n’t get out for lunch .

The Pure Programming Language
Pure is a functional programming language based on term rewriting .
Its core is actually purely algebraic and purely functional , but the name can also be taken as a recursive acronym for the " Pure Universal Rewriting Engine . "
Pure has a modern syntax featuring curried function applications , lexical closures and equational definitions with pattern matching , and thus is somewhat similar to languages of the Haskell and ML variety .
But Pure is also a very dynamic language , and is more like Lisp in this respect .
The interpreter has an LLVM backend to do JIT compilation , hence programs run blazingly fast and interfacing to C modules is easy .
Pure has moved to Google Code !

A batch of old documents linked to the assassination of President John F Kennedy has been found in an old safe at a Dallas courthouse .
They include what appears to be a transcript of a conversation between killer Lee Harvey Oswald and Oswald 's killer Jack Ruby .
Scroll down for more ...
Death of a president :
The fateful shooting of JFK in Dallas , November 1963
Also in the stash were letters reportedly from former District Attorney Henry Wade , the prosecutor in the Ruby trial - as well as official records from the trial , a gun holster and clothing that probably belonged to Ruby and Oswald , the current DA Craig Watkins said .
But the most controversial item is a transcript of an exchange between Oswald and Ruby in which they discuss killing Kennedy to halt the Mafia - busting agenda of his brother , Attorney General Robert Kennedy .
The Dallas Morning News said one theory about the transcript was that it was part of a movie script
Wade was working on with producers , for a film that was never made .
The transcript resembles one published by the Warren Commission , which investigated Kennedy 's assassination and concluded that Oswald acted alone .
The FBI claims the conversation between Oswald and Ruby - this time about killing Texas Governor John Connally - was definitely a fake .
Connally was riding in the car with Kennedy and was wounded in the attack .
The documents may be a Presidents '
Day gift to conspiracy theorists who have long questioned the official U.S. government version that Oswald acted alone when he shot Kennedy on November 22 , 1963 , as the president 's motorcade swept past the Texas School Book Depository in downtown Dallas .

Nightclub owner Ruby subsequently shot Oswald dead at point - blank range two days later as police were escorting their prime suspect .
Ruby died a few years later from cancer .
Senator Obama ,
I invite you to glance at this article before reading my letter .
http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/18/world/americas/18food.html?hp
It is no secret that World Hunger is on the rise .
The cause is apparent – rising food costs .
What ma not be so apparent is why .
There are so many articles on what is happening , but not so many on why .
Why is wheat now so expensive ?
Why are normally reasonably prices crops now up close to 50 % in cost ?
The answer is quite clear , but nobody is talking about it .
The reason is ethanol .
With the recent government regulation requiring more fuels to be combined with ethanol , the demand for corn has risen sharply .
Farmers would be crazy to not grow corn , as it is selling almost immediately to the energy industry .
Where this may be good for the farmers , it immediately creates a shortage in supply for other crops , causing the price to increase dramatically .
Obviously , I do n’t need to quote simple economics to you , as I am sure you are well aware of how they work .
The problem here is the ethanol market .
The market is artificial … driven by a scare of global warming , the false benefits that ethanol is supposed to provide , and government regulation .
Sure , ethanol lowers our dependence on fossil fuels , but it is by no mean a replacement .
Even the benefits of ethanol are questionable , even marginal at best ( http://environmentalalmanac.blogspot.com/2005/10/ethanol-and-environment.html).
The point I am trying to make here is “ is it worth it ? ”
Is it worth starving hundreds of thousands of people and collapsing several governments due to food shortages and riots … just so the ethanol industry can take off and make some money for a few companies ?
I think the answer is obvious .
It ’s very frustrating in an economic system like ours to see significant scientific processes be held back because it is “ bad for the economy . ”
We should be eliminating our dependence on oil based fuels completely , not supplementing it with a food source .
I find it hard to believe that we can build a rocket , launch it to Mars , and drop off a rover that we can control from a planet away and sent pictures back … but we ca n’t make an electric or magnetic based engine for cars ?
Another thing that irritates me is “ why corn ? ”
Why must ethanol be made from corn ?
There are a ton of other plants that can be refined into oils , why is corn the one for us ?
It is a food source , yet we burn it up for transportation .
What about this plant …
http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/vp_strauss/20070904.html
or this …
http://www.wired.com/cars/energy/news/2008/01/ethanol23
There has also been a lot of hype about algae producing biofuels .
http://www.scribemedia.org/2007/12/12/algae-biofuel-valcent-vertigro/
All of this provides a more reasonable source of biofuel than corn , yet corn is the source that gets government subsidies and ends up driving the food crisis higher around the world .
I realize that you are not my senator .
I am not an Illinois resident .
You are , however , possibly the next president of the United States .
I really want this to be brought to your attention .
I may not be too out of place , considering all of my family is from Illinois , and many of them still reside there .
I will also be sending this to my senator , and my representatives .
Senator , I hope this has struck a chord with you in some way , as it is in the forefront of what I fell should be addressed immediately by our government .
With you potentially becoming the next president of the United States , I feel submitting this letter to you was my best course of action .
Thank you for your time Senator .
Sincerely ,
Derek Wagner

DALLAS ( Reuters ) -
If the U.S. economy falls into a recession , can presumptive Republican nominee John McCain possibly win the presidential election in November ?
Analysts and historians say not likely -- just ask Jimmy Carter or Herbert Hoover , sitting presidents who lost re-election bids in 1980 and 1932 against the backdrop of shrinking economies .
Past economic slumps have dashed the hopes of both incumbent presidents and the nominees of the party in the White House .
The effects can linger after the recession ends , as George H.W. Bush found when he lost to Bill Clinton in 1992 .
One exception was Harry Truman ’s successful re-election bid in 1948 , which occurred just as a recession was starting to bite -- but that is widely regarded as one of the biggest electoral upsets in U.S. history .
The economy is the one issue that everyone has a stake in and therefore an opinion on , making it pivotal at the polls .
Last year the U.S. economy grew by 2.2 percent , its slowest expansion since 2002 , and many economists forecast a recession this year as a crisis in the housing industry spreads .
A recession is typically defined as two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth or contraction .
This suggests that the November election should be all but in the bag for whomever wins the Democratic nomination , be it Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama -- not least because President George W. Bush and his Republican Party will be widely blamed for any economic pain Americans feel .
“ A bad economy is more likely to help the Democratic candidate for a couple of reasons .
First , Bush is in charge and he ’s a Republican and people tend to blame the president and his party for their economic problems , ” said Andrew Kohut , president of the non-partisan Pew Research Center .
“ The Democratic Party also has a better image for coping with economic issues , ” he said .

A March 19 - 22 Pew survey of 1,503 Americans nationwide found just 11 percent rated the economy as excellent or good , down from 17 percent in early February and 26 percent in January .
GLIMMER OF HOPE ?
Americans were less dour about their own affairs .
About 47 percent viewed their own personal finances as excellent or good , while 51 percent rated them poor or fair .
But some analysts say general perceptions about the economy have more influence on voting than personal ones .
“ People care about their pocketbooks but research shows people vote more on the general state of the economy than their own personal economic circumstance , ” said David Epstein , a political science professor at Columbia University .
He said this could be because people worried a sagging economy would eventually pull down their lifestyles , pensions or businesses .
If the U.S. economy does fall into recession it may not even be declared until after the election , but the historical record suggests a downturn will be bad news for McCain .
Ray Fair , an economist at Yale University , has developed an econometric forecasting model for presidential elections using data going back to 1916 .
It suggests that if the U.S. economy on a per capita basis declines by 1.5 percent in the first three quarters of 2008 then the Republican candidate in a two - way race will garner less than 46 percent of the vote .
Slideshow ( 5 images )
“ I think if there is a recession then it is highly unlikely that the Republicans will win , ” he told Reuters .
U.S. history is littered with the political corpses of presidencies or White House bids slain by downturns .
A recession that took hold in April 1960 hurt Richard Nixon , a sitting vice president and nominee for the incumbent Republican Party , in his run for the White House against Democrat John Kennedy .
Democrat Jimmy Carter ’s attempt at a second White House term in 1980 floundered as a bruising recession kicked off in January , handing the presidency to Ronald Reagan .
Hoover had no chance in 1932 during the “ Great Depression . ”
The recession that wounded George H.W. Bush started in mid-1990 and had ebbed when he came up against Clinton -- but memory of it had not .
And Republican Warren Harding snatched the White House from the Democrats in 1920 against the backdrop of recession .

Major screwups in mathematics : example 1
Last month I asked for examples of major screwups in mathematics .
Specifically , I was looking for cases in which some statement S was considered to be proved , and later turned out to be false .
I could not think of any examples myself .
Readers suggested several examples , and I got lucky and turned up one on my own .
Some of the examples were rather obscure technical matters , where Professor Snorfus publishes in Acta Quandalia that all partially uniform k-quandles have the Cosell property , and this goes unchallenged for several years before one of the other three experts in partially uniform quandle theory notices that actually this is only true for Nemontovian k-quandles .
I 'm not going to report on matters that sounded like that to me , although I realize that I 'm running the risk that all the examples that I do report will sound that way to most of the audience .
But I 'm going to give it a try .
General remarks I would like to make some general remarks first , but I do n't quite know yet what they are .
Two readers independently suggested that I should read Proofs and Refutations by Imre Lakatos , and raised a number of interesting points that I 'm sure I 'd like to expand on , except that I have n't read the book .
Both copies are checked out of the Penn library , which is a good sign , and the interlibrary loan copy I ordered wo n't be here for several days .
Still , I can relate a partial secondhand understanding of the ideas , which seem worth repeating .
Whether a result is " correct " may be largely a matter of definition .
Consider Lakatos ' principal example , Euler 's theorem about polyhedra : Let F , E , and V be the number of faces , edges , and vertices in a polyhedron .
Then F - E + V = 2 .
For example , the cube has ( F , E , V ) = ( 6 , 12 , 8 ) , and 6 - 12 + 8 = 2 . Sometime later , someone observed that Euler 's theorem was false for polyhedra with holes in them .
For example , consider the object shown at right .
It has ( F , E , V ) = ( 9 , 18 , 9 ) , giving F - E + V = 9 - 18 - 9 = 0 .
Can we say that Euler was wrong ?
Not really .
The question hinges on the definition of " polyhedron " .
Euler 's theorem is proved for " polyhedra " , but we can see from the example above that it only holds for " simply - connected polyhedra " .
If Euler proved his theorem at a time when " polyhedra " was implicitly meant " simply - connected " , and the generally - understood definition changed out from under him , we can't hold that against Euler .
In fact , the failure of Euler 's theorem for the object above suggests that maybe we should n't consider it to be a polyhedron , that it is somehow rather different from a polyhedron in at least one important way .
So the theorem drives the definition , instead of the other way around .
Okay , enough introductory remarks .
My first example is unquestionably a genuine error , and from a first - class mathematician .
Mathematical background
Some terminology first .
A " formula " is just that , for example something like this : $ $\displaylines { ( ( \forall a.\lnot R( a , a ) ) \ wedge\cr ( \forall b\forall c.R( b , c ) \to\lnot R( c , b ) ) \wedge\cr ( \forall d\forall e\forall f. ( R( d , e ) \wedge R(e , f ) \to R( d , f ) ) ) \to\cr ( \forall x\exists y.R( y , x ) ) } $ $
It may contain a bunch of quantified variables ( a , b , c , etc. ) , relations ( like R ) , and logical connectives like ∧.
A formula might also include functions and constants ( which I did n't ) or equality symbols ( there are none here ) .
One can ask whether the formula is true ( or , in the jargon , " valid " ) , which means that it must hold regardless of how one chooses the set S from which the values of the variables will be drawn , and regardless of the meanings assigned to the relation symbols ( and to the functions and constants , if there are any ) .
The following formula , although not very interesting , is valid : $ $ \ forall a\exists b. ( P( a ) \wedge P( b ) ) \to P( a ) $ $
This is true regardless of the meaning we ascribe to P , and regardless of the set from which a and b are required to be drawn .
The longer formula above , which requires that R be a linear order , and then that the linear order R have no minimal element , is not universally valid , but it is valid for some interpretations of R and some sets S from which a ...f , x , and y may be drawn .
Specifically , it is true if one takes S to be the set of integers and R( x , y ) to mean x < y .
Such formulas , which are true for some interpretations but not for all , are called " satisfiable " .
Obviously , valid formulas are satisfiable , because satisfiable formulas are true under some interpretations , but valid formulas are true under all interpretations .
Gödel famously showed that it is an undecidable problem to determine whether a given formula of arithmetic is satisfiable .
That is , there is no method which , given any formula , is guaranteed to tell you correctly whether or not there is some interpretation in which the formula is true .
But one can limit the form of the allowable formulas to make the problem easier .
To take an extreme example , just to illustrate the point , consider the set of formulas of the form : ∃a∃b ... ( ( a=0 ) ∨( a=1 ) ) ∧(( b=0 ) ∨( b=1 ) ) ∧...∧ R( a , b , ... ) for some number of variables .
Since the formula itself requires that a , b , etc. are each either 0 or 1 , all one needs to do to decide whether the formula is satisfiable is to try every possible assignment of 0 and 1 to the n variables and see whether R( a , b , ... ) is true in any of the 2n resulting cases .
If so , the formula is satisfiable , if not then not .
Kurt Gödel , 1933
One would like to prove decidability for a larger and more general class of formulas than the rather silly one I just described .
How big can the class of formulas be and yet be decidable ?
It turns out that one need only consider formulas where all the quantifiers are at the front , because there is a simple method for moving quantifiers to the front of a formula from anywhere inside .
So historically , attention has been focused on formulas in this form .
One fascinating result concerns the class of formulas called [ ∃ * ∀2∃* , all , ( 0 ) ] .
These are the formulas that begin with ∃a∃b ...∃ m∀n∀p∃q ...∃z , with exactly two ∀ quantifiers , with no intervening ∃s .
These formulas may contain arbitrary relations amongst the variables , but no functions or constants , and no equality symbol . [ ∃ *∀ 2∃* , all , ( 0 ) ] is decidable : there is a method which takes any formula in this form and decides whether it is satisfiable .
But if you allow three ∀ quantifiers ( or two with an ∃ in between ) then the set of formulas is no longer decidable .
Is n't that freaky ?
The decidability of the class [ ∃ * ∀2∃* , all , ( 0 ) ] was shown by none other than Gödel , in 1933 .
However , in the last sentence of his paper , Gödel added that the same was true even if the formulas were also permitted to include equality :
In conclusion , I would still like to remark that Theorem I can also be proved , by the same method , for formulas that contain the identity sign .
Oops
This was believed to be true for more than thirty years , and the result was used by other mathematicians to prove other results .
But in the mid-1960s , Stål Aanderaa showed that Gödel 's proof would not actually work if the formulas contained equality , and in 1983 , Warren D. Goldfarb proved that Gödel had been mistaken , and the satisfiability of formulas in the larger class was not decidable .
Sources Gödel 's original 1933 paper is Zum Entscheidungsproblem des logischen Funktionenkalküls ( On the decision problem for the functional calculus of logic ) which can be found on pages 306–327 of volume I of his Collected Works .
( Oxford University Press , 1986 . )
There is an introductory note by Goldfarb on pages 226–231 , of which pages 229 –231 address Gödel 's error specifically .
I originally heard the story from Val Tannen , and then found it recounted on page 188 of The Classical Decision Problem , by Egon Boerger , Erich Grädel , and Yuri Gurevich .
But then blog reader Jeffrey Kegler found the Goldfarb note , of which the Boerger - Grädel - Gurevich account appears to be a summary .
Thanks very much to everyone who contributed , and especially to M. Kegler .

Obama denounces Wright
In Winston - Salem , Obama sharply attacks Reverend Jeremiah Wright and the substance of his remarks yesterday , a far sharper disavowal than he gave in Philadelphia last month .
The core of his message :
That Wright was not only offensive , but the polar opposite of Obama 's own views and politics .
" I have spent my entire adult life trying to bridge the gap between different kinds of people .
That ’s in my DNA , trying to promote mutual understanding to insist that we all share common hopes and common dreams as Americans and as human beings .
That ’s who I am , that ’s what I believe , and that ’s what this campaign has been about , " Obama said .
" I am outraged by the comments that were made and saddened by the spectacle that we saw yesterday , " he said .
Obama also distanced himself from the man in a way he has been reluctant to in the past .
" The person that I saw yesterday was not the person that I met 20 years ago , " he said .
" His comments were not only divisive and destructive , but I believe that they end up giving comfort to those who prey on hate , and I believe that they do not portray accurately the perspective of the black church . "
" They certainly do n’t portray accurately my values and beliefs , " he said .
" If Reverend Wright thinks that ’s political posturing , as he put it , then he does n’t know me very well and based on his remarks yesterday , I may not know him as well as I thought either . "
" I gave him the benefit of the doubt in my speech in Philadelphia , explaining that he has done enormous good in the church , " he said .
" But when he states and then amplifies such ridiculous propositions as the U.S. government somehow being involved in AIDS ; when he suggests that Minister Farrakhan somehow represents one of the greatest voices of the 20th and 21st century ; when he equates the U.S. wartime efforts with terrorism – then there are no exuses .
They offend me .
They rightly offend all Americans .
And they should be denounced , and that ’s what I ’m doing very clearly and unequivocally here today . "
" It is antithetical to my campaign .
It is antithetical to what I ’m about .
It is not what I think America stands for , " he said .

Claim : Insect - infested house is destroyed when too many “ bug bombs ” set by owner are ignited .
Status : True .
Origins : In December 2003 , an overly determined householder in San Diego , California ,
took on the bugs and lost her home in the process .
“ Bug bombs ” are aerosol insecticide foggers used to exterminate a residence ’s insect population ,
commonly purchased in home improvement stores by those intent upon ridding their domiciles of
cockroaches , fleas , and the like .
After the homeowner has cleared his house of kids , pets , and other residents , he sets off the fogger by pressing down on a tab atop the can ; the “ bug bomb ” then begins to produce a fine mist of insecticide , continuing this “ fogging ” at a slow and steady rate until the canister is empty .
After a few hours , the residents of the house ( adults , kids , pets ) can return to their ( presumably ) insect - free home , air it out , and take up residence again .
One canister is generally sufficient for a
600 square foot space .
Sounds simple , right ?
It is — provided you do n’t overdo it .
Nineteen of these foggers were set off in Aurelia Oliveras ’ 470 - square - foot home in San Diego .
Everything might have turned out well in spite of the excess had the pilot light in a water heater not ignited the fumes concentrated in this small space .
The resulting explosion blew apart the structure and hurled Christmas decorations into the street , strewed shards of glass ( from broken windows ) and nails ( from torn walls ) like shrapnel , blew the back door off its hinges , ripped gaping holes in the ceiling , spread insulation over the yard like confetti , and crashed the south wall of the house into the side of the home next
door — all in all resulting in damages estimated at more than $ 150,000 .
Fortunately no injuries resulted , as Oliveras , her husband , and her 2 - year - old daughter were in the back yard at the time of the kaboom .
This type of accident had occurred before in San Diego .
In April 2001 , another fog of insecticide from eighteen bug bombs was similarly set off by a pilot light , this time blowing up an apartment in the City Heights neighborhood .
No one was injured , but several cockroaches managed to survive the blast .
Elsewhere in southern California , another pilot light ignited the fumes from three bug bombs set off in a Los Angeles apartment in September 2003 , blowing out windows and splintering kitchen cabinets .
Also in Los Angeles , in April 2001 a woman suffered second - degree burns to her legs from the heat of a blast resulting from the ignition of thirty bug bombs she set off in her home .
That explosion shattered windows and lifted the dwelling ’s roof three inches .
Given the force of these blasts , it ’s surprising more people are n’t injured .
According to the California Department of Pesticide Regulation ( CDPR ) , a number of such explosions occur every year , typically when homeowners use too many foggers and do n’t shut off ignition sources ( particularly pilots lights in ovens , stoves , and water heaters ) .
In this battle between man and insect , more is certainly not better .
Those still contemplating the use of an arsenal of bug bombs in their wars with six - legged foes should consider this :
If the possibility of a horrendous explosion does n’t talk you out of it , the fact that roaches often survive the megabombing should .
Little can compare to seeing your home in ruins , its windows and walls blasted out , its roof lifted , and the whole of the house shifted off its foundation . . . but with roaches still scurrying about the ruins .
Yet a number of foolhardy homeowners have created just such scenarios .
Barbara “ bombs away ” Mikkelson
Update :
In April 2005 , various news outlets reported three men were hospitalized for burn treatment after they attempted to fumigate a Thai restaurant in Perth , Australia , with 36 insect bombs .
The fumigants released by the spray cans reportedly created a huge blast that blew the roof off the building when they were ignited by a pilot light in one of the restaurant ’s ovens :
A massive explosion rocked suburban Duncraig today after chemicals released during last night ’s do - it - yourself fumigation ignited , blowing out the back wall and lifting the roof off the Tamarind restaurant .
A massive explosion rocked suburban Duncraig today after chemicals released during last night ’s do - it - yourself fumigation ignited , blowing out the back wall and lifting the roof off the Tamarind restaurant .
The blast caused an estimated $ 500,000 damage , fire authorities said .
The restaurant owner and two staff members had closed the premises to set off 36 insect - control bombs throughout the building .
Eight bombs would have been enough , West Australian police and fire and emergency personnel said .
Investigators believed a pilot light in one of the restaurant ’s ovens ignited the huge amount of chemicals released by the bombs to kill insects such as fleas and cockroaches .
In January 2008 , the Galveston County Daily News reported that a resident left six foggers working inside his house but neglected to extinguish the pilot lights , triggering a blast that blew the roof off the home .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - A German medical student got some unexpected practical experience at the zoo when she gave the kiss of life to a baby tiger choking on a piece of meat , the zoo director said Friday .
The student was passing the enclosure with her toddler son on a visit several weeks ago when she noticed the 4 - month - old tiger choking and offered her assistance to the helpless keeper , said Andreas Jacob , director of the zoo in the eastern German city of Halle .
“ The tiger tried to eat a piece of meat that was too big and started choking and shaking and then fell over , ” the student , Janine Bauer , told MDR radio .
“ We got the piece out but he was n’t breathing so I tried mouth - to - mouth and heart massage , ” she added .
“ After 3 - 5 minutes he came to , thank God . ”
The zoo , which held a ceremony Friday to thank Bauer , has decided to call the tiger Johann , after her one - year - old son .
Despite last minute attempts by the French government to divide them , European
MEPs today voted decisively against " three strikes " , the IFPI - promoted plan to
create a class of digital outcasts , forbidden from accessing the Net if
repeatedly accused by music companies of downloading infringing content .
In a vote held today , hundreds of MEPs supported
href = " http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sce/server/internet/amend_motions_texts/sce_amend_motions_texts_main_02.jsp?ref=A6-0063/2008 ">language
which declared termination of Internet access to be in conflict with " civil
liberties and human rights and with the principles of proportionality ,
effectiveness and dissuasiveness " , all core values of the European Union .
In an attempt to limit the damage of this vote , the French government ( whose
President , Nicholas Sarkozy publically supports three strikes ) wrote to all
French MEPs to oppose the vote .
" Three strikes " advocates also worked hard to
divide support for the amendment .
They successfully managed to split the
language into two parts , to be voted on separately : the first section condemned
any action that would conflict with such ideals , but failed to specify what
those actions might be .
The second specifically named disconnecting Net users
as being beyond the pale .
EFF ( which has been following the Bono report closely since the first attempts were made to " hijack " it last October )
collaborated with activists across Europe to co-ordinate support for
the amendment , and wrote to all MEPs yesterday to point out the real dangers of
graduated response , and urge a vote for both parts .
French
Net activists ,
including the new Squaring the Net
initiative , contacted their MEPs en masse to oppose the French Government 's
recommendation .
And Guy Bono , the author of the report ,
href = " http://www.laquadrature.net/en/european-parliament-rejects-graduated-response ">
had
this to say in the plenary :
" On this subject , I am firmly opposed to the position of some Member States ,
whose repressive measures are dictated by industries that have been unable to
change their business model to face necessities imposed by the information
society .
The cut of Internet access is a disproportionate measure regarding the
objectives .
It is a sanction with powerful effects , which could have profound
repercussions in a society where access to the Internet is an imperative right
for social inclusion . "
Both parts of the amendment passed .

The entertainment industry originally intended the Bono Report on the Cultural
Industries to be a stalking horse for their new approach , encouraging MEPs to
insert language that would show support for copyright extension , banning Net
users , and censoring the Net in the interests of rightsholders .
Instead it has turned into a
watershed : a clear rejection of the strategy of forcing the
telecommunications industry to act as a private police force for entertainment
lobby — and a positive endorsement of the Net 's free flow of information ,
and a positive agenda for copyright reform .
It seems like the music industry
will remain the only group to believe that spying , filtering and punishing your
own customers is a good idea : either for business , or for society as a whole .

When the News of the World revealed that Max Mosley , the president of Formula 1 and son of the fascist poseur Oswald , had been videotaped in a basement enjoying sadomasochistic sex with five prostitutes dressed in Nazi death - camp uniforms , it had no hesitation in calling the activity an orgy .
It seems a far cry from the original meaning of the word orgia : secret worship .
Shouting commands in German while helping one lady of the night whip another is hardly the same as attending a night - time prayer meeting to worship Dionysus or Orpheus .
Sex was n't supposed to come into it .
But these things get out of hand so easily .
Since the worship of Dionysus involved music , dancing , drinking and eating animal sacrifices , it was inevitable that some group rumpia - pumpia would ensue .
The Romans were n't noted for their restraint in god worship , particularly of Saturn , lord of death , and Bacchus , god of wine .
As Christianity took hold , the no-holds - barred Saturnalia and Bacchanalia festivals were spoken of with disapproval ; and the Latin orgia came to mean something depraved .
But then , imperial orgies really were depraved .
Tiberius Caesar , according to Suetonius , was a connoisseur : " teams of wantons of both sexes , selected as experts in deviant intercourse and dubbed analists , copulated before him in triple unions to excite his flagging passions . "

The word " orgy " passed into English in 1589 , and evidence exists that the English were no slouches at group sex .
Dancing round a Maypole was n't always mere skipping - with - ribbons .
It was ritual phallus - worship , after which the dancers would head for the open meadows .
" What clipping , what culling , what kissing and bussing , what smooching and slobbering one of another , " remarked the 16th - century Puritan Philip Stubbes , from his vantage point behind a bush .
After the Restoration , things calmed down .
The orgy became the toy of the aristocracy .
In England , its apogee was the rise of the Hellfire Club , founded by Sir Francis Dashwood , an MP for 20 years and a full - time rake .
He leased Medmenham Abbey on the Thames .
In the garden stood a statue of a naked Venus , bending over so that visitors walked straight into her bottom .
He built a network of caves and passages under a hill , with individual " cells " where the friars could wench .
The friars hired London " dollymops " and ferried them down the Thames on barges .
In France , the Marquis de Sade inherited the beautiful Château La Coste , overlooking the Vaucluse valley .
Possibly bored by the lovely view , he and his wife signed up young male servants and pretty girls and subjected them to violent sex , cruelty and coprophagy , as depicted in The 120 Days of Sodom .
In the 20th century , orgiasts were disappointingly few and far between .
The Bloomsbury group famously " lived in squares and loved in triangles " , but drew the line at actual group sex .
Aleister Crowley , the writer and self - publicist , tried to revive the spirit of Dashwood by presiding over black masses , worshipping Pan and taking the motto , " Do what thou wilt is the whole of the law " .
He moved to Sicily and headed a community of orgy enthusiasts .
Hippy culture introduced the concept of free love to an uptight American world in 1967 .
The counter - culture promoted a version of sexual democracy that saw the staff of Suck magazine having sex during editorial meetings .
Then The Joy of Sex was published .
Readers stared at its " Orgy " section , the line drawings of naked , bearded accountants and indefatigably middle - class women fondling each other – and decided that , Dionysus or no Dionysus , they were sure as hell never going to do that .
And suddenly , after 2000 - odd years , the orgy ( or'gy , noun : " A revel involving unrestrained indulgence , especially sexual activity " ) just did n't seem like a great idea any more .
NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Teenagers seem to know that loud music can damage their hearing , yet most see no reason to lower the volume on their iPods , a small study suggests .
In focus - group discussions with students at two high schools in the Netherlands , researchers found that the teens were generally aware that blasting an MP3 player could harm their hearing .
Yet most said they usually played their own device at maximum volume and had no plans to change that .
Like many teenagers , the students often denied their own personal risk .
Most knew the general hazards of loud music , but believed they had a “ low personal vulnerability ” to hearing loss , the researchers report in the Journal of Pediatrics .
Given this , lead researcher Ineke Vogel told Reuters Health in an email interview , “ we strongly recommend parents to inform their children and to discuss with their children the use of MP3 players and the potential long - term , irreversible consequences for hearing capacity . ”
Parents can also look for signs of a problem , like when a child complains of ringing in the ears or sounds being “ muffled , ” according to Vogel and co-researcher Dr. Hein Raat , who are both based at the University Medical Center Rotterdam .
Based on the focus - group discussions , though , many parents may be unaware of the hearing risks posed by MP3 players , the researchers note .
Of the 73 students in the study , few said their parents had warned them that playing the devices too loud could harm their hearing .
It may also be necessary for MP3 manufacturers to make changes , the researchers note in their report .
Many students in the study said they did not know how to tell when their MP3 players were too loud .
Volumes at or above 90 decibels ( dB ) are believed to be hazardous , Vogel ’s team notes , but noise levels need to reach 120 dB to 140 dB to become uncomfortable or painful .
Manufacturers , according to the researchers , could equip MP3 players with an indicator that displays the volume level in terms of decibels , along with a signal -- such as a flashing light -- that goes off when decibel levels reach the danger zone .
For now , Vogel and her colleagues recommend that , as a general “ rule of thumb , ” MP3 users set the volume no higher than 60 percent of its full capacity when using “ ear bud ” style headphones , like those that come with iPods .
With over - the - ear headphones , they recommend 70 percent as the maximum .
Just as there are safety standards for occupational noise exposure , Vogel and her colleagues suggest that more long - range studies are needed to develop safety guidelines for “ leisure - time ” noise exposure .

A Haight - Ashbury soup kitchen that served as many as 450 people a day for a quarter - century closed Friday , a casualty of dwindling federal grants and donation money .
Directors of the Haight Ashbury Food Program said they eventually hope to resurrect a similar but much - scaled - down food safety net for the homeless , disabled and working poor in the neighborhood .
" Everyone is talking about how the economy is down , and they can't give ( donations ) , but more people are losing their jobs , rents are going up - it's a horrible irony , " said Executive Director Michael Scribner .
At its peak several years ago , the program had an annual budget of just under $ 500,000 and four full - time and two part - time staffers , Scribner said .
In addition to serving hot meals four days a week , the program ran a noteworthy culinary training course that helped about 200 people land jobs at catering companies and in hospital and university kitchens .
The cooking school , however , grew pricy and inefficient , Scribner said .
After the rent on the church basement space tripled to $ 50,000 a year in 2006 and the federal government slashed aid last summer , the program cut the culinary school and reduced its services to one hot meal a week and brown bag service .
The nonprofit limped on from there ; but without additional funding , it was clear by late last year the program would have to shut its doors , Scribner said .
On Friday , volunteers emptied the center 's pantry and handed out lists of other soup kitchens and food banks .
Aside from providing food for the needy in the neighborhood , the center at 1525 Waller St. was also an important gathering place , according to Gary Barbaree , who was pastor at the Hamilton United Methodist Church , which housed the food program in its basement .
" There was food , but also community - you felt that right away , " said Barbaree , who has been tidying up loose ends since January , when the church closed .
The heart and soul of the program , Judy Woods , walked into the center 14 years ago , homeless and an addict , Scribner said .
After volunteering for years , she rose to become food service project director , and did a large amount of the program 's community outreach .
Barbaree said the church , which his research shows was designed by famed architect Julia Morgan , will not be sold .
But the owner , the trustees of the California - Nevada Conference of the United Methodist Church , would like to see a community services center there .
In fact , a reimagined Haight - Ashbury Food Program would be a welcome tenant , Barbaree said .
To that end , Scribner and his board will be brainstorming in coming weeks and months in order to figure out what kind of organization the neighborhood could support , whether a food pantry service , nutritional counseling or community garden outpost .
" The board wants to work with the community to find out what the food needs are , and what is a potentially sustainable model , " Scribner said .
The first is that the Fed believed their non-discount rate actions would bring a quick halt to the global financial panic that was sure to ensue once the world realized a small but venerable US investment bank was worth just $ 2 a share .
They were once again hoping that a seemingly bold action would put an end to the panic .
Moreover , they are probably still stinging from criticism that their 75 bp emergency cut in January was engineered to prop up equity markets .
Even if that strategy works , however , it works in part because market participants are expecting a full 100 bp cut in the fed funds rate as a follow up .
If you do n’t deliver that cut , the market would collapse on Tuesday , completely undoing the Sunday policy initiatives .
Moreover , as of 9:00 pm Pacific
Time , the Fed ’s efforts to stop a global panic are failing , with Asian markets and the Dollar in free fall .
So it looks like the Fed will have to deliver more policy easing Monday after all .
Why not just have an emergency FOMC teleconference and get it over with Sunday ?
The answer would be my second possible reason for the meager discount rate cut : Growing concern that an aggressive Fed easing at this point will trigger a Dollar collapse .
The Wall Street Journal ’s Greg
Ip suggested this weekend that future policy must take into account the Greenback :
As the Federal Reserve meets for a crucial meeting Tuesday , more than just the credit markets are weighing on its decision :
In recent weeks , the dollar also has joined its worry list .
But it is n't clear whether that argues in favor of a smaller or larger cut in interest rates … .
Up to a point , a lower dollar helps the Fed because it boosts exports at a time when consumers are under siege and business investment could be weakening .
That is as long as there is no disorderly decline .
But if the dollar feeds an impression the Fed is complacent and pushes up expected inflation , it could limit the Fed 's ability to cut rates to support the economy …
As for interest - rate policy , Mr. Truman said that on the one hand , it might nudge the Fed toward a smaller rather than larger cut to show concern about the dollar .
But , he said , it is n't that simple .
If that meant the Fed took inadequate action against the credit crunch , the economy could ultimately end up far weaker , requiring lower interest rates and a far weaker dollar .
" The Europeans are busy complaining about dollar weakness , [ but ] do they want the Federal Reserve to ignore the U.S. economy in the name of supporting the dollar ?
The answer is also no . "
Ted Truman hits the central point – policy may soon be dangerously close to the having to choose between a collapse of the Dollar and a more generalized banking crisis .
Another description of this tradeoff comes from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke in a 1995 paper , The Macroeconomics of the Great Depression : A Comparative Approach :
A particularly destabilizing aspect of this process was the tendency of fears about the soundness of banks and expectations of exchange - rate devaluation to reinforce each other ( Bernanke and James 1991 ; Temin 1993 ) .
An element that the two types of crises had in common was the so - called " hot money , " short - term deposits held by foreigners in domestic banks .
On one hand , expectations of devaluation induced outflows of the hot - money deposits ( as well as flight by domestic depositors ) , which threatened to trigger general bank runs .
On the other hand , a fall in confidence in a domestic banking system ( arising , for example , from the failure of a major bank ) often led to a flight of short - term capital from the country , draining international reserves and threatening convertibility .
Other than abandoning the parity altogether , central banks could do little in the face of combined banking and exchange - rate crises , as the former seemed to demand easy money policies while the latter required monetary tightening .
To be sure , Bernanke is describing the Fed ’s tradeoff during the Great Depression , when it was constrained by gold standard .
Still , the basic problem remains .
Tight policy would accelerate and intensify the pain in the banking system , but loose policy could destabilize the Dollar , causing capital to flee the US and also undermining the banking system .
And , to make matters worse , a collapse in the banking system due to tight money could then trigger a currency collapse .
I think it is safe to describe this as a no - win situation , which means an ugly choice has to be made .
And , with this in mind , perhaps the Fed only offered 25 bp on the discount rate in hopes they could avoid a greater than 25 bp cut in the Fed Funds rates .
At this point , that does not look like an acceptable domestic policy choice , and if they ultimate cut 50 bp or more , they have accepted the risk of destabilizing the Dollar .
I have to imagine that global central banks are ready to intervene at the drop of a hat , and would not be surprised by some action when New York opens Monday .
If there is an intervention , it will be interesting to see if the Fed participates .
Could the Fed credibly buy the Dollar one day while cutting rates 75 bp or more the next ?
And what are the odds of a successful intervention if the monetization option looks increasingly viable in the weeks ahead ?
There is nothing but tough policy questions at this juncture .
We can only hope that Yves Smith ’s contact is misinformed :
The Fed is badly out of its depth .
Not that this is a surprise , since its actions have looked desperate for a while ( was it Barry Ritholtz who said " 75 is the new 25 " ? ) .
This confirmation comes from a hedgie reader : A last note on the Fed .
A friend who ’s got very good contacts told me today that they ’re completely at sea here , not understanding what ’s going on , flying by the seat of their pants , and making policy completely on an ad hoc basis .
Not precisely what one would hope for in this situation .
Bottom Line :
An aggressive cut in the Fed Funds rate seems likely , with 100 bp certainly on the table .
Still , one has to ponder why this was not part of the Sunday policy package .
Could it really be as simple as not being able to contact enough FOMC members to have a teleconference ?
Or was it hope that a bigger than 25 bp Fed Funds rate cut might not actually be necessary ?
Or has the Fed come to believe that their policy actions might trigger a destabilizing fall in the Dollar ?
At this point , I anticipate a cut larger than 50bp , with even odds on 75 and 100 .
The greater the cut , the more the Fed is willing to risk a Dollar collapse .

[ Tim has an update here . ]
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- Democrats in Pennsylvania are split between those who think the biggest disaster of the Bush presidency has been the Iraq war and those who think it 's been his economic policies .
The middle - class and blue - collar voters who feel every twitch of the economy right in their pocketbooks are backing Hillary Clinton , hoping that she can bring back the economy of her husband 's presidency .
Other Democrats , better educated and perhaps better insulated from immediate economic worries , are in Barack Obama 's camp , inspired by his promise to change the way Washington works , especially how it deals with the rest of the world .
The enthusiastic way Democrats trooped to the polls on Tuesday can't be good news for the Republicans , who 'll send John McCain out in November to face the Democratic nominee , almost certainly Obama .
The conventional wisdom , spun by the Clinton campaign and reinforced by opinion polls showing that a significant number of Clinton Democrats say McCain is their second choice , is that Obama can't win in November .
The Democratic base of working - class whites will desert Obama , they say .
If he can't win the primaries in big Democratic states -- California , New York , Ohio or Pennsylvania -- he can't beat McCain .
The conventional wisdom , as it is so often , is wrong .
The stars are aligning for a Democratic landslide in November .
The economy , the war , and the general disgust with the Bush years are all moving in their direction , regardless of who the standard bearer is .
While the Democrats have been squabbling among themselves , McCain got a bounce in the polls and has moved to solidify his party 's base of conservatives .
He 's reaffirmed his support for the war and embraced the tax cuts he opposed in 2001 , tying himself even closer to Bush 's policies .
In politics , six months can be a lifetime .
But it 's likely that McCain 's support is peaking .
Between now and November , the Democrats are likely to unite again , the economic news is likely to worsen , the violence in Iraq is likely to continue , and the spotlight will focus on McCain as it never has before .
It 's been buried by the coverage of the Clinton - Obama spat , but McCain has stumbled several times in the past weeks in potentially fatal ways .
McCain , who 's running as the expert in foreign policy , revealed just how shallow his expertise is when he repeatedly confused the two major groups in Islam , claiming that radical Shiite Iran was backing radical Sunni Al Qaeda in Iraq .
It wo n't do , as his campaign now says , that " Al Qaeda " is simply short - hand for " Muslims we do n't like . "
" Black " is not short - hand for " white , " nor is " right " short - hand for " wrong . "
One test of whether someone is qualified to be commander in chief is knowing who the enemy is .
McCain has failed that test .
On the economy , McCain put a serious dent in his reputation as a straight - talker , blatantly pandering to voters by proposing more tax cuts , even suggesting a moratorium on the federal gasoline tax .
If McCain really believes global warming is a serious problem that must be addressed , he'd know that the price of gasoline is too low , not too high .
McCain can't tell the truth about what it will take to reduce greenhouse gases .
McCain 's budget numbers just do n't add up .
He 's gone from rejecting the first Bush tax cuts as being fiscally irresponsible to trying to out - Bush Bush .
That may play well with the Republican hard - core base , but to moderate voters it looks like McCain thinks every economic problem can be cured with a tax cut , a theory that 's proven its faults over the past seven years .
While McCain backed into his party 's nomination without even being forced to break a sweat , Clinton and Obama have honed their message and have mobilized a vast army of disgruntled Democrats .
Come November , some of them will remember the nasty fight in March and April , and will cross the line to vote for McCain .
Some will turn away from Obama because he 's black , or from Clinton because she 's a woman .
But the vast majority will vote for the Democrat because they believe the times and their own best interests demand it .
Alameda sheriff named in 2nd strip - search suit SAN FRANCISCO Class - action filing maintains sheriff still violating law
An Oakland man who says he was strip - searched in an Alameda County jail after a drunken - driving arrest has filed a federal class - action suit accusing the county of conducting the searches without evidence that detainees are hiding weapons or contraband .
Ron Charles Roth , 47 , filed suit two months after a judge gave final approval to a $ 6.2 million settlement of a similar federal class - action suit claiming that Alameda County authorities had conducted illegal strip searches at two jails from 2004 to 2006 .
A California Highway Patrol officer arrested Roth in front of his home Feb. 3 , 2007 , for allegedly being under the influence when he moved his car , Roth 's attorney , Mark Merin of Sacramento , said Monday .
Roth was taken to the Glenn E. Dyer Detention Facility , a jail in downtown Oakland run by the Alameda County sheriff 's office .
There , he was ordered to take his clothes off for an inspection , said the suit filed Jan. 14 in U.S. District Court in San Francisco .
Authorities later learned that Roth had a warrant for an outstanding ticket for fishing without a license from San Mateo County and transferred him there , the suit said .
Alameda County jailers routinely conduct strip - searches and visual body - cavity searches without having a " reasonable suspicion that the search will be productive of contraband or weapons , " said the suit , which names the county and Sheriff Greg Ahern .
Roth 's complaint claims the county violated privacy rights under state law and the U.S. Constitution .
It seeks damages of at least $ 5,000 for everyone subjected to similar searches since Jan. 1 , 2007 .
" This is the most dehumanizing thing you can do to somebody , " Merin said .
" The people who are charged with minor offenses , who have n't been arraigned , should at least be protected so they are n't naked unless they have some reason to believe they 're concealing something .
You can't have a blanket search . "
Sgt. J.D. Nelson , spokesman for the sheriff 's office , would not comment on the specifics of the case .
But he said the department had " definitely modified its strip - search policy since the settlement " of the earlier class - action lawsuit , which was also filed by Merin .
County Counsel Richard Winnie said Ahern " has been working very hard to make sure that jail policies fully conform with the ever - evolving policies of the courts .
It has been a very high priority of the sheriff ever since he took office . "
Merin agreed that some changes had been made since the earlier suit , such as installing privacy screens for searches .
The attorney has filed similar suits in San Francisco , Marin , San Mateo , Solano and Sacramento counties on behalf of adult and juvenile inmates .

Fresh outrage has erupted over the Olympic torch procession after it emerged that the blue - clad thugs witnessed manhandling protesters and barking orders during the torch relay in London were Chinese paramilitary police hired by Beijing and the British government to quell demonstrations .
Officially know as the 29th Olympic Games Torch Relay Flame Protection Unit , this gaggle of bullies were in actual fact , " Picked from special police units of the People ’s Armed Police , China ’s internal security force . "
The requirements for the job : to be " tall , handsome , mighty , in exceptional physical condition similar to that of professional athletes , " the state - run China News Service said .
The government - hired heavies were also taught to bark a few words of English for the purposes of ordering around torch bearers .
This cadre of gang members honed their expertise in martial arts , marksmanship and hand - to - hand combat , and are trained to brutally suppress demonstrations and farmer ’s uprisings in China which routinely result in the slaughter of scores of protesters who dare stand up to the Communist police state .
Hiring foreign paramilitary thug cops to police the streets of our cities is not only flagrantly illegal , it is a telltale sign that we too are living in an oppressive police state .
This is a damning indictment of the attitude the British Labour Party , self - proclaimed " liberals , " holds toward the notion of freedom of speech and the right to peaceably assemble in the UK .
Since the British government effectively outlawed the right to protest with the passage of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act of 2005 , demonstrators have taken it upon themselves to flout an unjust law that is anathema to any basic notion of freedom or human rights .
Knowing that any rough treatment towards the Tibetan protesters by the British police would reflect badly on the government ’s tattered reputation , Labour gratefully acquiesced to Beijing ’s demand to ship in some of China ’s most brutal thug cops in order to do their dirty work for them .
Shadow home secretary David Davis wrote a letter to Jacqui Smith , the Home Secretary , yesterday and demanded to know who ’s decision it was to unleash these animals onto British streets .
" They were seen manhandling protesters .
They even accompanied the torch into Downing Street , " said Davis .
These blue - clad goons did not only physically assault demonstrators , but even metered out their bullying tactics to Olympic officials and the torch bearers themselves .
A CBC News report compiled eyewitness reports of the thugs ’ behavior .
Yolaine De La Bigne , a French environmental journalist who was a torchbearer in Paris , told The Associated Press she tried to wear a headband with a Tibetan flag , but the Chinese agents ripped it away from her .
" It was seen and then , after four seconds , all the Chinese security pounced on me .
There were at least five or six ( of them ) .
They started to get angry " and shouted " No ! No ! No ! " in English , she said .
De La Bigne tried to push several agents away as they grabbed her arm .
She said two French athletes who are martial arts experts tried to help her and clashed briefly with the security detail .
The chairman of the London 2012 Games , Sebastian Coe , was even more blunt .
" They tried to push me out of the way three times .
They are horrible .
They did not speak English .
They were thugs , " Coe , a two - time Olympic gold medalist , was quoted as saying in British media .
A spokeswoman for the London 2012 Olympics committee confirmed that Coe was quoted accurately , but added that he thought he was making private comments .
" They were barking orders at me , like ‘ Run ! Stop !
This !
That !’ and I was like , ‘ Oh my gosh , who are these people ? " ’ former television host Konnie Huq told British Broadcasting Corp. radio about her encounter with the men in blue during London ’s leg of the relay Sunday .
This is just the latest example of how one element of globalization , the exchange of policing and troop deployment between countries , is conditioning people to accept foreign troops .
Before the 2006 soccer World Cup , the British government allowed uniformed German police to be on UK soil to identify " potential troublemakers " who were planning on traveling to the tournament .
Before the event , Germany ’s interior minister changed the country ’s constitution to allow internal troop deployments for " security " reasons .
As part of NATO exercises in September 2003 , armed Ukrainian and French soldiers were running checkpoints and harassing members of the public in Scotland .
Alex Jones has attended numerous military urban warfare training drills across the U.S. where role players were used to simulate arresting American citizens and taking them to internment camps .
Foreign troops were routinely invited to join the training exercises .
Accepting the deployment of Chinese paramilitary thug cops to police a public event in Britain is completely illegal and indicates that Britons are living under a state of martial law and de-facto military occupation .
Despite empty rhetoric in the media on behalf of western governments supposedly slapping China on the hand for its human rights abuses , the real picture has now emerged .
The UK , the U.S. and China are one of a kind when it comes to using paramilitary police thugs and martial law tactics to silence dissent – and the governments of the three countries are joined at the hip in their efforts to stamp down the jackboot on the right to demonstrate against abuses of the state .

A post by " Belloc " on our Forum was noticed by one of the actual GM engineers that is building the Chevy Volt .
That engineer writes to me " I 'm an enthusiastic reader of the gm- volt.com site " and " I 'm trying to ensure that it's ( the Volt ) got the best features that the customers ' want .
Belloc 's post : " I would like a built in webserver ( like a wireless router )
That would allow me to monitor the electricity used / gas used / miles traveled etc ...
I would like to be able to see my day to day usage as well as a week and month breakdown .
I would also like to be able to enter in my electricity cost and fill up cost to track all expenses .
I would also like to monitor hours on engine .
When the next maintenance is due ( oil change etc ) also I would like a history of all maintenance that was performed over the history of the vehicle .
" It turns out GM is wondering whether this kind of thing would be a good option for the production car .
The GM engineer asked me to throw out the following questions from him to you , the GM - volt.com readership : 1-- Would you prefer the tracking information for costs / electrical usage / gas usage , etc. be provided in the vehicle or by a weekly / monthly e-mail ?
2-- Would you be willing to pay for this option ?
If so , how much ?
3-- Would you like other information , such as emissions reduced , CO2 negated , etc.4 -- Would you like a calculation of cost savings of electricity over fuel ?
5-- Would you be willing to pay more for the vehicle to know the rates for electricity and delay charging until the rates are lowest ?
Give the GM Volt team your thoughts in the comments section , and vote in the poll below .
Witness the importance of this site and your opinions in the development of this revolutionary vehicle !
As for me , I 'd like a wireless networking server in the car that provides battery SOC , time and distance to depletion , and the ability to check my car 's charging status from any browser , and of course a GM - Volt.com icon on the dash and screen so that we can all network about our Volts anytime !
While I 'm at it , I 'd also like to be able to see the depletion of my batteries energy graphically in real - time while driving , and have the dash show me optimum driving velocity for grade so that I may make the charge last the longest .
Oh yeah , and of course I want the whole dash to be a programmable LCD screen .
I think this geeked out setup should be an option at extra charge of $ 499 .

Going under and ' feeling ace '
A hypnotist from West Sussex has undergone surgery on his right hand without a general anaesthetic .

He said he was fully aware of everything going on around him during the procedure but was free from pain .
The operation at Worthing Hospital involved removing some bone in the base of the thumb and fusing some joints in an attempt to improve his arthritis .
Consultant orthopaedic surgeon David Llewellyn - Clark said he was happy in agreeing to the unusual sedation on Mr Lenkei , a registered hypnotist who has been practising since the age of 16 .
At one stage a hammer and chisel was used as well as a surgical saw , but I felt no pain
Alex Lenkei Mr Lenkei said Wednesday 's surgery " went amazingly well " .
" It took between 30 seconds to a minute for me to place myself under hypnosis , and from that point I felt a very deep relaxation .

The Associated Press
March 27 , 2008
PHILADELPHIA ( AP ) — Comcast Corp. , an Internet service provider under investigation for hampering online file - sharing by its subscribers , announced Thursday an about - face in its stance and said it will treat all types of Internet traffic equally .
Comcast said it will collaborate with BitTorrent Inc. , the company founded by the creator of the peer - to - peer file - sharing protocol , to come up with better ways to transport large files over the Internet instead of delaying file transfers .
Since user reports of interference with file - sharing traffic were confirmed by an Associated Press investigation in October , Comcast has been vigorously defending its practices , most recently at a hearing of the Federal Communications Commission in February .
Consumer and ” Net Neutrality ” advocates have been equally vigorous in their attacks on the company , saying that by secretly blocking some connections between file - sharing computers , Comcast made itself a judge and gatekeeper for the Internet .
They also accused Comcast of stifling delivery of Internet video , an emerging competitor to the core business of the nation ’s largest cable operator .

11:52 p.m. | The Wrap : Senator Clinton won the state by nearly 10 points .
We wo n’t really know until the results come in from the suburbs , where this thing is still a squeaker .
Those voters are torn !
It ’s neck and neck in Montgomery County .
With 39 percent of the vote in , Mrs. Clinton led 51 - 49 percent .
In Delaware County , with 75 percent reporting , it was 51 - 49 Obama .
Our friends in Chester were just posting 22 percent of the vote and Mr. Obama was ahead , 54 - 46 .
Half of Bucks was in , and Mrs. Clinton maintained a 2 - 1 lead .
Despite its image as gentrified horse country , that ’s only part of the story ; Bucks is also home to working class neighborhoods and converted old mills like the Fairless Works ( where both she and Mr. Obama campaigned ) .
In Philadelphia , we wondered what might have gone wrong , but that was an early read .
The results were as lopsided as they were expected to be .
With 98 percent of precincts reporting , Mr. Obama led by 65 - 35 , or about 130,000 votes .
That ’s a big win but not enough to offset Mrs. Clinton ’s big margins across the rest of the state .
Basically , she crushed him , especially in those much - discussed older , Catholic , working - class regions .
In Allegheny County ( Pittsburgh ) , she won 55 - 45 .
In the counties around there , she racked up her best margins in the state and perhaps her best in the entire country .
Fayette County , in southwest Pa. , voted for her 79 - 21 ; Westmoreland was hers , 69 - 31 .
This is “ Deer Hunter ” territory , full of Reagan Democrats .
Her ancestral county of Lackawanna , around Scranton , an old coal region where her grandfather worked in the lace mill and where her father is buried , also came through for her , 74 - 26 .
Two small bright spots for Mr. Obama :
He won Lancaster County convincingly , 55 - 45 .
The mayor there was on his side , and he spent a lot of time there .
The other : Center County , home to State College , also known as Penn State .
The kids came out .
Bottom line , Mrs. Clinton ’s sweep of the working - class men is her best selling point to the superdelegates and a big danger sign for Mr. Obama .
The night gave her a bounce in her overall popular vote ; we ca n’t tell yet by just how much .
The delegate situation wo n’t be sorted out until the morning ; there were 158 delegates up to be divided .
The state proved a big plus for her , despite the mixed message in the suburbs .
She can only hope that it had the desired effect of fueling doubts about Mr. Obama ’s electability .
11:05 p.m. | Milking
It : Our colleague Michael Luo , who ’s keeping track of the money in this campaign , tells us that Clinton officials are saying they are experiencing their best
night ever in fund - raising online , bringing in well over $ 1 million in
the two hours since she was declared the winner .
11 p.m. | Counting :
We just checked in with elections officials in Chester County , where only 72 of 224 precincts have reported .
They say they had a huge turnout and were still getting calls _ it ’s 11 p.m.!
_ from officials at various polling places about how to handle provisional ballots .
“ They ’re still at the polls wrapping things up , ” said a worker at election HQ in West Chester .
The Web site ( www.chesco.org/election) is also really slow .
10:51 p.m. | Tit - for - Tat : Mr. Obama takes on Senator McCain in a big way .
This is what he says first off , after congratulating Senator Clinton for her win tonight : “ After 14 long months , it ’s easy to forget this from time to time – to lose sight of the fierce urgency of this moment .
“ It ’s easy to get caught up in the distractions and the silliness and the tit - for - tat that consumes our politics ; the bickering that none of us are entirely immune to , and that trivializes the profound issues – two wars , an economy in recession , a planet in peril , issues that confront our nation . ”
( And an ad waiting to be made :
The shoutout to the frat boys standing behind Mr. Obama ; they ’re a standing bit of product placement for Abercrombie & Fitch . )
10:45 p.m. | Obama ’s Up : Senator Obama ’s campaign has released text of his remarks .
He ’s up now .
And thanking John Mellencamp for being in Indiana .
10:34 p.m. | Family : Former President Bill Clinton who does n’t usually show up at these things , is with her tonight .
( As is Chelsea , who usually does . )
He may have made a difference in some of those small counties , which went solidly for her .
He ’s ready to roll forward , with five events scheduled for tomorrow in North Carolina .
10:27 p.m. | Taking on Obama ’s Strength : “ Because of you , the tide is turning , ” Mrs. Clinton told the crowd .
“ We were up against a formidable opponent who outspent us 3 - 1 .
He broke every spending record in this state , trying to knock us out of the race .
Well , the people of Pennsylvania had other ideas about that . ”
Here are the actual numbers on TV spending , from the Campaign Media Analysis Group , in the last 30 days .
In Philadelphia , Mrs. Clinton spent $ 2.1 million compared with $ 4.7 by Mr. Obama .
In Pittsburgh , Mrs. Clinton spent $ 630,00 compared with Mr. Obama ’s $ 1.9 million .
10:18 p.m. | She Takes the Stage : Senator Clinton talks about the road from Pennsylvania to Pennsylvania Avenue .
She frames her win in a way that superdelegates can understand .
She said she and Mr. Obama were judged “ side by side ” during the campaign , and each made “ our best case . ”
“ You listened , ” she said , “ and today you chose . ”
Update :
In her speech tonight , Senator Clinton once again invoked the women ’s pull , talking about really elderly women who did n’t have the right to vote and younger women who were now getting the chance to see a woman running for president .
Full text of her speech here .
10:15 p.m. | Results Lag :
What does sophisticated Montgomery County have in common with rural Potter County ?
No results !
Zero .
In fact , all four suburbs seem to be lagging behind the rest of the state , even behind Philadelphia .
Chester has reported zero also .
Delaware County has about a third counted and is so far giving the edge to Mrs. Clinton .
In Bucks , 10 percent of the vote is in and it ’s going 2 - 1 for Mrs. Clinton .
In Philadelphia , with 76 percent of the vote in , Mr. Obama is ahead 2 - 1 .
That ’s not the big margin that he needed there .
There will be a lot of post - election analysis about what went wrong for him in the city .
Get Ready for the Speech : Mrs. Clinton is coming up on stage .
She ’s in Philadelphia .
Mr. Rendell is about to introduce her .
10:04 p.m. | Mapping the Returns : Check out our map .
If you ’re reading us , you ’ve probably already seen it .
But it ’s great .
You just click on a county and the latest results pop up .
So you can play along at home .
10:03 p.m. | Divining the Capitol : How to read the early returns from Dauphin County , where Harrisburg , the state capitol , is located ?
It ’s the roost for Governor Rendell , who is Mrs. Clinton ’s biggest fan .
Did n’t all those state workers get the memo ?
Another theory — the Democrats who live in and near Harrisburg are in fact more liberal than other Democrats in the state .
Either way , this is a bit embarrassing for the governor .
But we ’ll see what the suburbs do .
They may be a better measure of Mr. Rendell ’s influence .
Or not ; the well - educated suburban voters are less likely than most to vote for someone based on an endorsement .
Anyway , the suburbs are still out , although earliest returns suggest Mrs. Clinton is slightly ahead in Delaware County .
9:47 p.m. | Obama Steps Off the Plane : From our colleague Jeff Zeleny : Mr. Obama learned of his defeat as he landed in Indiana about 9:38 p.m .
He huddled with aides at the front of his campaign plane , but did not speak to reporters .
He intended to address the Pennsylvania results during a speech scheduled to begin at 10:45 p.m.
Stay tuned .
9:39 p.m. | Signs , Signs , Signs : Check out the picture of the Clinton rally on our site .
What jumps out is how many union signs are there .
We noticed this at Senatr Clinton ’s rally late Monday night at the Palestra .
The unions — AFSCME , the American Federation of Teachers among them — have stood by her .
This may be good for the TV backdrop but it emphasizes her institutional support , not a rising up of the grassroots .
9:35 p.m. | Calling
It : The Times just weighed in , to declare Senator Clinton the winner in the Pennsylvania primary .
9:30 p.m. | The Clinton Camp : Terry McAuliffe , former chairman of the Democratic National Committee and longtime Clinton loyalist , just said on CNN : “ They could n’t put us away here , they could n’t put us away in Ohio , Texas , New Hampshire .
We ’re not giving up anywhere .
We ’re going to compete ; there ’s nine contests yet to go .
700 delegates yet to be chosen .
There ’s a long way to go in this nominating battle . ”
9:25 p.m. | What ’s Next ? :
Whatever her margin of victory , Mrs. Clinton is leaving no doubt that this race goes forward .
She ’s on most of the morning shows Wednesday and then is on to North Carolina .
She ’ll be joined there by Hugh Shelton , former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs , who endorsed her last month .
It ’s Indiana on Friday and Saturday .
9:15 p.m. | Who ’s Talking First ?
Senator Clinton is due on TV a bit before 10 p.m. , in time for the local news .
Mr. Obama is on a plane , headed to a rally in Indiana .
( That ’s a Clintonian strategy — if the news is bleak , jump ahead to the next proving ground . )
It ’s not clear when Mr. Obama will go before the cameras , but in this case , it looks as if the winner will be on before the loser .
Election Night etiquette is out the window .
9:09 p.m. | Networks Call for Clinton :
Well , the networks are calling this a win for Senator Clinton .
In fact , Fox News and MSNBC went first .
The Associated Press chimed in at 8:57 .
CNN followed suit at 9:04 .
They are basing this on exit polls , although no more than 5 percent of the vote had been reported .
Of course , she was expected to win , but the big mystery of the night remains — what ’s her margin ?
Maybe they ’ll tell us when 10 percent of the vote is in !
9 p.m. | Patterns :
More from the exit polls while we continue to wait for results :
Not surprisingly , both candidates are doing well among the same groups they have in other states .
Mrs. Clinton was leading among older voters , women and those who are less affluent and less educated .
In fact , among white union members with no college education , she is winning almost three - quarters of the vote .
That ’s significant .
As we said above ( or below , depending on how you ’re reading ) , this has to be troubling to superdelegates who are weighing how Mr. Obama would stand up in a general election .
At the same time , Mr. Obama is winning black voters and those under 45 overwhelmingly .
He ’s also got the college grads .
Geographically , he is doing best in Philadelphia and its suburbs , as expected , while Mrs. Clinton is winning the majority of the vote in the rest of the state .
The question , obviously , is what the numbers are .
They are sloooowww coming in .
8:41 p.m. | Uh - Oh , Left Out :
One other tidbit from Pa. elections officials :
They say a lot of people who are independents have been showing up , thinking they could vote in the Democratic contest .
Too bad they were n’t paying attention earlier .
As Caucus readers know , you have to be registered as a Democrat to vote in the party ’s primary .
That shuts off a stream of voters who have been helpful to Mr. Obama in other states .
Their absence tonight could obviously hurt him .
8:38 p.m. | Waiting , Waiting :
Hey , where ’s the action ?
Voters are still standing in line in Pa.
Nothing but commercials on TV .
This could be a long night .
We know you want to switch to American Idol .
We ’ll give you those results too .
8:30 p.m. | White Men Weigh
In : Fifty - five percent of white men are backing Mrs. Clinton , according to the latest exit polls .
If that holds , that ’s a bad sign for Mr. Obama — not just for tonight , but down the road in making the argument that he is the better general election candidate .
8:20 p.m. | Bucks County Dispatch : In Bucks County , another big important suburban county , results probably wo n’t start being posted until 9 p.m. , Deena Dean , the top election official there , tells us .
She said she did n’t know yet if turnout was especially high .
But she said there was just a ton of paperwork for officials to complete at each place ( counting absentee ballots , the write-ins and the results from the machines .
Then they have to close the machines down , transfer the numbers to return sheets , etc. ) .
Then they have to physically drive the results to one of two drop - off points .
She did n’t expect to see the first results until 9 p.m .
Bucks is another county that was historically Republican and just turned blue .
It has some blue - collar areas along with affluent ones .
Hard to predict how this one will tilt .
8:11 p.m. | Surprise ! :
Guess what ?
John McCain has won the Republican primary in Pennsylvania !
8 p.m. | Polls Are Closing Suburban Montgomery County wo n’t have its results until at least 10 p.m. , we just learned from election officials .
This is crucial because Montgomery is the third biggest county in the state , and results will be meaningless without Montgomery , which is perceived as tilting toward Mr. Obama .
We just talked to Joe Passarella , the top election official there , who said he did n’t expect to start posting results until at least 10 p.m .
Turnout is high , he said , and the county had a big jump in registration because so many Republicans switched to become Democrats .
In fact , the county just flipped to blue from red , for the first time since Reconstruction .
In any case , Mr. Passarella said the poll workers had a lot to do , including counting the absentee ballots , before they could post the results .
He added that the polls were closing on time , but there were still a lot of people in line , and officials ca n’t post final results until everyone has voted .
7:50 p.m. | Voter Identity : The Committee of Seventy , the watchdog group in Philadelphia , says it has reports of “ numerous issues with party identification in voter registration logs . ”
Apparently some counties have listed people as independents , even though they ’re Democrats .
Not sure how widespread the problem is , but voters should be able to get provisional ballots , which would let them vote anyway .
7:30 p.m. | The Ad Wars : Voters are telling exit pollsters that they did n’t much like that flurry of negative ads in the last few days .
And yet a majority said those ads were very important or somewhat important in their decisions .
This is evidence of what political operatives often say — that people say they do n’t like it when candidates go negative and yet they do pay attention to it .
In other words , it works .
7:25 p.m. | Polls Close Soon :
Hi readers ,
Polls close in Pennsylvania in a little more than 30 minutes .
We began posting a couple of hours ago , and you can check out the lay of the land there .
( What to Watch For . )
We ’ll be referring back to that periodically , to give you a sense of where the vote is coming from and what it means .
We ’re beginning the live - blogging here , and we ’ll keep you up to date with our own analysis as well as tidbits from around the blogosphere , TV land and our colleagues in the field .
Gov. Ed Rendell , Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s de facto campaign manager in Pennsylvania , is on MSNBC right now , saying she ’ll win by 7 or 8 points .
Mr. Rendell loves politics and loves talking about the game more than most pols .
You think we ’ll hear from him again tonight ?
( As much as he loves to talk politics , he loves to talk politics on TV . )
The exit polls earlier today showed that Pennsylvanians find the economy uppermost on their minds , many suggesting the nation was already in a recession .
( President Bush asserted otherwise today , saying the economy was only in a slowdown . )
Our colleague Larry Rohter blogged about the surveys here .
" have had the benefit of undetectable back - doors into highly secure government and military computer networks for months , perhaps years . "
If already for years , so why the information will only be allowed to leak into the public in this highly sensitive period of increasing anti-China and anti-West sentiments in the West and China ?
Counterfeited products , either it be hardware or other kind of products , even fake SUGAR or fake Bottled Water in China is real .
The Chinese consumers learned to live with it and know one basic concept " cheap = low quality / warranty " .
When a product is obvious lower than at the neigbour shop or the usual market retail price , China consumer learned not to buy it or is willingly to take a risk of buying something fake .
The supply chains are all too familiar , but it was quite shocking that the US government would allow 2nd / 3rd sub -contractors to place hardware orders .
Why the US government does not cut a country - wide deal directly with CISCO or other branded US hardware manufacturers , I 'm quite sure with the total volume combined they would be much better off than going two three layers down the supply chain , not to mention the security risks .
Another very weird sheet is " Why CISCO ? " , and then simply state that CISCO owes 80 % market share .
So is that the reason for a quality purchasing nowadays with taxpayer money ?
US - CHINA Joint Liaison Group :
In the only sheet reharding how the cooperation is working , I believe it lacks some fundamental problem - solving actions .
If I was the head of this group :-
Do n't limit the group 's efforts at border protections or so - called meaningless Intellectual trademark blabla -
No more 2nd - 3rd contractors and only dealing with CISCO or whichever brand owner directly .
CISCO can always include the so - called golden partners in the deal , but effectively governments should be only dealing with CISCO .
If they refuse , purchase from someone else who can satisfy your service and quality requirements instead of only the price or " because they owe 80 % of the market . " .-
If a purchase order is aligned with the US Government , then only authorized secured manufacturing plants can produce and assembly the hardware and components . - CISCO should put their own engineers on the spot to monitor the productions .-
Chinese customs should check the plants in a regular and strict way .
ANY corruption by Chinese ' officials should be punished severe by the Chinese government .-
This punishment should be against the plant as well and all the direct people involved , the greedy people offering the corruptions !-
US government should recruit authorized preferred Inspection companies to check EVERY single order .
These quality inspectors are commonly well - known and used by Foreign Brand owners and importers who do care about the quality of their own products .
-ZERO tolerance an 100 % check .
Every production AND outgoing shipment .
Someone like APPLE will send their own inspectors standing next to the production line when producing the Ipods and Iphones in China !!!
Why can't the US government do that ?-
Incoming governmental shipments should go into a consolidated Warehouse in the West coast , either use a AQL or for higher security another 100 % quality check , before dispatching to the rest of the country .
- The most ideal is that the US create an own Purchasing department , every single purchasing should be going through this department .
With her own inspecting teams and with the coordinated efforts you can cut out the best deals .
of course Corruption in this department should be punished severe as well .-->
Even when a production ( all components / assembly ) is done in the US , even then a good quality inspection for every production should be ensured .
[ edit on 21/4/08 by IchiNiSan ]
When Al Gore won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday , conservatives reacted with apoplexy .
Talk show hosts like Rush Limbaugh , conservative bloggers and other Republican faithful denounced the prize as a fraud .
You might wonder why they care so much -- Gore , after all , is obviously not going to run for president , and even some conservatives now concede that global warming is real .
The answer is that Gore ’s triumph is a measure of George W. Bush ’s disrepute .
Indeed , in the political culture , Gore ’s role is as a negative indicator of the president ’s standing .
For all the talk of a “ new Al Gore , ” there ’s nothing new about the man .
His public reputation is almost entirely a function of Bush’s .
The high point of Bush ’s prestige came in the months after Sept. 11 , 2001 .
As Bush put it in a year - end interview : “ All in all , it ’s been a fabulous year for Laura and me . ”
( It certainly was , if you could put aside the 3,000 American deaths , which Bush apparently could . )
Advertisement
That was also the moment when it was most fashionable to ridicule Gore .
He was described as “ goofily bearded ” or “ sulking . ”
Democrats were publicly declaring they were glad Bush , and not Gore , was in the Oval Office .
Gore , the thinking went , was too intellectual and lacked Bush ’s gut - sense understanding of good and evil .
A staunch Gore backer explained his relief at Bush ’s victory thusly : " [ Gore ] may know too much . ”
At the time , this trait was seen as far more problematic than knowing too little .
A poll in late 2001 found that 76 % of Americans preferred Bush over Gore as a war leader .
In 2002 , when Gore began to criticize Bush ’s approach to Iraq , conservatives attacked him savagely .
The popular phrase at the time was “ moral clarity , ” a trait Bush had but Gore lacked .
It ’s not an accident that the current celebrations of Gore come at a time when Bush ’s popularity has cratered .
Once conservatives mocked Gore as the radical tribune of a tiny political fringe ; now it is they who represent the fringe .
Advertisement
Their argument with Gore over global warming is a telling indicator of their weakened position .
Suddenly , open debate looks better than absolute clarity .
Steven F. Hayward , a global warming skeptic at the conservative American Enterprise Institute , sniffed : “ The Nobel will be one more quiver in Gore ’s arsenal of intransigent moral authority by which he refuses to debate any aspect of the subject and declares the entire matter ‘ settled . ’
It ’s never a good sign when politicians declare a scientific matter settled ; we all remember how well that worked out for the Vatican when they told Galileo 400 years ago that astronomy was settled . ”
So Gore ca n’t declare that any scientific matter is settled ?
( What about the Earth revolves around the sun -- would that offend conservatives ? )
Funny what happens when it ’s your views that are out of the mainstream .
The defensiveness of Gore ’s critics comes because he is the ultimate rebuke to Bush .
Gore , obviously , is the great historic counter - factual , the man who would have been president if Florida had a functioning ballot system .
More than that , he is the anti-Bush .
He is intellectual and introverted , while Bush is simplistic and backslapping .
Some of us prefer a president like Gore no matter what .
But many people do n’t have a strong preference , or do n’t think very hard about what Gore would have been like as president .
Therefore , he lacks a positive identity ; people think of him only as the anti-Bush .

But Gore is highly prescient in his own right .
Not only was he an early activist against global warming , he favored the first Gulf War , urged military action in the Balkans and opposed the current Iraq war .
His denunciation of Bush as a captive of business interests -- ridiculed as dime - store populism -- has proved a telling critique of this administration , which has crafted legislation perfectly suited to oil companies , HMOs and pharmaceuticals .
But his standing in history will probably have less to do with anything he said or did than with Bush ’s record .
Fortunately for Gore , though unfortunately for the world , he ’s likely to make out just as well either way .
Anyone See The Irony Here ?
You ’ve probably read the story about an estimated 10,000 people gathered on the University of Colorado ’s Norlin Quadrangle Sunday , puffing joints till the air turned blue .
University police stood by to maintain order , but no one was busted for smoking pot .
In the meantime , the DEA is staunchly defending its policy against American farmers legally growing industrial hemp , citing the law that says all hemp is marijuana .
How ’s your war on drugs coming along , anyway , DEA ?
The sun is shining , and if you ’d pull your heads out , you ’d see it .
Pot is here , lots of it available , if this number of people can show up and get loaded on just one day in one city and no one is arrested .
Where did these pot -heads get their stuff , it surely did n’t come out of a couple of bags , and there was apparently enough to go around to get some 10,000 heads high .
How many more smoke - outs were held on April 20th , the annual , internationally recognized celebration of marijuana ?
How many tons of pot went puff ?
Now I ’m not in favor of marijuana , primarily because of its affect on the lungs .
Pot heads will tell you there ’s no danger , but the cigarette companies told us that decades ago , and a lot of us are dying of COPD everyday .
My point here is that while these young people are getting loaded on an illegal drug in public as cops stand by , two farmers in North Dakota are trying desperately to legally grow industrial hemp .
Their fight is now in Federal Appeals Court , hoping to overturn a lower court ’s decision upholding the DEA ’s position .
You can read more about the campaign to legalize industrial hemp cultivation in the U.S. at Vote Hemp .
Farmers in Vermont are ramping up their efforts to the the government to allow farmers there to grow hemp , and other states have passed , or are considering legislation to change the law .
Currently before congress is H.R. 1009 , ( PDF ) the “ Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2007 ”
Why have legal hemp ?
It ’s one of the most useful plants on earth .
It ’s been cultivated for thousands of years and used for everything from food and medicine to clothing and automobile parts .
It ’s grown legally in many countries , except in the US , so to take advantage of the many products made from hemp , we must import them .
So what can we do to get the government to change it ’s position on hemp ?
Do you think it will ever change ?

UPDATE : We ’re so pleased that so many of you are chiming in on this topic , and have created a discussion forum for this topic .
Come by , and continue to chime in …
For anyone who underscores the significance of blood in MMA , ask UFC lightweight Kenny Florian about his 2006 decision loss to Sean Sherk .
Behind on the scorecards going into the fifth round , Florian tried to submit his opponent .
" I cut Sean with an elbow , " Florian said .
He was bleeding all over me .
Mentally , someone else 's blood pouring in your face and mouth is awful .
I took three showers .
I can still smell and taste it . "
In their first encounter , Sean Sherk 's cut threw Kenny Florian off his game .
Sherdog.com
When it comes to blood , when is too much too much ?
What criteria are used to determine a stoppage by the referee or doctor , and how are cuts prevented and handled during a fight ?
A cut 's location is the most decisive factor .
" When a cut involves the soft tissue of the eyelid , I halt the action and bring the fighter to the doctor , " referee John McCarthy said .
" These are hard to repair and can do permanent damage . "
Cuts inside the orbit of the eye can affect the muscles or nerves ( resulting in a droopy eyelid ) , limit movement of the eyeball ( which produces double vision ) or affect the tear duct .
Cuts near the lashes , like that sustained by Randy Couture in his 2004 fight against Vitor Belfort , do not appear serious , but can quickly result in blindness without immediate surgery .
Lip lacerations across the vermillion border ( the colored portion ) result in scarring and difficulty closing the mouth , while cuts inside the ear could indicate a serious skull fracture .
All " pumpers " ( arterial bleeding ) end fights because they are difficult to control and precipitate significant blood loss .
Scalp wounds , like the one Joe Stevenson suffered against B.J. Penn at UFC 81 , can be bloody , but are rarely dangerous unless they obscure a fighter 's vision .
Excessive bleeding inside the mouth can make a fighter choke or vomit .
" During the Genki Sudo - Duane Ludwig fight , Ludwig was bleeding so much inside his mouth he was gurgling blood that sprayed into Sudo 's face , " McCarthy said .
" I had to break the action to have him looked at and restarted it from a standing position . "
Genki Sudo , bottom , not only had to deal with Duane Ludwig 's strikes , but also his opponent 's blood .
Sherdog.com
Soon after that fight , the rules changed so that if the action breaks for medical assessment , the fighters are put back in the same position to prevent one athlete from gaining an unfair advantage .
There are several situations in which a fight is stopped due to a cut .
The first is if the injured fighter is at an unfair disadvantage should the fight continue .
Another is if the cut can lead to irreparable damage , should the fight continue .
The last is if the fighter is already losing and taking too much punishment .
Unless a cut is too dangerous at the onset , the cutman is given a round or two to control the bleeding .
The keys to stopping the flow of blood begin weeks before a bout .
Headgear is used in the gym to guard against cuts and facial swelling .
Florian pre-treats his eyebrows and eye area with Mederma and uses vitamin E on old scars .
He avoids using Aspirin and Motrin , which increase bleeding time , and any form of medicinal steroids that thin the skin .
A good cutman can make the difference between winning and losing .
Las Vegas ' Jacob " Stitch " Duran began as a cutman in 1985 and has worked on some of the biggest names in boxing , such as heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko .
Now he is a fixture at UFC fights .
" In boxing , you can do preventative maintenance , " said Duran .
" In MMA , cuts are almost guaranteed ; multiple cuts and head wounds on the same fighter are common .
I have established a good foundation that works in MMA .
I 'll clean out the cut between rounds and look at how bad it is , where the main vessel is , then apply epinephrine [ a coagulant ] .
I 'll also ice the fighter every round to contain any swelling . "
Duran also uses other coagulants , including avetine and thrombin , but cold , pressure and time will stop most bleeding .
Many fighters can't handle seeing their own blood .
" The first time I was cut , it freaked me out , especially having blood in your eyes , " Florian said .
" Now I have learned to stay calm and deal with it . "
In the Dec. 13 , 2006 , fight between Drew Fickett and Karo Parisyan , Duran took control to reassure his fighter , Parisyan , that he had the fight under control .
" Karo got a serious cut on his cheekbone , Duran said .
" He saw his face on the big TV screen .
By the time he gets to his corner , he can't see and is going crazy .
I took it upon myself to tell him , ' Do n't worry about the cut .
My job is to work on you . '
I worked the cut and he won the fight . "
Duran knows he is there to try to give the fighter one more round , but that can't always be the case .
" There have been times where a cut was too much to handle and I have made a recommendation to the ring physician that a fight stops , " he said .
McCarthy also does his part to prepare the combatants before the fight .
" I put it to the fighter in the locker room that if they are hurt to a point and they do n't want to quit , if they are significantly cut , I will stop the fight , " he said .
If a fighter 's bleeding is causing his opponent an inability to see , McCarthy will stop the action , bring the injured fighter to the doctor and allow the opponent to have the blood cleared from his vision .
" I have had blood in my eyes , " McCarthy said .
" It is n't like water , it is like a thick goop , and it is hard to clear by just blinking . "
No one dies from a cut during a fight , but blood frequently influences an outcome .
Ending a fight on a cut is typically due to multiple factors that have played out during the preceding rounds .
While blood - lusty fans may cry foul , the referee , doctor and cutman are there to enable a fight to proceed to its natural conclusion and allow the athletes to return to compete another day .

Abstract
The " Tahoe " project is a distributed filesystem , which safely stores files on multiple machines to protect against hardware failures .
Cryptographic tools are used to ensure integrity and confidentiality , and a decentralized architecture minimizes single points of failure .
Files can be accessed through a web interface or native system calls ( via FUSE ) .
Fine - grained sharing allows individual files or directories to be delegated by passing short URI - like strings through email .
Tahoe grids are easy to set up , and can be used by a handful of friends or by a large company for thousands of customers .
Introduction : What Is It ?
The " Tahoe " project is remote filesystem , a place to store files and directories on distant computers instead of your own .
The primary goal is robustness : increasing the chances that you will be able to get your data back .
The data is spread among several machines so that the files will be recoverable even if some of the servers are lost or unavailable .
All data is encrypted and validated to control who can read and modify the contents .
Individual files and directories can be shared by passing around small URI - like strings , in either read - write or read - only modes .
A Tahoe grid can be used to back - up files from a home computer , to make sure the data survives a fire or hard drive crash .
This grid could be commercially managed ( you pay for storage space ) , or run by a collection of friends on each other 's computers ( everybody provides storage for each other ) .
The directory - sharing features can be used by a group of coworkers to collaborate on a project ; a common place to which they can all read and write .
Each Tahoe client offers a web server through which users can upload and download files .
There are also FUSE plugins through which other programs can access the virtual filesystem .
Other front - ends are possible .
Tahoe is free software : all of the source code is available under an open - source license .
The home page is at http://allmydata.org .
Tahoe is sponsored by allmydata.com , which uses it as the back - end for a personal - data backup service .
This paper provides an overview of the Tahoe architecture , enough to get a clear idea of how it is designed and how the various pieces fit together .
For actual protocol specifications and installation instructions , please refer to the source code and its accompanying documentation .
This paper describes the tahoe - 0.8.0 release , and portions of it may be obsoleted by changes in subsequent versions .
How Does It Work ?
The short form : files to be uploaded are encrypted , then split up into pieces .
These pieces are created using a technique called " erasure coding " , which gives them the interesting property that any sufficiently - large subset will be enough to reconstruct the original file ( typically 3 - out - of - 10 ) .
Each piece is uploaded to a different server , distributed to spread the load uniformly and avoid correlated failures .
When it is time to download the file , the client asks around to see which servers are still available , pulls the necessary pieces from them , then decodes and decrypts the results .
Users interact with a client that works on their behalf : usually a program running on their local computer , but sometimes running on some other computer .
The client runs a local webserver , so the user can point a browser at " http://localhost:8123 / " , or they can use other front - ends that use the same webserver .
The client talks to a collection of storage servers , managed by an Introducer .
The clients , servers , introducer , and other components are collectively referred to as a " Tahoe grid " .
What Technologies Does It Use ?
Tahoe itself is pure - python , but several of the libraries that it depends upon use C extensions ( sometimes for speed , sometimes to interface to pre-existing C libraries ) .
Twisted [ TWISTED ] is used for event - loop and control - flow management , application support , daemonization , web services , and other purposes .
Tahoe uses Foolscap [ FOOLSCAP ] for inter - node communications ( which itself uses PyOpenSSL ) , Nevow [ NEVOW ] for HTML templating on the web interface , pycryptopp [ PYCRYPTOPP ] for data encryption ( which uses the Crypto + + library [ CRYPTO ++ ] ) , and other support libraries .
Erasure coding is done using the zfec library [ ZFEC ] , which is a python wrapper around the Rizzo FEC library [ RIZZO ] .
The easiest way to visualize how FEC works is to consider a an overspecified polynomial : any two points will define a line , any three points will define a quadratic , etc .
By providing more points than are necessary , you can afford to drop many of them without losing the ability to determine the exact polynomial function .
The encode ( ) function of the zfec library accepts a chunk of input data , a count of required shares ' k ' , and a count of total shares ' N ' .
It then produces ' N ' blocks of output data .
The total output data is larger than the input by the " expansion factor " N/k .
The zfec decode ( ) function takes ' k ' blocks of data and produces the original input chunk .
Architecture Overview
Tahoe is composed of three layers .
The lowest layer is effectively a Distributed Hash Table ( DHT ) , like a python dictionary , but spread across multiple machines .
In this DHT , there are a large number of " slots " which are filled with arbitrary data .
Tahoe has both mutable slots and immutable slots .
Immutable slots are write - once : after the slot has been closed , no more data can be written to it .
Mutable slots can be written multiple times .
Capability discipline is used to control access to the slots : if you hold a write - reference ( or " write - cap " ) , then you can modify the slot , if you do n't hold such a reference , then you cannot .
Mutable slots have both write - caps and read - caps ( and the write - cap can be used to produce a read - cap , so really it is a read + write - cap ) .
Immutable slots have only read - caps .
These read - and write - caps can be expressed as short strings , containing encryption keys , integrity hashes , and location information .
In this form , they look a lot like web URIs : a string that provides a reference to some piece of data .
The data for each DHT slot is distributed among some number of storage servers , using encryption and erasure coding to provide confidentiality and reliability .
The middle layer is the Virtual Drive , which organizes these slots into directories .
Each directory is just a table that maps a name to a read - cap or write - cap of some child file or subdirectory .
Each client stores a specific " root directory " to use as a starting point .
To visit e.g. / projects / tahoe/ README.txt , the client will look up " projects " in the root directory , then look up " tahoe " in the results of that first query , then look up " README.txt " in the results of the second query , and finally present the contents of the file to the user .
The table 's child entries can point to any file or directory object , even itself , therefore allowing cycles .
As a result , the virtual drive is shaped like an arbitrary directed graph rather than being a strict tree .
The top - most layer is an application or presentation service ; something that uses the virtual drive for some purpose .
We currently have two such interfaces .
The most mature one is a RESTful HTTP interfaces , in which PUT , GET , and POST are used to add and retrieve files and directories .
This interface provides HTML for the benefit of a human sitting at a web browser , and JSON for the benefit of programs using httplib .
The other interface under development is a FUSE plugin , allowing all programs on a host computer to use the Tahoe virtual filesystem as if it were a local one .
Other applications can then be written on top of this , for example a backup program .
The Tahoe drive semantics are slightly different than a traditional filesystem , so there is still much work to be done to allow these application programs to make efficient use of Tahoe .
For example , a backup program that does a simple ' cp ' will spend a lot of time and bandwidth on files which have n't changed since the last backup .
Programs like ' rsync ' use special protocols to reduce this bandwidth .
Similar schemes could be constructed for Tahoe to efficiently determine if a file were already present in the grid and thus avoid uploading it again , or to make small modifications to an existing file .
File Types
Tahoe 's DHT layer uses two distinct types of slots : Mutable and Immutable .
Mutable slots can be changed indefinitely , whereas immutable slots are write - once .
We currently use immutable slots for all data files , and mutable slots to contain directories .
Capabilities
Each slot is referenced by a handful of " capabilities " : secure identifiers that provide location , confidentiality , and integrity .
Each capability grants a specific set of abilities , such as the ability to read a file , or the ability to modify a directory .
The access model is simple : if you hold a capability , you can perform the corresponding actions .
If not , you cannot .
No access control lists or passwords are used in Tahoe .
These capabilities contain cryptographic values : large unguessable numbers and SHA - 256 hashes .
They are expressed as ( relatively ) short ASCII strings , which allows them to be passed easily through email , IM , and other channels .
To share read - access to a file , you just ask your Tahoe client for that file 's read - cap , then mail it to your friend .
The friend pastes the read - cap into their own Tahoe client , and the client retrieves the contents of that file for them .
Some capabilities can be used to derive others for the same file , typically by hashing the secret numbers .
For example , if you can write to a mutable slot , then you can also read from it .
If you can read an immutable file , you can produce a " verify - cap " which gives someone else enough information to check on the availability of the file ( and verify the integrity of the ciphertext ) , but not enough to read the plaintext .
This property makes it easy to delegate limited access to other parties : you can create a new directory , grant read access to a coworker , but retain write access for yourself .
Introducer / Grid Setup
The current release uses a central " Introducer " , which is responsible for making sure that all clients know about all storage servers .
Clients and servers are both special instances of a generic " node " , which is just a single program running on a single machine , with a distinct identity .
Each node provides certain services to the other nodes , storage being the most common one .
All nodes speak to each other using Foolscap [ FOOLSCAP ] , which provides secure object reference semantics over SSL connections .
Each client maintains a connection to all storage servers : if each client is also a server ( such as the " friendnet " scenario ) , this results in a fully - connected mesh topology .
Future releases are expected to make the introduction process less centralized , and to reduce the number of long - lived connections that must be maintained .
Each storage server is assigned a " node id " or " peer id " , based upon the fingerprint of the SSL certificate that Foolscap uses for all connections .
This provides a secure identifier of the node : to claim a given node id would require knowledge of the corresponding private key .
The nodeid is also effectively random , making it attractive to use for load distribution ( a sufficiently large number of storage servers will have uniformly distributed nodeids ) .
Storage Index / Peer Selection
Each mutable and immutable slot is associated with a 128 - bit number called the " Storage Index " .
This value is used to determine the location of the encoded shares : both the set of servers that will be used to hold the shares , and to distinguish these shares from all other shares stored on those servers .
The Storage Index ( or " SI " ) is unique but not secret .
In general , knowing the storage index is sufficient to obtain the ciphertext of any given mutable or immutable slot .
Tahoe effectively has a DHT which maps storage index to ciphertext , and another DHT on top of that which maps read - cap to plaintext .
( Note that integrity of the ciphertext must be provided by a distinct value : knowing just the SI is not sufficient to validate the ciphertext ) .
The Storage Index is contained in or derivable from all other capabilites .
For immutable slots , it is the hash of the AES read - key , so holders of the read - key can derive the SI from it .
The immutable slot verify - cap contains a verbatim copy of the SI .
The same is true for mutable slots .
The Storage Index , being the output of a hash , is effectively random .
This property means it can be used to achieve load distribution .
Tahoe uses a techique called " hash - based permutation " to convert the SI into a set of servers .
For each upload or download , the client creates a list that consists of each server identifier concatenated with the SI , then hashes each item in the list , then sorts the list according to the output of the hash .
This creates a consistent - yet - effectively - random ordering of the server list for each file .
We then contact the servers at the beginning of the permuted list to place or retrieve shares .
For an upload with 3 - out - of - 10 encoding , we use the first 10 servers that will accept the share .
When downloading , we start with the first servers and continue forwards until we have enough shares or we decide we 've tried enough and declare failure .
This " peer selection " algorithm ( known internally as " Tahoe2 " to distinguish it from other possible ones ) has the following properties :
no hot spots due to server identifier
tolerate churn
minimize search time
" Hot Spots " occur when a given server gets more than a reasonable share of the total traffic .
This might occur because a single file ( which happens to use that server ) is very popular , or very large .
It might also occur if the peer selection algorithm tends to put more shares on that server than the others .
The Tahoe2 algorithm gives each file a new permutation , so servers should ( when averaged over time ) get an equal number of share requests , regardless of what their server identifiers are .
Hot spots may still occur due to popularity or size .
" Churn " refers to variations in the set of servers over time .
In a casual grid , participants may join or drop out at any time .
Even in large professionally managed grids , hard drives fail and machines get replaced .
As a result , when it comes time to download a file that was uploaded several months or years earlier , not all of the original servers will still be there , and new ones will have been added .
These will appear as randomly - located insertions and deletions in the permuted peer list .
If the original upload used 10 peers out of a grid that contains 100 , and there have been 20 insertions and 20 deletions since then , the download will see ( on average ) 2 insertions and 2 deletions in the 10 % portion that they care about .
The consistent permutation means that the servers found during upload are highly likely to appear early in the list used for download .
This means that downloading clients have a good chance of finding their shares with just a few queries .
If there has been a lot of churn , they may have to search further afield to find them .
The peer selection algorithm is designed to minimize this search depth .
The churn rate ( servers added / removed per unit time ) directly affects the reliability of the grid .
For a
Tahoe grid to remain reliable in the long term , files must be repaired fast enough to tolerate the churn .
See below for details about approaches to file repair .
Immutable Files
Immutable slots in Tahoe are referenced using a cryptographic identifier known as the " read- cap " .
This read - cap contains ( among other things ) a hash of the contents of the file .
This provides " integrity " : the promise that the file you 've downloaded matches the file that was originally uploaded , such that no attacker could modify the bytes without your knowledge .
The read - cap also contains an AES encryption key , which is not shared with anyone else during the upload or download process .
The encryption key provides " confidentiality " : the promise that nobody else ( i.e. people who do n't know the read - cap ) can see the plaintext of the file .
The file is encrypted on the client machine with this key before being erasure - coded .
In the current release , a Tahoe immutable - slot read - cap looks like this :
URI : CHK:6hwdguhr5dvgte3qhosev7zszq:lgi66a5s6gchcu4yyaji3blogdxmrrrgcdxj5q33bz7h2dhlp6oq:3:10:8448
The first base32 - encoded string ( 6hw .. ) is the encryption key , while the second ( lgi .. ) is the SHA - 256 hash of the " UEB " ( described below ) , which includes the hash of the file contents .
There are two ways to generate the encryption key .
The simplest is to pick a random string .
The slightly more complicated approach is to hash the file and use the result as the key , which is then known as a " Content Hash Key " , or " CHK " ( a technique originating with the Freenet project [ FREENET - CHK ] ) .
A nice property of CHK is " convergence " , meaning that a given file will be encoded to the same read - cap everywhere .
This improves the overall behavior of a backup client , because it can avoid duplicate uploads of large common files ( such as firefox.exe ) .
On the other hand , it requires more hashing before upload can begin ( which may prevent streaming upload ) .
The encryption key is hashed to get the Storage Index , which governs where the encoded shares are placed ( see above ) .
The file is encrypted using this key , then erasure - coded into shares .
Erasure - coding is performed one segment at a time ( the default segment size is 1MB ) for two purposes .
The first is to keep the memory footprint down , since the client only need to hold one segment in RAM at a time .
The second is to improve a property called " download alacrity " : the amount of time it takes to get the first byte of validated plaintext .
A low alacrity allows , for example , a streaming music player to begin playing the song quickly , rather than requiring that the whole file be downloaded first .
The shares that are placed on the storage servers are an aggregate data structure , containing the following :
" blocks " , which are the erasure - coded ciphertext segments .
These make up the majority of the share data .
" block hash tree " : a Merkle tree covering the blocks , different for each share .
The root of this tree is called the " block hash root "
one chain of the " share hash tree " , which is a Merkle tree computed over the block hash root from each share .
Each share holds just those hashes necessary to validate its block hash root .
The root of the share hash tree is called the " share hash root " .
the " URI Extension Block " , which contains a number of items that are nominally part of the read - cap but which were moved into the shares to allow read - caps to be shorter : the share hash root .
Each file has a single share hash root a Merkle tree over the ciphertext segments a flat hash of the complete ciphertext a Merkle tree over the plaintext segments a flat hash of the complete plaintext encoding parameters : total - shares , required - shares , segment - size total file size , number of segments
The Merkle tree of blocks makes it possible to isolate share corruption to a single server ( the other hashes allow the client to detect corruption , but recovery is much easier if we know exactly which server has the bad share ) .
The ciphertext hashes make it possible for a verifier or repairer to validate both the shares and the erasure - coding process .
The plaintext hashes add the ability for read - cap holders to validate the decryption process .
The hash of the URI Extension Block is included in the read - cap and verify - cap , providing an integrity check on everything , including the original file contents .
The capabilities associated with an immutable slot are :
read - cap : grants the ability to read the plaintext
verify - cap : read and verify the ciphertext but not the plaintext
The read - cap can be used to derive the verify - cap , but not the other way around .
Mutable Files
Mutable slots in Tahoe are referenced with an identifier known as the " write - cap " which , in the current release , looks like this :
URI :SSK:rymosvvxauojktsga6ukfbffsu:d4b2rqamue744nejtu4h7akxicllb7ta7iybckfywx7ba3lcqj7a
Each slot has an RSA public / private keypair .
Knowing the private key allows write access , while the public key is public knowledge and allows all parties to verify the integrity of the encoded ciphertext .
Read access is protected by an AES " read - key " .
Because RSA keys are big , we hash the RSA private key to form an AES " write - key " , and use it to store an encrypted copy of the RSA private key inside the share .
The read - key is then the hash of the write - key , and the Storage Index is the hash of the read - key .
Each share contains a copy of the RSA public key , and the hash of the public key ( usually known as the " fingerprint " ) can be used to make sure we 're using the correct public key .
The write - cap is then the write - key and the public key fingerprint .
The read - cap is the read - key and the public key fingerprint .
The verify - cap is the storage index and the public key fingerprint .
Thus each cap can be used to derive the next .
Mutable slots are inspired by the " Signed Subspace Key " design in Freenet [ FREENET - SSK ] , which has similar properties .
The current contents of the mutable slot are signed using the RSA private key , and the signature goes into the share .
When a client wants to download the file , it computes the storage index , retrieves the public key , checks its fingerprint , then downloads the data and checks its signature .
When uploading a new version of the file , the client uses the storage index to retrieve a copy of the encrypted private key , uses the write - key to decrypt it , uploads a new copy of the data , signs that data using the private key , then uploads the new signature .
The actual details are more complex , to deal with the possibility of simultaneous colliding writes .
Each time the mutable file is modified , it gets a new " version identifier " , which consists of a sequence number and a hash of the file 's contents .
The signature covers this identifier as well as several encoding parameters which can affect the way shares are produced .
There is an algorithm to control how the uploader decides what sequence number to use , and how downloads should react when they see a variety of sequence numbers , carefully designed to optimize reliability and minimize confusion .
The current version of Tahoe 's mutable slots ( known as " SMDF : Small Mutable Distributed Files " ) imposes a size limit of one segment ( usually 1MB ) , and only allows updates that replace the whole file at once .
We have initial designs for more advanced forms : " medium " - sized MDMF to allow larger files and updates of individual segments in - place , and " large " LDMF to allow insert / delete and preserve multiple versions of the data .
The capabilities associated with a mutable slot are ( in descending order of power : each cap can be used to derive the one below it ) :
write - cap : grants the ability to modify the plaintext
read - cap : read the plaintext but not modify it
verify - cap : read and verify the ciphertext but not the plaintext
Dirnodes
Directories are simply tables that map a child name to a read - cap or write - cap for that child .
For example , a directory that contained a file called " foo.txt " and a subdirectory called " documents / " could be represented as :

This table is serialized into a single string and stored in a mutable slot .
Note that if we only had immutable slots , each change to a directory would create a new file for that directory , causing any parent directories to change , etc , rippling all the way up to the root directory .
There are benefits to this approach ( journalling filesystems use it to provide atomic updates ) , but for performance and complexity reasons ( mainly garbage collection ) ,
Tahoe does not currently work this way .
We put each file or directory into a " node " of the directory graph , so this graph consists of " filenodes " and " dirnodes " .
Each filenode is a leaf .
The root directory is simply a pointer to some dirnode inside this graph , and the full " contents " of the vdrive are just the set of nodes which are reachable from that starting point .
One Tahoe operation used for maintenance and repair is to build the " manifest " , which is a set of verify - caps for all files and directories that a given user cares about ; this is built by doing a traversal of the graph from that starting point and accumulating the verify - cap for each node .
Because files are only readable by holders of their read - caps , the directory is only traversable by those who hold the read - cap .
Entries may only be added , removed , or modified by holders of the write - cap .
The directory structure is slightly more complicated than described above .
The first complication is that we add " metadata " to each table entry .
This is known as " edge " metadata , because it exists on the directory graph 's edges rather than on its nodes .
This metadata is associated with a name , rather than with a file : two difference references to the same file will have different edge - metadata .
We currently use this to store creation / modification timestamps ( ctime+ mtime ) , but a future release will provide an interface to attach arbitrary key - value pairs to each edge .
We may also add node - metadata in the future , perhaps for things like Content - Type .
The second complication is that we store two separate capabilities in each table entry , the child 's read - cap , and its write - cap .
The read - cap is stored normally , so everyone who can read the directory will be able to get read access to its children .
The child 's write - cap is encrypted with the dirnode 's write - key before being stored in the table .
This provides a useful property of " transitive readonlyness " : if you 've been given read - only access to a directory , you get read - only access to its children instead of read - write access .
( you might have read - write access to some child directory via some other path , but not through the one that passes through this dirnode ) .
To avoid crypto problems with key - reuse , the actual AES key for each write - cap is formed by hashing a randomly - generated salt with the dirnode 's write - key .
This salt is stored next to the entry 's ciphertext .
The current dirnode structure uses SDMF files as their backing store , therefore they are limited to directories that can fit in a single 1MB segment ( which results in a limit of about 3000 entries per directory ) , and must be retrieved and updated all at once .
When MDMF files are implemented , it will become possible to fetch a single dirnode entry without needing to download the whole thing : at that point it may become useful to build an index at the start of the file , so that the useful span of data can be determined .
However , this must be balanced against the latency of performing multiple retrievals : only extremely large directories would benefit .
Security Model
Tahoe seeks to be a secure filesystem : to make certain promises about the security of the data stored in it .
The most important property it tries to provide is " data integrity " : the promise that attackers cannot modify your stored data without detection .
It also offers " confidentiality " : the promise that attackers cannot read your files unless you give them permission .
Unlike some related projects ,
Tahoe does not attempt to offer " privacy " or anonymity : the promise that attackers can find out which files you are storing or retrieving .
These security goals are achieved by encrypting and hashing all data before it leaves the user 's client .
No other machines are assumed or required to behave correctly .
Shares are public knowledge : storage servers are expected to store and return data , but are not required to keep it secret .
A malicious or buggy storage server ( one which returns corrupted data ) cannot cause undetected changes to a file .
When diagnostic logs need to record information about a file upload or download , they log the storage index rather than anything that can be turned into an encryption key .
Web server logs are censored to remove file capabilities inside URLs .
The web server can be used to access private data , but only when supplied with a read - cap : no secrets are disclosed on pages with guessable URLs .
In fact , the Tahoe node does not remember read - or write - caps once the upload or download operation has finished : all authority that it uses must be given to it by the user .
Integrity
Cryptographic hashes ( SHA - 256 ) are used throughout Tahoe to provide data integrity : the promise that attackers cannot modify stored data without detection .
If a share is corrupted , the Tahoe download algorithm will ignore it and use other shares .
If all shares are corrupted , the download process will raise an exception .
If any data - corrupting bug has occurred during the upload or download process , the hash checks will probably detect the error and raise an exception rather than return corrupt data to the user .
For mutable files , the integrity promise is that the data retrieved was uploaded by some authorized writer ( one who possesses the file 's write - cap ) .
Obviously the promise is stronger for immutable files : the data will match exact data that was uploaded by the creator of the read - cap .
So , while it is reasonable to read the contents of an immutable read - cap today and expect them to be the same next week , this is not the case for mutable files : someone ( perhaps unknown to you ) who retains the write - cap may modify the file by the time you read it a second time .
In addition , if an attacker controls enough storage servers , they can accomplish a " rollback attack " , in which your mutable file is returned to the state that it was in last week or last month .
The best defense against this is to query more servers than are strictly necessary : this requires the attacker to control all the servers instead of merely a subset .
Though Tahoe files are retrievable by pathname through the virtual drive , applications which care about integrity should identify files by their read - caps .
Anyone with a write - cap on any of the intermediate directories can change the mapping from pathname to file contents , whereas changing the mapping from read - cap to immutable file contents would require breaking SHA - 256 .
Confidentiality
The second security promise that Tahoe attempts to provide is confidentiality : keeping your plaintext secret .
All file contents are encrypted ( using AES in counter mode ) before leaving the client , and the key is not shared with unauthorized parties .
As long as you do not reveal the read - cap for a file , nobody else will be able to read it .
Privacy
In general , Tahoe does not make any attempt to provide anonymity or privacy .
This means that a sufficiently powerful observer ( one who runs several storage servers ) can determine which user uploaded or downloaded any given file .
Although directories are encrypted in the same way as files , timing analysis can be used to deduce which files are in which directories , even if the attacker cannot read the contents of those files .
Note that Foolscap provides strong encryption of all inter - node links , so the attacker must actually control the storage server to mount this attack .
Merely observing the encrypted traffic entering and leaving the storage server is insufficient .
If convergence is in use , then the fact that storage index values are public knowledge means that observers can deduce which common files you are working with .
Specifically , if my copy of firefox .
exe and yours both upload to the same read - cap ( and therefore use the same storage index ) , any storage server that I run will see your lease requests for that storage index , and I will be able to deduce that you are uploading or downloading firefox .
exe .
If you were using random keys ( thus disabling convergence ) , I would see an unrelated storage index .
Of course , I would still see the filesize , and that may be sufficiently unique that I could make the same deduction .
Leases / GC / Deletion
Each share that is put on a storage server is covered by one or more " leases " , one for each client that wants the share to stick around .
Each lease is a promise by the storage server to hold the share faithfully on disk and to provide it to anyone who asks .
The lease may be valid indefinitely , or for a limited period of time ( we expect one month to be a common default ) .
Any lease can be cancelled by the client which requested it , and when the last lease is cancelled or expires , the share can be deleted to reclaim storage space .
When clients no longer care about a file , they are expected to cancel the leases on all of its shares .
This should occur shortly after that file is deleted from their virtual drive .
Because the vdrive graph could contain multiple references to any given file , the actual process involves constructing a manifest of all files on a periodic basis , and looking for changes to that manifest .
If a client deletes a whole directory , the next manifest will be missing many files ( as well as the directory itself ) , and the client will need to cancel many leases .
If the grid uses expiring leases , then those leases that are still needed must be renewed on a periodic basis .
In this mode , the client performs lease renewal on its current manifest perhaps once a week .
Expiring leases insure that space is eventually reclaimed , even if a client fails to explicitly cancel a lease .
File Checking / Repair / Verify
Once a file has been uploaded to a Tahoe grid , it is expected to stay there until the last client cancels its lease .
However , hard drives are fallible , with current drives advertising an average lifetime ( MTBF : Mean Time Between Failure ) of about 40,000 hours , or approximately 4.5 years .
In addition , machines come and go over time : storage servers may be rebooted or taken offline for maintenance , friendnet machines may leave the grid and never come back .
We can draw a distinction between availability problems ( caused by machines that are temporarily offline but which are likely to return ) and reliability problems ( caused by permanent failures : disk failures , servers which leave and never come back ) .
It may not be possible for the client to tell the difference , but we can model the probabilities of each one separately and add up the results .
We define the " health " of a file as the number of outstanding shares that can be found on distinct servers .
This value will be at a maximum just after it is uploaded , but will slowly drop towards zero over time , as shares disappear from the grid .
This is a probabilistic drop ( i.e. the health is a random variable ) , with an expected value that decays exponentially over time .
When the number of available shares drops below the number of required shares , the file will be irretrievable .
With professionally - managed storage servers , a 4 year drive MTBF , and 3 - of - 10 encoding , we can expect a failure rate ( for any given file ) of about .2 shares per month , leading ( on average ) to file loss after 8/.2 = 40 months .
The goal of " repair " is to make sure this does not happen , or more specifically to reduce the chance of file loss to some acceptably small value .
We cannot completely rule out the possibility of file loss ( since there is always a slight chance of all the storage servers failing simultaneously ) , but we can reduce it to arbitrarily low values as long as we 're willing to pay the storage and bandwidth costs .
Note that another way to quantify the reliability of file retrieval is to calculate the MTBF of any given file , and to make sure that it is so high ( thousands of years ) that the chances of losing even one file out of millions is acceptably low .
To repair the file , some client merely needs to download the ciphertext and re-upload it : the client does not need to be able to read the plaintext .
This means that the repair function can be delegated to someone who does n't get read access , if the original uploader is n't able to do it themselves .
For example , the original user uploads some files , then goes on vacation for five years and leaves their computer turned off that whole time .
This user would need to find another client willing to repair its files until they get back : they could pass their manifest of repair - caps ( basically the same as verify - caps ) to the repairer to check on during their absence .
In a commercial Tahoe grid , the repairer might be run by the service provider on behalf of all their customers .
To avoid losing data in the long run , the overall repair rate must equal the share loss rate .
If a petabyte grid has 1000 1TB drives , each with an MTBF of 40000 hours , then we can expect to lose one drive every 40 hours , which represents a rate of 7 megabytes per second .
The repair process must create new shares at this same rate to keep up .
The big question is when to perform this repair .
To minimize bandwidth usage , repair should be done at the last possible moment : just before the last vital share goes away ( i.e. when the health of the file drops to k - 1 ) .
On the other hand , to minimize the probability of file loss , the repair should be done as soon as possible : when we lose the very first share ( i.e. at N - 1 ) .
Clearly , we must choose some compromise point between these extremes .
One approach is to define a " check frequency " and a " repair threshold " .
A monthly check frequency means that once each month , somebody performs a " file check " for each file : the client simply queries the appropriate servers and counts the number of existing shares .
If that count is below the repair threshold , the client initiates a repair operation for that file ( or notifies a separate repair agent ) .
The cost of this approach depends upon the number of files , the check frequency , and the repair threshold .
We expect it should be appropriate for small grids , but the load may be unacceptably high for larger commercial grids .
A different approach is to pay attention to the storage servers instead of the files .
If we are informed when a storage server fails , and if we can get a list of storage index values for all the shares that used to be on that server , then we can trigger repair of just the files that need it .
We are investigating ways to reliably maintain a table of which shares are on which servers ( a large but not insurmountable database problem ) .
If the table is constructed to allow efficient counting of how many shares are available for each file , repair can be delayed beyond the first share loss ( using a repair threshold ) , reducing the repair costs .
With this approach , there is no filechecking .
The table would not necessarily have to be centralized : each server could have a set of " buddy servers " to which they report their share lists .
Once the buddy determines that the server has failed , the buddy could be responsible for informing a repair process of the list of files that now need repair .
Another question is where to perform the repair .
Note that each repair operation requires one full download plus an upload of each missing share ( each of which requires 1/ N of the normal upload bandwidth ) .
For a commercial grid , in which the storage servers live in a colocation facility , repair will be cheapest when performed by a machine in the same colo ( and therefore have fast cheap bandwidth to the servers ) .
High - availability grids that are split between multiple colos will want to keep repair confined to a single colo .
This suggests that each site should have k+1 shares , allowing single - failure - triggered repair to remain in - colo , and only requiring expensive inter -colo bandwidth to be used when multiple servers in a single colo fail at the same time .
A stronger form of checking is called " File Verification " , which downloads the ciphertext and validates the hashes .
This will detect disk errors that somehow slip past the hard drive 's built - in integrity checking , or buggy / malicious storage servers which have corrupted the shares .
The most intensive form of verification would download every share and validate every byte .
Tahoe does not currently perform this kind of check , but provisions will be made to allow the user to initiate such a check whenever they like .
This check would be most useful in an environment where storage servers are not trusted to honor the leases they have agreed to .
For more details about this sort of environment , see the section on " P2P " below .
Storage Authority / Quotas
Each storage server offers a limited amount of disk space to the world .
Leases are accepted until this ( configurable ) limit is reached , then leases are rejected until some shares are deleted to free up space .
This protects the storage server from disk exhaustion , and allows its admin to decide how much space they want to dedicate to the Tahoe grid .
On the other hand , limiting per-user storage consumption is a larger topic , and one that is still very much under research .
The current release makes no attempt to enforce quotas : there is no way for an admin to declare that they want to allow Alice to use 5 GB but no more , and that Bob should get 10GB .
The current plan is to have each user create a DSA public / private keypair , and then have an " Account Server " which produces " membership cards " , basically a signed certificate that states something like " DSA key # 123 ( owned by ' Alice ' , account # 4 ) is a member in good standing until date 4/1/2008 " .
The storage servers will then be configured with the Account Server 's public key .
The first time a client contacts a server , it presents its current membership card along with a signed request for service , and the server checks the contents and the signatures .
If valid , the server gives the client a shared secret that can be used for later storage requests : the leases created in these requests will be marked with the user 's account number .
Then , by enumerating the leases marked with account # 4 , the storage server can determine that Alice is currently using 4.9GB , and a request for a 2GB lease should be turned down .
For a centrally - managed grid , the storage servers can report this lease - ownership data to a central accounting facility on a periodic basis , enabling the creation of a report that shows the full - grid usage per customer .
The accounting facility can then bill customers appropriately .
Our current expectation is to have the client software track its own total usage and refrain from going over the quota , using random server - side audits to enforce the quota policy .
Note that the repair process needs to be aware of these per-account leases too .
When a server is lost and replacement shares are created on new servers , those shares eventually need to acquire replacement leases too .
This may require giving the repair agent the authority to create leases on behalf of other users .
Another approach is to have the repair agent create leases under its own authority , then eventually transfer those leases back to the original client ( when it comes back online ) .
In the meantime , the repair agent can remember which leases it is holding on behalf of which client , so that the associated storage can be accounted properly .
Upload Helper
Tahoe achieves high reliability by expanding the data into shares which , in combination , are larger than the original file by an expansion factor N/k .
This means that uploads will push more data than downloads , typically 3 x more ( for the default 3 - of - 10 encoding ) .
It is unfortunate that most home internet connections ( ADSL or cable modem ) are highly asymmetrical , offering upload speeds that are 8x - 10 x slower than their download speeds .
For Tahoe , these two slowdowns are in the same direction , meaning that an unassisted Tahoe upload might be 30 x slower than a download of the same file .
One way to mitigate this effect is to use an " Upload Helper " .
This is a service , run on a node in some convenient location , which performs encoding on behalf of its clients .
Files are still encrypted on the original computer ( so the helper does not get to see plaintext ) , but the resulting ciphertext is sent to the Helper , which then encodes it into shares and sends the shares to the storage servers .
This will allow the client to perform a 1 x upload ( sending the same amount of data as the original file ) , as opposed to the 3 x upload that would result if the client had to send all N shares .
If the bandwidth from the helper to the servers is high enough , the transfer of shares to the servers will complete in less time than the ciphertext transfer , and the overall process will be faster than an unassisted upload .
For a commercial grid , the helper can be located in the same colo as the storage servers , giving them extremely high bandwidth , typically several megabytes per second .
In addition , the helper is in a good position to perform a pre-check to see if a given file is already present in the grid before the client spends the upload bandwidth .
Clients must perform local hashing to compute the encryption key and the storage index , but then they ask the helper if the storage index is already present , and skip the upload if so .
This " de - duplication " feature can allow clients to avoid redundant uploads of common files that have previously been uploaded by some other user .
Convergence is necessary to take advantage of this feature , otherwise two separate uploads of the same file will not be comparable .
Finally , the helper can accumulate the ciphertext on disk before beginning the upload .
This is a great help for the unfortunate client that gets interrupted halfway through an upload : when it tries the upload a second time , it will learn that half the ciphertext is already present on the helper , and it only has to transfer the remaining data , thus salvaging the previous upload progress .
Convergence ( or some other way to make one upload of a given file achieve the same storage index as a later one ) is required to take advantage of this feature .
P2P
Tahoe has been specifically designed to work well in both friend - net and commercial - grid use - cases .
The friend - net case ( in which a group of friends all run storage servers for each other , and each also runs a client to push their own files into this grid ) is a " peer to peer " scenario , in which no node is more special than any others .
In contrast , a commercial grid will typically have storage servers in colo that do not run clients , while customer machines will run clients but not provide storage service .
The main advantage of using P2P technology is to increase reliability and lower costs .
Each point of centralization is also a point of failure .
No Tahoe storage server is special : any k shares will do , and any component of a tahoe grid can fail without causing data loss .
Storage servers are expected to fail at a certain rate , repair processes are not time - critical , and we are working to replace the centralized introducer with a distributed form .
Distributed services are also easier to scale up to higher traffic levels than centralized ones .
Through erasure coding , it is possible to obtain extremely high reliability with modest expansion factors .
Most home computers have a lot of unused hard drive space , so it is usually a good bargain to trade some of that space for the service of getting reliable storage on the rest of a friend - net grid .
In addition , the download code will retrieve multiple shares in parallel ( ' k ' at a time ) , so it may be possible to get better utilization of the available download bandwidth than a simple single - copy remote transfer would achieve .
On a home ADSL line , the download speed is typically 8 x faster than the upload speed .
If the members of a friendnet all have identical DSL lines , and 'k ' is at least 8 , then the download code will pull from enough servers to saturate the download link .
This property is sometimes known as a " swarming download " , but note that , unlike BitTorrent , Tahoe does not use downloading clients to push data towards other downloading clients .
On the other hand , the expansion factor ( N/k ) is causing a slowdown in the already - slow upload direction : with 3 - of - 10 , a Tahoe upload may be 30 x slower than a download .
If speed is a higher priority than reliability , 9 - of - 10 will allow uploads to be almost as fast as a simple remote copy , and still exploit download parallelism .
Another possibility is to set up a Helper ( see above ) on some machine with good upstream bandwidth ( perhaps in a colo facility ) , which would remove the expansion - factor penalty .
Tahoe ( and allmydata.com ) is a distant relative of the Mojo Nation project [ MOJO ] , which used economic incentives to encourage participants to provide storage space to each other .
Systems like that are designed to tolerate cheating , in which a node might pretend to hold a share , but would in fact throw it away .
In Mojo Nation ( and Mnet which followed it ) , credits were exchanged at both upload and download time , so if a server could n't actually cough up the share on demand , clients would stop using it , resulting in a loss of revenue , and thus creating an incentive for the server to act honestly and honor their promises .
Tahoe has no such features at this time .
Clients assume that shares which have been accepted by a storage server will be retained and retrieveable until the lease is cancelled or expires , or until the server fails .
Therefore cheating is equivalent to server failure .
More importantly , Tahoe clients choose servers purely on the basis of their nodeids ( and the Tahoe2 peer - selection algorithm ) , and do not compute or use any notion of " reliability " , so even if the client could detect that a given server had a poor track record of returning stored data , it would have no way to avoid using that server again in the future .
Front Ends
Web Server
Each
Tahoe node can run a web server through which both humans and programs can manipulate the virtual drive .
The human - oriented interface ( known as the Web User Interface : " WUI " ) displays each directory on a separate page , with forms to upload , buttons to delete , and hyperlinks to download .
The interface is functional but not particularly pretty , being oriented towards engineers and Tahoe developers more than customers .
This same web server offers a machine - oriented RESTful interface , in which PUT is used for upload , GET is used for download , and DELETE is used for delete .
This well - defined Web API ( " WAPI " ) interface can be used by programs ( using simple httplib calls ) to work with the virtual drive .
In both modes , the HTTP client starts by passing in a directory read - or write - cap .
There are no login passwords or cookies .
However convenient it might be , if the web server were to remember any secrets for you , it would become vulnerable to CSRF attacks .
By requiring that the client provide the access authority in the URL , these attacks are blocked .
It also enables simple and intuitive use of browser bookmarks to retain pointers to various files and directories .
Users can share access to any page by merely copying the current URL from the address bar and mailing it to their friend .
The web server also provides some diagnostic information on the current state of the grid , and timing / progess data on recent uploads and downloads .
CLI
A primitive command - line tool is distributed with Tahoe , named " tahoe " , and provides basic ' ls ' , ' put ' , and ' get ' functionality .
This tool uses a private " root.cap " file on disk as a starting point .
FUSE plugin
There are several FUSE plugins available , for various platforms : a WinFUSE one ( which , despite the name , uses SMB ) , and an OS - X / Linux one .
These make the Tahoe virtual drive visible to regular programs , allowing them to read and write arbitrary files .
This enables a large class of applications to take advantage of Tahoe , but is not without its pitfalls .
There are several impedance mismatches between the filesystem provided by Tahoe and the one that most POSIX - oriented programs expect .
So far , immutable files and edge - based metadata have been the two sticking points .
Several filesystem features that we think of as optional are less so , for example the Macintosh OS - X Finder will refuse to update a directory view unless its mtime has been advanced .
Tahoe stores mtime as edge - metadata in the parent dirnode , rather than as node - metadata on the child dirnode , making it difficult to update the mtime consistently and correctly .
Many applications do not tolerate the close ( ) call taking a significant amount of time : some Windows applications appear to use 30 - 60 second timeouts and declare a failure if close ( ) does not return within this time .
Of these applications , the ones that work with ( relatively slow ) network filesystems at all seem to expect the delays to occur inside the write ( ) calls rather than in close ( ) .
Since
Tahoe stores most data as immutable files ( and convergence is the default ) , it is difficult to push the correct data over a slow link before having all the data available .
Several tradeoffs must be made .
Finding a clean " impedance match " between Tahoe 's concept of a filesystem and that of POSIX is a continuing effort .
Reliability Modeling
Tahoe 's primary goal is to provide safe , reliable storage of data .
This comes at a cost : redundant shares and periodic repair .
There is a tradeoff between cost and reliability : more redundancy means more hard drives and more servers , but will reduce the chances of file loss .
If we could model the relationship between these two quantities , we could make an educated decision between the costs and the benefits .
Full analysis of the Tahoe reliability model is well beyond the scope of this paper , but we can attempt to provide an initial sketch here .
There are two metrics to pay attention to : availability and reliability .
Availability is the chance that a given file can be downloaded right now .
Reliability is the chance that a given file can be downloaded at some point in the future .
When a server is offline for a few minutes while it reboots , that affects availability .
When a hard drive has a head crash and all the shares on it are lost forever , that affects reliability .
In truth , these are both special cases of the same function .
The general form is expressed as follows .
At time t=0 , we finish uploading a given file .
At some time in the future t=T , we decide that we want to download it .
We are willing to wait until t=T+ A to get the file .
What is the probability that we will be able to get the file ?
This probability is a function of both T and A ( as well as the encoding parameters and the availability / failure behavior of all servers ) .
Let us call it Pfile ( T , A ) .
Now the " availability " is what we call this function when A is small : Pfile ( T,0 ) .
The " reliability " is what we call it when A is large : Pfile ( T , infinity ) .
We model servers as being available Pa of the time .
For example , a cheap linux box in a colo facility with reliable power can easily achieve 99.9 % uptime , which allows 9 hours per year for upgrades and hardware replacements .
99.7 % uptime is achievable without requiring operations personnel to wear a pager .
We model hard drives as having some well - characterized failure behavior , for example a Poisson process with rate = 1/40000 hours .
We make the assumption that hard drives are 100 % available until they fail forever , and that all servers are replaceable ( by moving the drives to a different chassis if necessary ) , so server failure can be expressed as downtime .
Note that to achieve the metrics predicted by these models , operations must be careful to avoid correlated failures .
For example , the rack full of 99.9 % - available servers must not all be rebooted at the same time .
Likewise , hard drives are frequently killed by power surges and thermal damage , which can affect neighboring drives simultaneously .
For large grids , we expect Tahoe storage servers to consist of large numbers of 1U or 2U rack - mounted machines in a colo facility : this means 4 or 8 drives per server .
We assume that this ratio is low enough that we can neglect the chance that multiple shares for the same file will wind up on the same server ( but on different drives ) .
Once the total number of servers is high enough , this is a fairly reasonable assumption .
Availability
Without too much loss of accuracy , we can examine availability and reliability separately .
Availability is easier , and is only influenced by server availability ( and encoding parameters ) .
3 - of - 10 encoding means that there are 10 servers of interest , and that we can retrieve the file if at least 3 of them are available .
This is a textbook case of the well - known " binomial distribution function " , specifically the " upper tail " of that function ( UTBF according to my HP calculator ) , which is a function of k , N , and Pa .
It is defined as the sum of the chance that all 10 servers are available , plus the chance that there are exactly 9 servers available , plus 8 servers , etc , down to the chance that there are 3 servers available .
The corresponding chance of failure is the " lower tail " ( LTBF ) , specifically the chance that there are exactly 0 , 1 , or 2 servers available .
When Pa=50 % this looks like the area under the right - hand side of the normal Bell curve ( with a dividing line drawn at 0.3 instead of 0.5 ) .
But when Pa is close to 100 % , this curve is drastically skewed towards the right , and the probability of success is close to 100 % as well .
To maintain numerical accuracy , we use two techniques .
The first is to pay attention to the probability of failure rather than the probability of success , and the other is to use an approximation in the binomial distribution equation .
To this end we use a metric adapted from the electrical engineering world : the decibel ( dB ) .
The " Bel " is a logarithmic scale , and a " deciBel " is one tenth of a Bel .
So in EE terms , 0 dBW is 1.0 watts , 10 dBW is 10 watts , 20 dBW is 100 watts , and 30 dBW is a kilowatt .
5 dBW is sqrt( 10 ) = 3.3 watts .
3 dBW is about 2 watts .
- 10 dBW is 0.1 watts , - 20 dBW is 10 milliwatts , and - 30 dBW is 1 milliwatt .
Using this concept , we define a metric named " dBA " , which measures decibels of availability .
We also define its opposite , a " dBF " ( which measures failure ) .
100 % failure 0 dBF 0 dBA 0 % success 10 % failure - 10 dBF 10 dBA 90 % success 1 % failure - 20 dBF 20 dBA 99 % success .1 % failure - 30 dBF 30 dBA 99.9 % success ( " three nines " ) .01 % failure - 40 dBF 40 dBA 99.99 % success ( " four nines " ) .001 % failure - 50 dBF 50 dBA 99.999 % success ( " five nines " )
We use this for the same reason EEs use it : it makes it easy to convert multiplication into addition , and exponentiation into multiplication .
This turns out to simplify many of the equations .
In addition , it makes it easier to retain numerical accuracy when dealing with numbers that are very close to 1.0 .
The second techique we use is to observe that the LTBF area ( when P is close to 100 % ) is dominated by the N=k - 1 sample .
That is , for our 3 - of - 10 case , the chance that there are exactly 2 servers available is so much higher than the chance of having exactly 1 server available , that for engineering purposes ( i.e. within an order of magnitude ) we can ignore the N=1 ( and N=0 ) cases .
Through these approximations , we observe that 3 - of - 10 encoding with servers that are available 90 % of the time results in 64 dBA , meaning that the chance that there will be fewer than three servers available is less than one in a million .
With 99 % - available servers , the number climbs to 144 dBA , which is one in 10e14 .
And with 99.9 % - available servers , we get 224 dBA , which is one in 10e22 .
Clearly , redundancy is a valuable technique for achieving extremely high availability .
The approximation to pay attention to is the number of servers we must lose before the file cannot be retrieved : N - k+1 .
There must be this many simultaneous offline servers , and the probability of each being offline is very low ( P=10 % , 1 % , or 0.1 % in our example ) .
Each additional server whose loss we can tolerate reduces our unavailability probability by another factor of P .
In dBA terms , the file - availability " dBAfile " equals ( N - k+1 ) * dBAserver +B , where B is a function of N and k ( specifically " N choose k - 1 " ) .
So the availability of a single server is magnified by the number of servers that we can lose due to encoding .
Note that this analysis considers high - availability servers and large expansion ratios .
If we consider either low - availability servers ( 50 % or less ) , or low expansion ratios ( i.e. 8 - of - 10 , which only expands the data by 25 % ) , the story is very different .
With no expansion ( i.e. 10 - of - 10 ) , the file availability is drastically lower than the individual server availability , because you are depending upon all 10 servers to be available at the same time .
Low - availability servers are difficult to distinguish from failed servers , raising the possibility that the system may spend more bandwidth doing repair than on actual user traffic [ BLAKE ] .
Also note that this analysis only covers server hardware failure .
Once enough redundancy has been used to remove the threat of hardware failure , other problems become visible .
The most likely remaining one is software failure : since all server nodes are likely to be running the same code , a bug in that release will affect all of them .
Client - side problems will also prevent a client from getting access to their files .
The goal of erasure coding and redundancy is to survive the failure mode that we have the least control over ( hardware failure ) , leaving us responsible for the failure modes that we have more control over ( software engineering practices ) .
It is not appropriate to calculate an availability of 224 dBA and then assume that the system really is that robust , but it gives us confidence that when a problem does happen , it wo n't be the result of a disk crash .
Reliability
Reliability ( the chance that a file will be available at some point in the future ) is a far more complicated analysis task .
Simply modelling the failure characteristics of a single hard drive is a difficult and poorly - understood field of study [ GOOGLE - DISK ] .
The best we can do here is to describe the general direction that our analysis is heading .
We start with some sort of failure pattern for hard drives , the ever - popular useful fiction : a poission process .
Hard drives are assumed to fail randomly as some specified rate , once per MTBF .
We assume all drive failures are independent and that each share is on a different drive .
The number of surviving shares for any particular file will decay over time in a roughly exponential shape .
By modelling this shape , we can derive some probability distribution for the number of surviving shares at any given point in time .
We will have some sort of repair process : either triggered by file checking ( run periodically ) , or by the loss of a server .
In both cases we assume that the repair is only triggered when the health drops below some threshold R , so there is some time A at which the health is just at the threshold , some intermediate point when we decide to initiate a repair , and some later time B when the repair process has successfully downloaded a copy of the ciphertext and can now survive the loss of the remaining shares .
If the file loses R - k + 1 shares between time A and time B , then we 've lost the file .
This is the probability we are interested in .
We might assume that the repair load is low enough to allow effectively instantaneous repairs .
In that case , a grid which uses periodic file - checking is mostly affected by the rate of file - checking : checking faster uses more network bandwidth , but checking slower increases the chance of file loss .
Raising the repair threshold increases the rate of repair ( costing bandwidth and CPU ) , but lowering it increases the chance of file loss .
For grids that use a centralized tracking of which shares are present on each server , the periodic filecheck poll is replaced by a server - loss interrupt , reducing the critical interval .
Grids which are willing to implement this kind of centralization may be able to afford lower repair thresholds and achieve the same level of reliability .
Future Work
The Tahoe project is still in its infancy : most of the code is about 6 months old , and changes are occurring rapidly .
There are several features currently in active development , and many others looming on the horizon .
DSA - based mutable files and directories
The current RSA - based mutable files require large primes that take several seconds to generate , limiting the rate at which new directories can be created .
The keys are too large to fit in the URI , so they must be pushed out to the share , requiring multiple round - trips to get them down to the client , which slows down both reads and writes .
We have a design in place ( ticket # 217 ) for DSA - based mutable files using a system - wide shared modulus , which would allow very fast directory creation , and make the private key small enough to fit inside the write - cap .
In addition , the write - caps will be smaller , making the containing dirnodes smaller and faster to manipulate .
We plan to update the write - cap format at the same time to make these strings short enough to fit in a 72 - column email without line - wrapping , and to avoid word - breaking characters that tend to cause cut - and - paste errors .
Chord - based Peer Selection
Once the number of storage servers becomes large , the need for clients to talk to many ( perhaps all ) of them becomes a burden .
There are alternate network topologies that scale better : one well - known approach is known as Chord [ CHORD ] , in which the number of connections grows logarithmically with the number of nodes rather than linearly .
Our general idea is to use the Chord network to send a bundle of lease requests to the target area , then have the target nodes send the individual requests to their immediate neighbors as necessary .
Each accepted lease request causes the server to contact the uploading client directly , and share data is sent over a direct TCP connection between the two .
Network - Aware Share Placement
The Tahoe2 peer - selection algorithm is designed to provide uniform load distribution , but there are other desirable properties we could design for .
Servers may be distributed in user 's homes , in a colo facility , on employee desktops , etc , and some are closer to clients than others .
For download speed , it would be fastest to have a full set of ' k ' shares resident on a server on the same LAN as the likely clients .
The download - time peer - selection algorithm could preferentially choose close or fast servers , using the others only when necessary .
A corporate grid designed this way could put one full set of shares on - site for speed , and use off - site servers just to improve reliability .
For data that is expected to survive for years , repair is inevitable .
Repairing files costs bandwidth , since it needs both a full download and a partial upload .
But not all bandwidth costs the same : local gigabit ethernet within a single rack or machine room is quite common , whereas even 10 megabit symmetric bandwidth to a house or office is prohibitively expensive .
Local repair will be far cheaper than a repair that must push the data a long distance .
To this end , we could place k+1 shares in each colo , allowing single - disk failures to be repaired entirely locally , and using multiple colos to tolerate multiple - disk failures and site - wide disasters ( i.e. a flood that takes out the whole facility ) .
To obtain these properties , we will need to modify the upload - time peer selection algorithm to place shares according to our new goals .
Instead of using a hash - based permutation , we could simply interleave the servers into a useful order ( colo1 - hostA , colo2 - hostB , colo1 - hostC , colo2 - hostD , etc ) , and then use a SI - based starting index .
Achieving load distribution requires additional effort , but is not infeasible .
Conclusion
The Tahoe project , while still under development , provides a useful system for safely backing up important files .
Distributed storage and cryptographic techniques provide protection against prying eyes , data corruption , and machine failure .
Tahoe grids are easy to set up and have been specifically designed to be useful for both small friend - nets and large commercial deployments .

A Mexican judge on Tuesday found Brenda Martin guilty of money laundering , sentencing the Ontario woman to five years in prison without parole and a fine of close to $ 3,500 .
Martin 's friends have said she 'll likely request to serve her prison time in Canada because launching an appeal would mean she would have to remain in a Mexican prison .
Her lawyer , Guillermo Cruz Rico , said the 51 - year - old Trenton woman received medical assistance after she heard the verdict , but did n't give any further details .
He said she was in a fragile mental and physical state .
" She was crying and screaming .
She did n't believe what is going on here , " he said .
Cruz Rico said he had n't yet had a chance to read the judge 's reasons for the ruling .
Martin's friend Deb Tieleman , who was in the courtroom , collapsed in deep sobs as the verdict was read , said CBC reporter Paul Hunter from Guadalajara .
Martin must spend at least another five days in jail because under Mexican law , a convicted prisoner must wait out the five - day appeal period before an appeal or transfer process can begin .
Mother alleges corruption
Martin's 69 - year - old mother , Marjorie Bletcher , said she would pray for her daughter .
" This has to be devastating for her .
This is crazy , " she said tearfully from her home in Trenton .
" She ’s in such a fragile state , this might drive her over the edge . "
She alleged corruption within the Mexican judicial system .
" This is a travesty of justice .
I guess we did n't pay a judge so I guess that 's why the verdict came down , " she said .
Paul Macklin , founder of the Save Brenda Martin Fund , said while he is " extraordinarily disappointed , " he does hope she 'll be able to serve her time in Canada .
" There 's a glimmer of hope we are going to be able to get her home , " he said .
" That has always been our key goal . "
Ottawa will try to arrange speedy transfer : Day
Public Safety Minister Stockwell
Day said the government will work to arrange a prisoner transfer as quickly as possible .
" Sometimes , these prisoner transfers can take weeks , if not months , but I have given instructions very clear that we want everything set up ready to go , " Day told CTV Newsnet from New Orleans .
A former senior official with Foreign Affairs , Gar Pardy , said if Martin is transferred to a Canadian prison , she would soon be eligible for parole because she has already served two years in a Mexican jail .
Canadian prisoners are usually eligible for full parole after serving one - third of their sentence .
" I think the key thing here is to work the system that exists to ensure she is transferred to Canada in as short a time as possible , " said Pardy .
Martin was found guilty of being part of a $ 60 - million internet fraud scheme run by Canadian Alyn Waage , who was convicted of fraud in 2006 .
He is serving a 10 - year term in a U.S. prison .
Martin maintained her innocence , saying she worked for Waage only as a chef .
Waage has testified Martin was unaware of his activities .
The nature of Mexico 's justice system , which does not include oral trials and puts the onus on the accused to prove his or her innocence rather than on the prosecution to prove guilt , meant Martin had to wait out the legal process in prison .
Martin's family and friends say imprisonment has taken its toll on her , leaving her depressed , heavily sedated and on 24 - hour suicide watch in Puente Grande women 's prison near Guadalajara .
( Fortune Magazine ) --
The tangled web of subprimes has claimed more than its share of victims in recent months : homeowners by the hundreds of thousands , to be sure , but also those who created , packaged , insured , distributed , and ultimately bought what should have been labeled " junk mortgages " but which by a masterstroke of marketing genius received a more respectable imprimatur .
" Skim milk masquerades as cream , " warned Gilbert and Sullivan over a century ago , and sure enough , today 's subprimes , packaged into financial conduits with monikers such as SIVs and CDOs , pretended to be AAA - rated cubes of butter .
Financial institutions fell for the ruse , and now we all suffer the consequences .
Defaults are rising , the dollar 's sinking , and -- good Lord ! -- even Google 's ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) stock price is going down .
Something must really be wrong .
It is .
What we are witnessing is essentially the breakdown of our modern - day banking system , a complex of leveraged lending so hard to understand that Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke required a face - to - face refresher course from hedge fund managers in mid-August .
My Pimco colleague Paul McCulley has labeled it the " shadow banking system " because it has lain hidden for years , untouched by regulation , yet free to magically and mystically create and then package subprime loans into a host of three - letter conduits that only Wall Street wizards could explain .
It is certainly true that this shadow system , with its derivatives circling the globe , has democratized credit .
And as the benefits of cheaper financing became available to the many as opposed to the few , placating and calming waves of higher productivity and widespread diversification led to accelerating economic growth , incomes , and corporate profits .
Yet , as is humanity 's wont , we overdid a good thing , and the subprime skim milk has soured .
Still , to equate rancid milk with a breakdown in today 's banking system is a bit much , do n't you think ?
Are n't our central bankers coming to the rescue with lower interest rates , and does n't Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson finally have a plan to steady Citigroup ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) and friends with a " super - SIV " ?
They are , and he does -- but cheap financing and SIV bailouts may not be enough to restore confidence in a shadow system built on fragile foundations .
Financed conduits supported by $ 1 trillion of asset - backed commercial paper were constructed on the basis of AAA ratings that suggested -- no , practically guaranteed -- that the investments could never fail : no skim , just the cr�me de la cr�me .
Now , as the subprimes undermine those structures and the confidence in them , it is a stretch of the imagination to suggest that 75 basis points of interest rate cuts by the Fed will bring back the love .
As the commercial - paper market shrinks by hundreds of billions of dollars a month , central banks worldwide are facing a giant stress test of the shadow banking system .
The publicized and photographed overnight " runs " on Countrywide and Britain 's Northern Rock in mid-August were nothing compared to what 's taking place in the shadows of the real banking system .
How does one protect during a run " deposits " that no one can see ?
To be blunt , what does it mean for your pocketbook ?
To understand where future losses may lie , it makes sense to ask which investments did especially well during the shadow 's formation .
Home prices have been the obvious first hit -- down 5 % nationwide already , with perhaps another 10 % to go over the next several years .
Following in lockstep have been financial stocks with subprime exposure , to be joined in short order by consumer - based equities , as jobs and disposable income falter .
These investments thrived as the shadow worked its voodoo ; now its curse will sap money from the pockets of any and all who believed in its black magic .
Importantly , add to the list of investment victims the strength and viability of our national currency .
The SIVs and CDOs of years past supported the dollar at unrealistic levels as foreign investment in the hundreds of billions poured into our markets .
Now , with confidence waning , the visible but unphotographable run from George Washington into the euro , the yen , and other currencies is under way .
Protecting an American - made pocketbook should begin by seeing that purchasing power is more likely to be enhanced via investments in strong currencies , not weak ones .
More than ever , your portfolio should have a international perspective and include non-dollar - denominated assets .
Investors should anticipate that the shadow 's successor will be a more conservative , less risk - oriented banking system .
The shadow writes , and having writ will move on to new sources of wealth creation in faraway corners of the globe .
Go with it .
NEW DELHI , India ( CNN ) --
Nearly 300 inmates broke out of a jail in central India after overpowering the four guards at the facility , authorities reported early Monday .
The jailbreak happened Sunday in Dantewada , in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh , the district 's inspector - general 's office reported .
Of the 377 inmates in the jail , 299 escaped , and no reinforcements arrived to search for the escapees for two hours , the inspector - general 's office told CNN sister network CNN - IBN .
" The inmates attacked and overwhelmed the prison guards during lunch time , " Chhattisgarh Home Minister Ramvichar Netam told CNN - IBN .
" Apparently they took advantage of weak security . "
Police have closed the state 's borders and were on high alert throughout the region , but the search was complicated by difficult communications in the area , Netam said .

All About India
A Chinese delegation from Beijing arrived in Phoenix last month and headed west to the Sonoran Desert , deep into suburbia .
Its destination : a quintessential American residential development in Buckeye , one of the many suburbs dotting the sprawling metropolitan area .
Members of the group studied the streetscape , the golf course , the spa , the cybercafé , the health care amenities and the design of the single - family homes at Sun City Festival , a 3,000 - acre , planned community for people over 55 .
They commented on the cleanliness and orderliness of it all .
The 25 Chinese who toured the Del Webb development were not seniors planning their retirement but government officials and their spouses , a couple of architects and a banker .
Their mission : study American suburbia with an eye toward replicating it back home .
For good or bad , the USA 's suburbs have become a living laboratory for the world .
Developing countries contending with explosive population growth and economic expansion are looking here for hints about how to manage growing cities .
For many , modern suburbia — a largely American concept and lifestyle for more than 50 years — is a nirvana worth emulating .
Others want to avoid it .
" They both admire and fear it , " says Robert Lang , director of the Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech .
" There are two lessons they take out of the U.S. : unfettered development or sprawl and an appreciation for well - done , master - planned communities . "
Copied for years on a smaller scale and adapted to deal with more stringent environmental standards and limited land in Western Europe , American suburbs now have gone truly global : • Affluent gated communities are sprouting up next to shantytowns outside Buenos Aires .
• On the outskirts of Lahore , Pakistan , new single - family homes are a testament to that country 's rising middle class .
• Across China , entire suburban cities are being built at a dizzying speed to keep up with population growth .
Outside Beijing and Shanghai , tract - home developments designed to mimic Spanish or Italian architecture have all - American names : Yosemite and Napa Valley .
Asia , Latin America and Eastern Europe have unleashed such a development boom that they have turned to the USA for lessons on how to do it — and how not to .
The push is on to inspire developing countries to do what more American communities are doing : steer away from sprawling , cookie - cutter subdivisions popularized after World War II and create sustainable communities that will not deplete natural resources .
That includes developments built around mass - transit stations to reduce reliance on cars and projects that mix homes and businesses so that people can walk from home to stores and other services .
The global discussion has begun : • Virginia
Tech hosted a conference last week on the " Suburban World . "
It attracted 135 people — including more than 40 planners and scholars from 19 countries and every continent except Antarctica .
Participants toured Washington 's Northern Virginia suburbs and saw examples of an " edge city " — a huge business district outside a traditional urban center ( Tysons Corner ) — and town centers ( Reston ) .
They discussed the environmental , social and economic impacts of suburbia in many countries , from Italy and Germany to Nigeria and Brazil .
" The conference is an effort to address the question of whether or not American - style suburbia is spreading , " says Lang , who will be a Fulbright scholar at the Sorbonne University in Paris next month to lecture on European and American suburbs .
" The fact that we are all coming to the ( United ) States … shows that there are concerns , " says Dirk Heinrichs , urban planning research associate at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research - UFZ in Leipzig , Germany .
After touring Tysons Corner , he said : " I 'm overwhelmed by the lack of coherent design . …
It 's ' build where you want . ' " • The University of Michigan's A. Alfred Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning last month put on a conference entitled " Global Suburbs . "
The conference 's program called suburbanization " no longer solely the province of developed Western countries . "
• The Urban Land Institute ( ULI ) , a research and education group for developers , is promoting its best industry practices in emerging markets worldwide and is taking foreign groups on " study tours " of the USA .
" They contact organizations like ULI in an effort to learn from past mistakes made in the U.S. , not to repeat them , " says John Fitzgerald , managing director of ULI Asia , in an e-mail .
• The Lincoln Institute of Land Policy , based in Cambridge , Mass. , and Peking University are opening a Center for Urban Development and Land Policy at the Chinese university this month .
" The lesson that can be learned from the U.S. is to mimic some good ideas and avoid some wrong principles , " says Saeed Ahmed Saeed , CEO of Limitless , a Dubai - based development company that is building cities and waterfront projects from Saudi Arabia to India , Russia and Vietnam .
" Most of the developers ( worldwide ) are not doing it the right way .
…
We have a professional responsibility .
Future generations will not forgive us if we do n't do it right . "
Spreading outward
The first true suburb was born in the 1830s outside Manchester , England , Lang says .
It was Victoria Park , a gated community of luxury homes that now is part of Manchester .
About 20 years later came the first U.S. suburb — gated Llewellyn Park in West Orange , N.J. , about 12 miles from Manhattan .
Streetcar suburbs followed , first along the route of horse - drawn streetcars and later along rail corridors such as Philadelphia 's Main Line .
After World War I , pedestrian - oriented suburbs flourished , including the Country Club Plaza district in Kansas City and Beverly Hills .
Suburban expansion came to a standstill during the Great Depression and " the great burst comes after World War II , " Lang says .
Tract - style subdivisions dependent on the automobile flourished .
The most famous is Levittown , on New York 's Long Island .
Then came larger , 1960s - era split - levels and colonials on cul - de - sacs .
Within 20 years , suburbs exploded in the booming Sun Belt around Dallas , Atlanta , Phoenix and other fast - growing cities .
Then the craze for large luxury homes — dubbed McMansions — pushed development to the farthest fringes of metropolitan areas , where land was still cheap and plentiful .
That helped spark an anti-sprawl fervor still alive today that has the backing of many environmentalists , preservationists , health professionals , farmers and big-city mayors .
Suburban sensibilities began to change .
Town centers designed to mimic small cities sprouted in suburbia .
New light - rail lines were built and transit - oriented developments along the tracks followed .
More people embraced " new urbanism , " a movement that strives to capture the essence of turn - of - the - century communities .
Central cities enjoyed a renaissance as young professionals and empty - nesters embraced the urban lifestyle .
Today , the dialogue about suburbs among urban thinkers around the world is intensifying largely because of universal concern over global warming .
There is worry about traffic congestion and air pollution .
That 's why designing suburbs that require residents to drive to get anywhere is losing relevance .
" The energy crisis , climate change .
Nobody can overlook that today , " says Kiril Stanilov , associate professor of planning at the University of Cincinnati .
Exporting the American dream As more Third World countries ' economies develop , their middle class grows .
So does the draw of traditional , U.S. - style suburbia .
" The suburbs represent , almost like a cliché , the American dream , " says New York architect Kevin Kennon , who has worked in China and Pakistan and is the executive director of the Institute for Architecture and Urban Study .
" I can own a piece of land , I can have my house on that land . …
It allows people to point to something that they own and distinguish it from other houses , even if they look the same . "
The Chinese delegation that visited Phoenix suburbs last month " had a keen interest in finding out what is this Petri dish of Del Webb communities they 've been hearing about for many years , " says Jacque Petroulakis , a Del Webb spokeswoman .
She says hundreds of foreign architects , planners , developers and private investors from Japan , China , Germany and South America have visited the company 's developments in recent years .
The rise of the middle class in developing nations is happening as more of the world 's population shifts from rural to urban areas .
More than half of the world 's population and about 80 % of the U.S. population live in urban areas .
" Every year , we add 60 million urban residents on Earth , " Stanilov says .
" The countries most susceptible to embracing the American model are particularly those with a booming economy and an emerging class of affluent residents and consumers really eager to embrace the American lifestyles .
They do n't want just the house but the whole package , the three - car garage , the mall , all of that . "
For many developing nations , however , the suburban ideal is stuck in circa 1980 : a sea of lookalike single - family homes and shopping malls on the edge of the city .
It 's a model that many Americans increasingly are rejecting .
" Most intellectuals say it 's horrible .
Most environmentalists say the same thing , " says Nora Libertun de Duren , urban planning professor at Columbia University and an expert on suburbs in developing countries .
" But developers say it 's good business , and architects say it 's good business . "
Developers adapt their projects to fit the local culture .
In respect for strict Muslim tenets about privacy , for example , Kennon has built high walls around every home in a subdivision he 's working on in Lahore .
Some of his homes in China have two kitchens — a regular kitchen and one with natural ventilation to allow fresh air to circulate while cooking fried foods .
In Argentina , developers are building gated communities in poor neighborhoods .
Shantytowns pepper the outskirts of Buenos Aires , areas that had no roads and other infrastructure until a major upgrade in the 1990s , Libertun de Duren says .
Once highways were built , gated developments went up and lured commuters who worked in the city .
The developments provided employment to the residents of shantytowns , she says .
Personal safety , a concern that has driven Americans out of cities and into suburbia , plays an even greater role in Latin America .
" You have the gated community phenomenon across the classes , " Heinrichs says .
" In principle , Latin American cities follow the U.S. model .
The idea of living somewhere green outside the hustle and bustle of cities and all the contamination is pretty much the same . "
A hit in Eastern Europe Stanilov sees it firsthand every summer when he returns to Bulgaria .
Driven by a flood of foreign investment , big - box retailers , industrial parks , malls and subdivisions are going up throughout Eastern Europe , he says .
There are few building restrictions in former communist countries , where the population is sensitive to the specter of government control .
" Of course government does n't have that much money to service all these new developments , " he says .
" So you have little roads with lots of automobile traffic .
…
Wisdom does n't transfer from country to country easily . "
China , where major cities are choking on stifling pollution , is striving to build the world 's first sustainable city — Dongtan , which broke ground last summer .
Designed by a London - based global consulting company and built on an island outside Shanghai , Dongtan , ultimately to house 50,000 , will ban cars that pollute ( even hybrids ) , grow its own food , recycle almost everything — including wastewater — and create its own energy from wind , the sun and human and animal waste .
" The Chinese are very interested in doing the latest and most interesting things , " says Paul Lukez , an architect from Somerville , Mass . , and author of Suburban Transformations .
" There 's a recognition by the government that something needs to be done . …
If something is cutting edge , whether it comes from the United States or Europe , they want it . "

It 's spelled gullable .

Okay .
For the love of God , would a real reporter please just ask Hillary under what possible scenario she gets more delegates , more states , or more votes than Obama ?
You all keep playing this game of following her around like she ’s news .
The only reason she ’s news is that she ’s an election zombie , roaming the primaries like she ’s still viable , when she ’s not .
And you know it .
And you ’ve written it .
But you do n’t ask her about it .
Far more important than even Hillary ’s bizarre and ever - changing views on nuclear weapons policy is the fact that it does n’t matter any more what Hillary thinks about anything .
She lost the nomination .
She ca n’t win .
And short of an asteroid falling on Obama ’s head , he ’s going to get the nomination .
We ’re all focused like a laser beam on the Pennsylvania results as if they matter .
They do n’t .
She lost .
She ca n’t catch up .
We all know it .
So why are we still playing this game ?
Because it would be mean to tell her the truth ?
Mean to ask her to explain how she possibly wins enough delegates , or even votes , when the math says she can ’t ?
What is she , 12 ?
George Stephanopoulos said he could n’t think of a harder question to ask Hillary than as to why people do n’t trust her .
Well , here ’s one , George : “ Under what possible scenario could you catch up to Obama in either delegates or votes ? ”
And do n’t accept her platitudes about “ counting every vote . ”
She ca n’t mathematically overtake Obama , so what is she doing , other than wasting all of our time ( and destroying her family ’s reputation ) ?
( That ’s another “ hard ” question , George . )
In the letter , Romney wrote , " I am an American running for president , not a Mormon running for president . "
He goes on to say , " I would have thought that more important to my potential presidency would be my record as a governor , 25 - year business leader , Olympic CEO , father , husband -- and American . "
Indeed .
I am no fan of Mitt Romney , but I have to agree with him here .
I have thought the same thing through the past two decades ' worth of elections , which often have seemed more like contests to prove who 's more holy , not who 's more qualified to run this country .
And I thought the same thing during a recent Democratic candidates ' debate , when each was asked to share his or her favorite Bible verse .
And I wondered if this nation will ever evolve to where we really might see a non-Christian candidate standing on that stage .
( Jewish Senator Joe Lieberman does n't count .
During his 2000 vice - presidential run , he managed to out - God all the other candidates . )
George W. Bush not only invokes his God in virtually every speech he makes , he also openly admits that he takes his instructions from his God .
And look where that has gotten us .
It brings to mind the words of Sinclair Lewis , who said , " When fascism comes to America it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross . "
The religious right and their supporters in Washington have brainwashed the American public into believing that Christianity is patriotic .
In fact , according to a recent survey by the First Amendment Center , 65 percent of Americans believe that the nation 's founders intended the U.S. to be a Christian nation and 55 percent believe that the Constitution establishes a Christian nation .
Hogwash .
They need to read the Constitution , which makes no mention of God or Christianity .
And they need to acquaint themselves with the Bill of Rights .
It was with good reason that this nation 's founders wrote the " separation clause " into the First Amendment , which states that " Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion . "
It was to protect the minority from tyranny of the majority .
Our founders did not want this nation to sink into theocracy .
They knew that theocracy always leads to oppression and loss of freedom .
Our founders wanted to establish a democracy in which the government serves all the people , not just the Christian ones .
For these reasons , we should not be compelled to vote for someone because he or she can recite passages from the Bible .
In fact , we should be suspicious of those who do so in a political context .
It 's pandering , and it 's often hypocritical .

TOKYO ( Reuters ) -
While the world pursues the knowledge economy , employers are increasingly desperate for plumbers , welders and other technical staff , U.S. employment services firm Manpower Inc said on Tuesday , in its annual survey of staff shortages .

Employers complaining about being unable to fill positions fell 10 percentage points to 31 percent in an annual survey of hot jobs and labor markets by employment services firm Manpower Inc , which it said reflected U.S. weakness .

The overall proportion of employers who ca n’t hire the people they want fell to 31 percent from 41 percent last year , the survey found , largely reflecting the U.S. slowdown .
But the survey of nearly 43,000 employers in 32 countries found the rising lament almost everywhere was for trades people and similar skilled , but not necessarily highly educated , positions .
“ We ’ve grown up and others have grown up talking about the knowledge environment , and parents are encouraging their children to go to college and get ahead , if you will , ” Manpower Chief Executive Jeff Joerres told Reuters in a telephone interview .
“ What is happening is that it is leaving a major void . ”
While Europe has fretted about the eastward expansion of the European Union and the potential for a flood of Polish plumbers and the like heading west , the survey found most Western European nations had the most acute shortages in such traditional crafts .
Joerres said employers across the world were desperate to fill such positions , which rely on detailed skills obtained over many years , including factory and maintenance technicians .
“ They basically would say : ‘ As many technicians as you have , we will take or as many IT programmers , or engineers ’ so we clearly feel the intensity of these sort of skill shortages , ” he said , when asked about the impact on his business .
Joerres said education institutions had wound back trade training in response to declining demand , but it had gone too far with high schools no longer offering the technical training that enthused generations of young people to work with their hands .
Such jobs were now attractive career choices , not least because they could not be outsourced to the other side of the world , he said .
“ You ca n’t be a plumber in New York City and live in Bangalore , ” Joerres said , saying the lengthy training required for such jobs would make it hard to fill the gaps .
“ These are skills that pay well , may not be as glamorous in today ’s environment but offers someone not only good pay but a future of possibly being their own business owner , ” he said .
The proportion of employers reporting difficulty filling positions in the United States nearly halved to 22 percent in this year ’s survey , undertaken in late January , from 41 percent last year .
But Joerres played down the significance of economic weakness , pointing out that the proportion of Japanese employers reporting difficulty finding staff was 63 percent despite a sluggish domestic economy .
“ You are going to go through cycles , like we are now in the U.S. , France and a few other places that are in a little bit of a slowdown .
Those are slight pauses , ” he said .
He said the demographic issue , with rapid ageing such as that in Japan -- where the workforce is forecast to shrink 16 percent by 2030 -- needed more focus .
The biggest bugbear for U.S. employers was a lack of engineers , followed by machinists and trades people .
In Asia and the Pacific , the most chronic issue was finding sales representatives , which Joerres said was due to increasingly complex requirements from multinationals expanding in Asia .
“ The sales rep is no longer presenting just the vacuum cleaner at the door , if you will , ” he said .
“ It requires a different kind of skill and a more sophisticated sale , and I think Asia has a little ways to catch up on that compared to Western Europe and the Americas . ”
Get out the siren : Clinton leaks tax returns to Drudge John Byrne
Published : Saturday April 5 , 2008

Print This Email This Man that broke Lewinsky scandal now target of Clinton news machine
The man who broke the story that nearly derailed her husband 's presidency continues to get first dibs from Sen.
Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign .
Clinton 's tax returns were leaked early to the conservative website The Drudge Report , " who has been extremely hard on Hillary for months  as good proof as any since the time of Machiavelli that it 's better to be feared than loved , " " according to Politico .
Clinton has also leaked her fundraising numbers first to Drudge in the past .
Matt Drudge came to prominence during the Bill Clinton Administration when he leaked a report Newsweek was holding on Monica Lewinsky 's sexual relationship with the president .
The Washington Times reported in 2007 that Drudge and the Web have played important strategic roles in the Clinton campaign .
" The New York Democrat 's third - quarter [ 2007 ] fundraising blowout was leaked to the Drudge Report , " the Times said .
" She made sure an Iowa newspaper printed her comments that she found Sen. Barack Obama 's answer to a foreign - policy question ' irresponsible ' and ' naive . '
She also uses her " Hillary Hub " campaign creation to break news . "
Wrote Wired 's Sarah Lai Stirland in response : " The story 's notable for two reasons :
This communications strategy is made to sound like President Bush 's , for which he has been continuously criticized during his tenure in office ; Clinton 's camp deliberately played down its third quarter fundraising numbers in comparison to rival camp Barack Obama 's in the days prior to their release .
The Clinton campaign then leaked its numbers online to show that it had surpassed Obama -- thereby generating headlines , and , presumably , more financial support in the future .
( Obama subsequently appealed to his supporter base on the Web to close the gap . ) "
The New York Times wrote about Clinton 's Drudge ' relationship ' after her fundraising numbers were leaked last year .
" Within minutes , Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton 's fund - raising success was injected via Drudge into the day 's political news on the Internet and cable television , " the Times ' Jim Rutenberg wrote .
" It did not halt coverage of Obama 's speech or his criticism of her vote to authorize the war in 2002 , but along the front lines of the campaign - the hourly , intensely fought effort to capture the news cycle or deny ownership of it to the other side - it was a telling assault . "
" Clinton 's aides declined to discuss how the Drudge Report got access to her latest fund - raising figures nearly 20 minutes before the official announcement went to supporters , " they added .
" But it was a prime example of a development that has surprised much of the political world : Clinton is learning to play nice with the Drudge Report and the powerful , elusive and conservative - leaning man behind it . "
Drudge was n't light on Clinton in his headlines Saturday .
His top three stories Saturday afternoon as of 1:20 pm ET , were : Clintons ' tax details made public ... , " " All charitable donations in '06 were to Clinton Foundation ... " and " $ 18 million dollars unaccounted for ... "
He did n't focus at the top of his page that the Clintons ' had given $ 10 million to charity , or that they paid $ 33 million in federal taxes during the same period .
RAW STORY 's earlier report on the Clintons ' $ 109 million follows .
Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign released her and husband Bill Clinton 's tax returns Friday , showing the couple made more than $ 109 million since leaving the White House in 2001 .
They donated $ 10 million to charity and paid nearly $ 34 million in taxes .
The couple 's tax returns are available here .
According to the campaign , Bill Clinton was responsible for the bulk of the couple 's post - White House income , both from his books -- $ 23 million from autobiography My Life and $ 6.3 million from Giving -- and a lucrative speaking tour , which netted him nearly $ 52 million .
Hillary Clinton had been facing mounting pressure to release the family 's tax returns since last week , when Obama released his .
Questions also arose earlier this year when Clinton loaned her campaign $ 5 million from her and her husband 's joint assets .
" The Clintons have now made public thirty years of tax returns , a record matched by few people in public service , " Clinton campaign spokesman Jay Carson said in a prepared statement .
" None of Hillary Clinton 's presidential opponents have revealed anything close to this amount of personal financial information .
" What the Clintons ' tax returns show is that they paid more than $ 33,000,000 in federal taxes and donated more than $ 10,000,000 to charities over the past eight years , " Carson continued .
" They paid taxes and made charitable contributions at a higher rate than taxpayers at their income level . "
Clinton earned close to $ 10.5 million from her own memoir Living History and about $ 190,000 from her 1996 book , It Takes a Village .
Earnings from the earlier book were donated to charity .
The Clinton campaign summarized the couple 's earnings as follows : CUMULATIVE TOTAL ( GROSS ) INCOME : $ 109,175,175
Including , among other items :
Senator Clinton 's Senate Salary : $ 1,051,606
President Clinton's Presidential Pension : $ 1,217,250
Senator Clinton's Book Income : $ 10,457,083
President Clinton's Book Income : $ 29,580,525
President Clinton's Speech Income : $ 51,855,599
That summary leaves about $ 18 million unaccounted for , as Politico 's Ben Smith notes .
The returns went out at 4 p.m. Friday , and the Drudge Report apparently got early word they were coming .
The Atlantic 's Marc Ambinder observes some reasons the release 's timing was helpful for Clinton : Good day to get these out .
( a) Clinton 's traveling press corps is exhausted by their travel schedule
( b) Mark Penn 's gaffe goes away temporarily
( c) It 's a Friday
( d ) lots of MLK - related political news
( e ) it 's well before Pennsylvania , as opposed to just days before Pennsylvania .

The expenses relate to claims by MPs to furnish a second home
The Commons authorities had been expected to release details of second home expenses later on Tuesday after a Freedom of Information tribunal ruling .
But they have launched an appeal against the ruling on the grounds it could compromise MPs ' security .
The FOI ruling last month follows a three year battle to stop publication .
The Commons authorities had until 1600 GMT on Thursday to launch an appeal , which they have now done .
' Reasonable expectations '
Explaining the decision , a Commons spokeswoman said : " The threats that MPs can face are unpredictable and subject to change . "
The battle goes on and the outcome can't be predicted
BBC political editor Nick Robinson
Read Nick 's thoughts in full
The release of their home addresses could " inhibit democratic debate " on a range of sensitive issues , she added .
The Speaker is said to have been " mindful " of MPs ' concerns and has sought advice from the security services .
" Having received advice he 's concerned that the Information Tribunal may have misdirected itself in law in deciding that home addresses of MPs should always be published subject to only to limited exceptions , " the spokeswoman said .
The Commons also considers that the tribunal gave " insufficient attention to the reasonable expectations " of MPs .
No information will now be made public until the case is heard at the High Court .
' Soft furnishings '
The Commons authorities - which include the Speaker and senior MPs from all the main parties - have spent years fighting calls to account for public money spent on expenses by MPs .
The FOI tribunal ordered the publication of a detailed breakdown of what the 14 MPs and former MPs claimed over three years .
If the details are published , the public will be able to see what politicians such as Gordon Brown , former Prime Minister Tony Blair and former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott spent on everything from their mortgage to soft furnishings on their second home in London .
The figures for Conservative leader Mr Cameron , shadow chancellor George Osborne , shadow foreign secretary William Hague and former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell are also included in the case .
' John Lewis list '
Earlier this month it emerged that MPs were allowed to claim expenses of up to £ 10,000 for a new kitchen , £ 2,000 for furniture and £ 750 for a TV or stereo for their second homes .
And other claims allowable include £ 6,335 for a new bathroom , £ 299.99 for air conditioning units , £ 300 per rug , £ 50 for a shredder and £ 1,000 for a bed .
The figures are in the so - called " John Lewis list " used by Commons officials to list maximum amounts for items .
The existence of the list - based on prices at the John Lewis store " because it was highly rated by Which magazine " - was revealed during the tribunal .
BBC request
The Commons authorities are also refusing to release the details of expenses claims by six MPs included in a 2005 Freedom of Information request by the BBC .
The Information Commissioner ruled against the BBC 's request for " full information " on the six then MPs - Tony Blair , John Prescott , Gordon Brown , Michael Howard , Charles Kennedy and Jonathan Sayeed - between April 2003 and March 2004 for reasons of personal privacy .
But he decided that the Commons should release details of travel expenses , staffing , IT provision , stationery , incidental expenses and the total amount claimed by the named MPs under the Additional Cost Allowance over the period .
The Commons authorities initially said they would comply with the ruling but then said they had decided to appeal against it .

Stephen Colbert does a wrap up from Tuesday 's Semi-super Tuesday primaries and wishes his buddy a Huckabye - bye .
Robert Reich , former Clinton Labor Secretary , appears to give his enthusiastic endorsement of the democratic process and to dismiss Colbert 's charge that the Democratic party is destroying itself from within , but just wo n't give an enthusiastic endorsement of a specific candidate , no matter how many ways Colbert tries to wheedle it out of him .
SC : Are you endorsing Hillary Clinton ?
RR : No , I decided not to endorse this round .
SC : So , you ’re endorsing Barack Obama ?
RR : No , I ’m not going to endorse anybody .
Because I ’ve been a friend of Hillary …
SC : But you ’re leaning , you ’re leaning towards Barack Obama …
RR : … for so many years , I do n’t want to endorse anybody , I think that would be inappropriate .
SC : Okay , let me put it this way : if we were at a restaurant together and the waiter brought around the dessert cart , and the choice was ladyfingers or Black Forest cake , which way do you think you ’d lean ?
RR : Quite seriously , either Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama would make a great president .
SC : Let me put this a different way .
If I were a waiter and I were to offer you two different slices of pizza , and one was half - Hawaiian and you were n’t entirely sure what it was going to taste like .
And the other was plain with cheese and had been under a heat lamp for 35 years , I mean , it had seen everything .
Which would you go for ?
RR : I do n’t think I ’d be terribly excited about either of those slices .
SC : Which movie would you rent ?
“ Big Momma ’s House ” or “ Medea ’s Family Reunion ” ?
Be careful , they are both about strong women who are actually black men .
RR : Um , gosh .
I think I ’d try both of them out .
Charles Bukowski
A cult figure , novelist , short - story writer , poet and journalist .
One of the greatest writers to come out of Los Angeles , many consider Bukowski to be a true voice of the city of angels .
Bukowski , also known as " Buk , " wrote with raw emotion and painted with words .
His canvas was Los Angeles .
Not the glitter though .
His Los Angeles was the stench of alley - ways , broken dreams , broken hearts , winos and of course ... the horse track .
Bukowski was born in Andernach , Germany in 1920 and brought to the United States at the age of three .
He was raised in Los Angeles and lived there for fifty years .
Buk published his first story when he was 24 , " The Aftermath of a Lengthy Rejection Slip , " but spent the next 10 years of his life drifting from city to city , deluging his body with pills and booze .
As he said , " I packed it in .
I threw away all the stories and concentrated upon drinking .
I did n't feel that the publishers were ready and that although I was ready , I could be readier ... "
This would land him in the charity ward of the Los Angeles City Hospital suffering from severe internal hemorraging .
After his near brush with death , he started writing again , using sleazy bars , dirty beds and indulgence in women and alcoholism as landscapes for free verse stories and poems .
He published more than 45 books of poetry and prose in his life - time .
SAN FRANCISCO – Computer intruders targeting pro-Tibetan groups , U.S. defense contractors and government agencies slipped in through previously unknown security holes in Microsoft Office , prompting Microsoft to issue a flurry of patches to the popular software suite in 2006 and 2007 , according to computer security experts .
These attacks , which appeared to have originated in China , began in early 2006 when the attackers started sending e-mails to victims with booby - trapped Word documents and Excel spreadsheets attached .
" We are seeing more and more spying done with Trojans , a shift that has happened in the last two years , " Mikko Hyppönen , the chief research officer for software security vendor F - Secure , told RSA conference attendees Thursday morning .
The Pentagon and pro-Tibet groups have previously acknowledged the intrusions , but Hyppönen is the first to link the cyber espionage to a series of patches that Microsoft pushed out without explanation .
Microsoft did not immediately reply to a request for comment .
Hyppönen 's colleague Patrik Runald notes that from 2005 through early 2006 , Microsoft issued few patches for its Office suite .
But soon after there was an explosion of patches for critical bugs that could be used to infect a computer , including a record 26 patches in October , 2006 , that fixed four critical bugs in Microsoft Office applications .
Those fixes , Runald says , appeared contemporaneously with the rise of targeted attacks on defense companies , nonprofits and government agencies .
" They now have an incentive to begin looking for bugs and exploiting them , " Runald said .
" Bad guys are finding these things fast . "
The attackers relied on e-mails tempting the victim to open the attachments , in some cases by presenting them as résumés from job seekers .
But when the target opened the attachment , the application would usually crash , while the embedded code covertly installed a keylogger and data - stealing software that scooped up documents anywhere on the organization 's network to which the user had access .
The malware then forwards the stolen information to services called DNS bouncers in China , such as 8800.org , that attackers can use to obfuscate and rapidly change where stolen documents or passwords are sent .
Finally , the code opens up what looks to be a legitimate document , in the hopes that the target wo n't know his or her computer was just infected .
The espionage was highly successful , according to Hyppönen .
One multi-billion - dollar defense contractor who went to F - Secure for help found that a single compromised Windows box had been secretly siphoning information to a server in mainland China for 18 months .
" Most attacks go unnoticed and targets do n't know they are hit , " Hyppönen said .
Hyppönen wo n't declare that the espionage is the work of the Chinese government or hackers loyal to it , though all the evidence points that way .
" Is it the Chinese ? , " Hyppönen asked .
" It sure looks like it but it could be a smokescreen .
We do n't know . "
Warnings about targeted attacks are not new , but the increase in espionage against government and nonprofit groups is alarming to experts .
In the past , security researchers more often dealt with financially motivated hackers who are after insider trading information , trade secrets or even early copies of movies that could be turned into pirate DVDs before its theatrical release .
" We now have to deal with the criminal doing it for money , and the spies doing it for information , " Hyppönen said .
Though Microsoft 's patches have shored up security in the Office suite , the attacks continue .
A more recent spate of intrusions at government agencies and pro-Tibet and Taiwanese groups have resorted to older , known vulnerabilities .
The attackers are using the classic hacking technique of reverse - engineering Microsoft security updates to discover the holes they patch .
Since large organizations can take weeks or months to update all of their machines , the updates provide intruders with a window of opportunity , Runald said .
Such attacks against pro-Tibet groups spiked in recent weeks following the riots in Tibet .
On March 17 , attackers sent a file purporting to be a statement from the United Nations to a pro-Tibet mailing list .
Once opened , the document attempted to install malware that steals PGP encryption keys , as part of an attempt to compromise tools used to keep communications secure , according to Hyppönen .
Like the 2006 and 2007 attacks , the newer intrusions appear to be the work of a single group of hackers :
The attack files used on one target are sometimes used within weeks on another .
" The files have the same hash , " Hyppönen said .
It almost a given it is the same attacker . "
The cyberspies also do a lot more homework than your run -of - the - mill online criminal , who tries to steal PayPal accounts by sending out millions of e-mails , with no idea whether the recipients actually use the online payment service .
By contrast , the stealthy attackers will try to test their exploits ahead of time by calling the company to quiz a secretary on what kind of anti-virus software the organization uses , claiming , for example , that an e-mail he sent to the company keeps bouncing .
The spies also forge e-mail headers to fool a recipient into thinking a file comes from a co-worker or trusted source .
They may even go so far to figure out who a C - level executive plans to meet with , in order to send a very convincing e-mail .
For protection , Hyppönen suggested that companies use F - Secure 's free root - kit detection tool , called BlackLight , install security patches rapidly , employ layers of security from different vendors , and monitor internet traffic headed to " funky hosts . "
Adobe 's Acrobat has also been targeted , and Hyppönen recommended that people use an alternative PDF reader .
He also noted that OpenOffice , an open source alternative to Microsoft Office , has not been targeted .
It is also possible for users to notice when they get infected , since exploits usually crash Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat Reader before relaunching the application with a real file .
That leads to a quick screen flash , and sometimes ends up putting the name of the exploit file in Word 's recovered document 's pane .
While one might expect banks to be targeted with these kinds of exploits , Hyppönen says he has n't seen a single one , calling that a clue to the motivations of these attackers .
Runald says the message is clear .
" The enemy is changing , " he said .
" Now we are also fighting spies . "

Actually it ’s my girlfriend ’s cat .
Actually we have two , a small grey tabby named T**** that is a blast to have around , and the “ other one ” .
It ’s corpulent , bright orange and has medium length hair , so of course to me it ’s name has only ever been Fat Bastard .
( I ’m not kidding , this cat is obese enough that it ’s gut leaves it ’s own trail in the middle of it ’s footprints after I vacuum the carpet , uniformly triangulating the food dish , the litter box , and the hammock it has steamrollered for itself in my underwear hamper ) Fat Bastard has a problem .
It ’s very existence revolves solely around consuming anything organic .
I meanWe can’t have real plants anymore , not even cactus .
( My girlfriend did n’t laugh when I , tired of the green vomit , suggested Poinsettias ) We have all of the food stored in cupboards that have child locks on them .
Opening the fridge involves holding a broom .
( I ’d love to teach the fucker a lesson by trapping it in there for a little bit , but beyond the cessation of all sexual activity when my girlfriend finds out , I ’m pretty sure this thing is as well - insulated as a walrus and I ’d only open the door and discover carnage , not to mention fuzzy rage propelling itself to freedom with one of it ’s signature exertion farts )
We have a bungee cord holding the lid on the trash can , which also happens to be attached to the wall to prevent , as my girlfriend calls it , “ accidental tipping ” .
Ordering pizza involves trapping it in a bedroom , then listening to it scratch furiously at the door as soon as it gets a whiff of oregano .
It drinks pop .
We can’t walk away from the stove while preparing a meal , as even scalding hot pots and pans have proven no match for it ’s powerful , powerful lust .
I love bacon , yet it ’s become contraband since the “ incident ” .
( Which my girlfriend still somehow regards as my fault , as if I encouraged the fucking thing to snatch sizzling bacon right out of the pan , headfirst , then tear - ass around the house alternating between muted howling and ragged , gasping swallows . )
It has , on a number of occasions , snarfed an entire pack of cigarettes .
It was entertaining at first , playing the “ Let ’s see what we can get in there ” game , but when this fucking beast blew right through wasabi , jalapenos , mustard , lemons , live grasshoppers , Skittles , and an extra - shot latte , I got the point .
I ’m tired of having to treat simple food items like they ’re plutonium .
I miss having a bag of chips or a cold pizza on the coffee table while I ’m watching the game .
I ’m fed up with having to wait to do laundry because the basement has been fouled by a particularly rank dump .
If you want her , she ’s yours .
The girlfriend or the cat , it ’s your call … ( Either way , you do n’t even have to get out of the car ; I ’ll just unwrap a Kraft single and throw it in the backseat . )
Please , help a guy out …
Her necklines have been plunging lower and lower with each recent red carpet appearance .
And each time the likelihood that JK Rowling would suffer an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction has increased .
This week , however , after an evening where her decolletage frequently threatened to pop out , the situation was made worse by a rather hands - on aide .
As these pictures show , the publicist of the Harry Potter author launched himself forward to prevent photographers capturing the moment when the front of her purple gown slipped perilously south .
But amid the hubbub and with flashbulbs popping at the British Book Awards , Mark Hutchinson ended up with more of a handful than he planned for .
Asked last night about the incident , Mr Hutchinson , who has worked with Miss Rowling for more than five years , seemed confused about how he ended up in such a position .
Saying he did not clearly remember trying to protect Miss Rowling 's modesty , he then gave two different accounts of how he might have ended up in such a position .
" Oh no , oh gosh ! " remarked Mr Hutchinson , director of PR agency Colman Getty , when he heard of the unfortunate pictures .
" I think there was a point where there was a strap coming loose , and that was where my hands were going - on the top .
" To my knowledge I did not have my hand actually on her breast .
Maybe it's the angle of the photograph . "
The slip marked an embarrassing end to an evening when Miss Rowling had picked up a lifetime achievement award - but even so , observers were stunned by just how much she 's transformed herself in the past decade .
The evening was a curious event where the worlds of literature and showbusiness met , with the likes of the Harry Potter author on one side and glamour - model turned children 's author Jordan on the other .
Sir Richard Attenborough was seen giving Spice Girl Geri Halliwell a kiss on the cheek .
Elsewhere were model Marie Helvin , Dame Edna Comedian Barry Humphries and chef Gordon Ramsay , glamour girl Abi Titmuss and Strictly Come Dancing champ Alesha Dixon .
Jordan 's outfit was a typically revealing bejewelled maxi-dress , complete with plunging neckline .
Slipping standards :
First her bra begins to show ( 2 ) before she makes a desperate attempt to hitch up her dress ( 3 )
Eyes down :
By now she 's attracting stares ( 4 ) so her publicist steps in to assist ( 5 )
Bosom buddies :
As the flashbulbs pop , aide Mark Hutchinson is caught red- handed
She may have expected her flesh - flashing outfit to steal the show .
However , she had reckoned without the unexpected intervention of Miss Rowling .
Other winners at the " British Book Oscars " included Ian McEwan who won Book of the Year and Author of the Year for On Chesil Beach .
Khaled Hosseini took home the Richard & Judy Best Read of the Year for A Thousand Splendid Suns , and Russell Brand received a best biography Nibbie for his tell - all tome My Booky Wook .
A Nibbie for the best piece of non-fiction writing went to film star Ewan McGregor and acting pal Charley Boorman for Long Way Down , the account of their journey through Africa .
More glamour : Strictly Come Dancing champ Alesha Dixon and former nurse turned glamour girl Abi Titmuss
Spice author : Geri Halliwell has followed idol Madonna into the world of writing children 's books

They are cats , some former strays , some tiger - striped .
But to Jan Fredericks of Wayne , N.J. , they are family , they are God ’s creatures and deserving of compassion .
And in Pope Benedict XVI , Ms. Fredericks , the chairwoman of the fledgling American branch of Catholic Concern for Animals , believes that she has found a kindred spirit :
Along with an enormous entourage and a message of peace , the Pope brought with him to the United States a lifelong love of cats .
Benedict ’s kindness toward the strays of Rome is already the stuff of Vatican legend .
His house in Germany , its garden guarded by a cat statue , was filled with cats when Benedict lived there full time before he was posted to the Vatican in 1982 .
And Benedict is , without a doubt , the first pope to have had an authorized biography of him written by a cat 
Chico , a ginger tabby who lives across the road from Benedict ’s old house in Germany .

WASHINGTON — A new U.N. Human Rights Council official assigned to monitor Israel is calling for an official commission to study the role neoconservatives may have played in the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
On March 26 , Richard Falk , Milbank professor of international law emeritus at Princeton University , was named by unanimous vote to a newly created position to report on human rights in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Arabs .
While Mr. Falk ’s specialty is human rights and international law , since the attacks in 2001 , he has devoted some of his time to challenging what he calls the “ 9 - 11 official version . ”
On March 24 in an interview with a radio host and former University of Wisconsin instructor , Kevin Barrett , Mr. Falk said , “ It is possibly true that especially the neoconservatives thought there was a situation in the country and in the world where something had to happen to wake up the American people .
Whether they are innocent about the contention that they made that something happen or not , I do n’t think we can answer definitively at this point .
All we can say is there is a lot of grounds for suspicion , there should be an official investigation of the sort the 9/11 commission did not engage in and that the failure to do these things is cheating the American people and in some sense the people of the world of a greater confidence in what really happened than they presently possess . ”
Mr. Barrett , who is the co-founder of the Muslim - Jewish - Christian Alliance for 9/11 Truth , said in an interview yesterday of Mr. Falk , “ I would put him on a list of scholars who are sympathetic to the 9/11 truth movement . ”
He added , “ Unlike most public intellectuals today , he is both honest and very , very knowledgeable in that he understands the probable reality of 9/11 .
He understands that the evidence that it was a false flag operation is very strong . ”
The narrative that the attacks from 2001 were a “ false flag ” operation is a recurring theme in the literature challenging the consensus that 19 Al Qaeda hijackers flew commercial jets into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon .
False flag refers to espionage or covert actions taken by one government made to seem like the work of another .
The false flag thesis has it that the Bush administration is somehow responsible for the September 11 attacks as a pretext for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Mr. Falk yesterday did not return e-mails and phone calls asking for a comment .
But in 2004 he wrote the foreword to the book “ The New Pearl Harbor , ” by David Ray Griffin .
Mr. Griffin has posited that such an inside job is the likely explanation for the attacks .

Researchers at Harvard Medical School have identified a gene in Asian monkeys that may have evolved as a defense against lentiviruses , the group of viruses that includes HIV .
The study suggests that AIDS is not a new epidemic .
The gene , called TRIM5 - CypA , well characterized elsewhere ( AIDS , 2007 ; PNAS , 2008 ) , is a hybrid of two existing cellular genes , TRIM5 and CypA .
The combination produces a single protein capable of blocking infection by viruses closely related to HIV .
Surprisingly , this is actually the second time researchers have identified a TRIM5 - CypA gene in monkeys .
The other hybrid gene , called TRIMCyp , was discovered in 2004 in South American owl monkeys .
Normally , evolutionary biologists assume that similar DNA sequences , present in the same location in the genomes of two or more species , evolved only once .
In this scenario , the gene arises first in a common ancestor and is subsequently inherited by all the species that descend from that ancestor .
In the case of TRIM5 - CypA and TRIMCyp , this does not appear to be the case .
TRIM5 - CypA was not found in monkeys closely related to the Asian macaques , and in fact , was not found in every macaque individual tested .
Likewise , owl monkey TRIMCyp was not found in any other species of South American primate .
Researchers interpret this to mean that the two genes arose independently , once in owl monkeys and once in macaques .
More tellingly , even though the protein sequences specified by the two TRIM5 - CypA genes are similar , at the DNA level it is obvious that the molecular events leading to formation of the two genes were different .
Evolutionary biologists refer to the acquisition of a similar adaptation in different species as “ convergent evolution , ” an example being the independent appearance of flight in both birds and bats .
The Harvard team ’s genetic evidence indicates that the two TRIM5 - CypA genes constitute an unambiguous and particularly striking example of convergent evolution .
Moreover , the kinds of molecular events required to construct the two TRIM5 - CypA genes are thought to be rare .
That the process occurred at least twice during primate evolution suggests that the combination of the TRIM5 and CypA genes provided a strong evolutionary advantage to the individuals in which they originally appeared .
An intriguing possibility is that the newly formed genes prevented infection by prehistoric viruses related to modern AIDS viruses .
If so , this could mean that AIDS - like epidemics are not unique to our time , but in fact may have plagued our primate ancestors long before the modern AIDS epidemic .

A couple of active Google Reader users have reported at a Google Groups thread that someone or something is injecting spam into their daily reading .
It is really hard to determine how this is being done at this point ( i.e. the reports are really new ) .
Here are two of those reportS :
How are these people 's blogs showing up in my reader that I have n't added to my subscriptions ?
Lots of Ads or people I just do n't know .
I am having a similar problem .
In my iGoogle homepage where I have a widget ( taken from Google reader I think ? ) allows me see my feeds .
I am seeing a feed from something called " best pics around . "
This now is flooding the widget so that i no longer see any of my other feeds .
However , when I go to my Reader there is no sign of this feed and I see my other feeds as normal but therefore I am unable to unsubscribe to this feed .
I have no Friends shared items and i am logged in to my account .
Google Reader Guide asks a few questions for the first user .
He / she asks if she is on a public computer and making sure that you are indeed logged into your account and not someone elses .
Maybe he / she is seeing items from the " Friends ' shared items " that was launched recently ?
But I do n't think this applies to any of those suggestions .
The second report came in after and I doubt it was the same case .
I personally tested my account and it was clean of pictures and spam .
But what are other possibilities ?
Someone hacked into their accounts and added the content
Their computer was infected and injected with this content
They visited a page that somehow automatically added subscriptions to their Google Reader accounts
Google Reader was indeed spammed somehow ?

Professorene Kristen Nygaard og Ole Johan Dahl fikk i forrige uke den prestisjebetonte Turing - prisen og den like respekterte von Neumann - medaljen - Informatikkens Nobelpriser .
Men kjenner alle til bakgrunnen og historien bak utviklingen av verdens første objekt - orienterte programmeringsspråk ?
Eller hvilken betydning det faktisk har hatt for IT - utviklingen ?
Her følger et bearbeidet og forkortet utdrag av Arild Haraldsens beskrivelse av historien om SIMULA som han utarbeidet i samarbeid med Kristen Nygaard , og gjengitt i boken " " .
Det var en gang - slik begynner som regel alle eventyr - en matematisk begavet , ung student som skulle avtjene sin verneplikt .
Dette var i 1948 .
Verneplikten ble avtjent som siviltjeneste på Forsvarets Forskningsinstitutt på Kjeller .
Her fikk han som veileder J. V. Garwick som han kjente fra sin tid som stipendiat ved Astrofysisk Institutt i Oslo .
Garwick møtte den unge soldaten den første dagen med et litt infamt smil , pekte på en stol og et skrivebord med en elektromekanisk regnemaskin , og sa : " Her skal du i 14 måneder avtjene verneplikten med å regne for meg ! " .
Og det gjorde Kristen Nygaard som studenten het - nærmere bestemt med å beregne dimensjonene på stavene til den atomreaktoren som skulle bygges .
Det gikk jo bra .
Noen atomulykke skjedde som kjent aldri .
Nygaard ble etter hvert mer og mer interessert i operasjonsanalyse og simulering .
Han ble bl .a. satt til å finne ut hvor mye soldater kunne bære under transport ( " krigføring utenfor vei " ) .
I dette arbeidet vokste det frem en erkjennelse som snart skulle bli skjellsettende for den videre datautvikling .
Data - informasjon - lever ikke sitt eget liv , det er en del av den sosiale og organisasjonsmessige sammenheng dataene opptrer i.
Et eksempel : Nygaard hentet inn data fra soldatene ute i felten for å gjennomføre sitt prosjekt " krigføring utenfor vei " .
Om og om igjen erfarte han at dataene ikke stemte , eller at de var utilstrekkelige .
Når de som leverte dataene ble konfrontert med dette , svarte de " ja , men da må dere komme ut i felten og se hva vi gjør i praksis , se helheten i hva vi gjør " .
Dette innebar en vesentlig utfordring til datidens programmeringsspråk som var laget for å behandle data isolert , og ikke ut i fra sosial og organisasjonsmessige sammenheng de oppsto eller skulle brukes i.
Men Nygaard tenkte anderledes .
Data - analyser kunne åpenbart ikke bare dreie seg om data : data var en del av et sosialt fenomen ; de måtte også beskrive den virkelighet de skulle opptre i , og den virkelighetsforståelse de som brukte dataene hadde .
Nygaard fortsatte på FFI etter vernepliktstjenesten , og jobbet med operasjonsanalyse og simuleringsoppgaver for næringslivet .
Igjen og igjen så han behovet for å sette dataene inn i en sosial , anvendelsesorientert .
sammenheng
I 1960 ble han overtalt til å overta som forskningssjef ved Norsk Regnesentral .
Han fikk etter hvert med seg flere forskere fra FFI over til Regnesentralen ( noe som skapte sterk og langvarig strid mellom ham og FFIs mektige sjef Finn Lied ) .
En av dem han overtalte til å hoppe over fra FFI til NR var Ole - Johan Dahl ( bildet t.h. )
I 1961 fikk de idèen til et språk de kalte SIMULA ( SIMUlation LAnguage ) .
Det skulle på samme tid være et hjelpemiddel for mennesker til å forstå og beskrive selv meget komplekse systemer , og samtidig gi beskrivelser som datamaskiner automatisk kunne bruke til å generere de tilhørende simuleringsprogrammer .
Samarbeidet mellom de to - duoen Nygaard og Dahl - begynte fort å bære frukter .
Nygaard var systemteoretikeren ; han hadde sluttet å programmere i 1954 .
Dahl var programmeren ; han hadde aldri drevet systemarbeid .
Sammen skapte de SIMULA i begynnelsen av 60 - årene .
Samarbeidet mellom de to må ha fortonet seg som en komposisjon av John Lennon og Paul McCartney - to ulike personligheter utfordret hverandre i et kreativt samarbeid som sprengte grenser og skapte ny kunnskap .
Men de fikk god drahjelp av en hendelse som var like uventet som gledelig .
Norsk Regnesentral trengte en ny datamaskin .
Valget falt på en maskin fra Dansk Regnesentral .
Maskinen ble kalt GIER .
Det var ikke den maskinen Nygaard hadde ønsket seg .
Han ville heller ha en topp moderne stormaskin - UNIVAC 1107 - den første datamaskin som var like god til å utføre videnskapelige oppgaver som til å løse næringslivets problemer .
Men den maskinen var for dyr .
Nygaard fant seg derfor i valget av GIER .
Så - helt uventet - ble Nygaard , sammen med en rekke andre ledere av private bedrifter og forskningsinstitusjoner i Europa , invitert til USA av Univac for å se nærmere på den nye maskinen .
Nygaard aksepterte tilbudet , og pakket kofferten .
I kofferten lå idèen om SIMULA .
Dette var i mai 1962 .
USA - besøket ble gjennomslaget for den videre utvikling av SIMULA .
Det skyldes ikke minst et minnerikt besøk på en gresk nattklubb ...
Historien er som følger : I USA traff Nygaard ledelsen i Univac , hvor de ga ham anledning til å snakke varmt om Simulas fortreffelighet .
Det falt i god jord .
En av de dyktigste selgerne i Univac - James W. Nickitas - tok vel i mot de norske gjestene .
Nickitas gikk for å ha greske aner ( egentlig er han tyrkisk ) .
Hvorom allting var foreslo han at de skulle avslutte samtalene på en gresk nattklubb .
Der - lyttende til bouzouki-musikk , og nytende synet av en skjønn mavedanserinne - kom et meget fristende tilbud : NR skulle få UNIVAC 1107 til halv pris .
Som motytelse skulle NR levere en Simula - kompilator .
Norsk Regnesentral skulle bli europeisk utstillingsvindu for den nye maskinen .
Vel tilbake i Oslo presenterte han tilbudet for styret i NR .
Den første reaksjon var at han neppe kunne være vel bevart .
Men i slutten av juni kom Nickitas og hans sjef til Oslo og NR .
De gjentok tilbudet .
Og i tillegg - helt uventet , og totalt upåvirket av nattklubbstemninger og mavedanserinner - ble tilbudet utvidet til også å omfatte en utviklingskontrakt for Simula .
Univac skulle med andre ord betale for Simulas videre utvikling .
Etter at UNIVAC - maskinen var på plass i 1963 gikk de i gang med å detaljutforme det nye språket .
Våren 1964 kom gjennombruddet : i stedet for å beskrive data og handlinger ( operasjoner ) hver for seg , ble et samlende komponentbegrep innført ( først kalt prosess , senere objekt ) .
Data og operasjoner ble beskrevet samlet som to aspekter av samme begrep : objektet .
Og alle objekter som var kjennetegnet med samme struktur på data og handlinger , ble betraktet som å tilhøre samme klasse ( først kalt aktivitet ) , og kunne gis en felles beskrivelse i en klasse - deklarasjon .
Objektorientert programmering - grunnstammen i dagens programmeringsspråk var med dette født .
Kompilatoren for det nye språket ble ferdig i januar 1965 .
NR fikk et av sine første oppdrag basert på det nye språket fra det svenske firmaet ASEA .
Oppdraget ble gitt på den uttrykkelige betingelse at Simula måtte kjøre 10 ganger raskere på en Facit - maskin enn tradisjonelle språk .
Resultatet ble 50 ganger raskere !
I 1966 begynte Dahl og Nygaard å se hvordan de kunne forbedre Simula .
De ønsket en meget kraftigere referanse - eller peker - begrep , og samtidig ha en kompilator som kunne forby feilaktig bruk av referansene .
Løsningen kom i januar 1967 ved det som i dag kalles nedarving .
Dette begrepet muligjorde for første gang å generalisere og spesialisere begreper .
Det var et kjempeskritt fremover i programmeringens historie .
Den nye versjonen av Simula ble hetende SIMULA 67 .
Tiden var nå inne for å vise vidunderet frem for verden .
I 1967 arrangerte IFIP en konferanse om simuleringsspråk på Lysebu utenfor Oslo .
Her ble den første fullstendige Simula - versjonen - Simula 67 - presentert for første gang for et internasjonalt publikum bestående av mange av verdens fremste innen programmeringsspråk .
En av deltakerne var en amerikansk forsker fra Stanford - Donald Knuth - som selv hadde laget et simuleringsspråk .
Etter å ha fått presentert Nygaard / Dahls Simula 67 la han imidlertid sitt eget arbeid bort .
Simula 67 var så mye bedre .
Donald Knuth ble senere en sann Norges - venn og ambassadør for Simula i USA .
Han ble også en meget god venn med Ole - Johan Dahl .
Det var ikke bare programmeringsspråk som brakte dem sammen .
De er begge fremragende pianister .
Gradvis slo Simula og objektorientert programmering igjennom , først i simuleringsoppgaver , så innen oppgaver som krevde mer komplekse datastrukturer ( som parallellprogrammering ) .
Viktigst var nok den utviklingen som skjedde ved forskningssenteret Xerox PARC , hvor Simula ble integrert med de nye grafiske brukergrensesnittene og objektorienterte databaser .
Det finnes derfor en direkte linje fra Simula over Windows til det Internett - baserte programmeringsspråket Java .
Og her kommer det som historikerne kaller det kontra - faktiske synspunkt : Dersom Norge hadde skaffet seg patentrettigheter til Simula , ville verdens rikeste mann ikke hett Bill Gates , og heller ikke vært amerikaner , men vært norske med navnene Nygaard / Dahl ?
Men slik gikk det ikke .
For ingen kan ta patent på idèer .
Forskning bygger på " gratis " - prinsippet .
Det utbrer kunnskap som skaper nye idèer og produkter .
Uten Simula intet Windows , intet Java , intet Internett .
Hvor hadde IT - utviklingen vært i dag uten Nygaard og Dahls epokegjørende forskningsinnsats ?

Nygaard og Dahl har også nylig fått en hederlig omtale i en bok om programmeringsspråkenes historie : " Go To " av Steve Lohr , Basic Books , 2001 ) .

A fact is the most trivial piece of science .
A theory is the most complete .
" The average density of granite is 2.75 g·cm^ - 3 , " is a fact .
Facts are important , but are the starting point , not the goal .
To a scientist , theory is the entire body of understanding about a particular phenomenon , the best unifying description of all the relevant facts .
Theory is the whole structure of knowledge .
To say that " evolution is a fact " is like saying " the Himalayas are a stone . "

Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution
Theodosius Dobzhansky ( 1900 - 1975 )
( see http://www.2think.org/... for a truly classic essay . )
Evolution is the central organizing principle behind biology .
Without it , biology is a list of facts and equations , a series of observations .
You can study the various types and formations of igneous rock , learn that pumice is useful for this and basalt for that , but without knowing that there was molten rock involved , your understanding would be pretty limited .
This is very equivalent to trying to understand biology without evolution .
We are all highly evolved .
Because all organisms have evolved from a common ancestor , we all have as many years of evolution behind us .
Bacteria , often seen as the least evolved , actually evolve a lot faster than we do .
We see the traits that are human like as being " highly evolved . "
Yeah us !
But when we do this , it is just chauvinism .
Evolution does not push towards any kind of subjective perfection .
In order to pass on its genes , an organism needs to be as good or better than the competition .
It does not need to be morally or intellectually appealing .
It does not need to be perfectly efficient or maximally beautiful .
It just needs to be good enough to get past the competition .
The popular view of evolution is a progression from bacteria to squiggly guys to fish to lungfish to amphibians to reptiles to mammals to primates to great apes to Neanderthals to cavemen to us us US , the pinnacle of God 's design !
But wait , we are talking about science here , no supernatural explanations need apply .
If we overcome our religious biases and our anthropocentrism , it becomes clear that the world 's organisms are not striving to be us .
Some populations evolve to be bigger , others to be smaller .
Brains get bigger and smaller .
Number of limbs increases and decreases .
There is no direction to it .
Every population just drifts towards whatever happens to encourage survival and reproduction in their peculiar environment at that moment .
There is no force driving things towards being human like .
Because there is no direct to evolution , the term " devolve " is not one that has a biological meaning .
See
http://en.wikipedia.org/... for a discussion of misunderstanding and misuses of " devolution . "
A trait can be highly evolved , in that it has changed a great deal from the ancestral state ( e.g. frogs have a highly evolved pelvis ) but after billions of years , all organisms are highly evolved .
Biologist do n't , and will likely never , agree how to define " species . "
In a creationist world view , it is easy to define a species .
The decedents of each pair of organisms that lived on Noah 's ark form a species .
Simple process leads to easy defining .
The problem is , looking at the diversity of life , we find much more complexity , much more messiness than can be explained through static , preordained species .
A single " species " can have tremendous geographic variation .
Oaks hybridize like mad .
Salamanders that look like the same species wo n't interbreed , except in particularly wet years .
Salamanders that can't interbreed with each other will both interbreed with an intermediate population .
Some populations , through spontaneous mutation , spawn clonal populations that do n't breed with anybody .
There is a tremendous diversity of process .
Pity the poor taxonomist .
Everyone expects a list of species , the laws are written around endangered species and migratory species , which means we have to decide what is a species , and what is not .
If two populations interbreed only once every thousand years , are they one species or two ?
If two groups swap nuclear DNA but not mitochondrial , can they be considered separate ?
Can species be delineated based on ecological traits ?
On behaviors ?
What does the word species mean when applied to organisms that reproduce asexually ?
There are literally hundreds of definitions of species supported by different biologists .
And there is no one right definition ; the underlying process that we are trying to shoehorn is so complex that every conceivable definition simply wo n't work in some cases .
In order to applicable in all cases a definition would have to be so broad that it was applicable in none .
No matter how much data we have , there is no final answer to how many species are out there , because no single definition can be applied .
Nature is messy , and does n't read our rule books .
Not all evolution is because of natural selection .
Biological evolution is the heritable change in populations over time .
Natural selection is one extremely important factor in driving heritable change .
But it is not the only one .
In small populations , there is genetic drift .
A trait that is in no way advantageous can increase in frequency simply because the two guys who happen to have that trait also happen to impregnate a whole bunch of females .
Mutations in and of themselves constitute evolution .
Basically , in order to avoid evolving , a population would have to be infinitely large , completely homogeneous , in a completely stable environment , under no selective pressures and without either a dearth or a glut of disadvantageous mutations .
Evolution is an ongoing process .
I often hear people say things along the lines of , " back in evolutionary times " or " when evolution was happening . "
Evolution is happening now .
Humanity is currently evolving .
Certain populations are increasing while other with different genetic backgrounds are decreasing .
Change in genetic make up of the population over time is evolution .
That is how geneticists define evolution .
Humans are also undergoing selective evolution , and specific genes have been identified that are currently being selected for or against .
Our genes for disease resistance are under particularly strong selection .
Evolution can act incredibly rapidly .
Spray a field with an insecticide .
There are a million crickets in the field .
9,999,998 of them keel over .
The remaining two survive because they happened to have a mutation that made them resistant to the insecticide .
The male calls , the female comes , candles , moonlight .
100 resistant baby crickets .
The farmer comes back and sprays again .
Maybe half the crickets die .
The remainder all carry the resistance gene .
Repeat the process and the gene that causes resistance becomes more common with each generation .
Pretty soon most of the crickets have not one but two copies of the resistance gene , having gotten one from each parent .
The population has evolved to be resistant .
This is also why we have antibiotic resistant bacteria .
And why the Cane Toad , introduced into Australia , can now survive in habitats much drier than they could have a few decades ago .
Almost everything you have ever read about evolution in the popular press gets it wrong .
Populations do not evolve in order to achieve a certain goal .
Biologists do not disagree about evolution any more than geologists disagree about tectonics .
Individuals do not act for the good of the species ( present company excepted , of course ) .
Darwin did not coin , or like , the term " survival of the fittest . "
Our ancestors did not look like modern day chimps .
We are not descended from the lungfish .
There is no such thing as " adaption . "
Darwin did not base his theory of evolution primarily on Darwin 's Finches .
Darwin did not set out to form a theory of evolution .
His main interest was barnacles .
Evolution is that heritable change in populations over time .
There is no way for an individual to evolve .
An individual can reproduce , or die , and contribute to the evolution of her species .
But there is no biological evolution of individuals .
Darwin got some details wrong .
Darwin had no clear concept of genetics .
Mendel sent Darwin a copy of his book .
Darwin never opened it .
Darwin made lots of wild guesses as to the mechanisms behind heredity , and some of those guesses lead him down dead ends .
Modern biologists are awed by Darwin 's genius , but we are not under the delusion that he had all the answers , nor are we simply accepting him at his word .
Many of Darwin 's guesses have been shown to be sound .
Others have been shown to be flawed .
Tell me what you think .
Let me know if you disagree with something , or want a source or more information .
There will be some slightly more provocative evolutionary musing tomorrow .
FOR a decade Europe has rebuffed efforts by biotechnology firms such as America 's Monsanto to promote genetically modified crops .
Despite scientific assurances that genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) are safe for human consumption , and a ruling by the World Trade Organisation against national import bans in the European Union , many Europeans have yet to touch or taste them .
But that may soon change , according to Iain Ferguson , boss of Tate & Lyle , a British food giant .
“ We sit at a moment of history when GM technology ... is a fact of life , ” he said this week .
Mr Ferguson , who is also the head of Britain 's Food and Drink Federation , argues that because many large agricultural exporters have adopted GMOs , it is becoming expensive to avoid them .
Copa - Cogeca , a farmers ' lobby , this week warned that the rising cost of feed could wipe out Europe 's livestock industry unless bans on GMOs are lifted .
Meanwhile , European agriculture ministers failed to agree on whether to allow imports of GM maize and potatoes ; the decision will now be made by the European Commission , which is likely to say yes .
If it does , it will be a victory for Monsanto .
But the firm is already enjoying an even sweeter form of revenge : huge commercial success .
It has had three straight years of revenue and profit growth , and on February 12th it raised its profit forecast for the fiscal year for the second time in two months .
Monsanto made a profit of $ 993 m in the year to August , on revenues of $ 8.6 billion .
The global commodity - price boom helps ( see article ) , but Brett Begemann , a senior executive at Monsanto , insists that it is the firm 's advances in GMO technology that are fetching premium prices and will help it to double profits by 2012 .
The firm 's fortunes have been boosted by the success of GMOs outside Europe .
A new report from the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications ( ISAAA ) , a non-profit outfit that tracks industry trends , charts the dramatic growth in the 12 years that GMOs have been commercially available .
The area under cultivation increased by 12 % last year , to 114 m hectares globally .
America topped the list , but there is rapid growth in Argentina , Brazil , India and China ( see map ) .
Thomas West of Pioneer Hi-Bred , a division of DuPont , says Europe should get on board , as “ the train is leaving the station . ”
According to Cropnosis , an industry consultancy , the market for agricultural biotechnology grew from about $ 3 billion in 2001 to over $ 6 billion in 2006 , and is expected to reach $ 8.4 billion by 2011 .
Hans Kast , chief executive of Germany 's BASF Plant Science , thinks the figure could reach $ 50 billion by 2025 , as a second generation of GMO technology , now in the pipeline , reaches the market .
Proponents of GMOs are optimistic because a confluence of social , commercial and technological forces is boosting the case for the technology .
As India and China grow richer , the world is likely to need much more food , just as arable land , water and energy become scarcer and more expensive .
If they fulfil their promise , GMOs offer a way out of this bind , providing higher yields even as they require less water , energy and fertiliser .
Early incarnations of the technology , such as Monsanto 's Roundup Ready maize and soyabeans , were genetically engineered to be resistant to herbicides and pesticides , making it easier for farmers to control pests without damaging crops .
The second generation will have further traits , such as drought resistance , “ stacked ” on top .
Michael Mack , chief executive of Switzerland 's Syngenta , reckons that farmers will pay extra for these new features .
Moore 's law for maize
Indeed , farmers can expect ever - faster cycles of product upgrades , thinks David Fischhoff , a senior executive at Monsanto .
He likens the industry 's situation to the early days of the personal computer , now that the underlying technology is in place .
Monsanto predicts that the yield from maize grown in America , which has doubled since 1970 , can double again by 2030 .
Mr Mack draws a similar analogy .
“ Like in the software industry , ” he says , “ intellectual - property rights give our technology value . ”
Farmers paying big licence fees to use the new technology would no doubt agree .
But just as with software , GMOs suffer from piracy .
In Argentina and China , the hostile stance toward intellectual - property rights has been blessed by the government itself .
The dirty little secret of the software industry , however , was that companies quietly tolerated some piracy on the basis that once customers went legal , they would probably stick with the products they were already using .
The same may be happening with GMOs .
Ask Syngenta 's boss if he is worried about piracy , and he answers “ yes and no ” .
As countries grow richer or embrace WTO rules , he says , their farmers will start paying .
Argentina has already headed in that direction , he reckons , and last year his firm set up a joint venture with a Chinese biotechnology centre .
The most important reason to think that GMOs have a brighter future , however , comes not from any of the benefits they offer farmers , large though those will be .
The big difference with the next generation of technology , argues Mr West of Pioneer Hi-Bred , is that it will also provide benefits to consumers .
As an example , he points to his firm 's high - oleic soyabean oil , which it expects to have on the market in 2009 .
Through genetic manipulation , he claims , his firm 's researchers have been able to improve soya oil so that it tastes better , is healthier and produces no trans - fats during cooking .
Could such an innovation even persuade sceptical Europeans ?
The lack of consumer benefits with first - generation GMOs made it easy for activists to whip up opposition .
But if future products offer things consumers want , such as healthier food , and address problems that European regulators are worried about , such as obesity and climate change , then GMOs may yet have their day in Europe .
So have you seen the trailer yet for The Golden Compass ?
If not then here it is below :
Until I saw the trailer I ’d never heard of the books the movie is based on — a trilogy called His Dark Materials — and the first time I saw the trailer I wrote it off as a Chronicles of Narnia wannabe .
The only reason I might have had for seeing it in theaters is that Courtney was very excited about the movie .
As it turns out , though , I may have to go see it out of my own curiosity now that I ’ve learned that the books have a somewhat anti-organized religion tone to them and are written by an avowed atheist .
It seems the movie has been a cause of concern for our good friend and Catholic League president , Bill Donohue , prompting him to put out a press release advising parents not to take their kids to see the film :
“ New Line Cinema and Scholastic Entertainment have paired to produce ‘ The Golden Compass , ’ a children ’s fantasy that is based on the first book of a trilogy by militant English atheist Philip Pullman .
The trilogy , His Dark Materials , was written to promote atheism and denigrate Christianity , especially Roman Catholicism .
The target audience is children and adolescents .
Each book becomes progressively more aggressive in its denigration of Christianity and promotion of atheism :
The Subtle Knife is more provocative than The Golden Compass and The Amber Spyglass is the most in - your - face assault on Christian sensibilities of the three volumes .
“ Atheism for kids .
That is what Philip Pullman sells .
It is his hope that ‘ The Golden Compass , ’ which stars Nicole Kidman and opens December 7 , will entice parents to buy his trilogy as a Christmas gift .
It is our hope that the film fails to meet box office expectations and that his books attract few buyers .
We are doing much more than hoping — we are conducting a nationwide two - month protest of Pullman ’s work and the film .
To that end , we have prepared a booklet , ‘ The Golden Compass : Agenda Unmasked , ’ that tears the mask off the movie .
“ It is not our position that the movie will strike Christian parents as troubling .
Then why the protest ?
Even though the film is based on the least offensive of the three books , and even though it is clear that the producers are watering down the most despicable elements — so as to make money and not anger Christians — the fact remains that the movie is bait for the books .
To be specific , if unsuspecting Christian parents take their children to see the movie , they may very well find it engaging and then buy Pullman ’s books for Christmas .
That ’s the problem .
“ We are fighting a deceitful stealth campaign on the part of the film ’s producers .
Our goal is to educate Christians so that they know exactly what the film ’s pernicious agenda really is . ”
Wow , anything that gets Bill ’s panties in a bunch like that might be worth seeing , but as it turns out he ’s quite right that the filmmakers have toned down the anti-religious aspects of the story somewhat .
According to some folks it ’s been watered down a bit too much :
Northern Lights , the book which first introduced readers to Pullman ’s 12 - year - old heroine , Lyra , is as dear to its many fans as JRR Tolkien ’s Lord of the Rings and JK Rowling ’s Harry Potter saga , so tampering with the philosophical content is not likely to be welcomed when the film is released before Christmas .
While Pullman himself has said he believes ‘ the outline of the story is faithful to what I wrote , given my knowledge of what they have done ’ , the National Secular Society – of which the author is an honorary associate – has now spoken out against the changes .
‘ It was clear right from the start that the makers of this film intended to take out the anti-religious elements of Pullman ’s book , ’ said Terry Sanderson , president of the society .
‘ In doing that they are taking the heart out of it , losing the point of it , castrating it .
It seems that religion has now completely conquered America ’s cultural life and it is much the poorer for it .
What a shame that we have to endure such censorship here too . ’
Kidman has said the critical stance of the film ‘ has been watered down a little … I was raised Catholic , the Catholic Church is part of my essence , ’ she told film journalists in Australia in the summer .
‘ I would n’t be able to do this film if I thought it were at all anti-Catholic . ’
…
At a preview of footage staged at the Cannes Film Festival in the spring , director Chris Weitz , best known for directing About A Boy , said the film would be a fair retelling of Pullman ’s tale .
‘ In the books the Magisterium is a version of the Catholic church gone wildly astray from its roots .
If that ’s what you want in the film , you ’ll be disappointed , ’ he admitted , but added : ‘ We have expanded the range of meanings of what the Magisterium represents .
Philip Pullman is against any kind of organised dogma whether it is church hierarchy or , say , a Soviet hierarchy . ’
That ’s disappointing to say the least , but as Bill Donahue points out there ’s always a chance some kids will be inclined to pick up the books after seeing the movies .
I ’ll have to make a point of picking them up myself as well .
The film is still causing enough concern among the Religious Right that several emails have been circulating around warning about its anti-Christian message .
The email is cropping up often enough that the folks at Snopes.com already have an entry on them on their site .
If nothing else it ’s nice to see the other side get a little representation every so often .
" I think relief is a word that springs to mind , " Hardie said .
The NSW Director of Public Prosecutions Nicholas Cowdery said in a statement that the Chaser team had carried out an examination of the area on September 5 , when police procedures had differed from those on September 6 , when the stunt occurred .
" The offence is one of strict liability .
Consequently , the defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact is available to the accused , " Mr Cowdery said .
" Put another way , it is a defence to establish , or to raise a reasonable doubt that there existed , an honest and reasonable but mistaken belief in a set of facts which , if they had existed , would have rendered the conduct innocent .
" In the cases of all 11 accused I am satisfied that on the evidence presently available the prosecution would not be able to negate , beyond reasonable doubt , the existence of an honest and reasonable ( but ultimately mistaken ) belief that they would not enter or be taken into the restricted area . "
The matters are listed for mention in the Local Court tomorrow , when the charges will be formally withdrawn .
Mr Cowdery said : " There is no reasonable prospect of conviction and for that reason the prosecutions should not proceed . "
" This is just a great relief , it 's a great weight off our shoulders that 's been hanging over us , " Chaser cast member Chris Taylor said .
The dropping of the charges would allow the comedy team to better focus on upcoming projects .
" We 'll now be in a position to block out the rest of diaries knowing a couple of us wo n't be serving time in a jail cell , " he said .
" We 'd been treading water until this matter has gone away .
" We 're looking at returning to the ABC in some form either by late this year or early next year . "
Taylor said the Chaser crew were especially happy charges had been dropped against people hired to be part of the APEC stunt who were not regular Chaser members .
" We always felt really bad for the other nine people who were either hard - working crew or just actors called in to play the role of an extra as a motorcade security guard . "
Taylor did not think the dropped charges would embolden the team to try more outlandish stunts .
" We were always surprised we got through the checkpoints , we thought we'd be stopped a lot earlier , " he said .
Eleven members of the team had faced charges of entering an APEC restricted area without justification .
The pranksters had driven a fake Canadian motorcade , flanked by bogus motorcycle and security guard escorts , through checkpoints to within metres of the hotel where US President George Bush was staying .
As part of the prank , Licciardello was dressed as Osama bin Laden .
The case was adjourned several times , and there had previously been speculation the charges would be dropped .
The director of ABC TV , Kim Dalton , said in a statement that the dropping of the charges proved that the stunt was a moment of great satire , not criminal behaviour .
" ABC TV welcomes the fact that the charges have been dropped , " he said .
" What was undeniably the greatest moment in political satire last year , which the ABC has always been very proud of , has been found to be just that - great political satire . "
A further paragraph at the bottom of the statement attributed to the Chaser appeared to indicate that Morrow and Licciardello counted themselves lucky .
" Today nine innocent people are feeling very relieved , and so are Chas and Julian , " the statement read .
The stunt won the award for best television moment at the MTV Australia Awards in Sydney at the weekend .
The Chaser 's Julian Morrow said he understood why the police wanted to push ahead with the prosecution but that he and the other members of the team were relieved about today 's decision .
While he did no regrets about the incident , Morrow said his main concern was " the other nine people just turned up to do their jobs ' ' .

In order to explain these patterns , it was sometimes argued that some bacteria have small genomes because there is selection for rapid cell division , with larger DNA contents taking longer to replicate and thereby slowing down the cell cycle .
However , when Mira et al. ( 2001 ) compared doubling time and genome size in bacteria that could be cultured in the lab , they found no significant relationship between them .
In other words , selection for small genome size is probably not responsible for the highly compact genomes of some bacteria , even though it seems plausible that , more generally , selection does prevent the accumulation of non-coding DNA to eukaryote levels in bacterial cells .
Mira et al. ( 2001 ) suggested a different interpretation that is based on two other major processes in evolution -- mutation and genetic drift .
In terms of mutation , they pointed out that on the level of individual changes that add or subtract relatively small quantities of DNA -- i.e. , insertions or deletions , or " indels " -- deletions tend to be somewhat larger than insertions .
The insertions in this case are separate from the addition of whole genes , which happens often in bacteria through sharing of genes among individuals or even across species ( " horizontal gene transfer " or " lateral gene transfer " ) or gene duplication .
In bacteria ( and eukaryotes ) small - scale deletions tend to involve more base pairs than insertions , creating a
" deletion bias " .
Of course , larger insertions such as of transposable elements or gene duplicates are
not part of this calculation as they add much more DNA at once .
From Mira et al. ( 2001 ) .
So , on the one hand , there are processes that can add genes ( duplication and lateral gene transfer ) , whereas in the absence of these processes , and if there are no adverse consequences to losing DNA ( i.e. , there is no selective constraint occurring ) , genomes should tend to get smaller as a result of this deletion bias .
In free - living bacteria , there are many opportunities for gene exchange , with lateral gene transfer adding DNA at an appreciable frequency .
Moreover , free - living bacteria tend to occur in astronomical numbers , and elementary population genetics reveals that selection will be strong under such conditions ( so that even a mildly deleterious mutation , such as a deletion or disruptive insertion , will probably be lost from the population over time ) .
Finally , free - living bacteria must produce their own protein products , and therefore tend to make use of all their genes , which places selective constraints on changes ( including indels ) in those sequences .
Endosymbiotic bacteria , especially those that live within the cells of eukaryote hosts , are different in multiple relevant respects .
First , they do not regularly encounter other bacteria from whom they can receive genes .
Second , they occur in drastically smaller numbers -- indeed , they experience a population bottleneck severe enough to shift the balance from selection to drift .
Third , they come to rely on some metabolites provided by the host and no longer make use of all their own genes .
These factors in combination mean that the selective constraints on many endosymbiont genes are relaxed , and the dominant processes become deletion bias and random drift .
Over many generations , endosymbiotic bacteria lose the genes they are not using ( and some that are only mildly constrained by selection , such is the strength of drift under such conditions ) due to deletion bias , and the end result is highly compact genomes .
Carsonella , a symbiont that lives within the cells of psyllid insects .
It contains only 159,662 base pairs of DNA and 182 genes , some of which overlap ( Nakabachi et al. 2006 ) .
The compaction of genomes in endosymbionts can be extreme .
The smallest genome known in any cellular organism ( except , perhaps , one in Craig Venter 's lab ) is found in the bacterial genus , a symbiont that lives within the cells of psyllid insects .
It contains only 159,662 base pairs of DNA and 182 genes , some of which overlap ( Nakabachi et al. 2006 ) .
Carsonella ( dark blue ) living within the cells and around the nucleus ( light blue ) of
a psyllid insect .
From Nakabachi et al. ( 2006 ) .
In some other bacteria , genes that are not used ( including non-functional duplicates ) may not be lost for some time and may persist as pseudogenes , just as are observed in large numbers in eukaryote genomes .
These tend to undergo additional mutations and to degrade over time but can still be recognized as copies of existing genes .
In Mycobacterium leprae , the pathogen that causes leprosy , for example , there are more than 1,100 pseudogenes alongside roughly 1,600 functional genes ( Cole et al. 2001 ) .
Its genome is about 1 million base pairs smaller than that of its relative M. tuberculosis , but clearly many of the inactive genes have not ( yet ) been deleted .
The two major influences on bacterial genomes : insertion of genes by duplication and lateral gene transfer ,
and the loss of non-functional sequences by deletion .
From Mira et al. ( 2001 ) .
It would be nice if this post could end there , having delivered a brief overview of an interesting issue in comparative genomics .
Sadly , there is more to say because some anti-evolutionists apparently have begun using the topic in a confused attempt to challenge evolutionary science .
In particular , though I note that I have become aware of this only second hand , some creationists apparently have suggested that all bacterial genomes are degrading and therefore that bacteria today are simpler than they were in the past , such that complex structures like flagella could not have evolved from less complicated antecedents .
It should be obvious that not all genomes are necessarily " degrading " just because there is a net deletion bias .
For starters , selective constraints prevent essential genes from being lost by this mechanism in most bacteria .
Furthermore , there exist well established mechanisms that can add new genes to bacterial genomes , including lateral gene transfer and gene duplication .
In fact , the rate of gene duplication seems to be related to genome size in bacteria ( Gevers et al. 2004 ) .
Also , as Nancy Moran noted in an email , " The most primitive bacteria were certainly simple , but they are not around or at least are not easily identified .
Many modern bacteria have large genomes and are very complex . "
Finally , the compact genomes of endosymbionts , such as in the aphid symbiont Buchnera aphidicola , tend to be more stable than the genomes of free - living bacteria in terms of larger - scale perturbations such as chromosomal rearrangements ( Silva et al. 2003 ) .

As of this writing , only a handful of states have formally resisted implementation of the draconian REAL - ID act , where the Feds create a de facto national ID card by hijacking the driver licensing agencies of all 50 states .
Despite the chilling " papers , please ! " overtones to this , some states are falling into line like so many obedient sheep , while the majority have resorted to sending the Department of Homeland Security a letter of intent to comply , which extends them another year or so of lead time before the mandate finally kicks in .
Of course that path only legitimizes the law , as opposed to standing up to the Feds and declaring the law the unconstitutional usurpation that it is .
DHS head Michael " Skeletor " Chertoff has made it clear that starting next year the residents of Montana , Maine , et al. will find it impossible to board an aircraft or enter a Federal building unless their state legislatures and governors cave in to his demands .
There is a third way , however .
It ’s simple , doable , and one that is guaranteed to stop REAL - ID in its tracks .
Every state can do it .
Its only drawback is that state governments will have to give up certain entrenched powers that they have arrogated to themselves for decades .
To stop REAL - ID , the states only have to get completely out of the drivers license business — by June of 2009 .
Libertarians have long lobbied for an end to state - mandated driver licensing .
Here is a new opportunity to put that idea back on the table .
After all , which is more important , rigid control over driver licensing , or the imposition of a biometric police - state national identity card ?
State legislatures , even those who are already on record opposing REAL - ID , could simply slip out from under the law ’s requirements by closing their licensing agencies for good , and either farming out certain functions to private - sector contractors , or eliminating them entirely .
States could take the lead in redefining what it means to have an " ID " in their state , as well as finding better solutions to controlling " problem " drivers ( the primary reason mandatory licensing was started to begin with ) .
Who knows what sorts of creative solutions may manifest when private citizens and entrepreneurs get in on the act ?
Meantime , any US citizen can certainly apply for a passport if they wish , and use that to board aircraft or enter government buildings .
Of course , the passport agency has been so overburdened with new applications since Jan 1st , with the Federal government ’s insistence that passports are now required to enter Canada and Mexico , it ’s hard to say how much farther they will fall behind in processing a new and even larger flood of applications in the wake of such state actions .
So it may be that they will have no choice but to allow people with more " creative " state IDs to fly until that long backlog can be handled — which could take years .
But any temporary inconvenience would be worth it to see the look on old " Skeletor ’s " face if every state told him : " Sorry Mike , but we no longer license drivers in our state , hence it is impossible for us to comply with the provisions of the REAL - ID Act . "
Even the majority of states who may loathe the Act but do n’t have the guts to confront the Feds directly could , in this passive - aggressive manner , express their independence and gut - level unwillingness to take part in the Bush administration ’s schemes to track us all , cradle to grave .
States may not like giving up that kind of power , but there ’s a long - term plus in that they will save a lot of taxpayer money , money that can either be used elsewhere , or simply given back .
The Best of Thomas Andrew Olson
The day after the International Atomic Energy Agency issued its latest report card on Iran 's nuclear program , the New York Times headlined its story : " Nuclear Agency Says Iran Has Used New Technology . "
The IAEA , David Sanger explained , had presented Iran with evidence that it was conducting experiments in manufacturing nuclear weapon .
At the end of second paragraph , he mentions that the report also stated that " Iranian officials had finally begun to answer a number of longstanding questions about its nuclear activities . "
But the IAEA , its report itself concludes , " has been able to continue to verify " that Iran is n't diverting nuclear material from nuclear energy to weapons research .
Though it can't give Iran a clean bill of nuclear heath " before reaching some clarity about the nature of the alleged studies . "
In other words , the Times portrayed the glass half - empty , while the IAEA , as reported by Reuters , presented it as half -- or even three - quarters -- full .
In a piece titled " Iran Says Work Plan Closed , U.S. Intelligence Fake , " Karin Strohecker wrote that " the IAEA said Iran had responded to questions and clarified issues raised in the context of the work plan struck in August , with the exception of alleged studies . "
But what 's with the " alleged studies " to which both the Times and Reuters refer ?
In 2005 , the Washington Post reported , a laptop computer was " allegedly stolen from an Iranian whom German intelligence tried , unsuccessfully , to recruit as an informant .
It was whisked out of the country by another Iranian . "
The purloined laptop wound up in the hands of the US , which exhibited it to the IAEA in Vienna .
A Times report read : " The Americans flashed on a screen and spread over a conference table selections from more than a thousand pages of Iranian computer simulations and accounts of experiments . "
They included " sophisticated drawings of a deep subterranean shaft .
. . consistent with a nuclear test - site schematic " and designs for a " facility to produce uranium gas [ which ] would give Iran a secret stock [ for ] fuel or for bombs . "
Most damining ( allegedly ) were " drawings on modifying Iran 's ballistic missiles in ways that might accommodate a nuclear warhead . "
But the IAEA was unimpressed .
" I can fabricate that data , " said one diplomat .
" It looks beautiful , but is open to doubt . "
Three years later , according to the AP , another diplomat with the IAEA still feels " much of it is of doubtful value . "
Other diplomat 's comments included , " Relatively insignificant " and " It 's not the amount , but the quality that counts . "
In Asia Times Online Kaveh Afrasiabi wrote that " even David Albright , a former weapons inspector [ and no friend of Iran ] admitted that ' so many pieces are missing ' in the US's allegations " about the laptop .
While yet another diplomat believed the US was acting in good faith , several more " suggested the U.S. was disingenuous in providing such a large amount of .
. . questionable information just days before ElBaradei was to complete his report . "
Iran barely had time to inspect the documents before the IAEA report was due to be released .
The initial reaction of Iran 's envoy to the International Atomic Energy Agency was " 100 percent fabricated and forged . "
Why the delayed release ?
At Informed Comment : Global Affairs , Farideh Farhi speculates that the Bush administration , " felt that the late release of these documents [ was all ] it had to keep the Iran file going . "
He wonders if we will face yet more haggling -- not over Iran 's nuclear program per se , but over documents " that no one ( except the Iranians ) seem to be sure .
. . are fake or not . "
Nicholas Burns , the outgoing undersecretary of state who 's been handling the Iran " dossier " ( as the erudite Afrasiabi always calls it ) , concurs .
He told Financial Times that , " I think this is going to be a drama that plays out well into 2009 and beyond . "
Everyone is exhausted with this drama , Farhi maintains , especially ElBaradei , who must feel " the need to move on after years of what under other circumstances would be considered successful interaction between his Agency and a member country . "
Perhaps making the same mistake as the mass media with the Bush administration , ElBaradei may be giving it the benefit of the doubt to avert any appearance of partisanship .
Like when he said , " A durable solution requires confidence about Iran 's nuclear program [ and among other things ] a regional security arrangement . "
To Afrasiabi , ElBaradei creates a " false linkage " by raising the specter of security .
It suggests that despite being verified as peaceful , its nuclear program continues to pose a regional security threat .
Still , Farhi writes , " I am sure some European governments and the Bush Administration will .
. . once again accuse ElBaradei [ of ] going beyond his technical mandate and talking about ways to overcome the deadlock politically . "
A Times editorial last fall embodied the prevailing view .
The key to ElBaradei's " credibility [ is ] his agency ’s clear scientific judgment .
Once he started making diplomatic deals , that judgment .
. . immediately becomes suspect . "
But , Farhi asks an equally key question : " In this day and age of failed policies should n't [ that ] be everyone 's mandate ? "
[ Emphasis added . ]
How then should the US and Europe react to a state whose nuclear weapon program may be in suspended animation , but which obviously still has lust in its heart for the bomb ?
The International Herald Tribune quotes a European diplomat , who maintains that " we should provide that little door that allows Iran to enter the long , long corridor toward the room where the negotiating table is -- without losing face . "
Another said , " The idea is that maybe a friend of Solana [ the European Union 's foreign policy chief ] meets a friend of Jalili [ Iran 's nuclear negotiator ] .
The two have tea and get their bosses together and they get someone else together . "
Meanwhile , the AP just reported that Iran is moving ahead with " new - generation centrifuges .
. . that can churn out enriched uranium at more than double the rate " of those they 're currently using .
In the face of the inevitability of Iran 's uranium enrichment , the New York Review of Books provided a forum for former statesmen William Luers and Thomas R. Pickering , and nuclear analyst Jim Walsh , to offer " A Solution for the US– Iran Nuclear Standoff . "
If only because , as one of the subtitles to the piece holds , " Iran Can Build and Use Centrifuges Faster Than We Can Impose Penalties or Controls . "
They propose that Iran 's nuclear activities be " jointly managed and operated on Iranian soil by a consortium including Iran and other governments . "
That 's not exactly music to the ears of those of us who are anti all - things - nuclear .
Not only is the authors ' acceptance of nuclear energy implicit , but they fail to suggest that the US enact a dramatic draw - down of its nuclear weapons .
But bear in mind that , in their minds , they 're " Choosing the Second - Best Alternative Instead of the Worst . "
In the interim , it looks like , even though there is n't much meat on it , the US will continue to gnaw on the Iran bone .
Let 's just hope we do n't crunch through and wind up with splinters in our mouth .

One picture tells the whole story .
It ’s a photo of five grim looking men in gray suits staring ahead blankly like they were in the dock with Saddam awaiting sentencing .
Every one of them looks downcast and dejected ; shoulders rounded and jaws set .
This is what desperation looks like , which is why the photo was kept off the front pages of the leading newspapers .
The group took no questions and , as far as the media was concerned , the meeting never happened .
But it did happen ; and it happened on Monday at the White House at 2 PM .
That ’s when President Bush convened the Working Group on Financial Markets , also known as the Plunge Protection Team , to explain their strategy for dealing with deteriorating conditions in the financial markets .
The details of the meeting remain unknown , but judging by the sudden ( and irrational ) recovery in the stock market on Tuesday ; their plan must have succeeded .
The Plunge Protection Team is a panel that includes Fed Chairman Ben Bernankee , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox , and acting Commodity Futures Trading Commission head Walter Lukken .
According to John Crudele of the New York Post , the Plunge Protection Team ’s ( PPT ) objective is to redirect the stock market by “ buying market averages in the futures market , thus stabilizing the market as a whole . ”
In the event of a terrorist attack or a natural disaster , the group ’s activities could play an extremely positive role in saving the market from an unnecessary meltdown .
However , direct intervention into supposedly “ free markets ” is less defensible when it is merely a matter of saving an over - leveraged banking system from its inevitable Day of Reckoning .
And , yet , that appears to be the reason for the White House confab ; to buy a little more time before the final explosion .
The psychology behind the PPT ’s activities is explained in greater detail by Robert McHugh Ph.D. who provides a description of how it works in his essay “ The Plunge Protection Team Indicator ” :
The PPT decides markets need intervention , a decline needs to be stopped , or the risks associated with political events that could be perceived by markets as highly negative and cause a decline , need to be prevented by a rally already in flight .
To get that rally , the PPT ’s key component — the Fed — lends money to surrogates who will take that fresh electronically printed cash and buy markets through some large unknown buyer ’s account .
That buying comes out of the blue at a time when short interest is high .
The unexpected rally strikes blood , and fear overcomes those who were betting the market would drop .
These shorts need to cover , need to buy the very stocks they had agreed to sell ( without owning them ) at today ’s prices in anticipation they could buy them in the future at much lower prices and pocket the difference .
Seeing those stocks rally above their committed selling price , the shorts are forced to buy — and buy they do .
Thus , those most pessimistic about the equity market end up buying equities like mad , fueling the rally that the PPT started .
Bingo , a huge turnaround rally is well underway , and sidelines money from Hedge Funds , Mutual funds and individuals ’ rushes in to join in the buying madness for several days and weeks as the rally gathers a life of its own .
The powers of the PPT are greatly exaggerated ; eventually the liquidity they provide has to be drained from the system .
The popular myth that the Fed simply creates as much money as it chooses and spreads it around like confetti ; is pure rubbish .
The Fed has very definite balance constraints .
The system is not quite as rigged as many people imagine .
According to Bloomberg News , the Fed has already depleted most of its resources :
“ The Fed has committed as much as 60 percent of the $ 709 billion in Treasury securities on its balance sheet to providing liquidity and opened the door to more with yesterday ’s decision to become a lender of last resort for the biggest Wall Street dealers . ”
The troubles in the credit markets and real estate are bigger than the Fed or the PPT ; and they know it .
The next step is massive government intervention ; mortgage - rate freezes , bailouts and fiscal stimulus .
Big government is back ; Reaganism has gone full - circle .
That does n’t mean that the PPT cannot have an important psychological affect in soothing jittery markets or stalling a system - wide collapse .
It just means , that markets will eventually correct regardless of what anyone does to stop them .
The sharp downturn in the financial markets is the result of unsustainable credit expansion that ca n’t be fixed by the parlor tricks of the PPT .
The rate at which financial institutions are deleveraging and destroying capital will inevitably trigger an economic crisis equal to the Great Depression .
What is needed is strong leadership and a re-commitment to transparency , not “ more of the same ” low interest crack and financial hanky - panky .
It ’s time to come clean with the public and admit we have a problem .
“ Sucker rallies ” , like Tuesday ’s 400 point surge on Wall Street just helps to conceal the deeply rooted problems that need to be addressed before investor confidence can be restored .
Blogger Rick Ackerman summed it up succinctly in his entry :
These psychotic , 400 - point rallies in the Dow do not augur renewed confidence .
They are being driven almost entirely by short - covering , and even the otherwise clueless news anchors are starting to dismiss them as meaningless .
One of these days , moments after the last surviving bear ’s short position has been liquidated , stocks are going to fall so steeply that even the Plunge Protection Team will call for back - up .
Then , the financial collapse that so many have been expecting will unfold in just a few days , with enough power to leave the global economy in ruins for a generation . ”
Whether Ackerman ’s dire predictions materialize or not , there ’s no denying that the situation is getting worse by the day .
In the last week alone , two major financial institutions , Carlyle Capital and Bear Stearns have either gone under or been bailed out wiping out tens of billions in market capitalization .
These flameouts have increased the rate of the deflation adding to the already prodigious losses from housing foreclosures , delinquent credit card debt , defaulting car loans , and the deleveraging in the hedge fund industry .
Fortress America has sprung a leak , and capital is escaping in a torrent .
“ One thing is for certain , we ’re in challenging times , ” Bush opined on Monday after meeting with his top economic aides .
“ But we are on top of the situation . ”
That ’s comforting .
Bush is all over it .
Tuesday ’s 75 basis point rate cut by the Fed is another sign of desperation .
The Fed Funds rate is now 2 percentage points below the rate of inflation ; a obvious attempt on Bernanke to reflate the equity bubble at the expense of the dollar .
Is that why Wall Street was so jubilant ; another savage blow to the currency ?
The Fed ’s statement was as bleak as any they have ever released sounding more like passages from the Book of the Dead than minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee :
Recent information indicates that the outlook for economic activity has weakened further .
Growth in consumer spending has slowed and labor markets have softened .
Financial markets remain under considerable stress , and the tightening of credit conditions and the deepening of the housing contraction are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters .
Inflation has been elevated , and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen … uncertainty about the inflation outlook has increased .
It will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully .
Today ’s policy action … should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity .
However , downside risks to growth remain .
Wall Street rallied on the cheery news .
Also , on Tuesday , the battered investment banks began posting first quarter earnings which turned out to be better than expected .
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. beat estimates which added to the stock market giddiness .
Unfortunately , a careful reading of the reports , shows that things are not quite as they seem .
The jubilation is unwarranted ; it ’s just more smoke and mirrors .
“ Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. reported a 57 % drop in fiscal first - quarter net income amid weakness in its fixed - income business , though results topped analysts ’ expectations . ”
The same was true of financial giant Goldman Sachs :
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ’s fiscal first - quarter net income dropped 53 % on $ 2 billion in losses on residential mortgages , credit products and investments … The biggest Wall Street investment bank by market value reported net income of $ 1.51 billion , or $ 3.23 a share , for the quarter ended Feb. 29 , compared to $ 3.2 billion , or $ 6.67 a share , a year earlier … .
Results included $ 1 billion in losses on residential mortgage loans and securities , and nearly $ 1 billion in losses on credit products and investment losses …
The bottom line is that both companies first quarter earnings dropped by more than a half in just one year alone while , at the same time , they booked heavy losses .
That ’s hardly a reason for celebration .
The major investment banks remain on the critical list because of the billions of dollars of toxic debt they still carry on their balance sheets .
Consider industry leader Goldman Sachs , for example , which is sitting on a backlog of bad paper from the subprime / securitization debacle as well as an unknown amount of LBOs ( Leveraged buyouts ) and commercial real estate deals ( CREs ) that are heading south fast .
Market analyst , Mark Gongloff , sheds a bit of light on the real condition of the big financials in his article “ Crunch Proves A Test of Faith For Street Strong ” :
All of the brokerage houses are highly leveraged , with a high ratio of assets to shareholders ’ equity , a sign they have used debt heavily to build up positions in hope of greater returns .
Morgan Stanley , which will report Wednesday , had a leverage ratio of 32.6 - to - 1 at the end of last year , nearly as high as Bear ’s 32.8 - to - 1. Lehman was leveraged 30.7 - to - 1 , and Merrill Lynch 27.8 - to - 1 .
And the would - be rock , Goldman ?
It was leveraged 26.2 - to - 1 . ”
Remember , Carlyle Capital was leveraged 32 to 1 ( $ 22 billion equity ) and went “ poof ” in a matter of days when it could n’t scrape together a measly $ 400 million for a margin call .
How vulnerable are these other maxed - out players now that the credit bubble has popped and the whole system is quickly unwinding ?
Not very safe , at all .
As Gongloff points out :
“ Based in part on numbers reported at the end of Bear ’s fourth quarter , estimated that Bear Stearns had $ 35 billion in liquid assets and borrowing capacity , enough to operate for 20 months .
Turns out it had enough for three days . ”
That ’s right ; three days and it was over .
Why would anyone think it will be different with these other equally - exposed banks ?
These institutions are basically insolvent now .
The Federal Reserve is just trying to prop them up to maintain appearances .
But it ’s a hopeless cause .
As hyper - inflated assets are downgraded ; structured investments and arcane hedges against default will continue to disintegrate and these profligate institutions will be crushed by a stampede of panicking investors .
The flight to safety has already begun .
Cash is king .
Look what has transpired just since Monday .
“ Crude oil , copper and coffee led the biggest decline ever in commodities on speculation that a U.S. recession will stall demand for raw materials . ”
All asset classes fall in a deflationary spiral , even commodities which many people thought would be spared .
Not so .
In fact , even gold has begun to retreat as hedge funds and other market participants are forced to relinquish their positions .
In other news , Reuters reports :
The yield on U.S. 3 - month Treasury bills fell below 1 percent on Monday to levels not seen in 50 years prompted by intense safety bids for cash spurred by the ongoing global credit crunch …
Investors were pulling money out of stocks and even the booming commodity market even after the Federal Reserve conducted a fresh round of measures over the weekend to alleviate the credit crisis .
Here ’s another example of the “ flight to safety ” as investors recognize the warning signs of deflation .
This trend is likely to intensify even though the Fed will continue to cut rates and real earnings on Treasuries will go negative .
In another report from Reuters :
The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index or VIX on Monday surged to its highest level in nearly two months as a fire sale of Bear Stearns and an emergency Federal Reserve cut in the discount rate reignited credit fears .
Doris Frankel , “ UPDATE 2 - VIX vaults over 30 at fresh 5 - year highs , ” Reuters , 17 March 2008 .
Fear is higher now than it has been in a long time .
Option traders are loading up on index puts in the Standard & Poor ’s 500 index .
The “ Fear Gage , as it is called , is soaring to new heights as credit problems continue to mount and business begins to slow to a crawl .
And , perhaps most important of all :
The cost of borrowing in dollars overnight rose by the most in at least seven years after the Federal Reserve ’s emergency cut in the discount interest rate stoked concern that credit losses are deepening ….
The London interbank offered rate , or Libor climbed 81 basis points to 3.86 percent , the British Bankers ’ Association said today .
It was the biggest increase since at least January 2001 .
The comparable pound rate rose 28 basis points to 5.59 percent , the largest gain since Dec. 31 , 2007 .
This may sound like technical gibberish geared for market junkies , but it is critical for understanding the gravity of what is really going on .
The Fed ’s rate cuts are not normalizing the lending between banks .
In fact , the situation is actually deteriorating quite quickly .
When banks do n’t lend to each other ( because they are worried about getting their money back ) the wheels of capitalism grind to a halt .
The banks are the essential conduit for providing credit to the broader economy .
If there ’s a slowdown in traffic , economic growth begins to slow immediately .
Presently , the banks are hoarding cash to cover the losses on their mortgage - backed investments and to shore up their skimpy capital reserves .
As a result , consumer spending is sluggish and GDP is beginning to shrink .
“ We know we ’re in a sharp ( decline ) , and there ’s no doubt that the American people know that the economy has turned down sharply ” , said Henry Paulson on NBC television on Sunday .
“ There ’s turbulence in our capital markets and it ’s been going on since August .
We ’re looking for ways to work our way through it . ”
No kidding .
But Paulson is clearly out of his depth .
He ’s simply not the man to deal with a crisis of this magnitude .
His only concern is bailing out his rich friends in the banking industry .
The interests of workers and consumers are just brushed aside .
Has anyone from the Dept of the Treasury ( or the Fed ) suggested a bailout for the 14,000 Bear Stearns employees who just lost not only their jobs but the entire retirement when the company was purchased by JP Morgan ?
Of course , not .
Because both Paulson and Bernanke take a class oriented approach to the problem that narrows their range of vision and limits their ability to pose viable remedies .
They are unable to see the whole playing field .
For example , Bernanke assumes that if he keeps cutting rates , he can reflate the equity bubble by stimulating consumer spending .
But that is not going happen .
First of all , the banks are not passing on the savings to customers .
And , second , the banks are only lending to applicants with a flawless credit history .
In other words , the Fed ’s cuts may be good for Bernanke and Paulson ’s buddies , but they do nothing for either the consumer or the broader economy .
Also , as Michael Hudson notes in his latest article the banks are taking the money they borrow from the Fed and investing it elsewhere :
This week the Fed tried to reverse the plunge in asset prices by flooding the banking system with $ 200 billion of credit .
Banks were allowed to turn their bad mortgage loans and other loans over to the Federal Reserve at par value ( rather at just 20 % “ mark to market ” prices ) .
The Fed ’s cover story is that this infusion will enable the banks to resume lending to “ get the economy moving again . ”
But the banks are using the money to bet against the dollar .
They are borrowing from the Fed at a low interest rate , and buying foreign euro - denominated bonds yielding a higher interest rate–and in the process , making a currency gain as the euro rises against dollar - denominated assets .
The Fed thus is subsidizing capital flight , exacerbating inflation by making the price of imports ( headed by oil and other raw materials ) more expensive .
These commodities are not more expensive to European buyers , but only to buyers paying in depreciated dollars .
The banksters are “ buying foreign euro - denominated bonds ” during an economic crisis in America ?
Whoa .
Now there ’s an interesting take on patriotism .
The Fed ’s strategy has even failed to lower mortgage rates which are pinned to the 30 - year Treasury and which has actually gone up since Bernanke began slashing rates .
This inability to pass on the Fed ’s rate cuts to potential mortgage applicants ensures that the housing meltdown will continue unabated well into 2009 and , perhaps , 2010 .
In the last few days , the Fed has provided $ 30 billion to buy up the least - liquid speculative debts of a privately - owned investment bank , Bear Stearns , which was leveraged at 32 to 1 and which will remain unsupervised by federal regulators .
How does that address the underlying issues of the credit crunch ?
Are Bernanke and Paulson really trying to put the financial markets back on solid footing again or are they merely expressing their bank - centered bias ?
That question was answered in an article on Tuesday in the Wall Street Journal which explained the real reasons behind the Bear bailout :
The illusion was shattered Saturday morning , when Mr. Paulson was deluged by calls to his home from bank chief executives .
They told him they worried the run on Bear would spread to other financial institutions .
After several such calls , Mr. Paulson realized the Fed and Treasury had to get the J.P. Morgan deal done before the markets in Asia opened on late Sunday , New York time .
‘ It was just clear that this franchise was going to unravel if the deal was n’t done by the end of the weekend , ’ Mr. Paulson said in an interview yesterday .
So all it took was a little nudge from his banking cohorts for Paulson to swing into action and firm up the deal .
That says it all .
The interests of the American people were never even considered .
It was all choreographed to bail out the financial industry .
No wonder so many people believe that the Federal Reserve and the US Treasury are merely an extension of the banking establishment .
The Bear bailout proves it .
SEATTLE ( Reuters ) - Warning of an economic " tailspin , " Starbucks Corp SBUX .
O outlined long - awaited plans to turn around its U.S. business on Wednesday , but details from new coffee machines to a rewards program for frequent customers failed to excite investors , who sent shares down 4 percent .
Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz talks to shareholders at the Starbucks Annual Shareholders meeting at McCaw Hall in Seattle , Washington March 19 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Marcus R. Donner
Chief Executive Howard Schultz told the company ’s annual meeting there was no “ silver bullet ” for fixing Starbucks , whose stock has dropped 40 percent over the last 12 months .
The company ’s blazing U.S. sales growth stalled in the most recent quarter , when a decline in traffic caused sales at domestic stores open at least 13 months to fall 1 percent -- the first quarterly fall in company history .
Schultz returned as chief executive in January , promising to change what he had called the “ commoditization ” of the brand , but John Langston , a senior analyst at Hodges Capital Management , said he did not hear anything that made him want to buy the stock again .
“ I did n’t really hear anything that blew my skirt up , ” he said .
Starbucks aims to woo consumers , who are rethinking their spending amid a broad economic downturn , by rolling out a new coffee blend , delving into energy drinks and investing in espresso equipment and high - end French presses .
It said it had bought ‘ Clover ’ French press maker Coffee Equipment Co .
Starbucks has long said its $ 3 to $ 5 coffee is an “ affordable luxury , ” but that assumption is being challenged because consumers are spending less on everything , from dining out to buying clothing , as home prices fall and the cost of necessities such as gas and fuel continue to rise .
“ We ’re an affordable luxury , but there are forces of nature here that we ca n’t control , ” Schultz told journalists .
He told investors : “ You have an economy that is really in a tailspin . ”
Earlier this year , Schultz said Starbucks would close 100 underperforming stores and cut its 2008 new store plan in the United States to 1,175 from 1,600 , while increasing the number of international store openings by 75 outlets to 975 .
Big shareholders were hoping for an update on those efforts , but the company did not comply .
The Seattle - based company is facing unprecedented economic pressures -- from lower consumer spending to high coffee and milk costs -- and Schultz did not see profit margins improving for the balance of the year .
He said the new turnaround plan offered solutions to “ reaffirm our coffee authority ” and make the chain feel less corporate .
For instance , Barista will be able to see customers over new low machines .

A new coffee blend is scheduled for an April debut and a Web site , wonder - struck , will allow customers to submit ideas to the company and to vote on them .
Under the reward program due to begin in mid-April , consumers who use the company ’s prepaid cards and register online can get free drip coffee refills and extras such as flavored syrup or soy milk , Starbucks said .
Meanwhile , competitors are nibbling away at different segments of the $ 25 billion - plus U.S. specialty coffee market that Starbucks carved out .
McDonald 's Corp MCD.N has aggressively entered the drip coffee market and plans to roll out more expensive espresso drinks .
Starbucks now has about 10,000 U.S. stores and some 5,000 international locations .
The brand has become such a part of mainstream life that some analysts say it is struggling to offer consumers something special .
Starbucks shares closed at $ 17.50 , down 74 cents or 4 percent on the Nasdaq .
In recent months the undeclared war in Iraq seems not to have been on the minds of most Americans .
News of the violence and deprivation which ordinary Iraqis are forced to deal with on a daily basis rarely makes it to the front pages .
Instead , we read in the newspapers numerous slanted stories about the how the surge is succeeding and reducing violence .
Never does anyone dare to discuss the costs of the war or its implications .
There are the direct costs of the war , the costs of maintaining bases , providing food , water , and supplies , which the administration vastly underestimated before embarking on their quest in Iraq .
These costs run into the tens of billions of dollars per month , and I shudder to think what the total direct costs will add up to when we finally pull out .
Then there are the opportunity costs , those which decision makers in Washington almost never discuss .
Imagine that the war in Iraq had never happened , and the hundreds of billions of dollars we have spent so far were still in the hands of taxpayers and businesses .
How many jobs could have been created , how much money could have been saved , invested , and put to productive use ?
Unfortunately , it appears too many policymakers in Washington still cling to the broken window fallacy , long since discredited by the 19th century French economist Frederic Bastiat , that destruction is a good thing because jobs are created to rebuild what is destroyed .
This pernicious fallacy is unfortunately widespread in our society today because those in positions of power and influence only recognize what is seen , and ignore what is unseen .
Running a deficit of hundreds of billions of dollars per year in order to fund our misadventure is unsustainable .
Eventually those debts must be repaid , but this country is in such poor financial shape that when our creditors come knocking , we will have little with which to pay them .
Our imperial system of military bases set up in protectorate states around the world is completely dependent on the continuing willingness of foreigners to finance our deficits .
When the credit dries up we will find ourselves in a dire situation .
Americans will suffer under a combination of confiscatory taxation , double - digit inflation , and the sale of massive amounts of land and capital goods to our foreign creditors .
The continuation of the war in Iraq will end in disaster for this country .
Parallels between the Roman Empire and our own are numerous , although our decline and fall will happen far quicker than that of Rome .
The current financial crisis has awakened some to the perils that await us , but solutions that address the root of the problem and seek to fix it are nowhere to be found .
There must be a sea change in the attitudes and thinking of Americans and their leaders .
The welfare - warfare state must be abolished , respect for private property and individual liberties restored , and we must return to the limited - government ideals of our Founding Fathers .
Any other course will doom our nation to the dustbin of history .

One nicotine - craven gearhead has crafted a model of the most exclusive of Raging Bulls out of nothing but cigarette boxes .
Even with the enormous taxes governments place on tobacco products , we doubt the model Reventon approaches the $ 1.5 million cost of the real thing .
It might not be enough to make Marlboro rethink which Italian supercar - maker it ’s sponsoring , but it would sit perfectly in a model garage next to the F1 car made out of matchsticks on which we reported previously .

5. Diamond - Encrusted Car ~ $ 140,000
A diamond encrusted Hot Wheels car sits on display at the Mattel offices in New York , February 15 , 2008 .
This one - of - a - kind car , the most expensive in Hot Wheels history , was made to commemorate the production of the 4 billionth Hot Wheels vehicle .
The diamonds on the custom - made jeweled car , valued at $ 140,000 , total more than 2,700 and weigh nearly 23 carats in total weight .
The car is cast in 18 - karat white gold with the majority of the vehicle detailed with micro pave - set brilliant blue diamonds , mimicking the Hot Wheels Spectraflame blue paint .
Under the functional hood , the engine showcases additional micro pave - set white and black diamonds .
The Hot WheelsÂ® flame logo found on the underbelly of the car is lined with white and black diamonds .
Red rubies are set as the tail lights , while black diamonds and red enamel create the â€œred lineâ€ tires .
The custom - made case that houses the jewel - encrusted vehicle also holds 40 individual white diamonds , signifying each year in the legacy of Hot Wheels .
The real one ( this Mercedes SL ) was spotted at an auto show overseas .
From a distance , it almost appears that the car is coated in glitter , but it is actually covered in diamonds .
I wo n’t speculate on the value , but you can bet that this is n’t a car just anyone will turn up in .

Sen .
John McCain served his nation with honor in Vietnam , and he is right to be proud of his service .
But by hedging on whether he will support a “ GI Bill for the 21st Century , ” he is casting doubt on his own commitment to the newest generation of American heroes .
The Post - 9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act , sponsored by Sens. Jim Webb ( D - Va. ) and Chuck Hagel ( R - Neb . ) , will restore the promise of a cost - free education to those who serve in the military .
The original GI Bill transformed American history , providing education for returning soldiers .
The GI Bill not only recognized our nation ’s moral duty for the enormous sacrifices of our World War II veterans , but it helped create America ’s middle class and spurred decades of economic growth for our country .
Economists estimate that the original bill returned anywhere between $ 5 and $ 13 for every dollar we spent on it .
But the original GI Bill has become woefully outdated , to the point where the average benefit does n’t even cover half the cost of an in - state student ’s education at a public college .
The Post - 9/11 Veterans
Act , which has an estimated cost between $ 2.5 billion and $ 4 billion , is common - sense legislation .
With 51 cosponsors , including nine Republicans , the three other Vietnam War veterans in the Senate and former Secretary of the Navy John Warner , the bill simply updates what the late historian Stephen Ambrose called “ the best piece of legislation ever passed by the U.S. Congress . ”
Yet , faced with unprecedented filibusters , it needs 60 cosponsors .
As de facto leader of the party , McCain could signal to other Republicans to sign on to the bill and assure passage .
Instead , McCain has said he has n’t had time to read the bill and is n’t sure if he could support it .
It ’s hard to believe that neither he nor anyone on his staff has had time to read such an important bill , which has been around since before he started running for president .
But , even if true , McCain must do the right thing now , when his leadership is needed .

Our newest veterans are struggling .
Jason Bensley , an Iraq war veteran from Southern California , receives $ 650 a month from the current GI Bill for his education .
Bensley , who served in southern Iraq , Mosul and Diyala province , is in debt , trying to pay for college .
“ I would n’t have the faintest idea why a member of Congress would n’t want to support the GI Bill , ” he says .
“ Sen. McCain should know how hard it is for veterans to transition back into civilian life . ”
The White House has voiced concern on the bill , arguing that if returning troops are offered a good education , they will choose college over extending their service .
This is as offensive as it is absurd .
First , it is morally reprehensible to fix the system so that civilian life is unappealing to service members , in an attempt to force them to re-up .
Education assistance is not a handout , it is a sacred promise that we have made for generations in return for service .
Second , falling military recruitment numbers are just as serious as retention problems .
To send the message that this nation will not help you make the most of your life will dissuade a large number of our best and brightest from choosing military service over other career options .

McCain has made it a point to remind audiences that service to one ’s nation is bigger than one ’s self .
Indeed , there is nothing more noble than risking your life for your country .
Every day , Americans are doing just that , as they serve longer and more frequent deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan .
But just because our service members are selfless does not mean they deserve to be left to fend for themselves as they return home and try to make a better life .
Indeed , as much as his service to America is responsible for making McCain who he is today , America ’s service to him played an invaluable role too .
McCain should remember that and sign on to the “ GI Bill for the 21st Century . ”
Saudi women are subject to strict sex segregation laws
The woman was initially punished for violating laws on segregation of the sexes - she was in an unrelated man 's car at the time of the attack .
When she appealed , judges doubled her sentence , saying she had been trying to use the media to influence them .
Her lawyer has been suspended from the case and faces a disciplinary session .
Abdel Rahman al - Lahem told the BBC Arabic Service that the sentence was in violation of Islamic law :
" My client is the victim of this abhorrent crime .
I believe her sentence contravenes the Islamic Sharia law and violates the pertinent international conventions , " he said .
" The judicial bodies should have dealt with this girl as the victim rather than the culprit . "
The lawyer also said that his client would appeal against the decision to increase her punishment .
Segregation laws
According to the Arab News newspaper , the 19 - year - old woman was gang - raped 14 times in an attack in Qatif in the eastern province a year - and - a - half ago .
Seven men were found guilty of the rape and sentenced to prison terms ranging from just under a year to five years .
The victim and attackers are from Saudi Arabia 's Shia minority .
Being a Muslim , I think it 's a big injustice done to the girl .
If the court doubled the sentence of the girl then they should have given death penalty to the rapists
Asfandyar
Saudi Arabia
Readers react in numbers
The rapists ' sentences were also doubled by the court .
Correspondents say the sentences were still low considering the rapists could have faced the death penalty .
The rape victim was punished for violating Saudi Arabia 's laws on segregation that forbid unrelated men and women from associating with each other .
She was initially sentenced to 90 lashes for being in the car of a strange man .
On appeal , the Arab News reported that the punishment was not reduced but increased to 200 lashes and a six - month prison sentence .
' Personal views '
Mr Lahem accused the court of letting personal views influence its decision .
" It seems that the sentence was influenced by the fact that the woman escalated the issue with her lawyer and also with the supreme judicial authorities , " he said .
" This is astonishing because justice is supposed to be independent from all pressures as well as personal considerations , be it a feeling towards the lawyer or defendant herself , " he added .
The Arab News quoted an official as saying the judges had decided to punish the girl for trying to aggravate and influence the judiciary through the media .
Mr Lahem said that the judges ' decision to confiscate his licence to work and stop him from representing his client is illegal .
A former Goldman Sachs associate who was accused of masterminding one of the broadest insider - trading conspiracies in years was sentenced on Thursday to nearly five years in prison .
Eugene Plotkin , 28 , a Harvard graduate who dabbled in filmmaking and ballroom dancing , was sentenced to four years and nine months by a federal district judge in Manhattan .
The sentence was the minimum under a plea agreement .
Mr. Plotkin ’s arrest in April 2006 was the first of a number of insider - trading cases brought by federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission that year and 2007 .
But none matched the scheme involving Mr. Plotkin , a fixed - income associate at Goldman , and a former co-worker , David Pajcin .
Their plans involved a former Merrill Lynch analyst , a New Jersey postal worker who served on a grand jury , two workers at a magazine printing press and an exotic dancer .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The State Department will renew its contract with Blackwater to provide security in Iraq , Greg Starr , acting assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security , said Friday .
An woman passes a burnt car in a Baghdad neighborhood where Blackwater guards killed 17 in September .
No provisions have been added to the contract , Starr said , but Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice ordered several changes to procedure after a September incident in which Blackwater guards shot and killed 17 people , including women and children .
The incident placed the operations of Blackwater and other security firms under scrutiny in Iraq , where an estimated 25,000 private contractors protect diplomats , reconstruction workers and government officials .
Under a provision instituted in the early days of the U.S. - led occupation of Iraq , security contractors have immunity from Iraqi law .
The five - year State Department contract , which began in 2006 , must be renewed every year and is up for renewal next month .
Starr said , in effect , Blackwater 's contract will roll over for another year .
Blackwater is one of three contractors working under a " task order " to provide security services in Iraq .
The other two are Triple Canopy and DynCorp .
An agreement , or memorandum of understanding , between the State Department and U.S. military calls for a higher level of coordination and supervision of contractors , Starr said .
Blackwater still has to work under the rules of the Iraqi government , he said .
The FBI is in charge of the U.S. investigation of the September incident , in which survivors and victims ' family members said Blackwater guards started shooting unprovoked .

Blackwater said its employees were returning fire after coming under attack from armed insurgents , but an Iraqi investigation called the killings " premeditated murder . "
Starr said the U.S. government , in particular U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker , will take a close look at the FBI 's investigation report and then " decide whether it is consistent with U.S. goals and policies to continue the contract . "
He said it will be important to see whether the FBI finds Blackwater itself criminally responsible , or merely a few of its employees .
" We can terminate contracts for the convenience of the government if we have to , " he said .
" I am not going to prejudge what the FBI is going to find in its investigation .
It 's complex .
I think the U.S. government needs protective services . "
Starr said he did have some concern about the reaction of the Iraqi government and people .
But he noted that there have been only three additional " escalation of forces " incidents since the new rules of engagement .
" I am up to this point very satisfied with the changes we have seen , " he said .
" Essentially I think they do a very good job .
The September 16 incident was a tragedy , it needs to be investigated carefully .
The results of that will come out of that eventually and we will decide how we will proceed . "
Blackwater spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell declined to comment , referring all questions to the State Department .

Cracked.com super editor Jack O'Brien called for a staff meeting at the Cracked house .
I hate staff meetings .
Usually it 's " Stop stealing from the company " this and " Leave Hannah Montana alone " that .
Christ .
If I had a dime every time Jack called a meeting to tell me to keep my pants on at work or to stop reading his mail , well , then I would n't have to steal from the company so much .
I 'd have all those dimes .
Jack assured me , however , that this particular meeting had nothing to do with my various indiscretions .
" Not to say that I do n't disapprove of your indiscretions , " Jack added when he saw me start loosening my belt , " because I do .
It 's just that we 're not going to talk about them at this particular meeting . "
Seeing as I 'm not really accustomed to attending meetings that do n't directly address my frequent and shameless pantslessness , I had no idea what to expect .
What could the meeting be about ?
Was Gladstone retiring ?
Is Swaim too racist ?
Is Bucholz not racist enough ?
What about Ross 's beard ?
Was this meeting going to be about Ross 's beard ?
I always felt that discourse regarding Ross 's beard was tragically absent on Cracked , and I was thrilled with the idea that we would finally address the issue .
When I arrived at what I assumed would be the beard event of the season , Jack was ready to speak .
" Guys , thanks for coming .
You 're all probably wondering why I called this meeting . "
I was n't .
It was Ross 's beard .
I could just feel it .
" I just figured I 'd let you all to know that Cracked.com was named an Honoree for the 12th Annual Webby Awards in the category of Humor . "
A couple of the interns clapped .
Personally , I do n't exactly know what kind of nerd bullshit a " Webby " is , but I do know that awards , in general , are cool as corndogs , ( which is to say , very ) .
I could only hope that a Webby was n't one of those embarrassing awards .
Would this be a prestigious award , like a Best Actor Oscar , or one of those lame , pointless dipshit awards , like a Best Actress Oscar ?
My immediate concern was whether or not I could use my new status as an award - winner to do some good in this world .
As I 'm sure youâre all aware , " doing good in this world " translates to " porking supermodels like crazy " in my book .
Because , folks , I made a promise ( below ) .
I got into the internet comedy business for one reason : Boning supermodels .
That promise is as true today as it was when I made it , when I was twelve years old and I first discovered supermodels , boning and the internet .
( It was a big year . )
Jack spoke up again .
" That 's basically all I had , but if anyone has any questions - "
My hand shot up immediately .
My middle finger , to be specific , but whatever .
" I 've got a question .
How many supermodels , on average , do you think I 'll be able to bone a month as a result of this award ?
A whole bunch , or just a lot ? "
" No , you misunderstand , " Jack explained .
" We did n't win , anything . "
" Yet , " I corrected with a wink .
" At all , " Jack said .
" Yet . "
Another correction , another wink .
" No , I mean we do n't have a chance of winning .
We 're honorees . "
I nodded , to present the image that I was listening instead of thinking about railing all those freakin supermodels .
What I did gather from what Jack said was that the amount of supermodels I 'd be plowing would rank somewhere in the high - to - superhigh buttloads , which would be just fine with me .
Webbys are awards given out for websites and bloggers that are outstanding in terms of either content or design or both .
For the Webby awards , you can either be an honoree or a nominee .
Being an honoree , which is what we are , means absolutely nothing .
It 's kind of meaningless , actually , " Jack explained .
I still did n't quite understand , but I find that happens often when I do n't pay attention .
" It means we were n't funny enough to be nominated , but we 're , I guess , slightly funnier than other websites , " Bucholz clarified , because he 's the only Cracked Blogger who actually knows anything .
" I mean , the Webby 's wanted us to know that they 're aware of our existence , but , and I can't stress this enough , we 're not funny enough to be even considered for an award .
We 're basically not funny enough to lose . "
This must be a joke .
" Are you pulling my leg , Bucholz , " I screamed .
" Do n't you lie to me .
Do n't shit in my toaster and tell me it's a pop tart . "
Bucholz lowered his eyes , so to suggest that he was n't , in fact , shitting in my toaster .
" Jaxaphone , you chump , did you seriously call a meeting to tell us we do n't even stand a chance of winning some award ?
Some stupid nerd award for jerks ? "
He nodded .
" God Dammit .
I can't believe I got up early to be at this meeting . "
" It 's four in the afternoon , " Gladstone pointed out .
" And you were three and a half hours late , " Swaim added .
But it was too late .
I 'd already left the house and started keying Jack 's stupid car .
Now , you 're all probably wondering " If the laughter - and - orgasm - inspiring comedy juggernaut that is Cracked .com did n't get nominated in the humor category , who did ? "
Well , I 'm glad you asked , weak literary device .
The Webby nominations are n't just for your run -of - the - mill comedy sites like Cracked , ( which , I should mention is updated every single day with original content ) .
No , it takes a special kind of comedic genius to be nominated for a Humor Webby .
Someone funny , yet smart .
Someone edgy , and fresh .
Someone that manages to be consistently funny yet still culturally relevant .
For example , I Can Haz Cheezburger , a site that was nominated for a Webby this year .
And with good reason , too .
Allow me to dissect the delicate nuances of ICHC 's comedy .
See , they take pictures of cats doing things , ( or alternately , not doing things ) , and they put words on the pictures .
Words that are n't spelled the way they ought to be spelled , as evidenced in the very title of the site .
( " Has " is spelled with an " s " in real life .
Not a " z. "
Laughing yet ? )
Honestly , how can Cracked possibly compete with the comedic brilliance over at Cheezburger ?
We barely have any cats at all !
Wait , are you still reading this blog despite the fact that I just pointed out a humor website that is clearly superior to us ?
Maybe I was n't clear on the art of their comedy .
Let 's start over .
See , they take pictures , and then they put captions on them .
There are a bunch of picture of cats with words on them , and this website is just loaded with them .
There 's , like , a thousand fucking pages of these fucking cats , right ?
And they 've all got captions , like " Im a cat doin sum stupid shit all the tyme . "
It 's pretty high brow , so do n't beat yourself up if you do n't think it 's funny .
You just have to trust me that it is funny .
You might not think it 's funny , ( specifically , because when you look at the pictures you do n't laugh ) , but you 'd be wrong .
It 's very funny .
For a slightly more authoritative opinion , you can turn to Aristotle 's Four Elements of Comedy .
This book , thought by many to be " the definitive dissertation on comedy , " ( while considered by some skeptics to be " totally made up " ) , focuses two whole chapters on the brilliant and subtle humor of merging cats and illiteracy .
Dude was way ahead of his time .
If you 're not rolling on the floor laughing right now due to the content over at Cheezburger , ( why not ?
Lol ! ) , there are other Webby nominees for your viewing pleasure .
After all , posting pictures of cats is n't the only way to get a Webby nomination , just ask fellow nominee Rathergood.com , a site that claims to be " Your One Stop Shop for Good and Evil Kittens . "
Wait , I typed that sentence before I actually read it .
Is this another fucking site about fucking cats doing stupid shit ?
Hold on one second .
...
Holy crap , it isâ ¦Uh , no problem , no problem with that at all .
Truth be told , pictures of cats are the only things on the planet that are actually funny .
Everything else is chimp excrement , plain and simple .
Do n't get me wrong .
I mean , I was aggravated when I heard that we did n't get a nomination .
I 've spent a year with this site .
We 've had compelling social commentary , wildly popular videos , and articles that challenge the lies you were taught in high school .
So yes , I was a little pissed when we did n't get a nomination .
But now that I 've seen our competition , I do n't feel so bad .
Clearly , we were beaten by the best .
It 's like we entered a painting contest and we were beaten by DaVinci , or perhaps , by someone who'd taken one of DaVinci 's paintings and written a bunch of misspelled words on it .
Palestinian gunmen blew up a monument in a British - run cemetery for foreign soldiers in the Hamas - controlled Gaza Strip on Thursday , witnesses and British diplomats said .
Witnesses said gunmen blew up the two - meter ( 6.5 - foot ) high stone monument in Britain 's Gaza War Cemetery in central Gaza .
No group claimed responsibility for the attack .
A statement issued by the British Consulate General in Jerusalem said the Gaza War Cemetery contains graves of British and other foreign soldiers who were killed in conflicts in the region from as early as World War One .
Many tombstones in the graveyard are marked with a cross or star of David , indicating that both Christians and Jews were buried there .
" The history of this region is complex .
But the right of the dead to lie in peace and dignity is simple and should be respected by all , " the statement said .
" We hope that the authorities in Gaza will make every effort to apprehend those responsible . "
Mohammed Awaja , the cemetery 's caretaker who lives nearby , said he heard the explosion .
" We had no idea that it was in the cemetery until two hours later when we discovered the explosion had blown up the monument , " he said .
Hamas security forces , which seized control of the coastal territory in June after routing Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas ' Fatah forces , said they were investigating the incident .

I find it odd that the NM totals that have been up for most of the day ( Feb. 6 ) on CNN.com show 66,173 for Clinton and 65,963 for Obama ( 98 % reporting ) , which gives a difference of 210 votes , while the latest Statewide Totals from the NM Democratic Party ( http://www.nmdemocrats.org/ht/display/ReleaseDetails/i/1129743) released at 8:28 PM MST ( 183 of 184 precincts reporting ) show Clinton with 66,278 versus 65,243 for Obama ( a difference of 1,035 votes ) .
I have n't been following the count at this site except to compare it now to the numbers I 've been seeing for hours from CNN .
Does this latest update reflect the ballots that were kept under questionable watch ?
And how is it that the more recent count actually shows less votes for Obama than were reported earlier ( at least by CNN ) ?
I 'm wondering whether or not the Statewide Totals include the Absentee Ballot Totals ( currently shown as 1,643 for Clinton versus 1,586 for Obama ) ?

The CNN exit poll also does not agree with the results reported so far :
http://www.cnn.com/ELECT.../epolls/index.html#NMDEM
The exit poll shows women , who made up 56 % of the voters , split evenly 47 % to 47 % for Clinton and Obama .
The exit poll also shows that men , who were 44 % of the voters , voted in favor of Obama 53 % to 39 % for Clinton .
Doing the simple math on these numbers gives Obama 49.6 % versus 43.5 % for Clinton , or roughly a 6 % margin in favor of Obama .
I suppose a draw or slight edge for Clinton may still be within the margin of error for this exit poll ?

You must add those absentee totals to the Statewide total to get the number of votes reported thus far .
The last precinct still unreported was the precinct in Rio Rancho where about 6000 people showed up to vote .
I voted at that precinct first thing and it already had a line .
But later in the after ( roughly 3 pm it was already a 2 hour wait .
By the time 5 pm rolled around it was a 3 hour wait . )

here is the short list of suspicious , unexplained developments ......
( plan on doing a comprehensive fact gathering post on this potential scandal , and big , big thans to the BB , for your invaluable efforts , also beginning to monitor fight the net operation against obama ? ) - after Obama stuns in conservative caucus state Iowa - he loses in more progressive state New Hampshire when pre election polls showed him with a significant lead - he is doing better in caucuses than states with the nasty secret vote counting devices - he wins alot of states on super tuesday in the south and midwest , the only way Clinton can keep up is to take the largest states , and walla , she does !
NY and CA - when hours before the vote in CA a Rueters / C - span / Zogby poll showed
Obama up 49 - 36 !
with 3 % margin of error , those threee organizations that did the poll are highly reputable - over 700,000 votes in LA alone may not have been counted because of a new butterfly ballot the double bubble ( I 'll put links to all this in a new vote manipulation clues post ) - and AGAIN after Obama wins more conservative states in the south and midwest , he loses California ?
after high powered endorsements from Oprah , Ethel Kennedy and even California 's First Lady !
- and finally a Hispanic newspaper man on NPR today made sure to point out , he was baffled and never saw before the Hispanic vote doing different things , going contrasting ways in different states , ( I 'll try to find out what he was referring to , I either missed it or he did not elaborate )

Yesterday , my mother and I went to vote at 4 : PM at the Adobe Acres Elementary School .
The parking lot next to the building was blocked off which was a problem because I 'm using a walker due to a foot injury .
I ignored the fence and went around to park in the Handy Cap parking area anyway .
Only two were available and thank God my Mother has a HC parking pass so we were legal .
We both went inside and were informed that there were two lines .
One for last names beginning with the letters A - L and the other line for last names beginning with the letters M - Z .
Whomever thought of this bright idea needs to resign because the M - Z line was at least twice as long .
After waiting 5 minutes it was apparent we would not be able to vote for at least 2 hours .
Unable to stand on my injured foot for that duration it was apparent that I had to leave .
Before we left I complained to an official and told him their " system " was not working .
He replied that he knew it and they were trying to do the best they could .
Because I was unable to vote I have now entered the ranks of disenchanted voters , there are millions of us .

An Undemocratic Election : Taos County Precinct 21
What Tommy Tafoya does n’t want you to know about the precinct election
in Talpa : Twenty four of the 67 ballots cast at the Precinct 21 election in
Talpa had the first name written on the ballot crossed out and a different
name entered .
Only 3 of those 24 had matching handwriting for both names written on
the ballot .
For the other 21 ballots , one person wrote the name on the
ballot - and then someone else crossed that off and wrote in a different
name .
Sixteen of the twenty - four changed ballots were written in the same
handwriting .
Six names did not appear on the voter rolls , but voted in the election
anyhow .
Of those , two were registered to vote in a different precinct ,
and three were not registered as Democrats .
A challenge to this crooked election was blocked from even being heard
at the Credentials Committee meeting .
( the pictures of the forged ballots appear to be gone from that post , but they are available elsewhere )

As far as polls being wrong or off the mark from the results , that is a good thing .
People should n't be swayed by polls but should make a decision on their own , using their brain .
Thats a major problem with caucus ' .
You may vote a certain way just to be able to sit or stand in line with your buddy and of course , you do n't want to be accused of being racist or sexist .
As far as voter rolls go , here in Florida , purging of voter rolls is still going on and we had 1.5 million voters choose a candidate , only to be told by our own party that we are n't being counted .
Thats one and a half MILLION votes .
As far as candidates not campaigning here , we saw plenty of Obama commercials on TV here .
The date of the primary was moved by our Republican Legislature .

Re : " Why should any party official who has endorsed a candidate be allowed to take home ballots ? "
No one , regardless of whether they are political or not , is EVER allowed to take home ballots !!!
Furthermore , it is against ALL ballot handling procedures for there EVER to be only one person in possession of ballots .
Those NM ballots need to be investigated for having been altered , and the person who took them home needs to go to jail .
NM ( and the rest of the country , for that matter ) now finds itself in a situation in which the right of the voters who cast their votes on those ballots has to be weighed against the integrity of the ballots .
No matter what NM decides to do with the ballots , at least one individual needs to go to jail .

Dear Mr. Brad ... this is the first time I have ever posted , but you talk about election fraud .
At one of the other sites they made a big thing about the support for obama at southern Minnesota .
Well why not .
Did you know it was a caucus and how they are manipulated .
Well in all the polls Hillary lead obama up to the next day after the voting .
So why did n't all the people who supported Hillary get to vote , senior citizens .
For the first time in caucusing , the DFL combined the places to caucus .
Some people showing up to the caucus found they had been moved some as far as 50 miles away .
And they did n't know .
No transportation either , remember this is rural MN and if you do n't have a car you are out of luck .
This is just one of the crooked , ways some of these caucus were manipulated for obama .
Who showed up the young bunch with cars .
Seniors did n't have a chance .

Why are people getting so overheated about this ?
Delegates are divided based on the proportional vote and the difference between Obama getting another 200 votes or Clinton getting another 200 votes in terms of delegates is not huge .
You really think Clinton supporters would violate the law to get one lousy delegate ?

It is highly inaccurate to say that 17,000 people were thrown off the voting rolls and forced to use provisional ballots .
I 've talked with and heard from many caucus site managers and volunteers and the main problems were with people showing up to vote who were n't registered Democrats or who were at the wrong voting place because the precinct locations were different from their normal polling places .
Many people used provisionals in the Chama area up north because of a snow emergency that resulted in people unable to get to the other sites and everyone voting at a centralized site at the last minute .
Also , many provisionals were used to allow people to vote at the Roundhouse in Santa
Fe where our 30 - day legislative session is currently ongoing .
They were used by legislators , staff members and others who work there during the session .
There were some problems with the lists and this needs to be researched and fixed , but most of the provisional ballots were given out for other reasons .
I think it 's wrong to exaggerate and claim that 17,000 people were thrown off the voter rolls .
Moreover , the provisionals will be carefully vetted and counted based on negotiations between attorneys for both the Clinton and Obama campaigns as to what the standards should be .

" As far as polls being wrong or off the mark from the results , that is a good thing .
People should n't be swayed by polls but should make a decision on their own , using their brain ... "
Exit polls have been THE MOST ACCURATE INDICATOR of election results , undisputably , until the year 2000 .
Since then , they have been abolished altogether ( 2002 ) , weighted and " adjusted " to match the offical results ( 2004 / 2006 ) , or just outright discredited altogether to cover up massive fraud ( NEW HAMPSHIRE , 2008 ) .
As for Florida , I was made so sick by the DEM DISENFRANCHISEMENT of FL DELAGATES that I traveled to the Dem Party State Convention in October to find out how this could happen / was horrified with what I learned / filmed .
You should know that while a REPUBLICAN LEGISLATURE ruled to move back our primaries in direct violation of the DNC bylaws , this was met WITH NO CONTEST OR OBJECTIONS from STATE DEMOCRATIC CHAIR KAREN THURMAN , who , as it turns out , is on the payroll for the STATE REPUBLICAN CHAIR .
My bet is that this was a bi-partisan , collective effort to ensure HILLARY was the FLORIDA nominee .
We 'll find out soon enough as this heated race for national delagates continues to " split " between HILLARY and OBAMA ; watch for HOWARD DEAN to have MI and FL delagates REINSTATED after so much in - party bickering / lawsuits / other candidates scrubbed from the ballot / barred from campaigning here .
Hope you 're all about HILLARY , cuz five 'll get you ten this race will be decided in her favor by HOWARD DEAN and the DNC .

Cannabis edibles are becoming increasingly popular as marijuana use grows in popularity and legality across the United States .
More states are allowing the medical and recreational use of cannabis , and as a result it and various supplements based on the drug are becoming increasingly popular and more widespread .
This means ways to ingest cannabis are increasing in use as well , particularly edibles .
Though edibles take longer to affect the body , they are often the most affordable way to do so .
They also provide an easy ingestion method for those who would prefer not to smoke .
Colorado was an early state to legalize the use of cannabis , and it has grown into a popular and profitable business in the state .
This includes the use of cannabis and CBD edibles .
Knowing what ’s best to purchase in such a successful market can be a daunting task , but with a bit of research the best Colorado edibles can be found .
Some people might still doubt the expertise of Colorado ’s with edibles , The Spot420.com explains that “ Finding the perfect edible dose is important .
Too little and you do n’t feel much and too much and you may not be a very happy camper .
Dosing for edibles has nothing to do with how long your smoking tolerance or how long you have been consuming cannabis in
smokable forms .
It has to do with personal body chemistry and everyone is different .
A comfortable dose can range from 2.5 MG – 600 MG depending on the person .
So start with 5MG and wait 2.5 hours to feel the effects before you take more . ”
From the same site , they consider one of the best cannabis edibles in Colorado to be Coda Truffles .
According to them , “ these edibles are delicious , perfectly dosed , and an absolute work of art .
With that combination , it ’s easy to see why they came in first place at the High Times Colorado Cannabis Cup .
If you ’re into aesthetically pleasing food , these will surely not disappoint .
Each truffle is handmade by a classically trained Chocolatier , filled with chocolate ganache , coated with high - quality chocolate , and then decorated with tiny pieces of art with confectioner ’s paint . ”
It ’s hard to argue with the combination of cannabis and chocolate .
Some might consider such a combination too risky , however .
for such people , there ’s the old reliable classic , the gummy .
Americcana gummies , according to TheSpot420.com , “ These gummies are made with whole cannabis plant extract , farmed using organic methods and no pesticides ever .
Each and every gummy is individually infused with 10 mg of THC and a focus on consistent dosing , so you always know what kind of high to expect when you buy Americanna .
These gummies come in sweet and sour assorted flavors , with 10 gummies in each package .
They do n’t melt and are our # 1 pick for portability .
Plus they taste great ! ”
High praise indeed .
One of the most highly praised Colorado edibles companies in the state is well known for their gummies .
Wana Brands is , according to TripSavvy.com , “ The gummies come in different flavors , such as mixed , watermelon , strawberry , blueberry , mango and yuzu .
You can also get them in class - specific options ( sativa and indica ) as well as a variety of CBD and THC ratios , which allows for customers to control the level of psycho-activity they prefer .
Wana also makes fruit lozenges , known as Wana Drops , which are available in tangerine , kiwi strawberry and watermelon . ”
Gummies may be the quintessential edible , right up there with brownies , but the increased widespread use of cannabis across the nation , and especially in Colorado , has allowed for a wider range of edibles .
For example , several dispensaries in Colorado are offering delightful summer treats like ice cream sandwiches .
Made with real ice cream , these 50 mg snacks are full of flavor , summer fun , and plenty of cannabis to get the job done .
Definitely an advancement over buying brownies from your college roommate .
Speaking of new and varies ways to enjoy cannabis , another summer treat available in Colorado is cannabis based tea .
Whitewater Blissful Black Tea makes a lovely iced tea .
This means you can enjoy a cool , refreshing drink with all the benefits of cannabis , too .
Definitely a change of pace from more snack based edibles , this one is great for people who are concerned about
consuming high calorie edibles in order to achieve results .
The only downside is the $ 24 price tag , which is still a pretty good deal for a Colorado edible that is n’t your standard snack - type treat .
For those who prefer coffee to tea , there ’s Canyon Cultivation Infused Coffee .
The Spot420.com declares that “ Coffee and cannabis is like peanut butter and jelly , they just go together .
Cannabis provides a nice balance to the effects of caffeine , keeping the caffeine jitters at bay .
Canyon Cultivation decided to make it even easier for cannabis consumers to enjoy this combination by developing the original infused cold coffee .
Their coffee is made from locally roasted , Guatemalan beans and infused with 10 mg of THC .
This dose allows for a perfect combination of energy and high to get your day started ! ”
Some people prefer larger doses , of course .
For those who fully embrace the high dosage , munchies side of Colorado edibles , there ’s Love ’s Oven .
As TripSavyy.com explains , “
Love ’s
Oven is a Denver - based bakery run by a classically trained pastry chef , Hope Frahm , who worked with some of the best restaurateurs out there .
Today , she makes high - end , high - quality , all - natural edibles with locally sourced and organic ingredients , whenever possible .
Shawna
Seldon McGregor , a spokesperson for L’Eagle Services in Denver , recommends Love ’s Oven ’s Purple Hash OG or Super Sour Alien . ”
You can tell they care because of the dedication the put into their strains , and their baked goods .
Love ’s
Oven takes the old brownie motif and runt with it to create the sort of delectable desserts your grandmother used to make .
If you ’re grandmother was a hippy , it ’s entirely possible she used cannabis , too .
These treats go for flavor and cannabis , but the natural ingredients help ease the conscience and also allow for easier ingestion of the cannabis itself .
The ingredients of the edible involved can be just as important as the cannabis itself , after all .
Though some might think
nothing of the edible itself and merely seek the cannabis , there are others who consider the quality of the edible an important aspect of the experience .
For such people , finding the best balance in cost , dosage , and ingredients is an important part of the edible experience .
One company seeking to work on the craftier side of edibles is Stratos , who specialize in CBD edibles and THC edibles , rather than just standard cannabis edibles .
As The Spot420.com explains , “ Stratos is a great change of pace from your typical edible offerings , crafting innovative products for both medical cannabis patients and recreational users .
Stratos CBD tablets come in 3 different ratios , 1:1 ( with an equal amount of THC and CBD ) , 2:1 ( with a slightly higher CBD to THC ratio ) , or 15:1 ( with a much higher CBD ratio ) .
Stratos THC tablets come in 3 different varieties as well : energy ( sativa based ) , relax ( sativa and indica hybrid ) , and sleep ( indica based ) . ”
For those who think of snowfall and relaxing under the winter sky , there are edibles for that time of year as well .
For the quintessential winter Colorado edible , Medibles sells candy canes .
That ’s right , candy canes .
60 mg of winter holiday edible goodness , which might make this the best
winter / Christmas edible in the entire history of cannabis , or at the very least an excellent example of the adaptability of cannabis in more modern times .
Love ’s
Oven was mentioned before , but they deserve another mention for one of their winter treats .
As WestWord.com explains , “ All Love ’s Oven goodies contain natural ingredients that are sourced locally and organic , when possible .
For these ginger snaps , the company makes crystallized ginger in - house .
The cookies come in packs of ten , and each cookie contains 10 mg of THC .
Although these little loves are available all year , they ’re irresistible during the holidays . ”
Thanks to increased acceptance of cannabis , more companies are able to expand the horizons of
edible usage .
Not only are regular edibles growing in popularity , CBD edibles can be found almost anywhere as well .
as one of the first states to legalize marijuana usage , the cannabis industry in Colorado has managed to prosper .
Colorado edibles are innovative and trend setting creations that not only provide the benefits of cannabis , they also taste great and come in a variety of creations .
For the sweets oriented there are cookies , brownies , and delectable truffles .
Coffee and tea can be infused with cannabis for a healthier beverage that provides a milder buzz .
For those who favor a bit more from their edibles , high dosage options exist as well .
There ’s also seasonal flavor options to enjoy .
Candy canes , ginger cookies , and all manner of winter treats can be
purchased in Colorado .
The same is true for summer , with ice cream sandwiches just one of the more notable options .
Regardless of the time of year , desired flavors , or dosages , Colorado edibles have what you are looking for .
色彩検定って役に立つ資格なの？
現在、日本には、どのくらいの資格や認定試験と呼ばれるものが、存在しているかご存知でしょうか。
なんと！1000種類も存在しているのです。
しかしながら、それって何の役に立つんだろうと思えるような資格や認定試験もあり、取得したは良いものの、就職や転職の際に何の役にも立たないものまで、さまざまです。
ここでは、資格取得を目指す方の多い、色彩検定について詳しく紹介していきましょう。
色を活かすことができる色彩検定のお仕事とは？
前述にもある通り、世の中には、さまざま資格・認定試験が存在しているものの、取得をしても、単純に肩書きが増えるだけのあまり役に立たないものも存在しています。
色に関しても、同じような感覚をお持ちの方もいらっしゃるのではないでしょうか。
色彩検定を取得すると、
ファッション業界や、広告などのデザイン。
アパレル業界のディスプレイ制作や、商品開発。
更に建築業などにも役立つと言われています。
ちょっとした変わり種では、色を使ったセラピーなどでのセラピストなんてものも活用することができると言われています。
より詳しく具体的な職業名で紹介してみましょう。
美容業界だと、スタイリストやメイクアップアーティスト。
ファッション業界では、テキスタイルデザイン、ファッションアドバイザー。
インテリア業界では、インテリアコーディネーターや家具デザイナー。
その他の業界では 、WEBデザイナーやカラーセラピスト、カラリストなんてものも挙げられます。
これほどに色の知識を有していれば、活躍することができる職業が充実しているわけですから、持っていれば、将来の選択肢も広がりますし、重宝される資格と言えるでしょう。
色彩検定とカラーコーディネーターとは何が違うの？
この資格は、しばしばカラーコーディネーターと一緒くたにされることが多いのですが、同違っているのでしょうか。
まず一番の違いとしては、認定団体の大きさです。
色彩の方は、全国服飾教育者連合会という社団法人が認定しているのに対して、カラーコーディネーター検定試験は、東京商工会議所が認定団体になります。
受験資格は、両者ともに制限はありませんし、年齢に関しても同様です。
ランクに関しても、3級から1級まで決まっており、1級がもっとも難易度が高いため、保有していると評価されるということも同じ。
合格ラインに関しても、7割前後の正解率があれば合格できます。
認定団体の違いだけなの？と思われる方もいますが、色彩の方は、20年以上の実績を持っている老舗資格であり、当然に前述に挙げたような業界の認知度も高いものです。
また、認定団体をみてもらうと分かりやすいと思いますが、もともとは服飾業界の一つの指針としての検定試験になりますから、前述に挙げた保有していると有利に働く職業の中でも、服飾系の仕事に向いている検定試験といえるのです。
一方でカラーコーディネーターの場合には、色彩の試験よりも、難易度は高く設定されているとされ、その試験範囲も広いとされています。
このため、プロダクトやインテリア、環境カラーなどの工業分野に強い資格と言われているのです。
色彩とカラーコーディネーターの違いは、このようなものがあることを覚えておきましょう。
色彩検定の試験を受けている年代層について
試験を受けている年代層は、カラーコーディネーターが学生や専門学生の受験者が多いことに対して、社会人が多いとされてます。
その上でどのような業界が多いかというと、ファッションやデザイン業界だと思うでしょうが、一番多いのがサービス業で、流通・販売・小売業。
そしてメーカーと続くのです。
役立つと言われている業界と、実際に資格を活かして仕事をされている方の割合とが違っていることも忘れてはいけませんね。
And some insurance companies pay doctors extra if their diabetic patients get their levels very low .
The low - blood - sugar hypothesis was so entrenched that when the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases proposed the study in the 1990s , they explained that it would be ethical .
Even though most people assumed that lower blood sugar was better , no one had rigorously tested the idea .
So the study would ask if very low blood sugar levels in people with Type 2 diabetes  the form that affects 95 percent of people with the disease  would protect against heart disease and save lives .
Some said that the study , even if ethical , would be impossible .
They doubted that participants  whose average age was 62 , who had had diabetes for about 10 years , who had higher than average blood sugar levels , and who also had heart disease or had other conditions , like high blood pressure and high cholesterol , that placed them at additional risk of heart disease  would ever achieve such low blood sugar levels .
Study patients were randomly assigned to one of three types of treatments : one comparing intensity of blood sugar control ; another comparing intensity of cholesterol control ; and the third comparing intensity of blood pressure control .
The cholesterol and blood pressure parts of the study are continuing .
Dr. John Buse , the vice - chairman of the study ’s steering committee and the president of medicine and science at the American Diabetes Association , described what was required to get blood sugar levels low , as measured by a protein , hemoglobin A1C , which was supposed to be at 6 percent or less .
“ Many were taking four or five shots of insulin a day , ” he said .
“ Some were using insulin pumps .
Some were monitoring their blood sugar seven or eight times a day . ”
They also took pills to lower their blood sugar , in addition to the pills they took for other medical conditions and to lower their blood pressure and cholesterol .
They also came to a medical clinic every two months and had frequent telephone conversations with clinic staff .

Microsoft will have to offer Windows without Media Player
Microsoft reaction
The European Court of First Instance upheld the ruling that Microsoft had abused its dominant market position .
A probe concluded in 2004 that Microsoft was guilty of freezing out rivals in server software and products such as media players .
Microsoft has two months to appeal at the European Court of Justice .
" The Court of First Instance essentially upholds the Commission 's decision finding that Microsoft abused its dominant position , " the court 's statement said .
Microsoft 's top lawyer said it was important now for the company to comply with EU competition law , but that it had not yet decided on its next legal steps .
Trustee rejected
It threw out just one small part of the European Commission 's ruling , which had established an independent monitoring trustee to supervise Microsoft 's behaviour .
The court has upheld a landmark commission decision to give consumers more choice in software markets
Competition commissioner Neelie Kroes
Profile : Neelie Kroes Q&A : What the ruling means for consumers
" The Court criticises , in particular , the obligation imposed on Microsoft to allow the monitoring trustee , independently of the Commission , access to its information , documents , premises and employees and also to the source code of its relevant products , " it said .
Microsoft has now been ordered to pay 80 % of the Commission 's legal costs , while the Commission has to carry a specific part of Microsoft 's costs .
The Commission welcomed the verdict .
It will give its competition commissioner Neelie Kroes a much needed boost , after her office lost several high - profile anti-trust cases .
Ms Kroes described the victory as " bittersweet " , saying that software customers still have no more choice than they did three years ago .
Sharing information
The 2004 ruling ordered Microsoft to ensure its products could operate with other computer systems by sharing information with rival software companies .
It was also ordered to make a version of its Windows operating system available without Microsoft 's Media Player software .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The EU is making an example of a strong US company - that 's all it is
Kenneth Macbeth
Send us your comments
Monday 's ruling upheld that order , saying it was " beyond dispute " that Microsoft obliged customers to buy its Media Player software along with the operating system .
Last year , Microsoft was told to pay daily fines adding up to 280.5 million euros over a six - month period , after it failed to adhere to the 2004 decision .
Michael Reynolds , of law firm Allen & Overy , said the important thing was " that these principles of the judgement will not just apply to the Microsoft case " .
" They will apply to any dominant company that engages in the same behaviour .
It 's not just about Microsoft , " said Mr Reynolds .
" It provides legal certainty now as to what you can and you can't do in relation to information you have to make available to companies who compete in your environment to enable them to be a viable competitor , " he added .
" The court has upheld a landmark commission decision to give consumers more choice in software markets , " Ms Kroes said in a statement .
" Microsoft must now comply fully with its legal obligations to desist from engaging in anti-competitive conduct . "
Because it is THE place for conservatives to present themselves and programs before a wide array of important ....
Then she spoke at the regular Wednesday conservative brainstorming session presided over by the bearded and ubiquitous Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform .
The speculation about Rice began two weeks ago , chronicled in detail on The Ticket , when within days in between foreign trips she complimented Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama on his race speech , spent a long time with the editorial board of the conservative Washington Times and published the transcript of the session on the State Department website .
The Arizona senator wants the No. 2 choice to be well - prepared when the announcement time comes , unlike , say , a certain former senator from Indiana whose name is the same as those helpless little birds that all the current vice presidents like to blast with large guns .
And he 's said publicly that his campaign team has just begun to assemble a long list of possibilities .
( You do n't want any party VP wannabes thinking they were overlooked , even if ultimately not chosen . )
Obviously , the choice is his .
He 's stubborn enough not to be pushed .
Now that everybody is dismissing it , we know there 's really something up for sure about Condoleezza Rice possibly becoming a vice presidential candidate with the presumptive Republican nominee , Sen. John McCain .
conservative institutions in the nation 's capital , potential candidates are drawn there .
Cabinet secretaries in GOP administrations ensure their deputies are ready to brief that influential crowd any week .
But for a secretary herself to attend and speak seemingly off - the - cuff , not about becoming vice president ( she never even mentioned it , which made her presence and presentation all the more powerful ) , but about her life and upbringing in Birmingham and Denver , her values , programs , policies and views .
She has described herself , for instance , as " mildly pro-choice . "
Attendees , who are not supposed to talk about the off - the - record sessions , said off - the - record that virtually everyone went away saying to themselves , " She could be president . "
Which is a helpful qualification for a possible vice president who would turn 54 10 days after the November election , when the head of the ticket would be 72 on inauguration day .
Norquist himself enthusiastically endorsed Rice 's non-existent candidacy in a lengthy interview with the Washington Post 's blog The Sleuth today .
" If her goal was to convince everyone she would be a good president and , therefore , a good vice president , " Norquist told Mary Ann Akers , " she hit it out of the ballpark . "
For years since she helped design the policies of the nascent Bush campaign in 1999 , Rice , who was trained as a concert pianist , has maintained that her ideal job would be commissioner of the National Football League , a job that is not currently vacant .
More recently , Rice has said that at the end of her current government job next January , she looks forward to leaving the city to " new blood , " returning to the West ( she remains a tenured Stanford faculty member on leave ) and reading , writing and voting as an ordinary citizen .
And no doubt regaining some lucrative posts on corporate boards .
She also told Akers that McCain is " an extraordinary American , a really outstanding leader . "
McCain has said he 's detected no signals from Rice .
Her State Department spokesman Monday sought to dampen the political rumors .
And on the same day as Akers ' post , another Washington Post blog , the Trail , recited her disinterest in the VP job .
But , you 'll notice , no one is saying " never " or " out of the question . "
All of which , in the absence of any other Republican political news except McCain 's lame fundraising numbers , naturally fuels the speculation .
If you were designing an ideal Republican vice presidential running mate in the Chinese Year of the Democrat , when that party will have either a black or a woman candidate at the top of the ticket , a black woman who 's from the state with the most electoral votes and has already established her conservative credentials with the D.C. Republican groups that count and donate ( and remain suspicious of McCain ) could fit right in .
Think someone like that , despite her connection to an unpopular White House incumbent , could help re-energize the dispirited base of the party of Lincoln ?
That is , after all , McCain 's Job One .
But , as they say , there 's probably nothing to it .
She 'll likely go back to Palo Alto and disappear .

The only condition is that they must keep their original form , no altering , along with your presentation .
This means actually more visibly and it is exactly what you need .
The more interesting the article is , the more people will read and remember it .
Even if you do n’t have experience with writing , there are some aspects that can make you try it :

You will have to coherent and state clear ideas and proper explanations .
It will make you improve the way you speak .
It will bring you visibility
If it ’s written well it will surely help someone .
You can prove your knowledge in your professional areas this way .
Publishing articles means they have to contains mostly useful information and just a little bit of advertising .

There are other things you could do with articles if you are willing to spend some money .
There are different publicity sites , ranked high in search engines that for a fee will publish your article on their site for a limited period of time .
The fee is not high usually , and you get much more visibility this way .

The user can see them all at the same time and you must think of ways to make him choose to read yours .
If you have tried and you are not confident you can do it on your own , you can always hire a professional .
On the Isle of Eigg , the arrival of the ferry always elicits a flurry of activity .
Islanders crowd the pier to greet friends and family or collect letters and parcels from the mainland , some 10 miles away .
At the cozy tearoom by the jetty , kettles boil water for hot drinks and bacon sizzles on the grill .
In the old days , dealing with the sudden rush of customers required careful calculation .
A limited power supply produced by the tearoom 's diesel generator meant the oven could n't be switched on at the same time as the dishwasher .
The small freezer was switched off at night .
But on Feb. 1 , all of Eigg , a spectacularly scenic island off the west coast of Scotland , switched on its own continuous , clean , and renewable energy supply .
Before , electric service was spotty .
Residents mostly relied on noisy , expensive diesel generators or mini-hydroelectric generators .
Now , the islanders , who number just over 80 , enjoy luxuries of modern living that mainlanders take for granted .
" I can use the deep fry and the dishwasher at the same time – it's great ! " says Stuart Fergusson , who works at the tearoom .
" Before , when the power used to go , I 'd have to rush up the hill to the fuse box and jiggle about with it with a half - cooked grilled sandwich on the [ grill ] .
Things are so much better now – we might even buy another freezer ! "
The island makes its electricity through a combination of solar panels , wind turbines , and a hydroelectric generator , all scattered strategically across the island and linked in a single grid .
Storage batteries provide a backup .
Two diesel generators stand ready to provide emergency power .
Each household is allocated a ration of electricity not to exceed a draw of 5 kilowatts ( kW ) at any time ( the equivalent of turning on 50 100 - watt light bulbs all at once ) .
Even at the full ration , that 's only about one - half to two - thirds the amount used by a household in Britain , though islanders can supplement that with a diesel generator or heat from a wood stove .
If the islanders use too much electricity and trip up the system , they will have to pay £ 20 ( $ 40 ) to be switched on again .
Businesses are allowed a draw of 10 kW .
All these conditions were agreed to by the residents .
Kathleen Miller is a young mother of two who is descended from a long line of islanders .
She lives in a white cottage on the opposite end of the island from the pier , with breathtaking views of the beach below and the neighboring island of Muck .
Author J.R.R.
Tolkien is rumored to have stayed there .
Ms. Miller remembers the old days .
" We used to switch off the generator at night , so there was no light once you went to bed .
You had to use candles or gas lamps , " she says .
" But now I can read in bed and put the light on when I get up .
And I 'll finally be able to use that toaster I got as a wedding present years ago . "
The electrification of Eigg began in 2006 , after members of the Island of Eigg Heritage Trust , a locally owned and managed body that runs the island 's affairs , commissioned feasibility studies on the best way of connecting islanders to one main power grid .
At more than $ 8 million , the option of tapping the mainland 's power grid through an underwater cable was far too expensive .
" We did n't want to have our electricity coming from nuclear power on the mainland anyway , " says Maggie Fyffe , secretary of the trust and fundraiser for the project .
The islanders decided on a combination of solar , wind , and hydropower .
They raised $ 3.2 million from a number of sources , including the European Union 's regional development fund , Britain 's national lottery , the Scottish government , and local and regional government programs .
A newly created company , Eigg Electric , a subsidiary of the trust , appointed a project manager and partnered with an electrical company from the mainland .
" It was a very exciting project , as integrating all three renewables had never been done before , " says Eigg Electric co-director John Booth , a retired industrial relations consultant from England who moved to the island in 2000 with his wife to renovate an old house .
When the idea for the project took hold , he poured himself into it as a full - time volunteer .
No one knew if the grid would really work , he says .
" We did our homework , and when we came up against something we did n't know , we went back to the physics books . "
The project could not have developed had a defining event not taken place on Eigg just over a decade ago .
For centuries , the entire island had been owned by a series of single landowners , meaning the residents were renters who could never own land .
In 1996 , the exasperated islanders teamed up to buy the island for themselves .
Donations flooded in from across Britain and from as far away as Detroit .
In June 1997 , the islanders took ownership of Eigg .
In the following years , they built a new jetty ; renovated the village hall , school , shop , and tearoom ; and , in the most expensive project to date , created the new electrical grid .
" Before the buyout we were just surviving .
Now we can look ahead and build a solid future , " says Camille Dressler , the island historian , who was drawn to Eigg as an anthropology student and never left .
" The electri­city is part of this dream which has come true .
It 's very liberating . "
Critics of the new scheme – none of them islanders – say it was too expensive and a waste of taxpayers ' money .
On the ferry , one visitor pointed out that for the price of the grid per head , every inhabitant could have been given a small yacht .
But for Booth , the benefits of Eigg 's green power outweigh the cost .
Renewable energy does n't risk becoming much more expensive , unlike the diesel fuel used to power the old generators .
Islanders also say their pricing system is fairer .
" On the mainland , everyone can use as much electricity as they want .
But market forces dictate what the price will be , and the people who can pay , will .
That penalizes the poor , " Booth says .
" Our system has a much more social aspect to it .
Everybody is allocated the same amount of electricity , so everybody pays the same .
That way everyone benefits .
" Not only is our system sustainable , but people actually have to think about how much power they can use . "
The euro could surpass the dollar within ten years
Jeffrey Frankel
One of the world ’s leading international economists explains how the euro could surpass the dollar as the premier international currency and examines the geopolitical implications of such a shift .
The International Economy recently asked experts :
Ten years from now , which will likely be the next great global currency ?
My answer is that it just might be the euro .
Contrary to fevered popular speculation in the 1990s , the yen and the mark never had the potential to challenge the dollar as the leading international currency : their home economies were smaller than the US and their financial markets less well - developed and liquid than New York .
The euro , however , is a credible challenger : Euroland is roughly as big as the United States , and the euro has shown itself a better store of value than the dollar .
To be sure , rankings of international currencies change only very slowly .
Although the US surpassed the UK in economic size in 1872 , in exports in 1915 , and as a net creditor in 1917 , the dollar did not surpass the pound as number one international currency until 1945 .
Thus one must account for the lags .
In 2005 , when Menzie Chinn and I used historical data on central bank holdings of foreign exchange reserves to estimate the determinants , even our pessimistic scenarios did not have the euro overtaking the dollar until 2022 .
Thus we could not have asserted that the dollar would be dethroned “ ten years from now . ”
But the dollar has continued to lose ground .
We have now updated our calculations , particularly to recognize that London is usurping Frankfurt ’s role as the financial capital of the euro , notwithstanding that the UK remains outside of EMU .
Now we find that the tipping point could come within the ten - year horizon : the euro could overtake the dollar even as early as 2015 .
Figure 1 .
The euro and the dollar ’s projected international reserve shares
Source : Chinn and Frankel ( 2008 ) .
Figure 1 shows one of our simulations .
In this scenario , the UK does not join the euro , but 20 % of London turnover counts toward euro area financial depth , and currencies depreciate at the 20 - year rates experienced up to 2007 .
The result is that the euro overtakes the dollar by 2015 .
Geopolitical Implications
One might ask why this would matter .
Some of the reasons are economic : the US would lose the “ exorbitant privilege ” of being able to finance its international deficits easily .
But there are also possible geopolitical implications .
In the past , US deficits have been manageable because allies have been willing to pay a financial price to support American global leadership ; they correctly have seen it to be in their interests .
In the 1960s , Germany was willing to offset the expenses of stationing US troops on bases there so as to save the United States from a balance of payments deficit .
The American military has long been charged less to station troops in high - rent Japan than if they had been based at home .
Repeatedly the Bank of Japan , among other central banks , has been willing to buy dollars to prevent the US currency from depreciating ( late 1960s , early 1970s , late 1980s ) .
In 1991 , Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , and a number of other countries were willing to pay for the financial cost of the war against Iraq , thus briefly wiping out the US current account deficit .
Unfortunately , since 2001 , during the same period that the US twin deficits have re-emerged , America has lost popular sympathy and political support in much of the rest of the world .
The hegemon has lost its claim to legitimacy in the eyes of many .
In sharp contrast to international attitudes at the dawn of the century , opinion surveys report that the US is now viewed unfavourably in most countries .
The next time the US asks other central banks to bail out the dollar , will they be as willing to do so as Europe was in the 1960s , or as Japan was in the late 1980s after the Louvre Agreement ?
I fear not .
The decline in the status of the pound during the course of the first half of the 20th century was part of a larger pattern whereby the United Kingdom lost its economic pre-eminence , colonies , military power , and other trappings of international hegemony .
As some wonder whether the United States might now have embarked on a path of “ imperial over - reach , ” following the British Empire down a road of widening budget deficits and overly ambitious military adventures in the Muslim world , the fate of the pound is perhaps a useful caution .
The Suez crisis of 1956 is frequently recalled as the occasion on which Britain was forced under US pressure to abandon its remaining imperial designs .
But the importance of a simultaneous run on the pound and President Eisenhower ’s decision not to help the beleaguered currency through IMF support unless the British withdrew its troops from Egypt should also be remembered .

Apparently Meizu was n't the only manufacturer to get a friendly visit from German police at this week 's CeBIT tradeshow in Hanover .
The word is that 51 different exhibitors got busted at the show for the patent infringement , with 180 law enforcement officers confiscating 68 moving boxes worth of gear .
Primary offenses included Meizu - style MP3 / MP4 infringement , along with unregistered CD , DVD-R and DVD playback devices .
All companies were informed of the rules before the tradeshow , and the warning we spotted at Meizu 's booth ( pictured above ) should 've probably served as a pretty good hint to these companies as well .
China boasted the most offenders at 24 , then it was Taiwan with 12 , Germany with 9 , and Poland , Netherlands and Korea with one a piece .
Everybody else just is n't trying hard enough .

Here ’s some news for Hillary Clinton : the Bosnian war was over in 1996 .
Those of us , like myself , who first went to Bosnia at the start of the war in 1992 and then , in 1994 and 1995 , endured President Bill Clinton ’s circumlocutions as we sat in an encircled Sarajevo watching pregnant women getting blown away by shelling from Serbian gunners , know that .
We know that as President Clinton mumbled about “ enmities that go back 500 years , some would say almost a thousand years , ” Bosnia burned .
We know what that talk of intractable grievances dating back to 995 was meant to communicate : no western intervention could achieve anything in the Balkan pit .
Only after the mass murder of Bosnian Muslims at Srebrenica , three years after the initial Serbian genocide of 1992 against that population ( and one year after a genocide on his watch in Rwanda ) , did the gelatinous Clinton develop some backbone .
NATO bombed , Richard Holbrooke did his brilliant work at Dayton in November 1995 , and the guns fell silent in Bosnia .
So , yes , the war was well and truly over when Hillary Clinton arrived in the northeastern Bosnian town of Tuzla on March 25 , 1996 .
It was over , although she recently recalled “ landing under sniper fire . ”
It was over when “ we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base . ”

Here is an extensive collection of quotes from religious people on and off the Internet
Before you ask , yes , people really do say these things .
It might seem like some of this is made up , but if you spend any amount of time in the online Christian forums you will continually run into these types of statements ...
No , everyone is born Christian .
Only later in life do people choose to stray from Jesus and worship satan instead .
Atheists have the greatest " cover " of all , they insist they believe in no god yet most polls done and the latest research indicates that they are actually a different sect of Muslims .
Trinidad and Tobago , CARM [ 2006 - Oct-01 ]
One of the most basic laws in the universe is the Second Law of Thermodynamics .
This states that as time goes by , entropy in an environment will increase .
Evolution argues differently against a law that is accepted EVERYWHERE BY EVERYONE .
Evolution says that we started out simple , and over time became more complex .
That just is n't possible : UNLESS there is a giant outside source of energy supplying the Earth with huge amounts of energy .
If there were such a source , scientists would certainly know about it .

Just recently my son Bobby came out to me .
I had been worried for awhile .
His teachers said most of his grades were slipping and he seemed depressed and withdrawn .
Bobby said he'd been hiding it for awhile because he was afraid I would reject him .
I sat him down and told him that I loved him and that God loved him , but that his salvation was in danger if he did not resist his unnatural tempations .
I told him how being gay would mean he would live a shorter life , and that if he couldnt change his orientation he could be celibate like most the ex-gays are .
He started crying saying something along the lines of " I knew you wouldnt understand !
You 're just like everyone else ! " before running to his room and slamming the door .
What did I do wrong ?
I dont want to lose my son , but I fear I already have .
I talked it over with his therapist , who had the ludicrous idea that homosexuality was unchangable and that trying to repress could lead to lots of psychological damage ( I 've dropped him and will try to be finding another therapist with more moral beliefs ) .
I wouldnt be surprised if he 's the one who 's feeding my son all the homosexual propaganda about how its ' ok ' to be gay .
That , or how homosexuality has engulfed the media , making it seem ' cool ' and ' hip ' and how they were just another oppressed minority .
You didnt have to worry about seeing two men making out on tv at my age !
I dont want to sound like a fanatic , but Im worried what other effects will come out of this increasingly secular , immoral society obsessed with filth .
Am I too late ?
Or is it possible to save my son [ Note : the boy eventually took his own life . ]

Gravity : Does n't exist .
If items of mass had any impact of others , then mountains should have people orbiting them .
Or the space shuttle in space should have the astronauts orbiting it .
Of course , that 's just the tip of the gravity myth .
Think about it .
Scientists want us to believe that the sun has a gravitation pull strong enough to keep a planet like neptune or pluto in orbit , but then it 's not strong enough to keep the moon in orbit ?
Why is that ?
What I believe is going on here is this :
These objects in space have yet to receive mans touch , and thus have no sin to weigh them down .
This is n't the case for earth , where we see the impact of transfered sin to material objects .
The more sin , the heavier something is .

This is what it would be like , if the majority of people were athiests .
ATHIEST KID : Mom , I 'm going to go fuck a hooker .
ATHIEST MOM : Okay , son .
ATHIEST KID : Afterwards , I 'm going to go smoke pot with my friends , since it's " not addictive . "
ATHIEST MOM : Okay , come home soon !
The athiest kid leaves the room .
The father comes home from work several minutes later .
ATHIEST DAD : Hey !
ATHIEST MOM : Hi , honey !
I 'm pregnant again .
I guess I 'll just get another abortion , since " fetuses do n't count as human life . "
ATHIEST DAD : Okay , get as many abortions as you want !
ATHIEST MOM : Oh , and do n't go in the bedroom .
ATHIEST DAD : Why not ?
ATHIEST MOM :
There are two gay men fucking each other in there .
ATHIEST DAD :
Why are they here ?
ATHIEST MOM : I wanted to watch them do it for awhile .
They just are n't finished yet .
ATHIEST DAD : Okay , that 's fine with me !
Suddenly , their neighbor runs into the house .
ATHIEST NEIGHBOR : Come quick , there 's a Christian outside !
ATHIEST MOM : We 'll be right there !
The athiest couple quickly put on a pair of black robes and hoods .
They then exit the house , and run into the street , where a Christian is nailed to a large , wooden X .
He is being burned alive .
A crowd of athiests stand around him , all wearing black robes and hoods .
RANDOM ATHIEST : Damn you , Christian !
We hate you !
We claim to be tolerant of all religions .
But we really hate your's !
That 's because we athiests are hypocritical like that !
Die , Christian !

This girl is like a leper so what she needs to do is try and find god if she really believes she can be healed from this state , she will be healed from this state Most afflictions like this are caused by sins committed while still inside the womb .
If she can repent for what she does god will embrace her and make her as human as you or me but if she chooses not to she 'll always be like this god tests every one of us [ emphasis added ]

Yes , that is a great company .
I bought one of their large print version ( old eyes ... what can I say ? ) .
The only thing I do n't like about them is they sell foreign language versions of the KJB .
I do n't think that 's right .
We know the only true translation is the 1600 's version in English .
It 's too risky for anybody to translate that into other languages .
Mistakes can creep in ... and that can lead to heresy .

Seriously , does anybody ever cry at an Atheist 's funeral ?
I mean , since Atheists have no value whatsoever as human beings ( they 're not even human , but only inhuman animals ) , since Atheists are nothing but miserable Liars , Cowards and Murderers , after all , why would anybody in their right mind weep over the dead rotting corpse , or bone chips and ashes ( that get mixed together with those of others from the crematory ) of a worthless dead Atheist ?
And what epitaph do you engrave on an Atheist 's grave marker ?
" Here lies the only good Atheist , which is a dead Atheist " .
What else is there say ?
Nothing at all .
No last words , no last rites , no flowers , no anything .
Every time an Atheist dies , the world is better off as a result of that dead Atheist being dead , & its damned God -forsaken soul burning in the fiery pits of Hades . :)
Which begs another related question , do Atheists cry at funerals ?
If so , why ?
Since Atheists hate God , and they hate Family , and they hate Country , who are they crying for ?
It is true :
The only good Atheist is a dead Atheist .

What is called ' Science ' today and ' scientists ' consist of the same old gang of witch doctors , sorcerers , tellers of tales , the ' Priest - Entertainers ' for the common people .
' Science ' consists of a weird , way - out occult concoction of jibberish theory - theology ... nothing good has ever come from ' science ' ----
In fact , technology is not in any way related to the web of idiotic scientific theory .
ALL inventors have been anti-science .
The Wright brothers said : " Science theory held us up for years .
When we threw out all science , started from experiment and experience , then we invented the airplane . "
By the way , airplanes all fly level on this Plane earth !
The Fact the Earth is Flat is not my opinion , it is a Proved Fact !
While all we need to know is that the Bible says the Earth is flat ( Is.40:22 , Ez.7:2 , Dn.2:35 ; 4:10 - 11,20 , Mt.4:8 ) ... but for a second can you imagine what these so - called ' scientists would have us believe ----
If the earth really was round , that would mean there arre people who are HANGING DOWN , HEAD DOWNWARDS while we are standing head up ?
But since the theory allows to travel to those parts of the earth where the people are said to hand head downward , and still to fancy ourselves to be heads upwards , and our friends whom we have left behind us to be heads downwards !
LOL !
What foolishness !
TheWHOLE THING IS A MYTH - A DREAM - A DELUSION - and a snare , and , instead of there being any evidence at all in this direction to substantiate this popular theory , it is plain proof that the Earth is Not A Globe !
Also , be sure to know the Sun and Moon are about 3,000 miles away are both 32 miles across .
The Planets are ' tiny . '
Sun and Moon do Move , earth does NOT move , whirl , spin or gyrate ( 1 Sam.2:8 , 1 Chr.16:30 ; Job 9:6 , 38:4-6 ; Ps.96:10 , 104:5 , Is.13:10 , Mic.6:2 ) .
Australians do NOT hang by their feet under the world ... this is a FACT , not a theory !
Also a Fact the Spinning , Whirling , Gyrating Ball World Planet , Globe Idea is Entirely 100 % now and at all times in the Past , a RELIGIOUS DOCTRINE ... a Blind Dogmatic Article of Faith in the Religion for the Blind unreasoning beast of prey .
No earthly reason for a Sane , Upright Member of the Elite True Christians to subscribe to it .
Also a Fact , today the Elite of Earth ALL live on the Flat World .
Only the illogical , unreasoning " herd " ... prefers the way - out occult weird theology of the old Greek superstitution earth a spinning ball !
Both Copernecious and Newton , the inventors of the " modern " superstitions ( 400 year OLD modern ) have said : " It is not possible for a Sane reasonable person to ever really believe these Theories . "

This past spring I was expelled from my high school .
Why ?
Because I 'm a Christian .
There was a girl in my class who was wiccan , and I did n't want demons to possess me or anyone else and save her from satan .
So , I told her that her faith was evil and told her to accept Jesus as Savior and she would be saved .
Simple as that .
Just say the sinners prayer and you can be saved !
Well I got sent to the principal for that .
She said I was ' discriminating ' against her religion .
I was only doing what the Bible , God , Jesus and my pastor said !
How is that wrong !?
Well , afterwards I was forced to aplologize , even though it 's a sin to , so I never meant what I said .
So , instead I put a copy of a Jack Chick tract in her locker about how wicca and a paganism lead to murder , rape and other horrible things because it lets the devil get inside of you .
I also left a little note about how she was going to hell .
I was hoping she would see the error of her ways and repent from the evil , disgusting ' religion ' .
Instead I was called down to the principal again and this time there were two police officers there .
And they said I was under arrest for harrasing this girl and threatening her !
What did I do ?
I just wanted her to accept Jesus and be saved !
Now her family ( all evil , stupid , disgusting god hating wiccans ) want to sue me for discrimination and creating a hostile workplace !
How is that fair ?
She 's the one who 's discriminating against me because I 'm one with the LORD !
Jesus is the only way to salvation !
It 's that simple people !
No pope , wicca , or anything stupid like that !
JESUS ONLY !
Why is is wrong to tell others that ?
It 's all the fault of the ACLU and simlar atheist organizations trying to destroy us Christians .
Next they 'll want to genocide us for doing our Godly work .

The other day while installing some new fiber optics cables for a satellite array I overheard some coworkers talking about quarks .
Quarks are supposedly tiny particles that nobody can see and nobody has any use for .
So why do we know about them ?
What good does it possibly do us to know what a quark is ?
Just another example of useless science , and wasted money on the so called research needed for this great discovery .
I seriously have to wornder about people who spend their free time thinking about things like quarks or quasars .
There are more important things to do .
As far as I am concerned if an answer to a question is n't in the bible , then the you have no business asking the question .
A few years ago when my wife suddenly had to get an emergency c-section I was scared .
But I didnt turn to any book about quarks .
Luckily I had my palm pilot with me , which just happened to have the entire King James bible on it !
I read a few passages that gave me the strength to pray for her and the baby to get through this ordeal .
I sure did n't need any useless trivia books about quarks to find comfort in .
I have very little use for science .
In fact it is in impediment to getting close to God .
[ Someone points out the obvious fact that c-sections and computers are a benefit of science . ]
You are confusing TECHNOLOGY with SCIENCE .
Technology and science are often lumped together , but are totally separate and unrelated things .
Technology makes peoples lives easier .
Technology is the product of inventive geniuses who were inspired by God.
Inventions and innovations improve life .
Science causes confustion and makes things complicated .
Everytime there is a new discovery the old discoveries and old wisdom are discarded !
And theories get more and more complex .
Science makes people confused and complicates things .
Who is the author of confusion ?
Satan of course .
The bible it the opposite of science .
Biblical wisdom NEVER CHANGES , and anyone can get it .
Scientific wisdom is always changing and contradicting itself , and really nobody gets it .
Please do n't insult our intelligence by lumping science and technology together .
They are as different at night and day .

The only solution we have to stop gays from recruiting other people is to cut off the source .
They need to be taken to specialized containment centers where they will be forced to become straight and accept Jesus as thier savior and to repent from their disgusting , wicket , hatful , devilish ways .
Those that refuse to go can either be forced , or banished from society in other specialized communities where they have no connetion to the outside world at all .

The word of God has been in heaven forever .
The KJV has always been there .
The so called Hebrew words like Alleluia are English words .
The English did not borrow them from the Hebrew but rather the Hebrew borrowed them from the English .
If the KJV has always been there and is the original word of God then there is no other conclusion .
The same can be said for any so called Greek words that were borrowed from the Greek or transliterated .

Top Ten Signs you 're a dumbass atheist :
10 .
You vigorously deny the existence of God , yet you frequently blame him for everything that is wrong in modern society .
9 . You repeatedly insist that man did not , in fact , evolve from an ape .
Apes and men both evolved from another species who did not resemble Curious George in any way .
8 . You criticize Christians who do n't know their Bible , yet you have never opened any of Darwin 's texts .
7 . While all created evidence and reasoning point to a Creator and absolute truth , you prefer to hide behind relativism and a theory of evolution which does not , in fact , describe the creation of the universe at all .
6 . You ca n't seem to understand the fundamental differences between fundamental Muslims and fundamental Christians ( hint : strap - on TNT ) 5 .
You willingly attribute all historical atrocities in Europe to a demographic that contained approximately 100 % of Europeans during the period in question .
4 . You also like to ignore the beneficial discoveries of the aforementioned demographic .
3 . You do n't realize that a closed system can be defined however the observer wants , so you throw out technological phrases to try to ignore the implications of thermodynamics .
2 . You accuse Christians of being hateful and you hope that they DIAF .
1 . Your biggest complaint is that these typically hopeful and caring people want to share the greatest single thing in their life with you .
You 're like an idiot who wipes with winning lottery tickets .

[ on why homosexuality is wrong and not natural ]
When two guy's have sex they can only penetrate eachother through the crack which I think is disgusting because of all the crap that 's in there .
They both must face the same direction and thus one guy 's twig and berries will be projecting from the two .
Because no man has a vagina they can't become one flesh when having normal sex .
Women do n't have Jimmy and his two buddies hanging around so they can't naturally penetrate eachother and become one flesh .
Oral with dudes can't be natural because the legs will be poking out from different directions as will the ladies if they participate in oral sex .
Oral with the opposite sex still is n't natural because you still have the leg issue and often someone is further down if they are not on top of eachother .
Anal with opposites is still excluded from natural sex because once again your are sticking your think in a crap hole and a womans tits are usually projecting outward .
When the Bible is speaking of becoming one flesh it literally means that there is nothing sticking out in the clear and that the man and woman are facing eachother .

Maybe his son will have the intelligence to make a similar point , maybe in his next state of the union adress outlaw evolution .
He would n’t need to say much , simply something like “ every evolutionist is now an enemy of the Republic , ” and then explain why .

In the real world homosexuals ( especially males ) are generally predatory perverts who would n't think twice about bedding a 14 yo boy .
You want to think that " Will and Grace " is a realistic picture of homosexuality .
You 're wrong .
It does n't show the incredibly widespread depression , drug use , disease and utter depravity of teh homosexual fetish community .
These are people who are deeply ashamed of thier fetish , but that have been pushed by certain radical elements to publicize thier perversion in order to be more widely accepted .
This makes their perversion normal in their eyes and this makes it easier to find someone who will glove up and give 'em the 5 - finger anal salute .
It makes it easier for them to find willing BOYS to rape .
I 'll bet that you 've never heard about the homosexual counseling clinic in Portland , OR that was shut down because the couselors there ( male and female ) were using it to hook up with newer and younger victims .
It got hushed up by the media and the gov't in Portland because they got threatened with a discrimination lawsuit , so most people have never heard of this event .
I can guarantee you , though , if it happened in Portland , it 's happening elsewhere .
This is just one more piece of evidence of how wrong homosexuality is .
I can tell you from painful personal experience that homosexuals are truly screwed up people .
Depression , drug use and suicide run rampant among homosexuals .
No one talks too much about this small fact , but it 's there none - the - less .

If the Bible is wrong when it tells us it is infallible , then it contradicts itself .
If it contradicts itself , then it is unreliable .
If it is unreliable , then our faith is totally shattered and Christianity is a lie .

We prayed during our family devotions .
Talitha ( 11 years old ) and Noel and I prayed earnestly for the families affected by the calamity and for the others in our city .
Talitha prayed “ Please do n’t let anyone blame God for this but give thanks that they were saved . ”
When I sat on her bed and tucked her in and blessed her and sang over her a few minutes ago , I said , “ You know , Talitha , that was a good prayer , because when people ‘ blame ’
God for something , they are angry with him , and they are saying that he has done something wrong .
That ’s what “ blame ” means : accuse somebody of wrongdoing .
But you and I know that God did not do anything wrong .
God always does what is wise .
And you and I know that God could have held up that bridge with one hand . ”
Talitha said , “ With his pinky . ” “ Yes , ” I said , “ with his pinky .
Which means that God had a purpose for not holding up that bridge , knowing all that would happen , and he is infinitely wise in all that he wills . ”
Talitha said , “ Maybe he let it fall because he wanted all the people of Minneapolis to fear him . ”
“ Yes , Talitha , ” I said , “ I am sure that is one of the reasons God let the bridge fall . ”

I think there are a lot more cases of people being agnostic or atheistic , but then getting off drugs in order to become Christians .
I do n't know any Christians who actually do drugs .
That to me seems like more of an escape from reality that non-religious folk tend to get into .
It would take a lot of drugs to convince me that I could know anything about myself and the world by being an atheist .
It would also take a lot of drugs to convince me , if I were an atheist , that morality had more meaning than the indigestion I felt when I drank bad water in Mexico .

[ Full article includes pictures of women playing sports ]
However , if you look at pictures of female athletes who play sports or observe them on the playing fields , you will notice that many develop strong , muscular bodies .
Female athletes also sneer , wince , push , and fight just like the men .
I notice these things all the time in pictures in our hometown newspaper .
The sneers are most obvious ; they make young women very unfeminine .
The masculine uniforms and sweaty bodies are n’t very attractive , either . [...]
I propose that sports greatly hinders the development of godly , Biblical , feminine character .
Parents today expend extraordinary amounts of time and energy taking their daughters from one sports event to another , week after week , even to the point where it exhausts the family and family resources .
The fruits we see are that today ’s Christian women are often ill - prepared to be Biblically obedient wives and mothers .
I also notice when driving by our public school grounds and sports fields another phenomenon taking place : the young girls are trained in sports right along with the boys .
To me , this can only be degrading to the boys .
In some cases , girls regularly participate on boys ' sports teams , and therefore compete against the boys themselves .
During the past decade , more and more girls participated in wrestling ; since there were no girls ' wrestling teams , they joined the boys ' teams and competed against the boys .
I read about one school where the boys refused to wrestle the girls and forfeited their matches ; there could be no greater embarrassment to them than to lose to a girl , not to mention it likely violated their sense of masculine chivalry .
So not only is female sports participation degrading the feminine nature of women , in many cases it degrades the developing masculinity in boys .

My drug of choice ... is secular music .
I threw out all of my secular CDs a year ago , and since then I have n't bought a CD that was n't explicitly Christian .
I felt like it was something that I needed to do .
From time to time I get in a blue funk and I try to listen to my Christian CDs ... sometimes they make me feel better , but usually they do n't .
However , when I turn on the radio to a secular station or I play secular songs on the internet , I almost always change my mood .
I asked the Lord about it , and he pointed out to me that some people take drugs to alter their moods ... the drugs have side effects and they often cause more problems than they solve , but they take care of the problem that the person wanted them to take care of .
So now it makes sense .
Secular music is my drug and when I listen to it ( like right now ) , I 'm showing personal defeat .

We have deformed skulls to prove that these aliens once had ape - like foreheads , and some walked on 2 legs and others walked on 4 legs .

We do n't know who the first alien was , but from the few skulls and bones we have , we can tell that there were millions of them .
Then when they had explored planet earth , they found it boring and decided to leave but not before some of them had died here which is why we still have their skulls and bones .
From them , we can tell what they wore , what color eyes they had , and that they were covered in hair .

My daughter knows that if she does n't come to Christ before we go that she is to get this file and share it with everyone .
I 'm working on a list of names and contact info to put in the file .
Anyway , today I just felt very strongly that not only should I remind her of it , but to witness to her for the 1000th time and give her complete instructions on what to do as soon as we are gone .
I even went so far as to tell her as soon as we are gone that she is to go to a house that belongs to a friend since he will be gone too .
It is WAY off the grid .
I 'm going to talk to him about it tomorrow and get directions .
He loves Tiffany like his own granddaughter so I know it will be fine since all of his loved ones are going too .
I gave her the pin # to my atm and credit cards .
I told her to make sure that she plants as big a garden as she can and learn to can food .

From years of studying environmentalists I have come to the conclusion that they are both religion based and mentally ill .
This makes for a dangerous combination . [...]
The mental illness of environmentalism manifests itself is three forms ; Paranoid , Delusional and Criminal insanities . [...]
Since religious environmentalism is a mental disease it must be treated like one .
Those afflicted by the malady must be gathered into central locations and be treated by counseling , drug therapy , shock treatments or whatever is necessary to restore their sanity and return them to being productive members of society .
The state presently administers such treatments to other mentally ill citizen , even against their will , and therefore there is hope for environmentalists .
Legal methods -
Once the sick mind of an environmentalist forces him to cross the line to the realm outside the law they are to be dealt with as any other criminal is .
These criminal environmentalists are , in fact , terrorists .
They seek to achieve their goals by terrorizing the general population by criminal actions .
Like any criminal they have no regard for the rights or lives of their victims .
Judges , no matter how liberal , owe it to the general public to protect them from criminal environmentalists by sentencing them as they would any rapist or murderer .
They can show no leniency or preference in dealing with them .
If their minds can be salvaged through mental treatments they can return to society .
If not , then the general public is safer with them incarcerated .
The population of a nation is not to be held hostage by the mind of a crazy person .
Mentally ill environmentalists working in the news media are to be treated as any other environmentalist .
Counseling , drugs , incarceration , whichever turns them back into normal people .
Environmentalists can be saved from themselves .
If we have the courage to act !

We have made clear our opinions , but my wife and I do not make life uncomfortable for them because of our opinions .
When they announced that they were going to try and get pregnant , we sat them down and explained our position .
We explained why we believed that children should have a mother and a father and told them that , should they go though with this , we would sue for custody of our grandchild .
We assured them that living in the South that we had a better than even chance of winning .
Though they were not happy with our decision , they still visited and were welcomed and we have always been welcomed at their home .
They thought of moving elsewhere but did n't like any of the places with more liberal laws .

4 ) Evolutionists put their faith in beneficial random mutations which have never proven to be random .
5 ) Evolutionists put their faith in natural selection , which has never even been tested .
6 ) Evolutionists put their faith in flawed dating techniques .
7 ) Evolutionists put their faith in the hopes that humans are actually apes .
8 ) Evolutionists put their faith in the hopes that a monkey can morph into a human simply by hopping down from tree branches and walking out into wide open spaces .
9 ) Evolutionists put their faith that a giant explosion could produce order .
10 ) Evolutionists put their faith that DNA could self - organize from randomly arising chemicals .

What do the other human persons here think ?
No doubt someone will object , saying something obviously ridiculous like , but atheists are persons .
But clearly this is mistaken because anybody without a well developed belief in God is obviously not a full human person .
What could be more obvious than that ?
How many full human persons do you know without a well developed belief in God .
Obviously none , because if they were full human person they would have a well developed belief in God .
Now some people might object to killing atheists for there ( and obviously it is there and not thier as they are not whos but whats ) organs but think of all the full human persons that would benifit from the organs and the medical research that could be done on these non-persons .
How could anybody object , they are not human persons and if you think we should not kill them then that is just because of out dated ideas and because they must really just want people to suffer .
For shame on you !
So what do people think ?
Should we kill these atheist human non-persons for the benifit of fully human persons ?

REBUTTAL : The crusades were GOOD .

Thank God ( or the IPF for you atheists ) the Crusaders pushed the Muslilm hoarde out of Europe and threw them back into the desert .

ATHEIST TENANT OF FAITH # 3 ) Advanced , benevolent aliens exist .
I really believe this ... I * need * to believe this REBUTTAL : Yes , my little atheist friend , I know you do .

ATHEIST TENANT OF FAITH # 5 ) Xians are inferior in intelligence to the superior minded atheist .
I am on a higher plane of thinking than those irrational xians .
Their puny minds are no match to mine .
REBUTTAL : I know , my wittle atheist , how important it is for you to believe that .
Its ok , I know you are insecure and really need to see yourself in a superior light .
It 's kind of like natural selection : the weaker get extinguished and sometimes you feel like you are being smothered by the xians and need to cry out " TYRRANY OF THE MAJORITY ! " and appeal to a Constitution that appeals to an absolute moral law .
The sad thing is , my little atheist friend , is that your contradiction is all too obvious .

On the same day that the Hindu abomination occurred in our Senate chamber , the 13th day of July 2007 , the U.S. State Department Headquarters was attacked by what the Associated Press called killer wasps .
These killer wasps are two inches long , and thousands of them have chosen to nest in the State Department building in Washington , D.C.
It is being called a total infestation !
I immediately thought of Exodus 23:28 , which reads as follows : " And I will send hornets before thee , which shall drive out the Hivite , the Canaanite , and the Hittite , from before thee . "
I must note at this point , that the three nations mentioned in this verse worshipped the gods of earth , wind , and fire , just as the Hindus do .
This wasp infestation that occurred on the same day at the headquarters of the powerful State Department is a clear sign from the Almighty of judgment forthcoming .
Where are the Christian ministers who should be sounding the alarm ? "

Just imagine vast fields of our sisters in Christ -- sisters brain damaged and comatosed , never to mentally return to this Earth full of sin -- inserted into pods that are themselves connected to a myriad of wires and hydraulic tubes ( I know , it sounds exactly like the Matrix , and I freely admit , although it 's certainly a very evil movie , some of the imagery is inspiring and inspired this post ) .
The pods will be the most comfortable places on Earth , playing soothing music like Bible hymns and Mozart , their insides like a massage chair and covered in silk .
A few intruding wires and tubes will , of course , have to connect to the women inside the pods to monitor their temperature and overall health , as well as the babies ' of those that are pregnant .
And of course there will be one tube reserved for the insertion of a man 's seed whenever the women are at their most fertile .
And only the best semen will be used .
I have n't quite settled on a selection process yet , but I 'm thinking some sort of Christian council could perhaps vote on the man who is honorable and moral enough to breed generations of these children .
Perhaps one man wo n't be enough , for a little bit of diversity is always good .
We should , therefore , most likely have a multitude of different men , one of each race .
When the children are born , they can be sent off to special adoption centers , where they can be delivered to good Christian parents who are unable to themselves breed .
Those that may be left over can be raised in God , brought up in Christian schools , where prayers are said thrice daily ( at least ) , and in the summer , they can be sent to Jesus camp .
If the schools are as good as I envision , then these children will make the perfect leaders for our future .
But not just leaders , for if this idea is near as good as I am thinking , we will breed enough of these children to one day make up a huge percentage of our population , such that they can elect only the most Christian of people to the government .
So even those that are not the brightest and best can contribute to God in some way .

God revealed to me two things about the timing of the rapture .
God specifically told me 2007 was the year , because I was only going to have from 3 to 3 1/ 2 years to spread the message after my book was published .

The gov't can endorse religion , it can't force religion .
You say , well if its tax payer dollars buying the bibles , then the gov't is endorsing the religion , true , but perfectly ok .
Think of this .
A . If a gov't builds , or repairs a road that leads to a church , did they endorse the church ?
The church did benefit from the gov't funding that was used on the road .
How is that different then buying bibles ?
B . If a church uses the post office to send letters to people , is our post office , which is a gov't service endorsing them ?
You could say no , they are paying to send their own letters .
The truth however is that the post office if funded by tax dollars , even if you pay for your stamp , you are really just paying a tax based on consumption .
Not that terribly different then a sales tax .
Most people would think those above examples are perfectly fine .
They really are n't any different .
The road does n't make anyone go to the church , but it might improve turnout nontheless .
Handing out bibles does n't make anyone a christian , or make them go to church either .

Whoa .
Time out for a second .
First off : frequency does n't make this LESS tragic .

Should we not feel too bad about it because those numbers could be higher elsewhere ?
Second off , her race has nothing to do with this .
I assure you every person on this site would be just as horrified to see a girl of ANY race in this situation .
ALSO , I do n't think you can compare the atrocious acts of people in the throes of poverty faced with near impossible decisions , which is horrible enough , to a guy who ... really does n't seem to be forced with a terrible decision at all .

WASHINGTON  The United States is hundreds of millions of dollars behind in dues to international organizations ranging from the United Nations peacekeeping office to the agency that sets and enforces global labor standards .
The arrears have grown as the United States has fallen short on payments for missions it is obligated to support under international agreements .
The debt , at $ 293 million , is projected to hit $ 478 million by year 's end , based on data from the State Department and the Senate appropriations subcommittee that oversees it .
Nearly $ 160 million is owed for U.N. peacekeeping on obligations dating to 2005 , the data show , and that is likely to grow to $ 266 million this year .
Since early 2007 , the United States also has fallen into arrears of $ 51 million in dues to the regular U.N. budget — the first time it has n't paid all yearly dues in a decade .
The rest of the debt is owed to smaller groups , such as the International Labor Organization .
The United States relies on the United Nations and other organizations to advance " vital security , economic and humanitarian interests … and for years , our support has fallen short , " Sen .
Patrick Leahy , D - Vt. , told USA TODAY in a statement .
" Joint efforts through ( such groups ) cost us far less … and can also be more effective , " said Leahy , chair of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations .
Recent budgets have n't covered rising costs for those missions , especially peacekeeping , says George Abrahams of State 's Bureau of International Organization Affairs .
The United Nations has 17 peacekeeping missions , including a new one in Sudan 's Darfur region , he says , and the United States pays 25 % of costs .
In 2007 , the U.S. bill was $ 1.6 billion ; it 's likely to hit $ 2 billion in 2009 .
Overall U.S. debt to international organizations has risen as the dollar has lost value worldwide , Abrahams says .
The debts have not curtailed missions , but they hamper organizations ' ability to plan and staff them , says Deborah Derrick of the Better World Campaign , which builds support for U.N. efforts .
Many of those missions have grown at U.S. urging , Derrick says .
" It 's " hypocritical to not fund them fully . "
Several times since the mid-1990s , Congress has capped U.S. contributions to peacekeeping and other U.N. programs at 25 % of their cost , while the United Nations has set dues rates at up to 30 % .
As a result , the United Nations tallies the U.S. debt well above the $ 293 million the United States acknowledges .
Congress lifted the caps after Democrats took over last year , but recent budgets have n't included money to pay either the acknowledged debts or all current dues .
President Bush 's 2009 budget plan would put $ 50 million toward arrears .
Withholding dues can help leverage management fixes , says John Bolton , former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations .
" Having Congress prepared to do that actually strengthens your … hand in ( demanding ) reform . "

Intel is officially spinning off its NOR flash business .
The chip maker and STMicroelectronics wrapped up work on creating the new company , Numonyx , March 31 .
Intel contributed all of the assets of its NOR flash division to the new venture , while STMicroelectronics will add part of its NAND flash business to the new company .
" < img src= " /imagesvr_ez/b2bezp/2016/05/videobug4.gif?alias=original " alt =" videobug4.gif " />
Click Here to Watch the Latest eWEEK Newsbreak Video . "
Numonyx will work on creating both NAND - and NOR - based products .
The deal to create Numonyx has been brewing for months and comes as Intel is looking to fix its sagging memory business .
In a meeting with analysts earlier this month , CEO Paul Otellini said he was committed to fixing Intel 's own NAND business after it reported that it would miss its gross margins earnings due to less - than - expected prices for these memory chips .
The price of memory chips , especially NAND flash , has taken a hit due to the sluggish U.S. economy and an oversupplied market .
Although Otellini was unclear about how he planned to rescue Intel 's NAND business , he did say the company planned to invest in more cutting - edge technology , such as SSDs ( solid state drives ) .
While NAND flash technology has been used as the main memory component for devices such as Apple 's iPod music player , NOR technology has been used more in devices such as cell phones .
Intel is betting that NAND flash memory will stabilize in the coming months as more vendors begin using SSDs with their PCs and other devices .
Lenovo recently announced that its new ThinkPad x300 will only use an SSD , and it plans to include more of these flash - based drives within its laptops .
The creation of the new company also means that Intel will trim another 2,500 people from its payroll as they go to work for Numonyx , according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission .
The chip maker has been trying to reduce its head count since 2006 .
The company now has about 86,500 employees , down from a high of more than 100,000 , and its executives hope to reduce that number to 80,000 by the end of 2008 .
Intel will retain about a 45 percent ownership in Numonyx , while STMicroelectronics will control about 48 percent of the new company .
Another investor , Francisco Partners , will control about 6 percent .
A slightly different take on the news .
From last night ’s debate .
First , here ’s Hillary on the mortgage crisis :
I think it ’s imperative that we approach this mortgage crisis with the seriousness that it is presenting .
There are 95,000 homes in foreclosure in California right now .
I want a moratorium on foreclosures for 90 days so we can try to work out keeping people in their homes instead of having them lose their homes , and I want to freeze interest rates for five years .
As I noted last month , this is a horribly bad idea .
Now , here ’s Obama a few minutes later :
On the mortgage crisis , again , we both believe that this is a critical problem .
It ’s a huge problem in California and all across the country .
And we agree that we have to keep people in their homes .
I have put forward a $ 10 billion home foreclosure prevention fund that would help to bridge the lender and the borrower so that people can stay in their homes .
I have not signed on to the notion of an interest rates freeze , and the reason is not because we need to protect the banks .
The problem is , is that if we have such a freeze , mortgage interest rates will go up across the board and you will have a lot of people who are currently trying to get mortgages who will actually have more of a difficult time .

Welcome all that visit this site !
Stay tuned , I hope to have updates on this situation within a few days .
Update :
You know , this is probably the most excitement I 've had in awhile .
Should I feel bad about looking to destroy a pseudoscience teacher 's career ?
If I should , I 'll try , but I think I 'm having too good of a time right now .
I 'd like to know where I can bring up charges of violating the Separation of Church and State against Bryan Fischer :
I had the privilege last week to spend two hours with accelerated biology students at a Treasure Valley public school , invited by an open - minded science teacher .
I reviewed with these students the evidence for intelligent design and against the theory of evolution .
Along the way , I pointed out the dramatic differences that occur in society if we believe that man is merely an advanced ape rather than someone created in the image of God.
Surely Planned Parenthood ’s racism is one of the logical consequences of the embrace of evolution by our cultural elites .
I would also like for someone to point me to the school or the teacher him / herself that violated the trust of the public .
A word of warning to Idaho teachers :
If you choose to bring organized religion into your classroom and attempt to teach it as having any scientific merit I will find you and I will make sure you never work in the public school system again , got that ?
This is not an idle threat , this is absolutely serious .
If you can't respect the law , then you can go teach in a religious institution or at church camp .
The University of Colorado Regents have issued a statement apparently aimed at people who , like me , have deep reservations about their appointment of a highly partisan global warming denying oil executive who ’s less educated than 99 % of the college presidents in America and who has a track record of attacking the very foundations of tenure and academic freedom to run the university .
Put another way , a fox has been appointed head chicken .
While the Regents ’ letter is n’t quite as objectionable as Bruce Benson ’s rÃ©sumÃ© , it leaves a good deal to be desired .
I ’d like to walk through the statement and offer some comments on specific pieces of it , if I may .
Although the boardâ€™s vote was not unanimous , we do agree that it is important for us to work together to make the president successful .
That ’s one theory .
Another is that we do n’t necessarily want Benson to be successful , if success means doing what he did at Metro State .
Instead , we might all be well advised to work tirelessly to make sure he is n’t successful .
The sooner he ’s gone and replaced by a real university president , the sooner we can set about making CU a better university .
CU and all of Colorado higher education face a funding crisis , and we believe that Bruce Benson will provide the leadership and coalition - building skills to address that crisis .
He has demonstrated abilities in that arena .
Nobody questions his ability to raise money .
After all , look at his success with his anti-Democratic hit squad , the Trailhead Group .
The problem is that we ’re being asked to accept a couple of ludicrous assumptions : first , that money is the only thing that matters , and second , that there ’s nobody out there capable of being both a strong development officer and a strong academic officer .
There ’s a well - established Republican agenda regarding education in this state and everybody who ’s been here more than 15 minutes is aware of it if they ’re paying attention at all .
Occam ’s Razor suggests that Benson ’s appointment is perfectly in line with that project and that project alone .
Constitutionally , the president is the principal executive officer of the university and the laws of the regents require the president to be the chief academic officer of the university .
We believe Mr. Benson can fulfill those duties .
Here is the biggest lie we ’ve been told yet .
( Well , maybe not – it ’s possible that the six GOP regents do believe this to be true , but if so it only demonstrates their unfitness for the positions they held . )
A man with a Bachelor ’s degree is by definition not qualified to be chief academic officer of a university .
This is why the laws of regents include such a clause in the first place , and once Benson is gone and we have a more enlightened board , the first order of business needs to be amending those laws to specifically require a doctoral degree so that we can avoid future cases of rhetorical hanky - panky .
A BA or BS no more qualifies you for the role of chief academic officer than an undergrad degree in marketing qualifies you to be chief technical officer at Boeing , and the Regents ’ willingness to suggest otherwise suggests either that they ’re stupid or they think we are .
The Board of Regents recognizes that this decision is unpopular among some important groups .
We believe Mr. Benson will reach out to constituents in the first months of his presidency to build bridges and create partnerships , both inside and outside the university .
But we all have a role to play in those partnerships , and we trust the university community will pull together to support our new president .
I try to keep an open mind and I ’m willing to be proven wrong .
But I would n’t bet a penny on it .
The problem here , though , is that I ’m not sure we can afford to adopt a wait - and - see attitude , because every moment we wait is a moment that where Benson ’s likely pursuit of the same “ reforms ” we ’ve seen in the past goes unchecked .
Given this , I believe active protest should begin today and continue unabated until he is either gone or conclusively proves that he has changed , and dramatically .
Bruce Benson is a known quantity , a man with a proven , unambiguously anti-intellectual track record , and his appointment is not only ill - advised , it ’s an insult to the university community and to everyone in the state who believes in the liberating power of a comprehensive education .
I call on everyone at the university to pull together to make sure Benson ’s impact is limited exclusively to the role of fund - raiser .
Since the apparent operating theory here is that money is everything , I plan on being ready the next time my phone rings – and it always does – during a CU fund drive .
When they call , I ’m going to say something like this : “ Not one red cent until Bruce Benson is gone . ”
And I ’m going to make sure the hapless student making the call writes is down and sends it back up the ladder .
I hope my fellow Buff alums will all do the same .
While I have never once in my life voted a straight ticket or encouraged anyone else to , it ’s clear that Colorado citizens can no longer trust the Republican Party with the stewardship of its universities .
The university is in the predicament we see today because of Republican actions over the past 15 years .
Republican vision is the problem , Colorado , and it ’s hard to imagine that more Republican vision is the answer .
Man the lifeboats .
The idiots are winning .
Last week I watched , open - mouthed , a Newsnight piece on the spread of " Brain Gym " in British schools .
I 'd read about Brain Gym before - a few years back , in Ben Goldacre 's excellent Bad Science column for this newspaper - but seeing it in action really twisted my rage dial .
Brain Gym , y'see , is an " educational kinesiology " programme designed to improve kiddywink performance .
It 's essentially a series of simple exercises lumbered with names that make you want to steer a barbed wire bus into its creator 's face .
One manoeuvre , in which you massage the muscles round the jaw , is called the " energy yawn " .
Another involves activating your " brain buttons " by forming a " C " shape with one hand and pressing it either side of the collarbone while simultaneously touching your stomach with the other hand .
Throughout the report I was grinding my teeth and shaking my head - a movement I call a " dismay churn " .
Not because of the sickening cutesy - poo language , nor because I 'm opposed to the nation 's kids being forced to exercise ( make them box at gunpoint if you want ) but because I care about the difference between fantasy and reality , both of which are great in isolation , but , like chalk and cheese or church and state , are best kept separate .
Confuse fantasy with reality and you might find yourself doing crazy things , like trying to wave hello to Ian Beale each time you see him on the telly , or buying homeopathic remedies - both of which are equally boneheaded pursuits .
( Incidentally , if anyone disagrees with this assessment and wants to write in defending homeopathy , please address your letters to myself c/o the Kingdom of Narnia . )
Perhaps the Department for Children , Schools and Families confused fantasy with reality the day it endorsed Brain Gym .
Because while Brain Gym 's coochy - coo exercises may well be fun or relaxing , what they 're definitely good at is increasing the flow of bullshit into children 's heads .
For instance , according to the Brain Gym teacher 's manual , performing the " brain button " exercise increases the flow of " electromagnetic energy " and helps the brain send messages from the right hemisphere to the left .
Brain Gym can also " connect the circuits of the brain " , " clear blockages " and activate " emotional centering " .
Other Brain Gym material contains the startling claim that " all liquids [ other than water ] are processed in the body as food , and do not serve the body 's water needs ... processed foods do not contain water . "
All of which sounds like hooey to me .
And also to the British Neuroscience Association , the Physiological Society and the charity Sense About Science , who have written to every local education authority in the land to complain about Brain Gym 's misrepresentation of , um , reality .
Wander round Brain Gym's UK website for a few minutes .
It 's a festival of pseudoscientific chuckles where impressive phrases such as " educational kinesiology " and " sensorimotor program " rub shoulders with bald admissions that " we are not yet at the stage where we have any scientific evidence for what happens in the brain through the use of Brain Gym " .
Look at the accredited practitioners of the art : top of their list of qualified Brain Gym " instructor / consultants " is a woman who is apparently also a " chiropractor for humans and animals " .
That 's nothing : I read tarot cards for fish .
And check out the linked bookshop , Body Balance Books .
Alongside Brain Gym guides and wallcharts , it stocks titles such as Awakening the Child Heart and Resonance Kinesiology , which , apparently , " holds information on how to move forward with truth , without the overlays of people 's beliefs and ideas about what is best for themselves and others " .
Huh ?
If we mistrust the real world so much that we 're prepared to fill the next generation 's heads with a load of gibbering crap about " brain buttons " , why stop there ?
Why not spice up maths by telling kids the number five was born in Greece and invented biscuits ?
Replace history lessons with screenings of the Star Wars trilogy ?
Teach them how to whistle in French ?
Let 's just issue the kids with blinkers .
Because we , the adults , do n't just gleefully pull the wool over our own eyes - we knit permanent blindfolds .
We 've decided we hate facts .
Hate , hate , hate them .
Everywhere you look , we 're down on our knees , gleefully lapping up neckful after neckful of steaming , cloddish bullshit in all its forms .
From crackpot conspiracy theories to fairytale nutritional advice , from alternative medicine to energy yawns - we just can't get enough of that musky , mudlike taste .
Brain Gym is just one small tile in an immense and frightening mosaic of fantasy .
Still , that 's just my opinion .
Lots of people clearly think Brain Gym is worthwhile , or they would n't be prepared to pay through the nose for it .
If you 're one of them , here 's an exciting new kinesiological exercise that should dramatically increase your self - awareness - and I 'm giving it away free of charge .
Ready ?
OK .
Curl the fingers of your right hand inward , meeting the thumb to form a circle .
Jerk it rhythmically up and down in front of your face .
Repeat for six hours .
Then piss off .

The text of : Galileo Galilei Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems , 1632
Galileo Galilei ( 1564-1642 ) Today Galileo is a famous and romantic name .
We have all been taught the story of his heroic fight in the name of science against the intractable ignorance of the tyrannical Catholic church .
The reality is not so starkly drawn , but no less interesting for that ; Galileo ’s own arrogance created many enemies , and Rome ’s anxiety over its authority in the schismatic era of the Protestant reformation made their collision inevitable .
Galileo was a professor of mathematics , first at the University of Pisa , where he had been born , and then at Padua , perhaps establishing a reputation for his willingness to offend Aristotelian philosophers perhaps , with the publication of De Motu ( On Motion ) , but for little more .
But while continuing to work as a mathematician , Galileo ’s interest in philosophy ( i.e. , physics ) and then astronomy grew .
With the publication of Siderius Nuncius , or The Starry Messenger , in 1610  in which he recorded the sights he had seen with the newly invented telescope , including the moons of Jupiter , and the mountains of our own moon - Galileo was instantly famous across Europe .
He was also in the midst of controversy , for few believed him until his findings could be verified by others with what was still a very rare instrument ( Galileo had made his own ) and even then there were disputes as to what those finding really were .
This controversy was no impediment to his ambitions , and his cultivation of the patronage of Cosimo de Medici , Duke of Florence - to whom he had dedicated his book , and whose name he gave to the Jovian moons - led to his being named " Chief Mathematician of the University of Pisa and Philosopher to the Grand Duke . "
Mathematicians and astronomers were not equivalent in the hierarchy of arts to philosophy , and in his new position Galileo ’s wars with the Aristotelian philosophers escalated , for physics was becoming his principle interest .
In 1615 he went to Rome to argue on behalf of the merits of the Copernican theory , but the political atmosphere was such that Copernicus ’
De Revolutionibus was placed on the Index of Prohibited Books in 1616 , and his theory declared " foolish and absurd philosophically and formally heretical inasmuch as it expressly contradicts the doctrines of the holy scripture . "
There is evidence that Galileo was warned against promoting the Copernican theory at this time .
A Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems first made it past the censors by purporting to be neutral on the astronomical debate .
Its failure to do so was but one of the objections raised after publication .
It had taken the Catholic Church seventy - three years to deem it neccessary to ban De Revolutionibus , but when Galileo published A Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems in 1632 , it reacted within in five months , and in 1633 his famous trial and recantation took place .
Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems Galileo Galilei TO THE DISCERNING READER
Several years ago there was published in Rome a salutary edict which , in order to obviaie the dangerous tendencies of our present age , imposed a seasonable silence upon the Pythagorean opinion that the earth moves
There were those who impudently asserted that this decree had its origin not injudicious inquire , but in passion none too well informed Complaints were to be heard that advisers who were totally unskilled at astronomical observations ought not to clip the wings of reflective intellects by means of rash prohibitions .
Upon hearing such carping insolence , my eal could not be contained Being thoroughly informed about that prudent determination , I decided to appear openly in the theater of the world as a witness of the sober truth .
I was at that time in Rome ; I was not only received by the most eminent prelates of that Court , but had their applause ; indeed this decree was not published without some previous notice of it having been given to me .
Therefore I propose in the present work to show to foreign nations that as much is understood of this matter in Italy , and pariicularly in Rome , as transalpine diligence can ever have imagined Collecting all the reflections thai properly concern the Copernican system , I shall make it known that everything was brought before the attention of the Roman censorship , and that there proceed from this clime not only dogmas for the welfare of the soul , but ingenious discoveries for the delight of the mind as well .
To this end I have taken the Copernican side in the disco urse , proceeding as with a pure mathematical hypothesis and striving by every artipee to represent it as superior to supposing the earth motionless–not , indeed absolutely , but as against the arguments of some professed Peripatetics .
( note 1 ) These men indeed deserve not even that name , for they do not walk about ; they are content to adore the shadows , philosophizing not with due circumspection but merely from having memorized a fow ill - understood principles .
Three principal headings are treated First , I shall try to show that all experiments practicable upon the earth are inszyfficient measures for proving its mobility , since they are indiferently adaptable to an earth in motion or at rest .
I hope in so doing to reveal many observations unknown to the ancients .
Secondly , the celestial phenomena will be examined strengthening the Copernican hypothesis until it might seem that this must triumph absolutely .
Here new reflections are adjoined which might be used in order to simplfy astronomy , though not because of any necess ire importeded by nature .
In the third place , I shall propose an ingenious speculation .
It happens that long ago I said that the unsolved problem of the ocean tides might receive some light from assuming the motion of the earth .
This assertion of mine , passing by word of mouth , found loving fathers who adopted it as a child of their own ingenuity .
Now , so that no stranger may ever a who , arming himself with our weapons , shall charge us with want of attention to such an important matter , I have thought it good to reveal those probabilities which might render this plausible , given that the earth moves .
I hope that from these considerations the world will come to know that if other nations have navigated more , we have not theorized less .
It is not from failing to take count of what others have thought that we have yielded to asserting that the earth is motionless , and holding the contrary to be a mere mathematical caprice , but ( if for nothing else ) for those reasons that are supplied by piety , religion , the knowledge of Divine Omnipotence , and a consciousness of the limitations of the human mind I have thought it most appropriate to explain these concepts in the form of dialogues , which , no !
being restricted to the rigorous observance of mathematical laws , make room also for digressions which are sometimes no less interesting than the principal argument .
Many years ago I was often to be found in the marvelous city of Venice , in discussions with Signore Giovanni Francesco Sagredo , a man of noble extraction and trenchant wit .
Prom Florence came Signore Filippo Salviati , the least of whose glories were the eminence of his blbod and the magnfficence of his fortune .
His was a sublime intellect which fed no more hungrily upon any pleasure than it did upon fine meditations .
I often talked with these two of such matters in the presence of a certain Peripatetic philosopher whose greatest obstacle in apprehending the truth seemed to be the reputation he had acquired by his interpretations of Aristotle .
( note 2 ) Now , since bitter death has deprived Venice and Florence of those two great luminaries in the very meridian of their years , I have resolved to make their fame live on in these pages , so far as my poor abilities will permit , by introducing them as interlocutors in the present argument .
( Nor shall the good Peripatetic lack a place ; because of his excessive affection toward the Commentaries of Simplicius , ( note 3 ) I have thought fit to leave him under the name of the author he so much revered , without mentioning his own )
May it please those two great souls , ever venerable to my heart , to accept this public monument of my undying love .
And may the memory of their eloquence assist me in delivering to posterity the promised reflections .
It happened that several discussions had taken place casually at various times among these gentlemen , and had rather whetted than satisfied their thirst for learning .
Hence very wisely they resolved to meet together on certain days during which , setting aside all other business , they might apply themselves more methodically to the contemplation ofthe wonders of God in the heavens and upon the earth .
They met in the palace of the illustrious Sagredo ; and , after the customary but brief exchange of compliments , Saiviati commenced as follows .
note 1 i.e. Aristoteleans : literally " those who walk around . "
Aristotle used to walk about the Lyceum note 2 Sagredo was , in fact , a close friend of Galileo , and represents in the dialogue the neutral position of an open - minded man of letters : Salviati is the man of science , Galileo himself ; the philosopher , who will be called Simplicio is a fictitious , a straw man .

Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems THE FIRST DAY INTERLOCUTORS SALVIATI , SAGRFDO , AND SIIMPLICIO SALVIATI .
Yesterday we resolved to meet today and discuss as clearly and in as much detail as possible the character and the efficacy of those laws of nature which up to the present have been put forth by the partisans of the Aristotelian and Ptolemaic position on the one hand , and by the followers of the Copemican system on the other .
Since Copernicus places the earth among the movable heavenly bodies , making it a globe like a planet , we may well begin our discussion by examining the Peripatetic steps in arguing the impossibility of that hypothesis ; what they are , and how great is their force and effect .
For this it is necessary to introduce into nature two substances which differ essentially .
These are the celestial and the elemental , the former being invariant and eternalo the latter , temporary and destructible .
This argument Aristotle treats in his book De Caelo , introducing it with some discourses dependent upon certain general assumptions , and afterwards confirming it by experiments and specific demonstrations .
Following the same method , I shall first propound , and then freely speak my opinion , submitting myself to your criticisms  particularly those of Simplicio , that stout champion and defender of Aristotelian doctrines .
The first step in the Peripatetic arguments is Aristotle ’s proof of the completeness and perfection of the world .
For , he tells us , it is not a mere line , nor a bare surface , but a body having length , breadth , and depth .
Since there are only these three dimensions , the world , having these , has them all , and , having the Whole , is perfect .
To be sure , I much wish that Aristotle had proved to me by rigorous deductions that simple length constitutes the dimension which we call a line , which by the addition of breadth becomes a surface ; that by further adding altitude or depth to this there results a body , and that after these three dimensions there is no passing farther  so that by these three alone , completeness , or , so to speak , wholeness is concluded .
Especially since he might have done so very plainly and speedily .
SIMP .
What about the elegant demonstrations in the second , third , and fourth texts , after the definition of " continuous " ?
Is it not there first proved that there are no more than three dimensions , since Three is everything , and everywhere ?
And is this not confirmed by the doctrine and authority of the Pythagoreans , who say that all things are determined by three  beginning , middle , and end  which is the number of the Whole ?
Also , why leave out another of his reasons ; namely , that this number is used , as if by a law of nature , in sacrifices to the gods ?
Furthermore , is it not dictated by nature that we attribute the title of " all " to those things that are three , and not less ?
For two are called " both , " and one does not say " all " unless there are three .
You have all this doctrine in the second text .
Afterwards , in the third we read , ad pleniorem Scientiam , ( note : For greater knowledge . ) that All , and Whole , and Perfect are formally one and the same ; and that therefore among figures only the solid is complete .
For it alone is determined by three , which is All ; and , being divisible in three ways , it is divisible in every possible way .
Of the other figures , one is divisible in one way , and the other in two , because they have their divisibility and their continuity according to the number of dimensions allotted to them .
Thus one figure is continuous in one way , the other in two ; but the third , namely the solid , is so in every way .
Moreover , in the fourth text , after some other doctrines , does he not clinch the matter with another proof ?
To wit : a transition is made only according to some defect ; thus there is a transition in passing from the line to the surface , because the line is lacking in breadth .
But it is impossible for the perfect to lack anything , being complete in every way ; therefore there is no transition beyond the solid or body to any other figure .
Do you not think that in all these places he has sufficiently proved that there is no passing beyond the three dimensions , length , breadth , and thickness ; and that therefore the body , or solid , which has them all , is perfect ?
SALV .
To tell you the truth , I do not feel impelled by all these reasons to grant any more than this : that whatever has a beginning , middle , and end may and ought to be called perfect .
I feel no compulsion to grant that the number three is a perfect number , nor that it has a faculty of conferring perfection upon its possessors .
I do not even understand , let alone believe , that with respect to legs , for example , the number three is more perfect than four or two ; neither do I conceive the number four to be any imperfection in the elements , nor that they would be more perfect if they were three .
Therefore it would have been better for him to leave these subtleties to the rhetoricians , and to prove his point by rigorous demonstrations such as are suitable to make in the demonstrative sciences .
SIMP .
It seems that you ridicule these reasons , and yet all of them are doctrines to the Pythagoreans , who attribute so much to numbers .
You , who are a mathematician , and who believe many Pythagorean philosophical opinions , now seem to scorn their mysteries .
SALV .
That the Pythagoreans held the science of the human understanding and believed it to partake of divinity simply because it understood the nature of numbers , I know very well ; nor am I far from being of the same opinion .
But that these mysteries which caused Pythagoras and his sect to have such veneration for the science of numbers are the follies that abound in the sayings and Writings of the vulgar , I do not believe at all .
Rather I know that , in order to prevent the things they admired from being exposed to the slander and scorn of the common people , the Pythagoreans condemned as sacrilegious the publication of the most hidden properties of numbers or of the incommensurable and irrational quantities which they investigated .
They taught that anyone who had revealed them was tormented in the other world .
Therefore I believe that some one of them , just to satisfy the common sort and free himself from their inquisitiveness , gave it out that the mysteries of numbers were those trifles which later spread among the vulgar .
Such astuteness and prudence remind one of the wise young man who , in order to stop the importunity of his mother or his inquisitive wife 
I forget which  who pressed him to impart the secrets of the Senate , made up some story which afterwards caused her and many other women to be the laughing - stock of that same Senate .
SIMP .
I do not want to join the number of those who are too curious about the Pythagorean mysteries .
But as to the point in hand , I reply that the reasons produced by Aristotle to prove that there are not and cannot be more than three dimensions seem to me conclusive ; and I believe that if a more cogent demonstration had existed , Aristotle would not have omitted it .
SAGR .
You might at least add , " if he had known it or if it had occurred to him . "
Salviati , you would be doing me a great favor by giving me some effective arguments .
if there are any clear enough to be comprehended by me .
SALV .
Not only by you , but by Simplicio too ; and not merely comprehended , but already known  though perhaps without your realizing it .
And to make them easier to understand , let us take this paper and pen which I see already prepared for such occasions , and draw a few figures .
First we shall mark these two points , A and B , and draw from one to the other the curved lines ACB and ADE , and the straight line P3 . ( Fig. 1 ) I ask which of them is to your mind the one that determines the distance between the ends A and B , and why ?
SAGR .
I should say the straight line , and not the curves , because the straight one is shorter and because it is unique , distinct , and determinate ; the infinite others are indefinite , unequal , and longer .
It seems to me that the choice ought to depend upon that which is unique and definite .
SALV .
We have the straight line , then , as determining the distance between the two points .
We now add another straight line parallel to AB  let it be CD  so that between them there lies a surface of which I want you to show the breadth .
( Fig . 2 ) Therefore starting from point A , tell me how and which way you will go , stopping on the line CD , so as to show me the breadth included between those lines .
Would you determine it according to the measure of the curve AF , or the straight line AF , or . . . ?
SIMP .
According to the straight line AF , and not according to the curve , such being already excluded for such a use .
SAGR .
But I should take neither of them , seeing that the straight line AF runs obliquely .
I should draw a line perpendicular to CD , for this would seem to me to be the shortest , as well as being unique among the infinite number of longer and unequal ones which may be drawn from the point A to every other point of the opposite line CD .
SALV .
Your choice and the reason you adduce for it seem to me most excellent .
So now we have it that the first dimension is determined by a straight line ; the second ( namely , breadth ) by another straight line , and not only straight , but at right angles to that which determines the length .
Thus we have defined the two dimensions of a surface ; that is , length and breadth .
But suppose you had to determine a height  for example , how high this platform is from the pavement down below there .
Seeing that from any point in the platform we may draw infinite lines , curved or straight , and all of different lengths , to the infinite points of the pavement below , which of all these lines would you make use of ?
SAGR .
I would fasten a string to the platform and , by hanging a plummet from it , would let it freely stretch till it reached very near to the pavement ; the length of such a string being the straightest and shortest of all the lines that could possibly be drawn from the same point to the pavement , I should say that it was the true height inthis case .
SALV .
Very good .
And if , from the point on the pavement indicated by this hanging string ( taking the pavement to be level and not inclined ) , you should produce two other straight lines , one for the length and the other for the breadth of the surface of the pavement , what angles would they make with the thread ?
SAGR .
They would surely meet at right angles , since the string faIls perpendicularly and the pavement is quite flat and level .
SALV
Therefore if you assign any point for the point of origin of your measurements , and from that produce a straight line as the determinant of the first measurement ( that is , of the length ) it will necessarily follow that the one which is to define the breadth leaves the first at a right angle .
That which is to denote the altitude , which is the third dimen sion , going out from the same point , also forms right angles and not oblique angles with the other two .
And thus by three perpendiculars you will have determined the three dimensions AB length , AC breadth , and AD height , by three unique , definite , and shortest lines .
( Fig. 3 ) And since clearly no more lines can meet in the said point to make right angles with them , and the dimensions must be determined by the only straight lines which make right angles with each other , then the dimensions are no more than three ; and whatever has the three has all of them , and that which has all of them is divisible in every way , and that which is so , is perfect , etc. SIMP .
Who says that I cannot draw other lines ?
Why may I not bring another line from beneath to the point A , which will be perpendicular to the rest ?
SALV .
Surely you cannot make more than three straight lines meet in the same point and form right angles with each other !
SAGR .
Yes , because it seems to me that what Simphcio means would be the same DA prolonged downward .
In that way there might also be drawn two others ; but they would be the same as the first three , differing only in that whereas now they merely touch , they would then intersect .
But this would not produce any new dimensions .
SIMP .
I shall not say that this argument of yours cannot be conclusive .
But I still say , with Aristotle , that in physical ( nwurali ) matters one need not always require a mathematical demonstration .
SAGR .
Granted , where none is to be had ; but when there is one at hand , why do you not wish to use it ?
But it would be good to spend no more words on this point , for I think that Salviati will have conceded both to Aristotle and to you , without further demonstration , that the world is a body , and perfect ; yea , most perfect , being the chief work of God. SALV .
Exactly so .
Therefore leaving the general contemplation of the whole , let us get to the consideration of the pans .
Aristotle in his first division separates the whole into two differing and , in a way , contrary parts : namely , the celestial and the elemental , the former being ingenerable , incorruptible , inalterable , impenetra ble , etc. ; the latter being exposed to continual alteration , mutation , etc .
He takes this difference from the diversity of local motions as his original principle .
With this step he proceeds .
Leaving , so to speak , the sensible world and retiring into the ideal world , he begins architec tonically to consider that , nature being the principle of motion , it is appropriate that natural bodies should be endowed with local motion .
He then declares local motions to be of three kinds : namely , circular , straight , and mixed straight - and - circular .
The first two he calls simple , because of all lines only the circular and the straight are simple .
Hereupon , restricting himself somewhat , he newly defines among the simple motions one , the circular , to be that which is made around the center ; and the other , the straight , to be upward and downward  upward , that which goes from the center ; and downward , whatever goes toward the center .
And from this he infers it to be necessary and proper that all simple motions are confined to these three kinds ; namely , toward the center , away from the center , and around the center .
This answers , he says , with a certain beautiful harmony to what has been said previously about the body ; it is perfect in three things , and its motion is likewise .
These motions being established , he goes on to say that some natural bodies being simple , and others composites of those ( and he calls those bodies simple which have a natural principle of motion , such as fire and earth ) , it is proper that simple motions should be those of simple bodies , and that mixed motions should belong to compound bodies ; in such a way , moreover , that compounds take the motion of that part which predominates in their composition .
SAGR .
Wait awhile , Salviati , for in this argument 1 find so many doubts assailing me on all sides that I shall either have to tell them to you if I want to pay attention to what you are going to say , or withhold my attention in order to remember my doubts .
SALV .
I shall willingly pause , for I run the same risk too , and am on the verge of getting shipwrecked .
At present I sail between rocks and boisterous waves that are making me lose my bearings , as they say .
Therefore , before I multiply your difficulties , propound them .
( The three now embark on a discussion qfmouion and velocity ( i.e. physics )  which leads in time to arguments about the location to the center of the universe and whether or not the heavens are act ualivincorrupnble  wit hSimpZicioconunuing to generally adhere to and defend Aristotle ’s theories , while Sugredo and Salviati , using a combination of logic and specific examples in nature , continue to cast doubt on the coherence of the Aristotelian model , pointing out inconsis tencies and fallacies . )
SALV .
I see we are once more going to engulf ourselves in a boundless sea from which there is no getting out , ever .
This is navigating without compass , stars , oars , or rudder , in which we must needs either pass from bank to bank or run aground , or sail forever lost .
If , as you suggested , we are to get on with our main subject , it is necessary for the present to put aside the general question whether straight motion is necessary in nature and is proper to some bodies , and proceed to demonstrations , observations , and particular experiments .
First we must propound all those that have been put forward to prove the earth ’s stability by Aristotle , Ptolemy , and others , trying next to resolve them .
Finally we must produce those by which a person may become persuaded that the earth , no less than the moon or any other planet , is to be numbered among the natural bodies that move circularly .
SAGR .
I submit to the latter more willingly , as I am better satisfied with your architectonic and general discourse than with that of Aristotle .
For yours satisfies me without the least misgiving , while the other blocks me in some way at every turn .
Nor do I know why Simplicio should not be quickly satisfied with the argument you put forward to prove that motion in a straight line can have no place in nature , so long as we suppose the parts of the universe to be disposed in the best arrangement and perfectly ordered .
SALV .
Stop there , Sagredo .
for now a way occurs to me in which Simplicio may be given satisfaction , provided only that he does not wish to stay so closely tied to every phrase of Aristotle ’s as to hold it sacrilege to depart from a single one of them .
There is no doubt that to maintain the optimum placement and perfect order of the parts of the universe as to local situation , nothing will do but circular motion or rest .
As to motion by a straight line , I do not see how it can be of use for anything except to restore to their natural location such integral bodies as have been accidentally removed and separated from their whole , as we have just said .
Let us now consider the whole terrestrial globe , and let us see what can happen to make it and the other world bodies keep themselves in the natural and best disposition .
One must either say that it is at rest and remains perpetually immovable in its place , or else that it stays always in its place but revolves itself , or finally that it goes about a center , moving along the circumference of a circle .
Of these events , Aristotle and Ptolemy and all their followers say that it is the first which has always been observed and which will be forever maintained ; that is , perpetual rest in the same place .
Now why , then , should they not have said from the start that its natural property is to remain motionless , rather than making its natural motion downward , a motion with which it never did and never will move ?
And as to motion by a straight line , let it be granted to us that nature makes use of this to restore particles of earth , water , air , fire , and every other integral mundane body to their whole , when any of them find themselves separated and transported into some improper place unless this restoration can also be made by finding some more appropriate circular motion .
It seems to me that this original position fits all the consequences much better , even by Aristotle ’s own method , than to attribute straight motion as an intrinsic and natural principle of the elements .
This is obvious ; for let me ask the Peripatetic if , being of the opinion that celestial bodies are incorruptible and eternal , he believes that the terrestrial globe is not so , but corruptible and mortal , so that there will come a time when , the sun and moon and other stars continuing their existence and their operations , the earth will not be found in the universe but will be annihilated along with the rest of the elements , and I am certain that he would answer , No .
Therefore generation and corruption belong to the parts and not to the whole ; indeed , to very small and superficial parts which are insensible in comparison to the whole mass .
Now since Aristotle argues generation and corruption from the contrariety of straight motions , let us grant such motions to the parts , which alone change and decay .
But to the whole globe and sphere of the elements will be ascribed either circular motion or perpetual continuance in its proper place  the only tendencies fined for the perpetuation and maintenance of perfect order .
What is thus said of earth may be said as reasonably of fire and of the greater part of the air , to which elements the Peripatetics are forced to assign as an intrinsic and natural motion one with which they were never moved and never will be , and to abolish from nature that motion with which they move , have moved , and are to be moved perpetually .
I say this because they assign an upward motion to air and fire , which is a motion that never belongs to the said elements , but only to some of their parti cles  and even then only to restore them to perfect arrangement when they are out of their natural places .
On the other hand , they call circular motion ( with which they are incessantly moved ) preternatural to them , forgetting what Aristotle has said many times , that nothing violent can last very long .
SIMP .
To all these things we have the most suitable answers , which I omit for the present in order that we may come to the particular reasons and sensible experiments which ought to be finally preferred , as Aristotle well says , above anything that can be supplied by human argument .
SAGR .
Then what has been said up to now will serve to place under consideration which of two general arguments has the more probability .
First there is that of Aristotle , who would persuade us that sublunar bodies are by nature generable and corruptible , etc. , and are therefore very different in essence from celestial bodies , these being invariant , ingenerable , incorruptible , etc .
This argument is deduced from differences of simple motions .
Second is that of Salviati , who assumes the integral parts of the world to be disposed in the best order , and as a necessary consequence excludes straight motions for simple natural bodies as being of no use in nature ; he takes the earth to be another of the celestial bodies , endowed with all the prerogatives that belong to them .
The latter reasoning suits me better up to this point than the other .
Therefore let Simplicio be good enough to produce all the specific arguments , experiments , and observations , both physical and astronomical , by which one may be fully persuaded that the earth differs from the celestial bodies , is immovable , and is located in the center of the universe , or anything else that would exclude the earth from being movable like a planet such as Jupiter , or the moon , etc .
And you , Salviati , have the kindness to reply step by step .
SIMP .
For a beginning , then , here are two powerful demonstrations proving the earth to be very different from celestial bodies .
First , bodies that are generable corruptible , alterable , etc. , are quite different from those that are ingenerable , incorruptible , inalterable , etc .
The earth is generable , corruptible , alterable , etc. , while celestial bodies are ingenerable , incorruptible , inalterable , etc .
Therefore the earth is very different from the celestial bodies .
SAGR .
With your first argument , you bring back to the table what has been standing there all day and has just now been carried away .
SIMP .
Softly , sir ; hear the rest , and you will see how different it is from that .
Formerly the minor premise was proved a priori , and now I wish to prove it a posteriori .
See for yourself whether this is the same thing .
I shall prove the minor , because the major is obvious .
Sensible experience shows that on earth there are continual generations , corruptions , alter - ations , etc. , the like of which neither our senses nor the traditions or memories of our ancestors have ever detected in heaven ; hence heaven is inalterable , etc. , and the earth alterable , etc. , and therefore different from the heavens .
The second argument I take from a principal and essential property , which is this : whatever body is naturally dark and devoid of light is different from luminous and resplendent bodies ; the earth is dark and without light , and celestial bodies are splendid and full of light ; therefore , etc .
Answer these , so that too great a pile does not accumulate , and then I will add others .
SALV .
As to the first , for whose force you appeal to experience , I wish you would tell me precisely what these alterations are that you see on the earth and not in the heavens , and on account of which you call the earth alterable and the heavens not .
SIMP .
On earth I continually see herbs , plants , animals generating and decaying ; winds , rains , tempests , storms arising ; in a word , the appearance of the earth undergoing perpetual change .
None of these changes are to be discerned in celestial bodies , whose positions and configurations correspond exactly with everything men remember , without the generation of anything new there or the corruption of anything old .
SALV .
But if you have to content yourself with these visible , or rather these seen experiences , you must consider China and America celestial bodies , since you surely have never seen in them these alterations which you see in Italy .
Therefore , in your sense , they must be inalter - able .
SIMP .
Even if I have never seen such alterations in those places with my own senses , there are reliable accounts of them ; besides which , cum eadem sit ratio totius et partium ( note :
Since the rational should be the same for the whole or the part . ) , those counties being a pan of the earth like ours , they must be alterable like this .
SALV .
But why have you not observed this , instead of reducing yourself to having to believe the tales of others ?
Why not see it with your own eyes ?
SIMP .
Because those countries are far from being exposed to view ; they are so distant that our sight could not discover such alterations in them .
SALV .
Now see for yourself how you have inadvertently revealed the fallacy of your argument .
You say that alterations which may be seen near at hand on earth cannot be seen in America because of the great distance .
Well , so much the less could they be seen in the moon , which is many hundreds of times more distant .
And if you believe in alterations in Mexico on the basis of news from there , what reports do you have from the moon to convince you that there are no alterations there ?
From your not seeing alterations in heaven ( where if any occurred you would not be able to see them by reason of the distance , and from whence no news is to be had ) , you cannot deduce that there are none , in the same way as from seeing and recognizing them on earth you correctly deduce that they do exist here .
SIMP .
Among the changes that have taken place on earth I can find some so great that if they had occurred on the moon they could yen well have been observed here below .
From the oldest records we have it that formerly , at the Straits of Gibraltar , Abila and Calpe were joined together with some lesser mountains which held the ocean in check ; but these mountains being separated by some cause , the opening admitted the sea , which flooded in so as to form the Mediterranean .
When we consider the immensity of this , and the difference in appearance which must have been made in the water and land seen from afar , there is no doubt that such a change could easily have been seen by anyone then on the moon .
Just so would the inhabitants of earth have discovered any such alteration in the moon ; yet there is no history of such a thing being seen .
Hence there remains no basis for saying that anything in the heavenly bodies is alterable , etc. SALV .
I do not make bold to say that such great changes have taken place in the moon , but neither am I sure that they could not have happened .
Such a mutation could be represented to us only by some variation between the lighter and the darker parts of the moon , and I doubt whether we have had observant selenographers on earth who have for any considerable number of years provided us with such exact selenography as would make us reasonably conclude that no such change has come about in the face of the moon .
Of the moon ’s appearance , I find no more exact description than that some say it represents a human face ; others , that it is like the muzzle of a lion ; still others , that it is Cain with a bundle of thorns on his back .
So to say " Heaven is inalterable , because neither in the moon nor in other celestial bodies are such alterations seen as are discovered upon the earth " has no power to prove anything .
SAGR .
This first argument of Simplicio ’s leaves me with another haunting doubt which I should like to have removed .
Accordingly I ask him whether the earth was generable and corruptible before the Mediterranean inundation , or whether it began to be so then ?
SIMP .
It was without doubt generable and corruptible before , as well ; but that was so vast a mutation that it might have been observed as far as the moon .
SAGR .
Well , now ; if the earth was generable and corruptible before that flood , why may not the moon be equally so without any such change ?
Why is something necessary in the moon which means nothing on the earth ?
SALV .
A very penetrating remark .
But I am afraid that Simplicio is altering the meaning a bit in this text of Aristotle and the other Peripatetics .
They say that they hold the heavens to be inalterable because not one star there has ever been seen to be generated or corrupted , such being probably a lesser part of heaven than a city is of the earth ; yet innumerable of the latter have been destroyed so that not a trace of them remains .
SAGR .
Really , I thought otherwise , believing that Simplicio distorted this exposition of the text so that he might not burden the Master and his disciples with a notion even more fantastic than the other .
What folly it is to say , " The heavens are inalterable because stars are not generated or corrupted in them . "
Is there perhaps someone who has seen one terrestrial globe decay and another regenerated in its place ?
Is it not accepted by all philosophers that very few stars in the heavens are smaller than the earth , while a great many are much bigger ?
So the decay of a star in heaven would be no less momentous than for the whole terrestrial globe to be destroyed !
Now if , in order to be able to introduce generation and corruption into the universe with certainty , it is necessary that as vast a body as a star must be corrupted and regenerated , then you had better give up the whole matter ; for I assure you that you will never see the terrestrial globe or any other integral body in the universe so corrupted that , after having been seen for many ages past , it dissolves without leaving a trace behind .
SALV .
But to give Simplicio more than satisfaction , and to reclaim him if possible from his error , I declare that we do have in our age new events and observations such that if Aristotle were now alive , I have no doubt he would change his opinion .
This is easily inferred from his own manner of philosophizing , for when he writes of considering the heavens inalterable , etc. , because no new thing is seen to be generated there or any old one dissolved , he seems implicitly to let us understand that if he had seen any such event he would have reversed his opinion , and properly preferred the sensible experience to natural reason .
Unless he had taken the senses into account , he would not have argued immutability from sensible mutations not being seen .
SIMP .
Aristotle first laid the basis of his argument a priori , showing the necessity of the inalterability of heaven by means of natural , evident , and clear principles .
He afterward supported the same a posteriori , by the senses and by the traditions of the ancients .
SALV .
What you refer to is the method he uses in writing his doctrine , but I do not believe it to be that with which he investigated it .
Rather , I think it certain that he first obtained it by means of the senses , experiments , and observations , to assure himself as much as possible of his conclusions .
Afterward he sought means to make them demonstrable .
That is what is done for the most part in the demonstrative sciences ; this comes about because when the conclusion is true , one may by making use of analytical methods hit upon some proposition which is already demonstrated , or arrive at some axiomatic principle ; but if the conclusion is false , one can go on forever without ever finding any known truth  if indeed one does not encounter some impossibility or manifest absurdity .
And you may be sure that Pythagoras , long before he discovered the proof for which he sacrificed a hecatomb , was sure that the square on the side opposite the right angle in a right triangle was equal to the squares on the other two sides .
The certainty of a conclusion assists not a little in the discovery of its proof  meaning always in the demonstrative sciences .
But however Aristotle may have proceeded , whether the reason a priori came before the sense perception a posteriori or the other way round , it is enough that Aristotle , as he said many times , preferred sensible experience to any argument .
Besides , the strength of the arguments a priori has already been examined .
Now , getting back to the subject , I say that things which are being and have been discovered in the heavens in our own time are such that they can give entire satisfaction to all philosophers , because just such events as we have been calling generations and corruptions have been seen and are being seen in particular bodies and in the whole expanse of heaven .
Excellent astronomers have observed many comets generated and dissipated in places above the lunar orbit , besides the two new stars of 1572 and 1604 , which were indisputably beyond all the planets .
( note : Supemovas appeared in these years which generated a great deal of debate .
Salviati ’s assertion that their place in the heavens was indisputable is an argumentative one .
He will offer a proof during the third day . )
And on the face of the sun itself , with the aid of the telescope , they have seen produced and dissolved dense and dark matter , appearing much like the clouds upon the earth : and many of these are so vast as to exceed not only the Mediterranean Sea , but all of Africa , with Asia thrown in .
Now , if Aristotle had seen these things , what do you think he would have said and done , Simplicio ?
SIMP .
I do not know what would have been done or said by Aristotle , who was the master of all science , but I know to some extent what his followers do and say , and what they ought to do and say in order not to remain without a guide , a leader , and a chief in philosophy .
As to the comets , have not these modem astronomers who wanted to make them celestial been vanquished by the Anti-Tycho ? ( note : Simplicio is referring to the work of Scipio Clijaramonti ( 1565-1652 ) . )
Vanquished , moreover , by their own weapons ; that is , by means of parallaxes and of calculations turned about every which way , and finally concluding in favor of Aristotle that they are all elemental .
A thing so fundamental to the innovators having been destroyed , what more remains to keep them on their feet ?
SALV .
Calm yourself , Simplicio .
What does this modem author of yours say about the new stars of 1572 and 1604 , and of the solar spots ?
As far as the comets are concerned I , for my part , care little whether they are generated below or above the moon , nor have I ever set much store by Tycho ’s verbosity .
Neither do I feel any reluctance to believe that their matter is elemental , and that they may rise as they please without encountering any obstacle from the impenetrability of the Peripatetic heavens , which I hold to be far more tenuous , yielding , and subtle than our air .
And as to the calculation of parallaxes , in the first place I doubt whether comets are subject to parallax ; besides , the inconstancy of the observations upon which they have been computed renders me equally suspicious of both his opinions and his adversary ’s  the more so because it seems to me that the Anti-Tycho sometimes trims to its author ’s taste those observations which do not suit his purposes , or else declares them to be erroneous .
SIMP .
With regard to the new stars , the Anti-Tycho thoroughly disposes of them in a few words , saying that such recent new stars are not positively known to be heavenly bodies , and that if its adversaries wish to prove any alterations and generations in the latter , they must show us mutations made in stars which have already been described for a long time and which are celestial objects beyond doubt .
And this can never possibly be done .
As to that material which some say is generated and dissolved on the face of the sun , no mention is made of it at all , from which I should gather that the author takes it for a fable , or for an illusion of the telescope , ( note :
The telescope was an object of suspicion in many circles . ) or at best for some phenomenon produced by the air ; in a word , for anything but celestial matter .
SALV .
But you , Simplicio , what have you thought of to reply to the opposition of these importunate spots which have come to disturb the heavens , and worse still , the Peripatetic philosophy ?
It must be that you , as its intrepid defender , have found a reply and a solution which you should not deprive us of .
SIMP .
I have heard different opinions on this matter .
Some say , " They are stars which , like Venus and Mercury , go about the sun in their proper orbits , and in passing under it present themselves to us as dark ; and because there are many of them , they frequently happen to collect together , and then again to separate . "
Others believe them to be figments of the air ; still others , illusions of the lenses ; and still others , other things .
But I am most inclined to believe  yes , I think it certain  that they are a collection of various different opaque objects , coming together almost accidentally ; and therefore we often see that in one spot there can be counted ten or more such tiny bodies of irregular shape that look like snowflakes , or tufts of wool , or flying moths .
They change places with each other , now separating and now congregating , but mostly right under the sun , about which , as their center , they move .
But it is not therefore necessary to say that they are generated or decay .
Rather , they are sometimes hidden behind the body of the sun ; at other times , though far from it , they can not be seen because of their proximity to its immeasurable light .
For in the suns eccentric sphere ( note :
The eccentric sphere was the perfect circle circumscribed by the orbit of a heavenly body round a point ( called the deferent ) which was near .
but not precisely the Earth ( and therefore slightly off the center of the universe ) .
It was a theoretical construct which ( along with the epicycle ) helped astronomers reconcile their belief in constant circular velocity and apparent fluctuations in that velocity . ) there is established a sort of onion composed of various folds , one within another , each being studded with certain little spots , and moving ; and although their movements seem at first to be inconstant and irregular .
nonetheless it is said to be ultimately observed that after a certain time the same spots are sure to return .
This seems to me to be the most appropriate expedient that has so far been found to account for such phenomena , and at the same time to maintain the incorruptibility and ingenerability of the heavens .
And if this is not enough , there are more brilliant intellects who will find better answers .
SALV .
If what we are discussing were a point of law or of the humanities , in which neither true nor false exists , one might trust in subtlety of mind and readiness of tongue and in the greater experience of the writers , and expect him who excelled in those things to make his reasoning most plausible , and one might judge it to be the best .
But in the natural sciences , whose conclusions are true and necessary and have nothing to do with human will , one must take care not to place oneself in the defense of error ; for here a thousand Demostheneses and a thousand Aristotles would be left in the lurch by every mediocre wit who happened to hit upon the truth for himself
Therefore , Simplicio , give up this idea and this hope of yours that there may be men so much more leaned , erudite , and well - read than the rest of us as to he able to make that which is false become true in defiance of nature .
And since among all opinions that have thus far been produced regarding the essence of sunspots , this one you have just explained appears to you to be the correct one , it follows that all the rest are false .
Now to free you also from that one  which is an utterly delusive chimera 
I shall , disregarding the many improbabilities in it , convey to you but two observed facts against it .
One is that many of these spots are seen to originate in the middle of the solar disc , and likewise many dissolve and vanish far from the edge of the sun , a necessary argument that they must be generated and dissolved .
For without generation and corruption , they could appear there only by way of local motion , and they all ought to enter and leave by the very edge .
The other observation , for those not in the rankest ignorance of perspective , is that from the changes of shape observed in the spots , and from their apparent changes in velocity , one must infer that the spots are in contact with the sun ’s body , and that , touching its surface , they are moved either with it or upon it and in no sense revolve in circles distant from it .
Their motion proves this by appearing to be very slow around the edge of the solar disc , and quite fast toward its center ; the shapes of the spots prove the same by appearing very narrow around the sun ’s edge in comparison with how they look in the vicinity of the center .
For around the center they are seen in their majesty and as they really are ; but around the edge , because of the curvature of the spherical surface , they show themselves foreshortened .
These diminutions of both motion and shape , for anyone who knows how to observe them and calculate diligently , correspond exactly to what ought to appear if the spots are contiguous to the sun , and hopelessly contradict their moving in distant circles , or even at small intervals from the solar body .
This has been abundantly demonstrated by our mutual friend in his Letters to Mark Welser on the Solar Spots . ( note : Published by Christopher Scheiner in 1612 . )
It may be inferred from the same changes of shape that none of these are stars or other spherical bodies , because of all shapes only the sphere is never seen foreshortened , nor can it appear to be anything but perfectly round .
So if any of the individual spots were a round body , as all stars are deemed to be , it would present the same roundness in the middle of the sun ’s disc as at the extreme edge , whereas they so much foreshorten and look so thin near that extremity , and &e on the other hand so broad and long toward the center , as to make it certain that these are flakes of little thickness or depth with respect .
to their length and breadth .
Then as to its being observed ultimately that the same spots are sure to return after a certain period , do not believe that , Simplicio ; those who said that were trying to deceive you .
That this is so , you may see from their having said nothing to you about those that are generated or dissolved on the face of the sun far from the edge ; nor told you a word about those which foreshorten , this being a necessary proof of their contiguity to the sun .
The truth about the same spots returning is merely what is written in the said Letters ; namely , that some of them are occasionally of such long duration that they do not disappear in a single revolution around the sun , which takes place in less than a month .
SIMP .
To tell the truth , I have not made such long and careful observations that I can qualify as an authority on the facts of this matter ; but certainly I wish to do so , and then to see whether I can once more succeed in reconciling what experience presents to us with what Aristotle teaches .
For obviously two truths cannot contradict one another .
SALV .
Whenever you wish to reconcile what your senses show you with the soundest teachings of Aristotle , you will have no trouble at all .
Does not Aristotle say that because of the great distance , celestial matters cannot be treated very definitely ?
SIMP .
He does say so , quite clearly .
SALV .
Does he not also declare that what sensible experience shows ought to be preferred over any argument , even one that seems to be extremely well founded ?
And does he not say this positively and without a bit of hesitation ?
SIMP .
He does .
SALV .
Then of the two propositions , both of them Aristotelian doctrines , the second  which says it is necessary to prefer the senses over arguments  is a more solid and definite doctrine than the other , which holds the heavens to be inalterable .
Therefore it is better Aristotelian philosophy to say " Heaven is alterable because my senses tell me so , " than to say , " Heaven is inalterable because Aristotle was so persuaded by reasoning .
Add to this that we possess a better basis for reasoning about celestial things than Aristotle did .
He admitted such perceptions to be very difficult for him by reason of the distance from his senses , and conceded that one whose senses could better represent them would be able to philosophize about them with more certainty .
Now we , thanks to the telescope , have brought the heavens thirty or forty times closer to us than they were to Aristotle , so that we can discern many things in them that he could not see ; among other things these sunspots , which were absolutely invisible to him .
Therefore we can treat of the heavens and the sun more confidentlythan Aristotle could .
SAGR .
I can put myself in Simplicios place and see that he is deeply moved by the overwhelming force of these conclusive arguments .
But seeing on the other hand the great authority that Aristotle has gained universally ; considering the number of famous interpreters who have toiled to explain his meanings ; and observing that the other sciences , so useful and necessary to mankind , base a large pan of their value and reputation upon Aristotle ’s credit ; Simplicio is confused and perplexed , and I seem to hear him say , " Who would there be to settle our controversies if Aristotle were to be deposed ?
What other author should we follow in the schools , the academies , the universities ?
What philosopher has written the whole of natural philosophy , so well arranged , without omitting a single conclusion ?
Ought we to desert that structure under which so many travelers have recuperated ?
Should we destroy that haven , that Prytaneum ( note : Greek public hall where statesmen , heroes , and dignitaries were honored and entertained . ) where so many scholars have taken refuge so comfortably ; where , without exposing themselves to the inclemencies of the air , they can acquire a complete knowledge of the universe by merely turning over a few pages ?
Should that fort be leveled where one may abide in safety against all enemy assaults ? "
I pity him no less than I should some fine gentleman who , having built a magnificent palace at great trouble and expense , employing hundreds and hundreds of artisans , and then beholding it threatened with ruin because of poor foundations , should attempt , in order to avoid the grief of seeing the walls destroyed , adorned as they are with so many lovely murals ; or the columns fall , which sustain the superb galleries , or the gilded beams ; or the doors spoiled , or the pediments and the marble cornices , brought in at so much cost  should attempt , I say , to prevent the collapse with chains , props , iron bars , buttresses , and shores .
SALV .
Well , Simplicio need not yet fear any such collapse ; I undertake to insure him against damage at a much smaller cost .
There is no danger that such a multitude of great , subtle , and wise philosophers will allow themselves to be overcome by one or two who bluster a bit .
Rather , without even directing their pens against them , by means of silence alone , they place them in universal scorn and derision .
It is vanity to imagine that one can introduce a new philosophy by refining this or that author ,
It is necessary first to teach the reform of the human mind and to render it capable of distinguishing truth from falsehood , which only God can do .
But where have we strayed , going from one argument to another ?
I shall not be able to get back to the path without guidance from your memory .
SIMP .
I remember quite well .
We were dealing with the reply of the Anti-Tycho to the objections against the immutability of the heavens .
Among these you brought in this mater of the sunspots , nqt mentioned by its author , and J believe you wished to give consideration to his reply in the case of the new stars .
SALV .
Now I remember the rest .
Continuing this subject , ii seems to me that in the counter argument of the Anti-Tycho there are some things that ought to be criticized .
First of all , if the two new stars , which that author can do no less than place in the highest regions of heaven , and which existed a long time and finally vanished , caused him no anxiety about insisting upon the inalterability of heaven simply because they were not unquestionably parts of heaven or mutations in the ancient stars , then to what purpose does he make all this fuss and bother about getting the comets away from the celestial regions at all costs ?
Would it not have been enough for him to say that they are not unques - tionably parts of heaven and not mutations in the ancient stars , and hence that they do notprejudice in any way either the heavens or the doctrines of Aristotle ?
In the second place I am not satisfied about his state of mind when he admits that any alterations which might be made in the stars would be destructive of the celestial prerogatives of incorruptibility , etc. , since the stars are celestial things , as is obvious and as everybody admits , and when on the other hand he is not the least perturbed if the same alterations take place elsewhere in the expanse of heaven outside the stars themselves .
Does he perhaps mean to imply that heaven is not a celestial thing ?
I should think that the stars were called celestial things because of their being in the heavens , or because of their being made of heavenly material , and that therefore the heavens would be even more celestial than they ; I could not say similarly that anything was more terrestrial than earth itself , or more igneous than fire .
Next , his not having made mention of the sunspots , which are conclusively proved to be produced and dissolved and to be situated next to the body of the sun and to revolve with it or in relation to it , gives me a good indication that this author may write more for the comforting of others than from his own convictions .
I say this because he shows himself to be acquainted with mathematics , and it would be impossible for him not to be convinced by the proofs that such material is necessarily contiguous to the sun and undergoes generations and dissolutions so great that nothing of comparable size has ever occurred on earth .
And if the generations and corruptions occurring on the very globe of the sun are so many , so great , and so frequent , while this can reasonably be called the noblest part of the heavens , then what argument remains that can dissuade us from believing that others take place on the other globes ?
SAGR .
I cannot without great astonishment 
I might say without great insult to my intelligence  hear it attributed as a prime perfection and nobility of the natural and integral bodies of the universe that they are invariant , immutable , inalterable , etc. , while on the other hand it is called a great imperfection to be alterable , generable , mutable , etc .
For my part I consider the earth very noble and admirable precisely because of the diverse alterations , changes , generations , etc. that occur in it incessantly .
If , not being subject to any changes , it were a vast desert of sand or a mountain of jasper , or if at the time of the flood the waters which covered it had frozen , and it had remained an enormous globe of ice where nothing was ever born or ever altered or changed , I should deem it a useless lump in the universe , devoid of activity and , in a word , superfluous and essentially nonexistent .
This is exactly the difference between a living animal and a dead one ; and I say the same of the moon , of Jupiter , and of all other world globes .
The deeper I go in considering the vanities of popular reasoning , the lighter and more foolish I find them .
What greater stupidity can be imagined than that of calling jewels , silver , and gold " precious , " and earth and soil " base " ?
People who do this ought to remember that if there were as great a scarcity of soil as of jewels or precious metals , there would not be a prince who would not spend a bushel of diamonds and rubies and a cartload of gold just to have enough earth to plant a jasmine in a little pot , or to sow an orange seed and watch it sprout , grow , and produce its handsome leaves , its fragrant flowers , and fine fruit .
It is scarcity and plenty that make the vulgar take things to be precious or worthless ; they call a diamond very beautiful because it is like pure water , and then would not exchange one for ten barrels of water .
Those who so greatly exalt incorruptibility , inalterability , etc. are reduced to talking this way , I believe , by their great desire to go on living , and by the terror they have of death .
They do not reflect that if men were immortal , they themselves would never have come into the world .
Such men really deserve to encounter a Medusa ’s head which would transmute them into statues of jasper orof diamond , and thus make them more perfect than they are .
SALV .
Maybe such a metamorphosis would not be entirely to their disadvantage , for I think it would be better for them not to argue than to argue on the wrong side .
SIMP .
Oh , there is no doubt whatever that the earth is more perfect the way it is , being alterable , changeable , etc. , than it would be if it were a mass of stone or even a solid diamond , and extremely hard and invariant .
But to the extent that these conditions bring nobility to the earth , they would render less perfect the celestial bodies , in which they would be superfluous .
For the celestial bodies  that is , the sun , the moon , and the other stars , Which are ordained to have no other use than that of service to the earth  need nothing more than motion and light to achieve their end .
SAGR .
Has nature , then , produced and directed all these enormous , perfect , and most noble celestial bodies , invariant , eternal , and divine .
for no other purpose than to serve the changeable , transitory , and mortal earth ?
To serve that which you call the dregs of the universe , the sink of all uncleanness ?
Now to what purpose would the celestial bodies be made eternal , etc. in order to serve something transitory , etc . ?
Take away this purpose of serving the earth , and the innumerable host of celestial bodies is left useless and superfluous , since they have not and cannot have any reciprocal activities among themselves , all of them being inalterable , immutable , and invariant .
For instance , if the moon is invariant , how would you have the sun or any other star act upon it ?
The action would doubtless have no more effect than an attempt to melt a large mass of gold by looking at it or by thinking about it .
Besides , it seems to me that at such times as the celestial bodies are contributing to the generations and alterations on the earth , they too must be alterable .
Otherwise I do not see how the influence of the moon or sun in causing generations on the earth would differ from placing a marble statue beside a woman and expecting children from such a union .
SIMP .
Corruptibility , alteration , mutation , etc. do not pertain to the whole terrestrial globe , which as to its entirety is no less eternal than the sun or moon .
But as to its external parts it is generable and corruptible , and it is certainly true that generations and corruptions are perpetual in those parts , and , as perpetual , that they require celestial and eternal operations .
Therefore it is necessary that celestial bodies be eternal .
SAGR .
This is all very well , but if there is nothing prejudicial to the immortality of the entire terrestrial globe in the corruptibility of its superficial pans , and if this generability , corruptibility , alterability , etc. give to it a great ornament and perfection , then why can you not and should you not likewise admit alterations , generations , etc. in the external parts of the celestial globes , adding these as an ornament without diminishing their perfection or depriving them of actions ; even increasing those by making them operative not only upon the earth but reciprocally among themselves , and the earth also upon them ?
SIMP .
This cannot be , because the generations , mutations , etc. which would occur , say , on the moon , would be vain and useless , and natura nihil frustra facit .
( note : Nature makes nothing in vain . ) SAGR .
And why should they be vain and useless ?
SIMP .
Because we plainly see and feel that all generations , changes , etc. that occur on earth are either directly or indirectly designed for the use , comfort , and benefit of man .
Horses are born to accommodate men ; for the nutriment of horses , the earth produces hay and the clouds water it .
For the comfort and nourishment of men are created herbs , cereals , fruits , beasts , birds , and fishes .
In brief , if we proceed to examine and weigh carefully all these things , we shall find that the goal toward which all are directed is the need , the use , the comfort and the delight of men .
Now of what use to the human race could generations ever be which might happen on the moon or other planets ?
Unless you mean that there are men also on the moon who enjoy their fruits ; an idea which if not mythical is impious .
SAGR .
I do not know nor do I suppose that herbs or plants or animals similar to ours are propagated on the moon , or that rains and winds and thunderstorms occur there as on the earth ; much less that it is inhabited by men .
Yet I still do not see that it necessarily follows that since things similar to ours are not generated there , no alterations at all take place , or that there cannot be things there that do change or are generated and dissolve ; things not only different from ours , but so far from our conceptions as to be entirely unimaginable by us .
I am certain that a person born and raised in a huge forest among wild beasts and birds , and knowing nothing of the watery element , would never be able to frame in his imagination another world existing in nature differing from his , filled with animals which would travel without legs or fast  beating wings , and not upon its surface alone like beasts upon the earth , but everywhere within its depths ; and not only moving , but stopping motionless wherever they pleased , a thing which birds in the air cannot do .
And that men lived there too , and built palaces and cities , and traveled with such ease that without tiring themselves at all they could proceed to far countries with their families and households and whole cities .
Now as I say , I am sure that such a man could not , even with the liveliest imagination , ever picture to himself fishes , the ocean , ships , fleets , and armadas .
Thus , and more so , might it happen that in the moon , separated from us by so much greater an interval and made of materials perhaps much different from those on earth , substances exist and actions occur which are not merely remote from but completely beyond all our imaginings , lacking any resem - blance to ours and therefore being entirely unthinkable .
For that which we imagine must be either something already seen or a composite of things and parts of things seen at different times ; such are sphinxes , sirens , chimeras , centaurs , etc. SALV .
Many times have I given rein to my fancies about these things , and my conclusion is that it is indeed possible to discover some things that do not and cannot exist on the moon , but none which I believe can be and are there , except very generally ; that is , things occupying it , acting and moving in it , perhaps in a very different way from ours , seeing and admiring the grandeur and beauty of the universe and of its Maker and Director and continually singing encomiums in His praise .
I mean , in a word , doing what is so frequently decreed in the Holy Scriptures ; namely , a perpetual occupation of all creatures in praising God. ( note :
This is , in fact , the case in Dante ’s Divine Comedy ( Par. 3 - 7 ) . ) SAGR .
These are among the things which , speaking very generally , could be there .
But I should like to hear you mention those which you believe cannot be there , as it must be possible for you to name them more specifically .
SALV .
I warn you , Sagredo , that this will be the third time we have thus strayed imperceptibly , step by step , from our principal topic , and we shall get to the point of our argument but slowly if we make digressions .
Therefore it will perhaps be good if we defer this matter , along with others we have agreed to put off until a special session .
SAGR .
Please , now that we are on the moon , let us go on with things that pertain to it , so that we shall not have to make another trip over so long a road .
( Salviati , aided by Sagredo and relying greatly on data derived from the use of / he telescope , expounds upon the moon ’s resemblance o the cart / i : ft is spherical , dark , dense , mountainous ; it is divided into areas of contrasting brightness , much like the land and sea areas , of the earth ; from the moon the earth is seen to go through phases just like the moon ; the moon receives reflected sunlight from the earth , as the earth does from the moon .
Salviati also claims the moon always presents the same hemisphere to the earth .
Simplicio disputes several points : he claims the moon is a perfectly smooth sphere , of greater density than the earth because it is composed of celestial material ; while the moon is opaque , it is not dark , but rather polished to a reflective luster like a mirror , it is impossible for the moon to receive any light form the dark earth .
The three engage in a lengthy argument about the moon , involving in part a discussion of the properties of light and reflection , which takes up most of the rest of this first day . )
SIMP .
Therefore , in your opinion , the earth would make an appearance similar to that which we see in the moon , of at most two parts .
But do you believe then that those great spots which are seen on the face of the moon are seas , and the brighter balance land , or some such thing ?
SALV .
What you are now asking me is the first of the differences that I think exist between the moon and the earth , which we had better hurry along with , as we are staying too long on the moon .
I say then that if there were in nature only one way for two surfaces to be illuminated by the sun so that one appears lighter than the other , and that this were by having one made of land and the other of water , it would be necessary to say that the moon ’s surface was partly terrene and partly aqueous .
But because there are more ways known to us that could produce the same effect , and perhaps others that we do not know of , I shall not make bold to affirm one rather than another to exist on the moon .
We have already seen that a bleached silver plate changes from white to dark by the touch of the burnisher ; the watery part of the earth looks darker than the dry ; on the ridges of mountains the wooded parts look much gloomier than the open and barren places because the plants cast a great deal of shadow while the clearings are lighted by the sun .
Such a mixture of shadows is so effective that in sculptured velvet the color of the cut silk looks much darker than that of the uncut , because of shadows cast between one thread and another ; and plain velvet is likewise much darker than taffeta made of the same silk .
So if on the moon there were things resembling dense forests , their aspect would probably be like that of the spots we see ; a like difference would be created if they were seas ; and , finally , there is nothing to prevent these spots being really of a darker color than the rest , for it is in that way that snow makes mountains appear brighter .
What is clearly seen in the moon is that the darker parts are all plains , with few rocks and ridges in them , though there are some .
The brighter remainder is all fill of rocks , mountains , round ridges , and other shapes , and in particular there are great ranges of mountains around the spots .
That the spots are flat surfaces we are certain , from observing that the boundary which separates the light and dark parts makes an even cut in traversing the spots , whereas in the bright parts it looks broken and jagged .
But I do not know whether this evenness of surface is enough by itself to cause the apparent darkness , and I rather think not .
Quite apart from this , I consider the moon very different from the earth .
Though I fancy to myself that its regions are not idle and dead , still I do not assert that life and motion exist there , and much less that plants , animals , or other things similar to ours are generated there .
Even if they were , they would be extremely diverse , and far beyond all our imaginings .
I am inclined to believe this because in the first place I think that the material of the lunar globe is not land and water , and this alone is enough to prevent generations and alterations similar to ours .
But even supposing land and water on the moon , there are in any case two reasons that plants and animals similar to ours would not be produced there .
The first is that the varying aspects of the sun are so necessary for our various species that these could not exist at all without them .
Now the behavior of the sun toward the earth is much different from that which it displays toward the moon .
As to daily illumination , we on the earth have for the most part twenty  four hours divided between day and night , but the same effect takes a month on the moon .
The annual sinking and rising by which the sun causes the various seasons and the inequalities of day and night are finished for the moon in a month .
And whereas for us the sun rises and sinks so much that between its maximum and minimum altitudes there lie forty  seven degrees of difference ( that is , as much as the distance between the tropics ) , for the moon it varies no more than ten degrees or a little less , which is the amount of the maximum latitudes of its orbit with respect to the ecliptic .
Now think what the action of the sun would be in the torrid zone if for fifteen days without pause it continued to beat down with its rays .
It goes without saying that all the plants and herbs and animals would be destroyed ; hence if any species existed there , they would be plants and animals very different from present ones .
In the second place , I am sure that there are no rains on the moon , because if clouds collected in any part of it , as around the earth , they would hide some of the things on the moon that we see with the telescope .
Briefly , the scene would alter in some respect ; an effect which I have never seen during long and diligent observations , having always discovered a very pure and uniform serenity .
SAGR .
To this it might be replied that either there might be great dews or that it rains there during its nights ; that is , when the sun does not light it up .
SALV .
If from other appearances we had any signs that there were species similar to ours there , and only the occurrence of rains was lacking , we should be able to find this or some other condition to take their place , as happens in Egypt by the inundations of the Nile .
But finding no event whatever like ours , of the many that would be required to produce similar effects , there is no point in troubling to introduce one only , and even that one not from sure observation but because of mere possibility .
Besides , if I were asked what my basic knowledge and natural reason told me regarding the production there of things similar to or different from ours , I should always reply , " Very different and entirely unimaginable by us " ; for this seems to me to fit with the richness of nature and the omnipotence of the Creator and Ruler .
SAGR .
It always seems to me extreme rashness on the part of some when they want to make human abilities the measure of what nature can do .
On the contrary , there is not a single effect in nature , even the least that exists , such that the most ingenious theorists can arrive at a complete understanding of it .
This vain presumption of understanding everything can have no other basis than never understanding anything .
For anyone who had experienced just once the perfect understanding of one single thing , and had truly tasted how knowledge is accomplished , would recognize that of the infinity of other truths he understands nothing .
SALV .
Your argument is quite conclusive ; in confirmation of it we have the evidence of those who do understand or have understood some thing ; the more such men have known , the more they have recognized and freely confessed their little knowledge .
And the wisest of the Greeks , so adjudged by the oracle , said openly that he recognized that he knew nothing .
SIMP .
It must be said , then , that either the oracle or Socrates himself was a liar , the former declaring him the wisest , and the latter saying he knew himself the most ignorant .
SALV .
Neither of your alternatives follows , since both pronouncements can be true .
The oracle judges Socrates wisest above all other men , whose wisdom is limited ; Socrates recognizes his knowing nothing relative to absolute wisdom which is infinite .
And since much is the same part of infinite as little , or as nothing ( for to arrive at an infinite number it makes no difference whether we accumulate thousands , tens , or zeros ) , Socrates did well to recognize his limited knowledge to be as nothing to the infinity which he lacked .
But since there is nevertheless some knowledge to be found among men , and this is not equally distributed to all , Socrates could have had a larger share than others and thus have verified the response of the oracle .
SAGR .
I think I understand this point quite well .
Among men there exists the power to act , Simplicio , but it is not equally shared by all ; and no doubt the power of an emperor is greater than that of a private person , but both are nil in comparison to Divine omnipotence .
Among men there are some who understand agriculture better than others ; but what has knowing how to plant a grapevine in a ditch got to do with knowing how to make it take root , draw nourishment , take from this some part good for building leaves , some other for forming tendrils , this for the bunches , that for the grapes , the other for the skins , all this being the work of most wise Nature ?
This is one single particular example of the innumerable works of Nature , and in this alone may be recognized an infinite wisdom ; hence one may conclude that Divine wisdom is infinitely infinite .
SALV .
Here is another example .
Do we not say that the art of discovering a beautiful statue in a block of marble has elevated the genius of Michelangelo far , far above the ordinary minds of other men ?
Yet this work is nothing but the copying of a single attitude and position of the external and superficial members of one motionless man .
Then what is it in comparison with a man made by Nature , composed of so many members , external and internal , of so many muscles , tendons , nerves , bones , that serve so many and such diverse motions ?
And what shall we say of the senses , of spiritual power , and finally of the understanding ?
May we not rightly say that the making of a statue yields by an infinite amount to the formation of a live man , even to the formation of the lowest worm ?
SAGR .
And what difference do you think there was between the dove of Archytas and a natural dove ?
SIMP .
Either I am without understanding or there is a manifest contradiction in this argument of yours .
Among your greatest encomiums , if not indeed the greatest of all , is your praise for the understanding which you attribute to natural man .
A little while ago you agreed with Socrates that his understanding was nil .
Then you must say that not even Nature understood how to make an intellect that could understand .
SALV .
You put the point very sharply , and to answer the objection it is best to have recourse to a philosophical distinction and to say that the human understanding can be taken in two modes , the intensive or the extensive .
Extensively , that is , with regard to the multitude of intelligibles , which are infinite , the human understanding is as nothing even if it understands a thousand propositions ; for a thousand in relation to infinity is zero .
But taking man ’s understanding intensively , in so far as this term denotes understanding some proposition perfectly , I say that the human intellect does understand some of them perfectly , and thus in these it has as much absolute certainty as Nature itself has .
Of such are the mathematical sciences alone ; that is , geometry and arithmetic , in which the Divine intellect indeed knows infinitely more proposi-tions , since it knows all .
But with regard to those few which the human intellect does understand , I believe that its knowledge equals the Divine in objective certainty , for here it succeeds in understanding necessity , beyond which there can be no greater sureness .
SIMP .
This speech strikes me as very bold and daring .
( note : Indeed , in attacking the Dialogue , the notion that the human intellect could understand a geometry proposition " perfectly " was construed by the Church to be a claim by Galileo that the human mind was in some ways equivalent to the Divine . ) SALV .
These are very ordinary propositions and far from any shade of temerity or boldness .
They do not detract in the least from the majesty of Divine wisdom , just as saying that God cannot undo what is done does not in the least diminish His omnipotence .
But I question , Simplicio , whether your suspicion does not arise from your having taken my words equivocally .
So in order to explain myself better , I say that as to the truth of the knowledge which is given by mathematical proofs , this is the same that Divine wisdom recognizes ; but I shall concede to you indeed that the way in which God knows the infinite propositions of which we know some few is exceedingly more excellent than ours .
Our method proceeds with reasoning by steps from one conclusion to another , while His is one of simple intuition .
We , for example , in order to win a knowledge of some properties of the circle ( which has an infinity of them ) , begin with one of the simplest , and , taking this for the definition of circle , proceed by reasoning to another property , and from this to a third , and then a fourth , and so on ; but the Divine intellect , by a simple apprehension of the circle ’s essence , knows without time  consuming reasoning all the infinity of its properties .
Next , all these properties are in effect virtually included in the definitions of all things ; and ultimately , through being infinite , are perhaps but one in their essence and in the Divine mind .
Nor is all the above entirely unknown to the human mind either , but it is clouded with deep and thick mists , which become partly dispersed and clarified when we master some conclusions and get them so firmly established and so readily in our possession that we can run over them very rapidly .
For , after all , what more is there to the square on the hypotenuse being equal to the squares on the other two sides , than the equality of two parallelograms on equal bases and between parallel lines ?
And is this not ultimately the same as the equality of two surfaces which when superimposed are not increased , but are enclosed within the same boundaries ?
Now these advances , which our intellect makes laboriously and step by step , run through the Divine mind like light in an instant ; which is the same as saying that everything is always present to it .
I conclude from this that our understanding , as well in the manner as in the number of things understood , is infinitely surpassed by the Divine ; but I do not thereby abase it so much as to consider it absolutely null .
No , when I consider what marvelous things and how many of them men have understood , inquired into , and contrived , I recognize and understand only too clearly that the human mind is a work of God ’s , and one of the most excellent .
SAGR .
I myself have many times considered in the same vein what you are now saying , and how great may be the acuteness of the human mind .
And when I run over the many and marvelous inventions men have discovered in the arts as in letters , and then reflect upon my own knowledge , I count myself little better than miserable .
I am so far from being able to promise myself , not indeed the finding out of anything new , but even the learning of what has already been discovered , that I feel stupid and confused , and am goaded by despair .
If I look at some excellent statue , I say within my heart : " When will you be able to remove the excess from a block of marble and reveal so lovely a figure hidden therein ?
When will you know how to mix different colors and spread them over a canvas or a wall and represent all visible objects by their means , like a Michelangelo , a Raphael , or a Titian ? "
Looking at what men have found out about ananging the musical intervals and forming precepts and rules in order to control them for the wonderful delight of the ear , when shall T be able to cease my amazement ?
What shall I say of so many and such diverse instruments ?
With what admiration the reading of excellent poets fills anyone who attentively studies the invention and interpreta-tion of concepts
And what shall I say of architecture ?
What of the art of navigation ?
But surpassing all stupendous inventions , what sublimity of mind was his who dreamed of finding means to communicate his deepest thoughts to any other person , though distant by mighty intervals of place and time !
Of talking with those who are in India ; of speaking to those who are not yet born and will not he born for a thousand or ten thousand years ; and with what facility , by the different arrangements of twenty characters upon a page !
Let this be the seal of all the admirable inventions of mankind and the close of our discussions for this day .
The honest hours now being past , I think that Salviati might like to enjoy our cool ones in a gondola ; and tomorrow I shall expect you both so that we may continue the discussions now begun .
End of the First Day
Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems THE SECOND DAY SALVIATI .
Yesterday took us into so many and such great digressions twisting away from the main thread of our principal argument that I do not know whether I shall be able to go ahead without your assistance in putting me back on the track .
SAGR .
I am not surprised that you should find yourself in some confusion , for your mind is as much filled and encumbered with what remains to be said as with what has been said .
But I am simply a listener and have in my mind only the things I have heard , so perhaps I can put your discourse back on its path by briefly outlining these for you .
As I recall it , yesterday ’s discourse may be summarized as a preliminary examination of the two following opinions as to which is the more probable and reasonable .
The first holds the substance of the heavenly bodies to be ingenerable , incorruptible , inalterable , invariant , and in a word free from all mutations except those of situation , and accordingly to be a quintessence ( note : Literally , a fifth essence , distinct from the four elements of earth , water , air , and fire which were to be found within the lunar sphere . ) most different from our generable , corruptible , alterable bodies .
The other opinion , removing this disparity from the world ’s parts , considers the earth to enjoy the same perfection as other integral bodies of the universe ; in short , to be a movable and a moving body no less than the moon , Jupiter , Venus , or any other planet .
Later many detailed parallels were drawn between the earth and the moon .
More comparisons were made with the moon than with other planets , perhaps from our having more and better sensible evidence about the former by reason of its lesser distance .
And having finally concluded this second opinion to have more likelihood than the other , it seems to me that our next step should be to examine whether the earth must be considered immovable , as most people have believed up to the present , or mobile , as many ancient philosophers believed and as others of more recent times consider it ; and , if movable , what its motion may be .
SALV .
Now I know and recognize the signposts along our road .
But before starting in again and going ahead , I ought to tell you that I question this last thing you have said , about our having concluded in favor of the opinion that the earth is endowed with the same properties as the heavenly bodies .
For I did not conclude this , just as I am not deciding upon any other controversial proposition .
My intention was only to adduce those arguments and replies , as much on one side as on the other - those questions and solutions which others have thought of up to the present time ( together with a few which have occurred to me after long thought ) - and then to leave the decision to the judgment of others .
SAGR .
I allowed myself to be carried away by my own sentiments , and believing that what I felt in my heart ought to be felt by others too , I made that conclusion universal which should have been kept particular .
This really was an error on my part , especially as I do not know the views of Simplicio , here present .
SIMP .
I confess that all last night I was meditating on yesterday ’s material , and truly I find it to contain many beautiful considerations which are novel and forceful .
Still , I am much more impressed by the authority of so many great authors , and in particular ...
You shake your head , Sagredo , and smile , as if uttered some absurdity .
SAGR .
I merely smile , but believe me , I am hardly able to keep from laughing , because I am reminded of a situation that I witnessed not manyyears ago together with some friends of mine , whom I could name to you for that matter .
SALV .
Perhaps you had better tell us about it so that Simplicio will not go on thinking your mirth was directed at him .
SAGR .
I ’ll be glad to .
One day I was at the home of a very famous doctor in Venice , where many persons came on account of their studies , and others occasionally came out of curiosity to see some anatomical dissection performed by a man who was truly no less learned than he was a careful and expert anatomist .
It happened on this day that he was investigating the source and origin of the nerves , about which there exists a notorious controversy between the Galenist and Peripatetic doctors .
The anatomist showed that the great trunk of nerves , leaving the brain and passing through the nape , extended on down the spine and then branched out through the whole body , and that only a single strand as fine as a thread arrived at the heart .
Turning to a gentleman whom he knew to be a Peripatetic philosopher , and on whose account he had been exhibiting and demonstrating everything with unusual care , he asked this man whether he was at last satisfied and convinced that the nerves originated in the brain and not in the heart .
The philosopher , after considering for awhile , answered : " You have made me see this matter so plainly and palpably that if Aristotle ’s text were not contrary to it , stating clearly that the nerves originate in the heart , I should be forced to admit it to be true . "
SIMP .
Sir , I want you to know that this dispute as to the source of the nerves is by no means as settled and decided as perhaps some people like to think .
SAGR .
Doubtless it never will be , in the minds of such opponents .
But what you say does not in the least diminish the absurdity of this Peripatetic ’s reply ; who , as a counter to sensible experience , adduced no experiment or argument of Aristotle ’s , but just the authority of his bare ipse dixit .
SIMP .
Aristotle acquired his great authority only because of the strength of his proofs and the profundity of his arguments .
Yet one must understand him ; and not merely understand him , but have such thorough familiarity with his books that the most complete idea of them may be formed , in such a manner that every saying of his is always before the mind .
He did not write for the common people , nor was he obliged to thread his syllogisms together by the trivial ordinary method ; rather , making use of the permuted method , he has sometimes put the proof of a proposition among texts that seem to deal with other things .
Therefore one must have a grasp of the whole grand scheme , and be able to combine this passage with that , collecting together one text here and another very distant from it .
There is no doubt that whoever has this skill will be able to draw from his books demonstrations of all that can be known ; for every single thing is in them .
SAGR .
My dear Simplicio , since having things scattered all over the place does not disgust you , and since you believe by the collection and combination of the various pieces you can draw the juice out of them , then what you and the other brave philosophers will do with Aristotle ’s texts , I shall do with the verses of Virgil and Ovid , making centos of them and explaining by means of these all the affairs of men and the secrets of nature .
But why do I speak of Virgil , or any other poet " I have a little book , much briefer than Aristotle or Ovid , in which is contained the whole of science , and with very little study one may form from it the most complete ideas .
It is the alphabet , and no doubt anyone who can properly Join and order this or that vowel and these or those consonants with one another can dig out of it the truest answers to every question , and draw from it instruction in all the arts and sciences .
Just so does a painter , from the various simple colors placed separately upon his palette , by gathering a little of this with a bit of that and a trifle of the other , depict men , plants , buildings , birds , fishes , and in a word represent every visible object , without any eyes or feathers or scales or leaves or stones being on his palette .
Indeed , it is necessary that none of the things imitated nor parts of them should actually be among the colors , if you want to be able to represent everything ; if there were feathers , for instance , these would not do to depict anything but birds or feather dusters .
SALV .
And certain gentlemen still living and active were present when a doctor lecturing in a famous Academy , upon bearing the telescope described but not yet having seen it , said that the invention was taken from Aristotle .
Having a text fetched , he found a certain place where the reason i’s given why stars in the sky can be seen during daytime from the bottom of a very deep well .
At this point the doctor said : " Here you have the well , which represents the tube ; here the gross vapors , from whence the invention of glass lenses is taken ; and finally here is the strengthening of the sight by the rays passing through a diaphanous medium which is denser and darker . "
SAGR .
This manner of " containing " everything that can be known is similar to the sense in which a block of marble contains a beautiful statue , or rather thousands of them ; but the whole point lies in being able to reveal them .
Even better we might say that it is like the prophecies of Joachim or the answers of the heathen oracles , which are understood only after the events they forecast have occurred .
SALV .
And why do you leave out the prophecies of the astrologers , which are so clearly seen in horoscopes ( or should we say in the configurations of the heavens ) after their fulfillment ?
SAGR .
It is in this way that the alchemists , led on by their madness , find that the greatest geniuses of the world never really wrote about anything except how to make gold ; but in order to tell this without revealing it to the vulgar , this fellow in one manner and that one in another have whimsically concealed it under various disguises .
And a very amusing thing it is to hear their comments upon the ancient poets , revealing the important mysteries hidden behind their stories what the loves of the moon mean , and her descent to the earth for Endymion ; her displeasure with Acteon ; the significance of Jupiter ’s turning himself into a rain of gold , or into a fiery flame ; what great secrets of the art there are in Mercury the interpreter , in Pluto ’s kidnapings , and in golden boughs .
SIMP .
I believe , and to some extent f know , that the world does not lack certain giddy brains , but their folly should not redound to the discredit of Aristotle , of whom it seems to me you sometimes speak with too little respect .
His antiquity alone , and the mighty name he has acquired among so many men of distinguished mind , should be enough to earn him respect among all the learned .
SALV .
That is not quite how matters stand , Simplicio .
Some of his followers are so excessively timid that they give us occasion ( or more correctly would give us occasion if we credited their triflings ) to think less of him .
Tell me , are you so credulous as not to understand that if Aristotle had been present and heard this doctor who wanted to make him inventor of the telescope , he would have been much angrier with him than with those who laughed at this doctor and his interpretations ?
Is it possible for you to doubt that if Anistotle should see the new discoveries in the sky he would change his opinions and correct his books and embrace the most sensible doctrines , casting away from himself those people so weak - minded as to be induced to go on abjectly maintaining everything he had ever said ?
Why , if Aristotle had been such a man as they imagine , he would have been a man of intractable mind , of obstinate spirit , and barbarous soul ; a man of tyrannical will who , regarding all others as silly sheep , wished to have his decrees preferred over the senses , experience , and nature itself
It is the followers of Aristotle who have crowned him with authority , not he who has usurped or appropriated it to himself

What was it about your wife that made you married her ?
If you are not happy then why stayed with her this long ?
You know you 're only burden yourself with her if you do n't have feelings for her .
Maybe it would be nice once in a while that you can help her and motivate her to lose weight .
You can workout with her to gain strength and muscle mass while she can drop some pounds .
Its really sad to see that you put up with a relationship knowing that you dont want to be in and will hurt her .
How would you feel if your wife was the one who left you if you were about 300 lbs or so and she was thin .
Is n't it terrible ?
You know , we 're not made perfect .
You married your wife because you 're suppose to be her better half and support her .
It goes both way not one way .
Is looks everything ?
I 'm sure your wife is a beautiful person in and out .
And I 'm hella sure that if you are willing to work with her and compromise and when you see her start to slim down , that could add some sparks to your love life .
Nethertheless , no one should be put in this position of not being wanted because of their weight .
Let her know that you care about her health and you want her to be healthy .
Do n't come at her and saying you have to lose weight b/c your fat .
You know she will get defensive .
I 'm pretty sure if you tell her you love her and you want to work it out together then you will get what you want .
And not only that , it will boost your wife self esteem up and make her keep herself looking good for herself and for you too .
I hope that this helps and again , do n't stay if u dont want too but yet again dont play with other peoples feeling .
Think about this , what if you did leave your wife for a thinner lady then she becomes 300 lbs .
What are you gonna do ?
Leave her too ?
In this lifetime , you know what you have is good but then again do n't screw up and go back to her once she loses weight as a way to get you back for leaving her .
Equatorial Guinea issued a request for an Interpol arrest warrant for Mark Thatcher yesterday , in connection with his alleged involvement in a failed coup attempt in the west African country five years ago .
Thatcher is accused of helping the British mercenary Simon Mann to stage a coup .
Interpol headquarters in Lyons said yesterday the request was being processed .
Details of Thatcher 's involvement have been provided by Mann , who was extradited from Zimbabwe to Equatorial Guinea two months ago .
Mann , who is awaiting trial for allegedly attempting to overthrow the government and threatening to kill the president , has already said in a Channel 4 interview from Black Beach prison in the capital , Malabo , that Lady Thatcher 's 54 - year - old son was " part of the team " .
In 2005 Thatcher was fined £ 265,000 and given a four - year suspended sentence in South Africa , where he and Mann lived , after a plea bargain in which he admitted helping to finance the purchase of a helicopter for the plotters even though he suspected it might be used for mercenary activity .
The announcement of the warrant request was made on Thursday by José Olo Obono , Equatorial Guinea 's attorney general .
" We are not going to let this drop , " he said .
" We will pursue him wherever he goes . "
Obono was speaking to British journalists who had flown to Malabo on advice from official sources that Mann would give a press conference this week before his trial .
Neither event has taken place and the trial is not expected for several weeks .
In return for his cooperation Mann and his family are hoping for a reduced sentence .

It has to feel like the walls are starting to close in for Hillary Clinton , as today the man who was the Secretary of Labor under her husband ’s administration , Robert Reich , endorsed Barack Obama .
On his blog Reich wrote about his own perceived lack of importance about his endorsement and his friendship with the Clintons .
“ The formal act of endorsing a candidate is generally ( and properly ) limited to editorial pages and elected officials whose constituents might be influenced by their choice .
The rest of us should n’t assume anyone cares .
My avoidance of offering a formal endorsement until now has also been affected by the pull of old friendships and my reluctance as a teacher and commentator to be openly partisan .
But my conscience wo n’t let me be silent any longer . ”
He wrote that Clinton ’s policy proposals were solid , but Obama ’s were even more solid , “ Although Hillary Clinton has offered solid and sensible policy proposals , Obama ’s strike me as even more so .
His plans for reforming Social Security and health care have a better chance of succeeding .
His approaches to the housing crisis and the failures of our financial markets are sounder than hers .
His ideas for improving our public schools and confronting the problems of poverty and inequality are more coherent and compelling .
He has put forward the more enlightened foreign policy and the more thoughtful plan for controlling global warming . ”
Advertisements
He discussed Obama ’s new politics and his belief that Obama can transcend what divides us , “ He also presents the best chance of creating a new politics in which citizens become active participants rather than cynical spectators .
He has energized many who had given up on politics .
He has engaged young people to an extent not seen in decades …he offers the best hope of transcending the boundaries of class , race , and nationality that have divided us .
His life history exemplifies this , as do his writings and his record of public service .
For these same reasons , he offers the best possibility of restoring America ’s moral authority in the world . ”
Reich also referenced Obama ’s race speech , and as I look back , I think that speech was the moment that he won over many in the Democratic Party , and convinced them that he was ready to be president .
So many party heavyweights have mentioned that speech specifically when endorsing Obama , that it can be concluded that it was that speech which lifted him from contender to nominee .
Reich is correct .
Clinton for the most part has been solid and workmanlike in this campaign .
Her biggest problem is that she ran into a special candidate , who has captured the imaginations of many Democrats .
Reich ’s endorsement wo n’t sway many voters , but it provides insight into the shift towards Obama within the party .

The 10 Worst Websites of 2007 Web design is an art .
Great web design occurs when design and content are seamless and you do n't notice its greatness .
Unfortunately , 2007 was among the worst ever for great web design , but it was wonderful for bad design .
Most of the sites look like the designer never read ( or ignored ) my article Does Your Web Site Suck ?
Checklist # 1 — 155 Mortal Sins That Will Send Your Site to Web Design Hell .
Most of the sites featured on Web Pages That Suck also committed one or more of the Biggest Mistakes in Web Design 1995 - 2015 including the following :
We 've designed our site to meet our organization 's needs ( more sales / contributions ) rather than meeting the needs of our visitors .
It takes longer than four seconds for the man from Mars to understand what our site is about .

They fixed the site , but that does n't mean they can hide .
Thank goodness for Archive.org — there are times when they actually capture a site .
This site 's " navigation " is unique , which is why I 'm sending you to a cached copy .
Submitter 's comments : I 've never seen anything like it before , and can't conceive of any reasonable explanation for this utterly gratuitous use of Javascript .
Using Javascript to alter the background color is n't new , clever , original , or remarkable — except in this case , where the results are remarkably hard on the eyes .
Yes , I know there 's a dispensation of sorts for graphics design sites , but in this case , if I were looking for a graphic design studio to work for me , I 'd run the other way as fast as possible .
I also notice that one of the examples that pops up when you click the last link , " Two Steps Back , a book for 55 Diesel , Milan " has an image with severe glare from the lighting , plus a large empty area on the left .
What is the point of that ?
Be sure you have web page - specified colors enabled , ditto Javascript ... Vincent Flanders ' comments : Someone once said , " Empathy is an effort to understand someone 's experience as she experiences it and to convey that understanding . "
I tried my very best to understand what would cause someone to use this design technique .
I looked deep within my soul for an explanation .
I will try to convey my understanding of the experience of this site .
The only explanation I can come up with is this web site has a subdural hematoma .
Wait a minute , that 's what sent me to the hospital four years ago .
One of the best examples of a " Subdural Hematoma Web Site " ( S.H. W.S. ) is Accept Jesus , Forever Forgiven !
After looking at the site you will feel nauseous , disoriented , numb , weak , dizzy , and have a headache .
If you stay too long on the site , you 'll slur your speech , your breathing pattern will change , and you 'll start to lose consciousness .
Only the thought of death will keep you alive .
That , and the thought that maybe you 'll become an amnesiac and forget you ever visited the site .
This site is n't as bad as the " Accept J " site , but it 's training to be such a site .
That would make it a " Subdural Hematoma In Training " site — or " S.H.I.T . "
Other comments # 1 : This web site scared me .
I came to the web page expecting a rainbow of colors .
All that greeted me was an innocuous white background and black text .
Nothing that great , but not at all the cornucopia of color I was expecting .
Then I rolled over the links .
It was a horrible experience that did n't end with clicking the link .
Since a different page was active , I thought it would hold the background color to just one color , but no , as I moved my mouse over the new page , the old page kept right on changing color .
I exited before losing consciousness , thankfully .

THE WEB IS NOT A BOOK !!!
If you want to flip pages , get the g**d **n catalog !
Other comments # 2 : This is not much better than just scanning and posting the catalog as a PDF .
When will these companies learn ( bicycle parts companies I 'm talking to you ) that people want to search and buy stuff online , not just look at a page load heavy catalog .
My husband spends thousands on bicycle parts , and maybe luckily for me he spends less than he would , due to frustrations with online shopping .
Vincent Flanders ’ comments : I like a person who cuts to the chase .
There ’s no waffling or hint of ambiguity in his / her opinion .
( All comments are about the original version . )
I do n’t have the slightest idea what this Flash - based monstrosity is about .
Initially , I did n’t notice the zoom icon so I wondered how in the heck I was going to read the tiny text .
Even after I click the zoom icon , I still have to stick my face in front on the monitor and squint my eyes to try to read the text .
Just remember that no matter how stupid this site is to normal folks like you and me , somebody or a group of people had to look at the site and say , “ Damn , this is hot , hot , hot . ”

But it 's always that way .

Trailing cursor , distracting background , animated GIFs , and ugly color :
What more can you say ?
Vincent Flanders ' comments :
They 've been " Serving Airlines Throughout the World Since 1948 " -- which is when their web site was created .
OK , Al Gore had n't invented the Internet in 1948 ( actually , he was born in 1948 ) but this site has that old , old , sucky look that people do n't believe still exists .
Uh ... Their logo has " Accessories " spelled " Accesories " and I do n't think that 's the British spelling .
I also love how they mix and match centered and left - justified text .
Other comments # 1 : I do n't always agree with your " suckers " because some of them ( though your points about navigation are certainly well taken ) are quite artistic - and clear took a lot of effort .
That said - this one absolutely deserves the " honor " you have bestowed upon it .
A pet peeve of mine is if you have the time to indicate an item is discontinued , you probably have time to delete it from your page .
Half the crap on this site is no longer available .
Other comments # 2 : A good example of all the doodads available to a webmaster skilled in animation but short on common sense .
After a few web sites loaded with animation hung up my processor I decided animation was not a skill I needed to learn .
Properly constructed and located navigation page links can salvage just about any crappy web site .
But this site needs a complete re-construction , preferably by an adult this time .
Do n't you just love to scroll pages ?

At least the navigation worked for me on this site .
Other comments # 2 : This site has earned the N.K. Tearful ' Why ? ' award .
I never found the ' real ' site because there is n't one .
This site has all my favorites : MMN , I - Frames , PDF files , scrolling , wordiness , etc. , etc .
The banner wasted enough space for 56 to 84 page links .
The site uses MMN and requires scrolling .
The site utilizes about one sixth of the screen to advantage , and half of that is wasted with navigation instructions , superlatives , and adverbs .
A web site that needs navigation instructions is a failure .
I saw a site just like this once before , it is a children 's site called Eric the Croc .
Remember your first English composition class when your teacher required you to write a small piece that was one page long ?
Most children stretched the longhand script to fill the lines as quickly as possible with very few words .
The person who wrote this site commands a large vocabulary but has n't learned to write with brevity .
A web site should n't read like Jane Eyre or a novel by Dickens .
I just love it when they have to explain acronyms .
The example below could be shortened to : " We will teach you how to cater to your customer 's banking needs . "
Example : Hello .
Welcome to the Sales , Incentive and Information Management System , otherwise known as SIIMS .
This is the CRM system that helps bankers generate revenue , build value for shareholders and provide superior service to customers .
The heart of SIIMS — the TotalView Relationship Management Program — is designed specifically to help you get a complete picture of your customers and their needs .

5. OPEN BEXI Vincent Flanders ’ comments : ( loud sobbing sounds )
Other comments : Horrible UI .
I 'd cry if someone made me use it .
Submitter ’s comments : Yikes !
This site is even worse for the fact that it intends to spread horrible design through its new HTML builder tool .
Other comments # 1 : I 'm blissfully ignorant about code writing and forty years past Latin , Italian and Spanish , but I think if one is going to publish in a foreign language , it 's probably a good idea to find a foreigner to write the script .
I 'm sure it took them only seconds to build their page if appearance is any clue .
I 've noticed that the 35 + pages web site I 'm working on now can take weeks for gathering information , fitting it , and then tweaking it for usability by the visitor .
Color cueing and capitalization for usability requires a great deal of discipline .
Pages that are the easiest to comprehend take considerable effort to build .
I really do n't care how a page works technically , just so it works every time .
Other comments # 2 : That ' created with ' logo in the corner ?
1024 pixels wide .
It 's squished so small you can't read it .
Note :
They fixed the site , but here 's a screenshot of how the site originally looked .

4. Usability Net
There 's a phrase called " unclear on the concept " that applies to this site .
Flash navigation has usability issues and you would think a web site about the topic of usability would understand this fact .
Vincent Flanders ' comments :
There are some things you just do n't do if you want to be politically correct , but I 've always been a rebel without a clue .
You just do n't critique usability experts if you 're involved in the same field AND your web site sucks .
One of my favorite singer / songwriters is Chris Knight .
He has a song called " It Ain't Easy Being Me " and these four lines explain why I chose this site :
There ought to a bridge somewhere they could dedicate to me
I 'd probably come to the ceremony with a can of gasoline
Walk on over to the other side where I 'd light a match
Sit and stare through the smoke and flames and wonder how I 'm gonna get back Let 's make UsabilityNet , which bills itself as " A European Union project that provides usability and user centred design resources to practitioners , managers and EU projects , " one of the worst sites of 2007 .
Gee .
Where 's the match ?
It 's time to blow up the bridge .
I chose them because I simply cannot believe they use Flash navigation .
When I visited the site I I was using Firefox with the Flash Block plugin and basically got a blank screen .
I realize UsabilityNet discusses their reasons for using Flash , and they claim they 're working on an HTML version , but it looks like they 've been working on it since 2003 .
I can't think of a reason they would use Flash .
Can you ?
I think it sucks like a bilge pump .
Maybe it sucks like a black hole .
Hmm .
It sucks like a lousy hair band from the 80's playing at an Indian casino .

It 's not just that I think their ideas suck .
The web site really sucks .
Try finding their phone number .
Try finding the hours of the museum .
They must not care if people make it there .
Vincent Flanders ' comments :
Unfortunately , in the battle between appearance and reality , appearance wins on the web .
If your site looks like it was designed by a psychotic , people are n't going to trust the content .
In my speeches I use an example of a business site I call " The Vincent Flanders School of Dentistry and Auto Body Repair . "
The name of the school always gets a laugh because ... well , it 's " out there . "
The # 3 Worst Site knocked down , ran over and trampled the name of my school — " Creation Museum , Taxidermy Hall of Fame of NC and Antique Tool Museum . "
This site is a classic example of Mistake # 6 from The Biggest Mistakes in Web Design 1995 - 2015 —
" Have you ever seen another web site ?
Really ?
Does n't look like it . "
I call this type of design the " I have n't taken my antipsychotics in a while school of web design . "

2. Microsoft Quite frankly , a company worth billions of dollars can spend a few bucks and make sure there 's sufficient contrast between the text and the background .
It 's not just about web standards ; it 's about making your site easier to read .
The lack of contrast is either arrogance or stupidity .
Vincent Flanders ’ comments : NOTE : Microsoft makes # 2 because there is no reason for this type of amateur mistake coming out of corporation like Microsoft .
I was reading a post on a Microsoft blog about how the yet - unreleased Internet Explorer 8 passed the Web Standards Project 's Acid2 test .
Hmm … Microsoft and web standards in the same sentence ?
One of the ADD thoughts that ran through my brain was , “ Hey , go run Microsoft ’s home page through AccessColor ’s color contrast and brightness test . ”
The results will have nothing to do with web standards , just the ability to code a page in such a way that the text is readable against the background .
It ’s all about visual contrast and it's important to be able to read the page .
This is the specific
This is the specific Microsoft home page I ran through the analyzer and here are the results I received : Click on the picture to see the complete results ( 382 Kb ) Both color difference and color brightness do not meet the recommended standard for 62.13 % of the total text .
A Fail message is displayed next to the HTML source line .
Either color difference or color brightness does not meet the recommended standard for 0.53 % of the total the text .
A Warning message is displayed next to the HTML source line .
Now , I ’ve never met a stupid person who worked for Microsoft ( some have been a little too Lifespring - ish or est- ian for my taste ) , so I have to ask myself , “ Do n’t they understand it does n’t cost millions of dollars to make your page readable ? ”
OK , they ’re stupid .

Hydrogen cars and their promise of a zero-emission , petroleum - free future are no longer the stuff of science fiction .
Automakers have the technology largely nailed down and say vehicles like the Chevrolet Equinox FCEV and Honda FCX Clarity are poised to take us beyond gasoline .
There 's just one hitch .
Where do we get the hydrogen ?
There are 36 hydrogen fueling stations in the United States , and two thirds of them are in California .
Increasing that number in any meaningful way remains the biggest - and most pressing - challenge keeping us from traveling the hydrogen highway .
" The reality is , we cannot wait , " says Paul Brubaker , head of the Research and Innovative Technology Administration for the federal Department of Transportation .
" We have to figure out what to do to reach critical mass and create the infrastructure to get these cars on the road sooner than later . "
If Brubaker 's got any thoughts on the matter , he kept them to himself during Hydrogen Drive 2008 , where 40 or so experts from the government , the auto industry and academia said we need a Manhattan Project level of commitment - and spending - to improve the technology and develop the infrastructure .
How much money are we talking about ?
The federal government has spent $ 1.2 billion on hydrogen in the five years since President Bush announced an initiative to develop a national hydrogen infrastructure .
We 'll need a whole lot more than that if we 're to meet the president 's goal of replacing fossil fuels by 2040 .
Hydrogen advocates like the National Hydrogen Association say we could put 70 percent of all Americans within 2 miles of a hydrogen fueling station for $ 10 to $ 15 billion .
They like to point out that 's half the cost of the Trans Alaska Pipeline System ( in today 's dollars ) and about what we 're spending each month in Iraq .
That figure seems optimistic - perhaps wildly so .
Royal Dutch Shell , which created the Shell Hydrogen subsidiary in 1999 , says supplying 2 percent of America 's cars with hydrogen by 2020 would cost " around $ 20
billion . "
Wired , in " How Hydrogen Can Save America , " argues we can make the switch to a hydrogen economy for $ 100 billion .
And a 2002 analysis by Argonne National Laboratory found " the hydrogen delivery infrastructure to serve 40 percent of the light - duty fleet is likely to cost over $ 500 billion . "
That 's a wide range of numbers , but they all show switching to hydrogen wo n't be cheap .
" Until we put billions or even trillions of dollars into this , it just wo n't happen , " says Paul Williamson of the University of Montana College of Technology .
Others agree the tab will be high but say we wo n't need a nationwide infrastructure for decades , so let 's start with major metropolitan areas like Los Angeles .
The California Fuel Cell Partnership says 40 stations would put most L.A. residents within five minutes of a hydrogen source .
" In the near - term , it can be accomplished for what we 're spending on other priorities , " said Joan Ogden of the UC Davis Institute of Transportation Studies .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has mapped out just that kind of approach with his " Hydrogen Highway " agenda .
Four years ago , his administration proposed spending as much as $ 11 million a year to bring 100 hydrogen stations online by 2010 .
We have 25 so far , and a solar - powered facility that will use electrolysis to produce hydrogen opens next month in Sacramento ( most stations use hydrogen produced by steam reformulation of natural gas ) .
The California Air Resources Board expects to finance 10 more stations within the next two years .
Progress has been slow , spokeswoman Gennet Paauwe told the Sacramento Bee , because advancements in fuel cell technology have been slow and there are only 200 or so fuel cell vehicles on the road in California .
" We 're not going to open stations if there are n't vehicles to fill , " she told the Bee .
But automakers say they can't make the technology commercially viable - they 've still got to boost range , improve durability and bring down costs - until there 's a fueling infrastructure broad enough to support the cars .
It 's a classic catch - 22 - we can't get the stations until we get the cars , but we can't get the cars until we have the stations .
By Elizabeth de la Vega , t r u t h o u t
… In the early 1900s , as a former New York City fire chief testified regarding factory conditions after the Triangle fire , there was “ nobody responsible for anything . ”
Now , of course , we have an office – the Occupational Safety and Health Agency ( OSHA ) – that is at least putatively responsible for workplace safety .
Specifically , OSHA is legislatively mandated to ( 1 ) enact industrial standards for toxic substance exposure and site protection ; and ( 2 ) conduct inspections to ensure those standards are followed .
Unfortunately , OSHA started becoming anemic during the 1990s , and now it is positively spectral .
With fewer employees than it had 30 years ago , yet twice the number of workplaces in its charge , OSHA would need 133 years to inspect every business over which it has jurisdiction .
The far more serious problem with OSHA ’s performance , however , is that , under the Bush administration , it has deliberately avoided setting any significant industrial standards .
( To be precise , it has set one , regarding the permissible level of workplace exposure to the known carcinogen hexavalent chromium , but only after a court ordered it to do so . )
OSHA ’s abdication of its duties is not a matter of incompetence .
It is , as Rep. John Barrows ( D - Georgia ) pointed out in a March 12 , 2008 , Workforce Protections Subcommittee Hearing of the House , Education and Labor Committee , a purposeful unwillingness to act .
Or , to put it more colorfully , as Barrows did : “ When you ’ve got an agency that do n’t know its job or do n’t care about its job , or has all kinds of reasons for not doin ’ its job , it ’s a little bit like goin ’ bird huntin ’ and havin ’ to tote the dog . ”
OSHA ’s failure to enact mandatory standards has not only been fatal to its mission ; it has been fatal to the workers .
Lil'Bit was born around seven months ago in the state of Arizona , and at first he was n't expected to stay alive .
But his owner took extra special care of him , and now Lil ' Bit is doing really well .
He has three eyes , two mouths , two noses and one pair of ears and some experts think he may even have two brains as well .
Sometimes one of Lil' Bit 's faces will be asleep , while the other is still awake .
The cat 's owner told a newspaper : " When I picked Lil ' Bit up I suddenly spotted that he had two faces .
I was so shocked that I nearly dropped him .
" I called a kitten rescue service and they told me not to expect him to survive .
But I did n't see why he should n't be given the chance to live .
Everything is possible . "
Giving Yourself a Sixth Sense for Wireless Networks
What ?
How ?
Amaze your friend(s ) and terrify your enemies by granting yourself the ability to supernaturally sense wireless network hotspots !
( Well , apparently supernaturally , anyway . )
You will easily and quite literally " feel " wireless access points in the vicinity and automatically sense their signal strength as easily as you feel the wind on your cheek .
All you need is a few parts and some careful electronics work .
What This Is
This project is for a small electronic unit that allows the user to sense the presence and relative signal strength of wireless hotspots .
It can be worn as a pendant or carried in a pocket .
It is " always on " and communicates the presence and signal strength of an in - range hotspot by way of sequences of pulses - like a heartbeat you can feel .
The stronger and faster the " heartbeat " , the stronger the wireless signal detected .
It does not actually authenticate or otherwise interact with a hotspot in any way .
It is a 100 % passive device , meaning it transmits nothing --- it can detect hotspots , but can not be detected itself .
How It Was Made
This project consists of a microcontroller , some custom interface electronics , a small vibe motor , and an off - the - shelf Wi - Fi detector - the one I used is by D - Link and is keychain - sized .
Here is the sensor I used , and some pictures of the construction .
Details of the design will follow .
How It Works
The microcontroller periodically " presses " the button on the detector to initiate a reading .
Then the microcontroller " reads " the output from the indicator LEDs on the detector , and uses this as the basis for pulsing out a signal on the vibe motor , which the wearer can feel .
In this way , the unit keeps you updated on the presence and signal strength of a wireless hotspot in your vicinity .
No pulses means no signal .
Short pulses means a weak signal .
Faster , more frequent pulses means a stronger signal .
This feedback is very much like a heartbeat , and is extremely intuitive to interpret .
How To Make Your Own
First of all , I use a microcontroller in this project .
If you are n't familiar with terms like 12F629 or .HEX files and how to blast them into a PIC , you will have trouble with this project .
The D - Link sensor I used works like this -- press the button and the LEDs light up in a " scanning " pattern while it looks for a signal .
It can be in this scanning pattern for up to a few seconds .
Afterwards , it lights up either one , two , three , or four of the green LEDs to indicate relative signal strength .
If there is no signal detected , a single red LED is lit .
The LED (s ) remain lit for a few seconds , then the sensor shuts off .
If your chosen sensor works differently , you will need to adjust the electronic interface and the program in the microcontroller accordingly .
The electronic add - on part interfaces to the sensor in two basic ways :
The " Button Hitter " This is how a digital output from the microcontroller " pushes " the activation button on the sensor .
A digital " 0 " to the spot indicated on the graphic triggers the sensor .
The " LED Watcher " This is how the microcontroller senses which LEDs are lit ( or not lit ) and reads them as digital inputs .
As shown on the diagram above , the indicated spots beside each LED can be read as a digital " 0 " when the LED is lit .
Operation
This is a basic description of how the unit works ( the code in the microcontroller is a little more complicated , but this will tell you what happens ) .
The microcontroller program is a big loop that does the following tasks asynchronously : activates the sensor every 10 seconds or so , checks to see if any LEDs are lit solidly ( a signal strength reading is ready ) , pulses an appropriate " heartbeat " .
Activate the sensor .
( Note that the " scanning " - where LEDs light up momentarily back - and - forth in an old - school Cylon - eye fashion - can take up to a few seconds to complete . )
Watch those LED outputs and wait until one or more LEDs remain lit for at least 500 ms .
Did any LEDs remain lit ?
If so , then check which one (s ) .
This tells us the signal strength .
Then depending on the signal strength , set the " heatbeat rate " to reflect the strength of the signal detected : Signal strength 4 ( highest ) : pum - pum - pum - pum - pum - pum Signal strength 3 ( high ) : pum-pum ... ... pum-pum ... ... pum-pum ... ... Signal strength 2 ( low ) : pum ... ... ... pum ... ... ... pum ... ... ... pum ... ... ... Signal strength 1 ( lowest ) : No change ( provides hysteresis beftween LOW and NO signal ) .
Signal strength 0 ( none ) : No heartbeat .
Every 10 seconds , repeat # 1 . Specific Design Information
Here is a schematic of the interface and electronics .
The sensor and electronics run on a 3V supply ( provided by CR2032 cells in parallel ) and the vibe motor has a separate power supply .
A couple AAA cells or even another CR2032 cell should do the trick .
I used the Microchip 12F629 microcontroller , and Melabs ' PICBasic compiler .
Download the source code Download the .HEX file I ignore the lowest signal strength LED for purposes of reading the sensor 's output ( I actually do not read it , and as a result it acts as a " no change " ) .
This provides some hysteresis between the LOW SIGNAL and NO SIGNAL results .
The HIGH SIGNAL and NO SIGNAL are OR 'd together on GP5 on the PIC .
This saved me an I /O pin at the time .
Since a HIGH SIGNAL reading lights all the signal LEDs , if GP5 is low ( active ) then I can check GP4 ( the next signal LED down ) to determine the " real " reading .
If GP4 is also low , then the HIGH led was lit .
If GP4 is not low ( led not lit ) then the NO SIGNAL led was lit .
This is explained more fully in the source code -- but the short version is that I saved an I / O pin by doing it this way .
( The I / O pin I " saved " ( GP1 ) is unused in the schematic -- this is intentional as I was actually having quite a lot of trouble with it , so I simply avoided the problem and just left it alone . )
Video Demonstration A Possible Alternate Use : Friendly I.Q. Test Stick it in an envelope ( so it works and the vibration can be felt , but it can't be seen ) .
Then present it to a friend .
Using it only in its intended manner ( i.e. no opening it up allowed ) , how long before they figure out what it is sensing ?
Lessons Learned
The sensor works best when the flat side of the sensor is facing a wi-fi access point directly .
If the source of the wireless signal is to the side of the sensor ( relatively speaking ) , it will not sense it as well .
Meat does a reasonable job of attenuating ( or even blocking ) a signal .
So assuming the unit is in your front shirt pocket or around your neck like a pendant , you may not pick up a signal behind you as well as you pick up one in front of you .
Turning 180 degrees may result in a stronger or weaker detected signal despite the fact that you have not really moved .
This can help you roughly localize an access point in the vicinity as long as there is n't a lot of interference or anything .
( See note below ) Wireless signals will bounce off things such as sheer building faces .
So remember you 're only detecting the presence of a signal and its relative strength -- not necessarily it 's location .
Originally I attempted to make the vibe motor vibrate softer or harder to indicate signal strength .
This did n't work nearly as well as I thought it would .
I switched to the " heartbeat " model where pulse rate was felt instead - and a stronger signal meant a faster pulse rate ( like a heartbeat ) .
This was extremely intuitive .
Filigrams : A New Type of Pretty Picture
by Simon Tatham , mathematician and programmer
Synopsis
Filigrams are a type of pretty pictures generated by mathematical means .
They 're not technically a type of fractal , although they contain elements which people who know fractals might find hauntingly familiar .
They 're something I invented by accident once and decided to polish up because it looked pretty .
Genesis
I produced the first filigram completely by mistake .
When I was 14 or so , my GCSE Computer Studies teacher showed me a short BASIC program on a BBC Micro that plotted a pleasant repeating pattern of interlocking circles :
I thought it was pretty enough that I should take the program home and run it on my Amiga , where I could give it the benefit of better graphics and see how much prettier it looked then .
So I memorised the important details of the program and went home to a real computer .
Completely by accident , I got one character wrong when I typed the program back in , and it generated this instead :
Now that 's much more interesting than interlocking circles , is n't it ?
It 's got clear structure at the centre – black fades to white and jumps back to black again , repeatedly , in narrower and narrower stripes .
Then , once the stripes become smaller than the distance between pixels , the delicate filigree ( hence the name ) degenerates into chaos .
But beyond that , as if by magic , the chaos reforms into a new order , with little butterfly shapes embedded in the swirling black and white maelstrom .
I stared at this feast of interlocking detail and was very glad I 'd typed the circles formula in wrong .
Then I set about enlarging it to poster size , so I could print it out and put it on my wall .
Unfortunately , the pattern proved to be elusive .
The way it was generated provided an obvious way of magnifying it : the program was computing a function at every point of a square grid , so to enlarge it you just compute the same function at some new points in between the original points , right ?
Wrong – if you try that , a lot of the interesting detail in the butterfly shapes just disappears .
Some of it remains , but more and more of the detail disappears the further you enlarge the image .
It was like trying to nail fog to the wall – at 320 × 256 resolution , the image obediently sat there and looked pretty , but as soon as I looked any closer it vanished .
Infuriating .
And there the matter rested for nearly ten years , until one day , after having done a maths degree , I remembered it and came back to see if I could finally find a way to catch that fog and nail it down .
Analysis
( Warning to non-mathematicians : this section may get a little intense .
But there are pretty pictures to look at , so that 's all right :-)
The formula I 'd completely failed to type correctly was the obvious " circular " formula : $ x ^ 2+ y ^ 2 $ .
The program I saw computed the fractional part of this function at every point on the screen and converted it to a colour value .
This produces an N - colour image of interlocking circles , and the pattern ends up repeating itself after long enough .
Instead of this , though , I replaced the addition with a multiplication : $ x ^2 \times y^2 $ , with its fractional part taken , generates the picture shown above .
So that explains the central section : each stripe in the centre follows a line along which $ xy$ is constant .
Based on this level of understanding , I was able to replace the function with the slightly more complex $ ( 2x+y ) ( 2x -y ) ( x+2y ) ( x - 2 y ) $ , which produces a nice symmetric cross shape at the centre :
But we still have n't explained the butterflies – and I knew that I would have to understand what the butterflies were if I were to avoid them disappearing when magnified .
So when I came back to the problem nearly ten years later , I looked at it with the eyes of a much more highly trained mathematician , and was finally able to see far enough into the chaos to pin down the cause of the butterflies .
The reason the central section of the image has such smooth changes of colour is that the values of $ f ( x , y ) $ do n't vary by much over the distance between pixels .
But out in the butterfly regions , $ f( x , y ) $ is growing much faster than that ; so why are those butterflies appearing ?
Answer : it must be because the difference in $ f ( x , y ) $ between one pixel and the next is very close to an integer – so that the difference in the fractional part of $ f ( x , y ) $ is very small even though the actual values of $ f$ differ by a lot .
And that 's why half the butterflies disappear when you enlarge the image by a factor of two : when the difference in $ f $ between two pixels is close to an odd integer , then the fractional part of $ f$ half - way between the two pixels will be about $ \frac12 $ away from what it was at the original pixels themselves – as different as it's possible to be .
No wonder the butterflies disappeared so easily .
So at the centre of every butterfly , the fractional part of $ f ( x , y ) $ is close to the fractional part of $ f( x+1 , y ) $ , and also close to the fractional part of $ f( x , y+1 ) $ .
In other words – and here 's where the calculus begins – the partial derivatives of $ f$ with respect to $ x $ and $ y$ are both integers at the centre of each butterfly .
( Well , actually they 're integer multiples of the reciprocal of the inter - pixel spacing ; but it obscures the essence of the mathematics to have to keep remembering about the inconvenient constants .
Putting the correct constants back in is left as an exercise for the reader :-)
This also suggests that if we plot the lines along which the partial derivatives $ \partial f/\partial x$ and $ \partial f/ \partial y$ are equal to an integer and a half , we might well find ourselves drawing a set of lines that precisely mark the divisions between the butterflies .
And it 's true : we get the following picture .
( The partial derivatives in $ x $ and $ y$ are $ 16x ^3 - 34xy ^2 $ and $ 16y ^3 - 34yx ^2 $ respectively .
Black lines mark contours of $ \partial f/\partial x$ ; red lines mark contours of $ \partial f/\partial y$. )
( Notice in the above graph that the contours of the derivatives have a three - fold symmetry .
These three - way symmetric curves can clearly be seen by following the lines of butterflies in the original image ; at first sight they seem a bit odd because the function being plotted is four - way symmetric , right ?
But it does make sense : the positions of the butterflies depend on the derivatives of the degree - 4 polynomial we started with , which are degree - 3 polynomials and can therefore indeed be expected to be three - way symmetric . )
Now we 're getting closer .
With the above piece of analysis to help us , we can isolate each butterfly and treat it separately .
For a moment , let 's pretend this whole thing is only happening in one dimension , instead of two .
Consider the situation at the centre : the value of $ f$ itself varies very little between pixels , so computing the halfway point between two pixels will produce a value that still fits in sensibly with the ones around it .
No problem .
Now consider the situation in a butterfly region .
The difference in $ f $ between two adjacent pixels is close to an integer , let 's say $ a$ .
So $ f( x+1 ) =f ( x ) +a+ \epsilon$ , where $ \epsilon $ is the error term .
Therefore , we would expect the halfway point to be $ f ( x ) + a/2+\epsilon'$ , where $ \epsilon ' $ is comparable to $ \epsilon$ .
More generally , $ f( x+b ) $ ( where $ b$ is between 0 and 1 ) can be expected to be $ f( x ) +ab+\epsilon( b ) $ .
So this gives what seems like a sensible way to plot a point whose coordinates are fractional .
To plot the point at $ x+b$ , compute the nearest integer $ g$ to the partial derivative at $ x $ ; then compute $ f( x+b ) $ as normal , but subtract $ bg$ before taking the fractional part .
And this works !
Returning to two dimensions , it still works .
Every clearly defined butterfly in the original image holds together when viewed at higher resolution .
Let 's enlarge the image above by a factor of two to prove it :
To summarise , the algorithm for enlarging the image is as follows .
For each pixel $ ( X , Y ) $ in the enlarged image , convert its coordinates to coordinates $ ( x , y ) $ in the original image .
Save the fractional part $ ( x_f , y_f ) $ of each resulting coordinate .
Compute the partial derivatives $ ( f_x , f_y ) $ of the function at the point $ ( x , y ) $ , rounded to the nearest integer .
Compute the value of the function $ f ( x , y ) $ .
Subtract the product of each partial derivative with the fractional part of the corresponding coordinate , to get $ f( x , y ) -f_xx_f -f_yy_f $ .
Take the fractional part of that , and convert it into a pixel colour .
Metamorphosis
After doing all of this , I made a further discovery .
The original function $ x ^2y ^2 $ , and the replacement $ ( 2x+y ) ( 2x -y ) ( x+2y ) ( x - 2 y ) $ that I then switched to , are both products of real linear factors .
What happens , I wonder , when you try using a polynomial without real factors ?
So I tried it , of course .
I replaced the function $ ( 2x+y ) ( 2x -y ) ( x+2y ) ( x - 2 y ) $ with the alternative function $ ( 2x+iy ) ( 2x - iy ) ( x + 2iy ) ( x - 2iy ) $ ( which of course multiplies out to a real polynomial , since the factors come in conjugate pairs ) .
The result was qualitatively different from the other images :
Suddenly we 're getting circle shapes instead of butterfly shapes !
In retrospect , this makes reasonable sense : you get a circle shape when the function is locally shaped like a paraboloid – curving upwards on all sides , or downwards on all sides – and a butterfly shape when the function is locally saddle - shaped , curving upwards in one direction and downwards in the perpendicular direction .
By choosing polynomials with real factors , it seems I inadvertently also chose functions which were saddle - shaped everywhere .
This is very nice ; what happens when we try a function with some real factors ?
So I tried the polynomial $ y ( 2x - iy ) ( 2x+iy ) $ ... and this happened .
Is n't that something ?
Butterflies in parts of the plot , circles in other parts – and some really fun things , like small fish shapes , happening where the two meet .
We can work out which type of feature we expect to see in which parts of the plane , by applying a bit more calculus : given a twice partially differentiable function $ f ( x , y ) $ , a few hours of intense thought will tell you that the double partial derivatives can be combined into the formula $ $ \left ( \ frac{ \partial ^ 2 f}{\partial x \ partial y}\right ) ^2-\left ( \frac{\partial ^2 f}{\partial x ^2}\right ) \left ( \frac{\partial ^2f}{\partial y^2}\right ) $ $ and that this is greater than zero in saddle - shaped regions and less than zero in circle - shaped regions .
( Also , this formula only varies by a positive constant factor when you change the axes on the diagram , so it 's a genuine reliable way to tell . )
But this does n't seem to help with the pretty pictures – it just gives us a useful tool to analyse them with .
Synthesis
So that 's the heavy - duty maths over with .
We 're now able to take the original simple plots of the fractional part of $ f ( x , y ) $ , and enhance them into high - resolution images that can be fed to a seriously high quality printer to generate eye - twisting posters .
But that is n't the end of it : some of the by - products of the algorithm above can be used to produce some more fun effects .
In particular , when the partial derivatives above are rounded to the nearest integer , it 's instructive to note the amount by which each derivative had to change when rounded .
This will be close to zero ( in both directions ) at the centre of each butterfly , close to one - half ( in both directions ) at the corner between four butterflies , and close to one - half ( in only one direction ) on the edge between two butterflies .
So we could take the maximum of the fractional part of each partial derivative and use it to fade the butterflies out at the edges :
Also , keeping the integer parts of the partial derivatives provides a good way to differentiate one butterfly from the next by changing the colour .
Here 's what happens if we colour each butterfly purple or green depending on whether the sum of the integer parts of the partial derivatives is even or odd ( this looks a bit strange unless the fading effect is used at the same time ) :
Catalysis
In case you want to try doing some of these for yourself , a program to generate filigrams is available for download here : C source code and precompiled Windows executable .
The program will produce PNG , Windows .
BMP , or PPM files , and image processing software should be able to convert those to other formats if you prefer .
Here 's a selection of sample command lines you might like to try :

Editor ’s Note :
In the video , Dietl admits he has problems with the official version of events and tells WeAreChange his daughter came to him with evidence of a conspiracy .
Highly decorated former New York City detective Bo Dietl admits that his first instinct on 9/11 was that the twin towers were downed with explosives , as he conceded that he shared many questions about the official story with 9/11 truth activists he had formerly debunked on national television .
What started out as a adversarial confrontation with members of We Are Change turned into a cordial discussion as Dietl contradicted some of his previous public statements on 9/11 and appeared to agree with the group on several issues , presumably prompted by the fact that his daughter was doing a research paper on 9/11 which lent credence to the suspect nature of the official story behind the attacks .
" I had a perfect view …. next thing is I hear screaming , I looked up and when these are coming down you know what the first thing I said is ?
They had fucking bombs in those buildings – I ’m telling you what was in my mind , I said there had to be bombs in the buildings , " said Dietl .
" You ’re talking about two 110 story buildings that fucking evaporated , " said Dietl , adding , " Where are the people … .
I ask the same questions it ’s such a devastating thing . "
" Where the fuck did all these bodies go – it was pulverized – no bones , no DNA was found , I did n’t see no body parts " added Dietl , who was on the scene to help rescue workers and firefighters shortly after the towers ’ collapse .
Dietl confirmed that the collapse of WTC 7 was known ahead of time and that he was told to stay away from the building .
Dietl also described it as a " fucking crime " that members of the Bin Laden family were flown out of the country under FBI supervision in the days following 9/11 when all other air traffic was grounded .
The former detective also mentioned how his former friend FBI agent John O’Neill , who died in the towers , was prevented by the FBI from prosecuting Bin Laden and other Al - Qaeda members .
However , Dietl ’s claim that " they never dreamt in a million years the tragedy that happened would happen " in the context of his assertion that the faulty construction of the towers contributed to their sudden collapse is demonstrably false .
Numerous different World Trade Center designers and construction specialists are on record as having ruled out the possibility that multiple commercial jetliner impacts could bring the towers down .
A February 3 , 1964 white paper which was written during the design phase of the towers stated , " The buildings have been investigated and found to be safe in an assumed collision with a large jet airliner ( Boeing 707 DC 8 ) traveling at 600 miles per hour .
Analysis indicates that such collision would result in only local damage which could not cause collapse or substantial damage to the building and would not endanger the lives and safety of occupants not in the immediate area of impact . "
In 2001 , Leslie Robertson , one of the two original structural engineers for the World Trade Center , stated , " The twin towers were in fact the first structures outside the military and nuclear industries designed to resist the impact of a jet airplane . "
Also in early 2001 , Frank A. Demartini , on - site construction manager for the World Trade Center , said on camera , " The building was designed to have a fully loaded 707 crash into it .
That was the largest plane at the time .
I believe that the building probably could sustain multiple impacts of jetliners because this structure is like the mosquito netting on your screen door — this intense grid — and the jet plane is just a pencil puncturing that screen netting .
It really does nothing to the screen netting . "
Since Dietl still serves as Chairman of the New York State Security Guard Advisory Council , his comments are of great significance in the quest for a new investigation .

Two bacterial species have apparently been caught in the act of merging back into one .
This case of de-speciation may be a consequence of the two species being thrown together within domestic animals .
Campylobacter coli and C. jejuni are the most common causes of bacterial food poisoning worldwide .
The two species differ in 13.5 % of the nucleotide bases that spell out their genomes .
That is a level of genetic differentiation comparable to that seen between other bacteria that diverged over 100 million years ago – plenty of time to have developed into different species or even different genera .
But when Daniel Falush , a bacterial geneticist at University College Cork , Ireland , and his colleagues looked more closely , they found that the two species have recently started exchanging genetic material at a high rate .

Wholesale exchange
In particular , they found that one sub-lineage of C. coli , known as clade 1 , carries many more C. jejuni genes than the other two C. coli sub-lineages .
Moreover , 49 out of 50 such genes had sequences that had not changed by even a single base from the C. jejuni form — strong evidence that the exchange happened very recently .
In fact , Falush ’s analysis shows that the two species ’ genomes are converging through gene exchange at least four times as quickly as they are diverging through mutation .
In the wild , C. coli and C. jejuni tend to infect different species , but the clade 1 form of C. coli can co-occur alongside C. jejuni in farm animals such as chickens and cattle .
By eliminating the ecological barriers that once kept the two bacteria separate , agriculture may have given them the opportunity for wholesale genetic exchange .
Evolutionary dead end ?
“ When these two bacteria get together in the same niche , they are perfectly capable of exchanging DNA at a very high rate , ” says Falush .
“ Differences that happened over a long time period can be reversed over a very short time period . ”
If Falush is right , then different niches may play a crucial role in speciation in bacteria , just as they do in higher organisms .
Evolutionary biologists have suspected this on theoretical grounds , but Falush ’s study is the first concrete evidence to support this idea .
Falush ’s study clearly shows that the two Campylobacter species are swapping genes at a high rate , says William Hanage , an evolutionary biologist at Imperial College in London .
However , the researchers have yet to show that the resulting hybrids are fit enough to continue the process of convergence , rather than just being an evolutionary dead end .
“ Call me 75 % convinced , ” says Hanage .
“ There ’s a ways to go yet . ”

GOP presidential candidate , Rudy Giuliani , appeared on Meet The Press this morning and in a stunning reversal of policy , host Tim Russert actually grilled him , asking him tough questions AND followed up .
Rudy looked lost and confused at times as he bumbled , stumbled and backtracked his way through this terrible interview .
His attempts to defend his shady past and the myriad scandals torpedoing his campaign -- failed miserably .
In this clip , Russert hits America 's Mayor with a question about the Iraq Study Group and why he chose to skip ISG meetings to make huge sums of money for speaking engagements .
Rudy claims he discussed dropping out with James Baker ( that 's news ) , but thought being involved with the ISG would be a bad idea because he was thinking about running for president - but had n't made up his mind yet .
Huh ?
Being an ISG member would have been a huge feather in his cap now that he 's actually running , but why would he bother with such trivial matters as learning how to avoid another disaster like Iraq when he could make major cash on the lecture circuit ?
Usually I do n’t bother blogging about these , but this one is particularly bad .
Anyone with basic SQL knowledge could have registered anyone he wanted as a sex offender .
One of the cardinal rules of computer programming is to never trust your input .
This holds especially true when your input comes from users , and even more so when it comes from the anonymous , general public .
Apparently , the developers at Oklahoma ’s Department of Corrections slept through that day in computer science class , and even managed to skip all of Common Sense 101 .
You see , not only did they trust anonymous user input on their public - facing website , but they blindly executed it and displayed whatever came back .
The result of this negligently bad coding has some rather serious consequences : the names , addresses , and social security numbers of tens of thousands of Oklahoma residents were made available to the general public for a period of at least three years .
Up until yesterday , April 13 2008 , anyone with a web browser and the knowledge from Chapter One of SQL For Dummies could have easily accessed — and possibly , changed — any data within the DOC ’s databases .

You have arrived at " One particularly useful Web site "
-- New York Times
Carbonating tap water to make seltzer is easy , fast , and absurdly inexpensive with my improvised apparatus .
All that is required is to place CO2 ( carbon dioxide ) gas in agitated contact with chilled water for a few seconds .
In this essay , I 'll show you how it is done with easy - to - find parts and common PET ( polyethylene terephthalate , sometimes called PETE ) soda bottles .
I 'll also explain the kinetic chemistry of why it works so well .
And in the second half of this essay , I 'll explain how I progressed from this improvised apparatus to installing a complete soda fountain in my home .
The Gas Supply : Tank and Regulator
The essential ingredient is a supply of CO2 under pressure .
CO2 is sold commercially in steel tanks of various sizes .
It is actually a very inexpensive material , considering the special handling it requires .
In my area you can refill a 20 - pound tank for about $ 18 , which will make many hundreds of gallons of carbonated beverages .
Larger tanks are even cheaper per pound .
Many soft - drink or beer distributors will swap your empty CO2 tank for a full tank at even lower cost , since they expect to make their profit on the other products that just use CO2 for propulsion .
You should n't have to invest more than $ 75 to own such a swappable tank with a current inspection , and many dealers even prefer to just charge you a smaller refundable deposit to borrow one .
A " 20 - pound tank " is so called not because it weighs 20 lbs , but because it contains 20 lbs of CO2 in gas - over - liquid form ( aka liquid - under - own - vapor ) .
The empty steel tank and valve weight about 30 lbs ( the " tare weight " ) , so the total filled weight is a hefty 50 lbs or so .
I prefer this size tank because it is the largest that is still possible for me to carry by hand , and its 30 - inch height also just fits under the counter in the kitchen .
Tanks smaller than the 20 - pound size do cost a bit less , and they 're easier to lug around , but you will have to refill more often at a slightly greater cost per unit of CO2 .
On the other hand , the giant 50 - pound tank weighs about 160 lbs when full , making it more of a piece of heavy equipment than a gadget .
The actual weight of my 20 lb tank on one occasion was 30.4 lbs ( 13.8 kg ) empty and 46.3 lbs ( 21.0 kg ) full .
Apparently the " 20 lbs " of payload is either a nominal figure , or I was n't getting a complete fill from the supplier .
The regulator adds about 3 lbs , if you 're trying to weigh a connected tank .
Tanks also vary slightly in size and weight depending on their construction .
The tank alone is not enough to supply the gas .
One must attach a regulator to reduce the gas pressure inside the tank to a controlled , usable , low pressure .
This is the top of the CO2 tank and regulator , underneath the kitchen counter in a corner of a cabinet .
The low - pressure outlet hose ( exiting the bottom of the regulator at the bottom left ) runs along the back of the cabinet , then through a hole behind the refrigerator , and then up to the wall where the shutoff is mounted .
The knob at the top right is for the tank valve .
The lever at the extreme left adjust the outlet pressure of the regulator .
The left gauge reads the outlet ( low ) pressure , and the right gauge the tank ( high ) pressure .
The high pressure gauge monitors the contents of the tank , while the low pressure gauge monitors the delivery of low - pressure gas .
The least expensive regulators have no gauges .
Twenty pounds of CO2 carbonates a lot of water .
We consume several liters per day in our household , and one tank lasts us for several years !
The 20 pounds of CO2 in my full tank yields over 1000 liters of carbonated water at an extremely fizzy 4 volumes .
Since my techniques produce an extra-biting - fizzy result ( the water is both chilled and pressurized while the gas is dissolved ) , and the gas in the head space of the bottle at the end of the process is vented , the yield can be somewhat less .
But the process is so cheap that I have n't bothered to precisely measure it !
CO2 expense is no more than a few cents per 2 - or 3 - liter bottle .
Another source of gas is CO2 fire extinguishers , which are made typically from a 20 lb tank , except painted red and fitted with an extinguisher squeeze - valve and horn .
On several occasions I have bought these extinguishers at plant - closing auctions for $ 1 each , and adapted the high - side of my regulator to connect to the extinguisher valve .
When empty , the gas dealer can then remove the squeeze - valve and extinguisher horn and install a standard twist valve top on the tank .
Tanks should also be inspected internally and subjected to a hydrostatic pressure test after some years , so if you are not swapping tanks to refill , you should make sure your dealer is inspecting the tanks on the right schedule .

The slightest leak , especially ahead of the regulator where the high pressure exists , will bleed your entire CO2 supply in a matter of days , or less .
CO2 tanks and regulators use a unique flat nipple fitting ( CGA 320 , 0.825-14NGO -RH -EXT , flat nipple ) and washer to connect to each other , instead of the usual inert - gas nipple ( CGA 580 , 0.965 -14NGO -RH -INT , such as for argon , nitrogen , or helium ) .
The flat nipple squeezes against the mating tank outlet , being compressed by a large captive nut , with a fiber or plastic washer in between the flat faces .
You must firmly attach the regulator nut with a new washer to assure a leak - free fit .
Each time the tank is filled , the supplier should give you a new washer for the regulator connection .
I find it so difficult to find high - pressure leaks that I have taken to disconnecting the low - pressure side and dunking the entire tank and regulator together into my swimming pool to look for bubbles .
The ordinary soap - bubble method works fine to find leaks on the low - pressure side .
I actually have two of these 20 - pound tanks .
This assures a continuous supply ; when one tank empties , I can have it out to be filled while using the other .
I use an adjustable regulator that I have set to deliver about 45 or 50 psi.
CO2 regulators are available for about $ 50 from soft - drink distributors , welding gas suppliers , or homebrew hobby suppliers ( see , for example , the page at http://www.kegworks.com).
There are " special " regulators made just for CO2 , and fixed - pressure CO2 regulators , but these seem to be less rugged than good - quality inert - gas regulators , which are also suitable at the low flow rates needed for carbonation ( although an inert - gas regulator will need to have its nipple switched for a CO2 fitting ) .
I connect the CO2 gas delivered by the regulator to 1/4 inch ( ID ) flexible , braided polyethylene tubing , which is rated for suitable working pressure .
Unbraided 1/ 4 inch vinyl tubing will burst at low pressures , especially if it gets warm .
I learned this the hard way one day when I had the supply line running behind the stove ; suddenly there was a bang and hissing of gas .
The working pressure of the unbraided tubing was reduced by the heat to the point where it burst under only 50 psi .
After that experience I switched to braided tubing and made sure that it did not run close to any sources of heat .
But I still use unbraided tubing for the final section to the bottle , as shown in the photos below , since it is flexible and under low pressure for short times .
The Shutoff and Gauge
The gas delivery tubing runs from a kitchen cabinet holding the tank and regulator to a wall - mounted ball - valve for shutoff , and a low - pressure gauge for monitoring .
While not strictly necessary , without a separate shutoff , you have to use the regulator or tank valve to stop the flow , which is very inconvenient and somewhat wasteful of gas .
The shutoff and gauge .
The shutoff provides control over the carbonation process , while the gauge provides measurement .
The ball valve requires only a quick 1 / 4 turn of the handle for full on or off .
The tee and gauge are optional , but help in monitoring the carbonation process and impressing house - guests .
The female quick - connect allows easy selection of final hose and cap .
All fittings are 1/4 inch brass NPT , except the ball valve which is 3/8 inch ( only because 1 / 4 inch ball valves are hard to find , but when I made this in the 1980s we did n't have the Web to help locate such things ) .
Teflon tape in the threads prevents leaks .
Copper pipe straps across the ball valve shoulders hold the whole assembly firmly against the wood plate , which in turn is screwed to the kitchen backsplash .
The quick - connects are common air fittings available in auto parts and hardware retailers .
This part of the apparatus is all that is normally visible in the kitchen , which is a good thing , because it is about all my wife will tolerate from her mad-scientist husband in that regard .
I enjoy showing it off to guests , but in 20 years of doing this , I do n't seem to have convinced anyone else to actually build something like it .
The gauge on the shutoff panel allows me to monitor the performance of the regulator and to have a rough idea of the gas flow and degree of CO2 saturation in the water .
My latest CO2 regulator is actually made for MIG welding ( these are the least expensive I 've found ) and has an orifice restricter to limit flow rates , which requires that I let the bottle pressure " catch up " sometimes when carbonating , as indicated by the gauge .
The gauge is connected after the shutoff valve , so it measures the pressure in the bottle and not the regulated supply pressure when the valve is closed .
The gauge is also not strictly necessary .
I use a quick - connect air fitting at the output of the shutoff .
This allows me to attach various hoses and caps for different bottle sizes .
It also allows me to rinse the open hoses if they get a bit of backflow from carbonating a beverage other than plain water .
The Bulkhead Cap
So far everything has been ordinary parts from a gas supplier and the hardware store , but the final cap fitting to the soft drink bottle is improvised from unusual parts , because there does n't seem to be any other way to do it .
While I 've gone through several designs to get the 1/4 inch hose fitted to the plastic soda bottle cap , let me first describe the easiest and best method that does n't require much fabrication .
While you might expect to use the common threaded fittings for tubing available at the hardware store , those use tapered pipe threads , not straight threads ; thus you cannot use them with a nut to make a bulkhead fitting .
The solution is to use a clamp - in tire valve from the auto parts store .
This provides a straight - threaded , stainless steel fitting with the right dimensions and shape to clamp into a hole in a bottle cap , and to insert into the 1/4 inch gas delivery hose .
The parts in a clamp - in tire valve kit .
This is a Camel brand part number 30 - 463 , sold in many retail auto parts stores such as Pep Boys Auto & Tire for a few dollars .
Camel makes at least one other size , and other manufacturers make similar items , such as the Milton 409 .
This is the only common source for a bulkhead fitting I 've ever discovered ; otherwise you have to look for fittings for laboratory tubing .
I 've removed the valve stem ( the item in the middle with the red band ) using the stem tool on the right , leaving the fitting fully open for the passage of gas .
Only the valve body , nut , and washer are needed ; the screw cap , stem , and rubber washers are discarded .
You might wonder whether you can't just leave the valve stem in place in the valve , and use a tire chuck on the gas supply hose to fill the bottle with pressurized CO2 .
This does not work because the process requires continuous flow of CO2 into the bottle via an open connection .
Carbonating a 2 - liter bottle requires flowing in about 8 liters of CO2 .
Puffing up the bottle from a tire chuck through a stem valve provides only an intermittent flow of CO2 that requires many iterations to inject the proper amount of gas .
Holding the chuck continuously against the valve is a difficult manipulation , especially while shaking the bottle , and tends to leak a lot of gas .
There are bottle cap adapters incorporating a valved , continuous connection offered in home brewing catalogs .
However they can't match the price and quality of this simple tire valve trick .
Here is the tire valve body serving as a bulkhead fitting through a bottle cap from a 2 - liter plastic soda bottle .
A hole is first drilled through the center of the plastic cap , the valve inserted and clamped with the nut , and the hose attached with a hose clamp .
You do not need need a washer for a gas - tight fit , since the bottle cap should have a pliable plastic gasket inside that will seal under the pressure of the tightened nut .
This gives a tight connection from the gas supply to the interior of the bottle .
The other end of the hose is fitted with the male quick - connect for connection to the shutoff and for easier cleaning .
The brewing and soft - drink industry have their own quick - connects for fluid lines , but I prefer the easier - to - find air fittings .
Note that the only components that contact the liquid beverage are the bottle , bottle cap , and the stainless steel fitting .
Most brass is an alloy that contains a few percent of lead for machinability .
Mild carbonic acid ( carbonated water ) does corrode brass when left in contact for long periods .
I do n't myself have the slightest concern that one would be exposed to any lead from using brass in this way , but if you like to be certain , then the stainless steel fitting is the thing to have .
Commercial soft drink apparatus is all stainless steel and plastic wherever it contacts carbonated beverages ; this is important because the slightly - acidic soda is in constant contact with the metal .
Here is an earlier bulkhead fitting I designed using a 1 / 4 x 1 inch brass screw , brass nut , and fiber washer .
This cap is for the larger 3 - liter bottle .
I drilled a 1/16 inch hole axially through the length of the screw for the gas passage .
The head of the screw is on the inside of the cap , with the threads protruding outside .
I wrapped several turns of teflon tape around the threads to fill them and provide a tight connection to the inside of the flat hose .
You have to be careful to keep the screw snug , since the tubing wants to twist off along the threads .
This design works , and I 've used this specimen for years , but the tire valve is better .
But see the section " Other Approaches " at the end of this page for my idea to improve this design .
I prefer to use the 3 - liter bottles because they have a much larger cap and neck which makes the bulkhead fitting easier to mount .
The neck of the bottle is also big enough to permit dropping in icemaker ice cubes .
This is the head of the 1/4 x 1 - inch screw inside a 3 - liter bottle cap .
A 1/16 - inch hole is drilled through the center axis of the screw .
The torn plastic around the screw head is the plastic gasket inside the bottle cap , punctured for the bulkhead fitting , which should be left in place to make a good seal on the neck of the bottle , but which does n't need to be under the bulkhead fitting ( that is , it could be trimmed away from the screw head instead of being ragged here ) .
The Carbonation - in - a- Bottle Process and Its Economics
To carbonate a bottle of water , you must pre-chill the water first , because the solubility of CO2 in water is greatly increased by both lowering the temperature ( Le Chatelier 's principle ) , and by raising the pressure of the CO2 gas ( Henry 's law ) .
Lukewarm water or low pressure CO2 gas will saturate with much less carbonation , so that the result is flat .
In short , CO2 is easy to dissolve into water , but only up to an amount determined by pressure and temperature .
You cannot insert or keep CO2 in solution above the concentrations dictated by pressure and temperature , and if you lower the pressure or raise the temperature , you may have excess CO2 that will effervesce back out of the beverage ( which is , after all , the charm of it all ) .
To pre-chill , you can refrigerate the water , or ( if you have the 3 - liter bottle with the large neck ) drop ice cubes in through the neck ( as shown in the photo below ) .
I like to chill in the refrigerator and then add a few ounces of ice to bring the water down the rest of the way to 32 deg F .
Or , for a trick that works with any size PET bottle , freeze a small portion of water beforehand in the bottle horizontally , whack the frozen bottle on a hard corner to crack the ice , and top off with warm tap water ; the amount of water to freeze depends on how warm your tap water is , and how much surplus ice you want to remain in the bottle after carbonation .
I use about 1/ 5 the full volume , and I mark this level with a permanent marker on the side of the bottle for convenience in refilling .
Having ice in the bottle while serving also has a " ship in a bottle " effect on guests , since unless they have seen the process , they cannot figure out how you got such big chunks of ice through the small neck of the bottle .
The fill level of the water in the bottle should leave a head space sufficient to allow the water to shake well in the bottle and have a full cross-section of surface .
For the 2 - and 3 - liter soda bottles , this level is about at the bottom of the shoulder , where the side of the bottle starts curving from vertical towards the neck .
That leaves a head space of about 1/ 5 the volume of the bottle ( as shown in the photo below ) .
The size of the head space is a compromise : a smaller head space will take much more agitating effort to saturate the water , since there is both less motion and less surface area to interact , while a larger head space will take less effort , but a larger space wastes more vented gas on opening .
Once filled with water to the proper head space level , it is time to apply the cap , purge the air , and charge the CO2 .
Screw on the bulkhead cap , back the cap off a bit from the tight seal , open the CO2 shutoff slightly to apply slight gas flow , squeeze ( " burp " ) the bottle to shrink the head space while the slow flow of gas purges the air from the hose and the head space , and then tighten the cap to inflate the squeezed bottle and fill the head space with CO2 .
This purging technique removes all the air from the head space and replaces it with pure pressurized CO2 , so you do n't have a partial pressure of insoluble air mixed in there .
If you do n't do this purging , you 'll have a lower partial pressure of CO2 applied to the water , and it will take more agitation to get a fully carbonated result .
Once the head space is purged and filled , you open the shutoff completely , so as to provide full flow of CO2 .
Shake the bottle vigorously for about 20 seconds ( depends on the flow rate of CO2 your regulator will deliver , and the kinetics of the dissolution ) while the shutoff is fully open .
As a bartender once told me , shaking liquids this way is " all in the wrists " , not in the arms and torso .
It takes a vigorous shake to get the gas and water mixing quickly ; less vigorous shaking will work but much more slowly .
After shaking sufficiently , fully close the shutoff , and shake a bit more to dissolve ( " scour " ) the remaining head space gas and reduce the pressure to saturation level ( about 20 psi ) from the higher regulator level ( 45 psi ) .
Let the contents settle for a few seconds , uncap , and enjoy absolutely supersaturated superfizzy seltzer .
Of course you will apply an ordinary cap if you need to store the unemptied bottle for any time .
" The cost to convert tap water to seltzer is less than $ 0.04 per 2 - liter bottle .
A single fill of a 20 - lb tank charges over 500 bottles . "
The chief factors determining carbonation of water are the temperature of the water , the partial pressure ( strictly speaking , the fugacity ) of CO2 , the area of interface between water to CO2 , and the agitation .
These interact over time to cause CO2 to go into or bubble out of solution .
Vigorous agitation promotes solution or dissolution because it greatly increases the area of interface and keeps the water in the container well mixed .
( Surface tension , nucleation sites , and the partial pressure of the water vapor are small factors , but we will not consider them here . )
You can regulate the degree of carbonation by experimenting with the amounts of agitation , by adjusting the regulated pressure up or down , or chilling the water to different temperatures .
The degree of carbonation as a proportion of CO2 to water is measured in standard " volumes of CO2 " for a given volume of water , where the " volume " of CO2 is understood to be that of the gas at 32 deg F and atmospheric pressure , where CO2 gas has a density of about 2.0 grams / liter .
A carbonation chart ( see link below ) or solubility formula ( below ) reveals that my method of 20 psi CO2 applied to ice water and agitated to equilibrium yields a carbonation of about 4 volumes CO2 gas per volume of water .
( Compare this to Coca Cola 's standard of 3.7 volumes for their bottled product . )
Since the density of chilled CO2 is about 2 grams / liter , charging 4 volumes requires about 8 grams of CO2 for each liter of water .
A 20 lb tank ( about 9000 grams of CO2 ) should theoretically yield 1133 liters of carbonated water .
In practice , efficiency is not perfect , with unavoidable losses in the hose and headspace .
But at current prices ( 2003 ) of $ 18 per 20 - lb tank - fill , the cost convert tap water to seltzer is less than $ 0.04 per 2 - liter bottle .
A single fill of a 20 - lb tank charges over 500 bottles , which will keep you supplied for 1.5 years if you consume an average of one bottle daily .
My experience is consistent with this .
At $ 1 / bottle for store - bought seltzer , the pay - back time on the equipment investment is less than a year .
And you will have avoided grabbing , checking out , and hauling home about 1000 lbs of water .
The savings will continue indefinitely .
Consider an unopened bottle of carbonated beverage , such as our freshly made seltzer .
When you open that bottle , lowering the pressure from 20 psi ( or so ) to atmospheric pressure , the liquid changes from its quiet equilibrium to being " supersaturated " .
That is , the amount of dissolved CO2 is much more than the new pressure will retain , and thus the gas spontaneously and rapidly effervesces .
You have an immediate and rapid fizz as the supersaturated gas spontaneously comes out of solution .
Warming the carbonated water also acts to disequilibrate , since the CO2 has much lower solubility at higher temperatures .
The change from ice to body temperature will change the equilibrium concentration of CO2 from 3 or 4 volumes down to about 1 volume , meaning several volumes of CO2 will effervesce .
This is why cold , carbonated beverages fizz on your palate , and why they produce gas in the stomach that leads to burping -- once warmed to 98.6 deg F body temperature , very little CO2 will remain in solution for long .
For every swallow of beverage , perhaps several swallows of gas will have to come back up !
This bubbling and burping from the stomach is a happy thing , because if the gas were to come out of solution and form pockets after the liquid traveled to the small intestine , it would be intensely painful .
The stomach and its valves are a marvelous system for de-gassing , de-foaming , propelling , and metering the contents .
You can carbonate any beverage this way , subject to the need to decompress without excess foaming .
Plain water will not foam , but soft drinks or punches sweetened with table sugar or corn sweetener may require lower final pressures and / or slow opening , lest you get a volcano of foam .
You can premix a bit of mineral salt like sodium bicarbonate or calcium carbonate to make club soda .
Carbonated mineral waters such as Perrier ( http://www.perrier.com/) contain about 500 ppm of total dissolved solids ( TDS ) , which is to say about 1 / 2 gram per liter , which is just a pinch , consisting chiefly of calcium and magnesium carbonates .
Mineral water constituents include : calcium carbonate , magnesium carbonate , sodium bicarbonate , sodium chloride , sodium citrate , sodium phosphate , and iron sulfate .
Use fruit punch syrup for soda , apple or grape juice , or brand - name syrups from the soft - drink distributor ( these are not particularly cheap , despite what you may have heard ) .
Pinching a bit of lemon or lime oil from a fresh rind will make a pleasant , non-caloric flavored seltzer .
You might wonder if PET soda bottles are strong and durable enough to take all this freezing , whacking , squeezing , and pressure cycling over and over again .
These bottles are amazingly strong and durable .
They must have a working pressure far above the 50 psi I have been using to carbonate ; a warm bottle of store - bought soda dropped on the floor will develop far over 100 psi of pressure , and they must be designed to take that kind of situation .
I have abused these bottles through hundreds of carbonation cycles without developing so much as a pinhole leak .
They do get a bit wrinkly and creased after a while .
But of course they are easily replaced with " new " ones .
If we could send a few back through time to the ancients , these bottles would be considered precious jewels reserved for the king 's use .
But we just discard them like so much useless trash .
I am not a nutty environmentalist , but I am perplexed by the irony of such exquisitely engineered vessels being used for only 1/1000 of their potential lifetime .
After purging , applying gas , and shaking , you wait for the bottle to settle for a moment or two .
Then it is ready to enjoy !
From tap water to seltzer , in about a minute , at next to no cost .
Making and Using Syrups
Once you have this marvelous carbonation process working , you may want to experiment with making soft drinks .
This means making or buying flavored syrups .
You can make your own " simple syrup " by dissolving 2 parts of granulated white sugar in 1 part of boiling water .
Measure these parts by volume , such as 2 cups sugar to 1 cup of water .
This will give you the maximum concentration of sugar that will not spontaneously crystallize .
This plain syrup is the base for making a flavored product for soft drinks by adding flavorings such as vanilla ( which is " creme soda " ) or extracts that might be found at your grocer's .
Syrup is diluted to make a finished soft drink in one of two ways , which the beverage industry calls the " pre-mix " or " post - mix " process .
The " pre " and " post " refer to whether the syrup dilution occurs before ( pre ) or after ( post ) carbonation .
By " pre-mix " is meant that you dilute the syrup with water and then carbonate to make a finished beverage .
By " post - mix " is meant that you carbonate plain water to make seltzer , and then add syrup to the seltzer to make a finished beverage .
The precise USP ( United States Pharmacopia ) recipe for simple syrup is 850 grams of sucrose to 450 ml water , yielding 1 liter ( 33.8 fl oz ) of syrup .
One 8 - ounce measuring cup of granulated sugar weighs about 200 grams and contains 700 food calories .
Since the liter of syrup weighs 1300 grams , the specific gravity should be about 1.30 , or perhaps 1.33 with the evaporation of water during boiling .
850 grams of sucrose contains about 2975 calories , so that the syrup contains 44 calories per fluid ounce ( 89 calories per 30 mL ) .
The British Pharmacopoeia recipe is similar : 2 parts by weight of sugar to 1 part of boiling distilled water , heated until dissolved and subsequently adding boiling distilled water until the weight of the whole is restored to 3 parts .
According to their " Nutrition Facts " labels , commercially bottled soft drinks contain anywhere from 140 to 200 food calories per 12 fluid ounces of beverage .
This corresponds to 35 to 50 grams , or about 9 to 13 teaspoons , of table sugar per 12 ounces !
That might seem like a lot of sugar , and it is , but this is what makes soft drinks taste good .
This equals 14 to 20 sugar cubes , which make quite a sight sitting in an empty 12 - ounce bottle .
Using our simple syrup would require 3 to 4.5 fluid ounces of syrup topped up to 12 ounces to yield the commercial proportion of sugar .
This is quite a bit more than the 1:5 ratio for a soda fountain ; it is not clear what accounts for the discrepancy , unless the fountain syrup is calorically more concentrated than the simple syrup ( sucrose ) recipe by virtue of fructose content .
A hydrometer chart gives the specific gravity of a solution of 35 grams sugar in 12 ounces of water as 1.033 , or for 50 grams as 1.045 .
Soft drinks are 10 to 15 percent sugar by weight , or roughly 1 pound per gallon .
When my wife taught high school Home Economics , she used to exhibit a 16 oz Coca - Cola bottle on her desk , empty except for the equivalent amount of sugar in the form of 24 (! ) sugar cubes .
Most of us cannot imagine just eating that much sugar , especially as cubes , yet drinking a soda containing that same sugar seems inconsequential .
The amount of sugar in that bottle was quite a disturbing sight !
Commercial soft drinks in the US today are sweetened with " high fructose corn syrup " ( HFCS ) , although up until the 1980s they were formulated exclusively with sucrose syrup .
The switch was purely economical , due to the politics of US agriculture making sugars from domestic corn ( corn starch is convertible to glucose and fructose by various industrial processes ) cheaper than imported sucrose from sugar cane ( the US federal government forces a domestic price of sucrose at twice the world market price through import duties ) .
HFCS is a different product than the corn syrup sold in grocery stores , such as Karo brand light corn syrup ( See http://www.karosyrup.com), which contains chiefly glucose ( also known as dextrose , corn sugar , or grape sugar ) and not fructose ( desirable for soft drinks since according to the Merck Index fructose is the sweetest of all sugars ) .
The " light " in the Karo product name refers to the color , not the sugar concentration .
According to the nutrition facts label , Karo syrup contains 30 grams and 120 food calories ( chiefly from glucose ) in each 30 mL .
Compare this to simple syrup at 25 grams and 89 calories ( all from sucrose ) for the equal volume .
Note that Karo syrup and similar household baking products contain vanilla flavoring and significant amounts of salt , which pretty much spoils their candidacy as a home - made soft drink ingredient .
In the US , you can still buy sucrose - sweetened Coca - Cola during the Passover season as the Kosher - for - Passover product .
The orthodox dietary rules of that season prohibit the consumption of certain grain - derived products ( kitniyos ) , such as sugar derived from corn .
Coke aficionados prize this seasonal product as a chance to enjoy the beverage in the authentically original form .
There is a subtle difference in flavor and mouth - feel between the beverage sweetened with cane sugar versus corn sweetener .
I have also heard that the tradition of serving " two cents plain " ( plain soda water with no flavorings ) in New York delicatessens arose from kosher considerations .
Commercial soft drinks , in the early days of bottling , were not kosher .
Today , commercially bottled soft drinks typically bear the OK or OU rabbinical hechsher .
Phosphoric acid is an ingredient of many soft drinks .
The acidulous flavor is said to balance the strong sweetness of the rather high sugar content , thereby amplifying the overall sensation , much like citric acid in orange juice or a SweetTart type candy .
The phosphoric acid content is said to be 164 mg / L of the beverage , with observed values around 106 mg / L , or about 0.01 percent .
All About Brix
If you study soft drinks or other products made from sugar solutions ( such as wine or maple syrup ) , you 'll eventually come upon the food - science term " brix " ( pronounced " bricks " , like bricks in a wall , named after a 19th century German scientist named Brix ) .
The brix scale is simply the percentage by weight of sucrose in a given mix ( such as , grams of sugar per 100 grams of beverage ) .
Sometimes the percentage is referred to as the " degrees of brix " .
This would be analogous to the " proof " scale for concentration of an alcoholic beverage , or the Baume scale for concentration of an acid .
If you look at the nutrition label on a soft drink bottle or can , you 'll see that commercial soft drinks are about 10 to 14 percent sugar by weight .
For example , a can of cola might say it contains 35 grams of carbohydrate ( all of it being sugar ) in 340 ml of beverage .
Since one ml is about one gram , this ratio works out to ( 35 grams ) / ( 340 grams ) = 10.3 percent sugar , which is the brix value .
If you look at the nutrition labels on the store products , you 'll see that Coca - Cola is a bit less sweet than Pepsi , and that a typical orange soda is sweeter than either of those colas .
( Assuming we can trust those labels to be true ; on occasion they have been famously falsified for other products . )
By way of comparison , a teaspoon of sugar ( 5 grams ) in an 8 - ounce cup of coffee ( 227 grams ) would have a brix of 5/227 = 2.2 percent .
Other typical beverage values are 10 for orange juice , 12 for apple juice , 5 for whole milk , and 11 for chocolate milk .
The brix of a solution can be measured with several types of instruments , which types are based on various principles .
A refractometer is the most versatile and costly instrument , using the optical principle of refractive index to indicate the sugar concentration of a tiny drop of a sample .
A typical refractometer is a hand - held cylinder containing a prism and magnifier .
A hydrometer is a less expensive device that measures the buoyancy , and thus the density , of the solution to indicate the sugar concentration in a larger sample .
A typical hydrometer is a closed , hollow glass tube about 12 inches long , weighted at one end with metal shot , and holding a paper scale in the center .
The brix scale is based on pure sucrose , but the other beverage sweeteners are negligibly different in terms of the relationship of weight , energy content ( food calories ) , and perception of sweetness ( a brix hydrometer might read a few percent high if you used glucose instead of sucrose ) .
See the excellent glossary at starch.dk .
A " brix cup " is a completely different approach to testing sweetness , used only for fountain output .
It is simply a plastic cup shaped to receive the streams of soda water and syrup separately , and keep them separate , as they flow out of the dispenser head ( thus the instructions to remove the diffuser , which is designed to make the streams mix ) .
These two separated streams then collect in two separate sections of the brix cup , one for syrup and one for soda water .
The soda water section of the cup is designed to be 5 times wider in cross-section , so if you have the dispenser adjusted to the proper 5:1 water - to - syrup ratio , the levels in the two sections rise up evenly .
If the levels rise unevenly , then you know you have to adjust the restricter screws in the dispenser accordingly to open ( or close ) the syrup ( or soda ) flow .
The syrup side of a typical brix cup is like a skinny test - tube shape , and the water side is more a small drinking cup size .
Usually you start with maximum soda water flow and adjust only the syrup restricter , unless you can't get the brix high enough , in which case you have to restrict the soda water and use maximum syrup flow .
It can get a bit messy and will waste a few cups of product .
When it comes to testing my own soft drinks for sweetness , I do n't bother with precise brix measurements .
I just go by taste .
People have their own taste preferences for sweeter or less sweet in fountain drinks .
Some people think they do n't like watered - down soda , but what they are responding to is melted - ice that makes the product flat ; a fully - carbonated but less - sweet mix may be truly preferred .
Brix testing is important for product consistency standards , such as when Coca - Cola comes into your restaurant chain and wants to test whether you 're watering down their brand - name product ( fountain dispensers let you adjust the ratio , so an unscrupulous restaurateur could shave some pennies that way ) .
Brix is n't so critical for home use , where your tastes should govern .
Other Approaches to Carbonation
The homebrew beer hobbyists are the cutting edge researchers on improvised carbonation apparatus .
In brewing terms , what I 'm doing is called " force carbonation " , as opposed to the natural carbonation produced in liquids by yeast fermentation .
For example , C. D. Pritchard has his " 3 liter keg " , and John Schnupp has his TapCap .
The TapCap is an odd device that somehow gets by with using tapered thread fittings ; the end of that page also shows a tire - valve bulkhead cap much like mine .
Mr Pritchard advised me by email that to get tapered threads to work , he enlarged the diameter of the tapered inside threads on the nut by using a tap , and shrank the diameter of the outside tapered threads on the pipe by using a die applied backwards , thus adjusting the tapers so as to make for a snug fit of the washer to the bulkhead ) .
But these kegging carbonators are more complicated and difficult to build than my design , since they are designed to remain on the bottle , injecting CO2 gas into the bottle while delivering only liquid beverage out , as is appropriate for kegging .
Simply carbonating water and pouring it through the neck does not require quite so much sophistication .
Note that brass should not be left in contact with carbonated water , although it is OK for gas fittings .
Lately my hobbyist metal - working skills have advanced to where I am using taps and dies to cut threads in metal , and oxygen and MAPP gas to braze .
I have another idea ( untried as of yet ) , which is to improve the bulkhead fitting I earlier improvised from an axially - drilled screw .
The improvement idea is to take a short piece of brass rod ( say 3/8 inch OD by 1 inch long ) which you ( 1 ) drill axially ( 2 ) thread outside for half its length , and ( 3 ) braze the unthreaded end into a tubing fitting made with ( or drilled out for ) a matching ID .
Thus you have constructed a fitting which adapts tubing to untapered outside threads , which in turn can clamp to the cap bulkhead with ordinary nuts and washers .
The brazing is optional ; you might get by with just solder .
Homebrew suppliers also sell carbonator caps .
Here is a photo of the " Carbonater [ sic ] Valve Coupling " sold by http://www.morebeer.com
( and by many other suppliers ) for about $ 12 , but this mates to the unusual ball - lock style of quick - connect tubing fittings , which are used extensively in beverage equipment but are not something you 'll find at the hardware store .
Of course the suppliers of the cap also sell the mating ball - lock fittings , and the total to make up a kit ( cap , ball - lock coupler , tubing , clamps , and shipping ) will run about $ 40 .
This coupling involves Moench 's US patent number 5,396,934 ( see table below ) .
It appears to be available only in a 2 - liter thread size , and not available for 3 - liter threads .
This device and the ball - lock fittings have the distinct advantage of incorporating small poppet valves , which are devices that shut off the gas flow when the fitting is disconnected .
This avoids the need to purge the final length of hose at the start of carbonating a bottle of beverage , but adds complexity and more parts and passages to keep clean .
Standard ball - lock connectors have grey or black plastic bodies to indicate gas - in ( grey ) or beverage - out ( black ) usage , but the mechanisms are the same .
Between the beverage industry , and quirky inventors , there are zillions of patents involving apparatus and methods for carbonation .
Here are links to the text of some of the many patents involving bottle carbonation :
Some US Patents Related to Bottle Carbonation Title ( Inventor / Assignee ) Year of Publication Number , and Google Patents , Delphion , and / or Free Patents Online link Method and apparatus for injecting gas into a bottled fluid ( Thomas S Moench , the " Carbonator Cap " ) .
A genuinely useful and sound product , for which it deserves any commercial success that follows .
Unclear why this turned into a patent , since many of us had been improvising the same type of device for years and considered it too obvious or minimal .
1995 5,396,934 5,396,934
Carbon dioxide injection interface in carbonation apparatus ( Bruce R Robinson , the National Safety Associates , Inc ( NSA ) tabletop carbonation system ) .
The stroke of original genius to this patent is to take the whole of existing carbonation technology and turn it literally upside down .
You fill and cap the bottle , turn it over , and stab the cap onto a gas - dispensing nipple .
That 's right , you would - be inventors : take any useful , expired patent , and merely invert the apparatus , and you have a new patent !
Brilliant !
And part of a product porfolio on which you can base a " marketing company " .
I obtained several of these defunct systems , and tore them down to reveal how they were made and how they worked , which you can read about on my NSA carbonation system page .
Much of this is similar to the SodaStream system , described below .
1990 4,976,894
Apparatus for aerating liquids ( Guy H Gilbey [ UK ] , aka the SodaStream or Soda - Club home carbonation system sold for $ 123 online at http://www.sodaclub.com or http://www.sodaclubusa.com/, which is a device having a self - contained CO2 supply and a clamping fixture that holds the bottle , injecting excess CO2 into a dip tube to carbonate without shaking , at the expense of the excess CO2 being vented through a relief valve ) .
This same manufacturer has 9 other patents available online .
As of 2004 , while the system itself is not unreasonably priced , you can only use CO2 in their 2 - pound " Alco2Jet CO2 Carbonator " tanks that are delivered at a cost of over $ 12 per pound of CO2 , which is 10 to 20 times what a ordinary tank of CO2 will cost to refill .
And these tiny tanks are only loaned to you , and you have to worry about returning them lest you be penalized " $ 15.00 for an additional User License Fee " ( according to their Web site ) .
In effect , you are using CO2 gas not just to carbonate , but also as a " motor " to do the agitation for you .
This is a very expensive system to operate , both in principle and in being hostage to a single overpriced gas supplier .
While this might end up being slightly cheaper than buying bottled seltzer at a grocery store , it wo n't be by much , and not until you 've run some 100's of bottles through it .
Judging from a Google Groups search of " sodastream " and " sodaclub " ( perform this Google search now ) , this system seems to be popular only in Germany .
The European patent deals with a specialized valve on the CO2 tank which appears to be designed expressly to prevent CO2 refills from standard industry equipment , requiring you to buy the highly - priced Soda - Club CO2 .
Interesting information on adapting this valve to use standard CO2 tanks is at http://soadahclub.vox.com/.
The approach suggested is to adapt a standard tank to refill Soda - Club tanks .
I would think a simpler adapter and better result would be instead to adapt a standard tank to the Soda - Club carbonation unit , and thereby eliminate the proprietary tanks once and for all .

Reading the texts and diagrams for the gadgets above should convince you that many of these patents are based on :
Obvious things , such as putting a check valve in a cap , a CO2 cartridge in a cap , or an ice jacket around a bottle , or
Ignorance of physics ( such as attempting to maintain carbonation of an opened bottle by recapping the headspace and pressurizing with just air ) , or
Trivial mechanical variations or miniaturizations of processes long in use ( such as force carbonating in a keg ) .
It is not clear whether such patents could be enforced .
The improvised bottle method lacks a relief valve or other overpressure protection device on the bottle .
Given that the supplied pressure always moves through a soft vinyl hose , this should not be a problem , as the hose is a kind of integral overpressure protection .
John Palmer 's How to Brew ( http://www.howtobrew.com) is a good online reference to the homebrew hobby , which has a lot of overlap with the general subject of carbonation .

Fountain Carbonation Equipment
In the summer of 2002 I bought a number of items to upgrade my apparatus to a continuous , automatic system for carbonation .
I wanted the luxury of having seltzer on tap rather than having to fill and shake single - bottle batches .
Indeed , I got so lucky finding new equipment for sale cheap , that I experimented with three different systems : ( 1 ) a commercial countertop soda fountain , ( 2 ) a commercial bar gun , and ( 3 ) a used Flomatic fountain dispenser head removed from a soda fountain .
All of these work with ( 4 ) a commercial McCanns carbonator .
The fountain contains its own chiller , while the bar gun and dispenser head use ( 5 ) a cold plate and ice bin for chilling .
I happened to already have ( 6 ) a Frigidaire ice machine ( this is an undercounter unit that only makes ice , not to be confused with an ice maker in the freezer side of a refrigerator ) that maintains a bin of " wet " ice for use with the cold plate .
And with all this invested , of course I had to try making real fountain soft drinks , not just seltzer , so I had to acquire ( 7 ) six pneumatic FloJet syrup pumps , and ( 8 ) 2.5 and 5 - gallon boxes of soft drink syrup from the local distributor .
With all the fittings and hoses to connect this stuff , my little project had grown to an involved and invested hobby .
The Carbonator Unit
The McCanns carbonator unit is common to all these approaches , so let me describe that first .
It works on a somewhat different principle than my bottle method .
It merges warm tap water and higher - pressure CO2 into a continuous flow of warm carbonated water .
The unit consists of an Proconn electric water pump , a stainless steel pressure vessel with electronic water level control , and associated connections and check valves .
The bottom half of the pressure vessel contains water ; the top half is initially purged of air and thereafter contains only CO2 gas .
You set the CO2 regulator to supply about 100 psi , which maintains the same pressure in the vessel .
The pump boosts the tap water pressure from the utility supply ( typically about 60 psi ) to something higher that will inject water past a check valve and into the 100 psi vessel .
An electronic level control monitors the amount of water in the vessel and turns on the pump to maintain the water level as soda is withdrawn .
The soda output is removed from the bottom of the vessel via a dip tube .
Connections are through 1/4 inch and 3/8 inch stainless flare fittings welded into the sides of the pressure vessel , and a brass flare fitting on the pump inlet .
An overpressure relief valve on the tank ensures that if the CO2 pressure became dangerously high ( such as from a stuck - open CO2 regulator ) that the tank would not catastrophically explode .
The large area of interface between the gas and liquid in the pressure vessel , and the high pressure of CO2 , result in rapid dissolution of CO2 into the water , even at room temperature .
The equilibrium of this solution , given the high pressure of CO2 , is above the target 4 volumes of CO2 despite the room temperature operation .
In the improvised bottle method , we use chilling and agitation to rapidly carbonate ; in the carbonator machine we use high pressure and a larger area .
To maintain the carbonation at the ultimate delivery pressure , you must lower the temperature of the liquid after it flows from the carbonator vessel but before dispensing it to atmospheric pressure .
Chilling is absolutely critical to dispensing carbonated beverages .
Dispensing at room temperature results in an instantaneous loss of nearly all the carbonation ( " warm soda is flat soda " ) due to the agitation of passing through the valve .
Thus one uses a " flash " chiller to lower the temperature of the flowing seltzer just before it reaches the dispenser valve .
Carbonators are inherently more efficient in their use of CO2 than the bottle or keg methods .
All of the CO2 consumed is delivered in the beverage without waste .
The headspace of the carbonator vessel is purged of air when the system is started , and never is opened to the atmosphere to spoil that purge or to waste the headspace gas .
Filling is more or less a continuous replacement of the draw , so that CO2 is not wasted into an emptying bottle or keg .
McCanns makes several models of carbonators , but the most common seems to be the " fast - flow " model with a 2 - gallon stainless pressure vessel and a capacity that can keep up with a big 6 - flavor fountain .
Their smaller models have ( you guessed it ) slower flow rates but ought to be fine for home rates of use .
There are also other carbonator manufacturers like Selmix , Lancer , Cornelius , FHPC , and Servend , but McCanns seems by far to be the most popular .
Being connected to the public water supply , to be legal , the carbonator pump must incorporate a backflow preventer .
Watch out for older and used models , which may be obsolete in not having this feature .
The Ice- Bank Flash Chiller
The countertop fountain contains its own chiller , which looks like the compressor and condenser coil from an ordinary refrigerator .
When the chiller runs , heat is exhausted out to the top of the whole unit by a fan that blows over the condenser coil , like a refrigerator .
Unlike a refrigerator , however , instead of cooling air , the evaporator coil is a spiral of bare tubing immersed in a tank that you have filled with some 10 gallons of ordinary water .
This coil chills to below freezing temperature , freezing some of the water in the tank , resulting in a " bank " of ice forming on the coil .
Thus you not only have a big supply of ice - cold water , but a reserve of some 40 pounds of ice ( the " ice bank " ) that will keep that water ice cold .
A control device senses when the ice bank is fully built up or not , and turns the compressor on and off accordingly .
A paddle runs constantly to circulate the water around the tank and maintain an even ice - cold temperature .
Now this water in the chiller tank is not for consumption .
It is just a heat - transfer medium that stays in the chiller tank , separate from the dispensed product .
Through this chiller tank then pass stainless steel tubes that carry the seltzer and soft - drink syrups to the dispenser heads on the front of the fountain .
Thus the dispensed product is chilled to 40 deg F or colder as it passes through the tubes .
The ice bank is a reserve that lets you chill a lot of drinks in a short amount of time .
This kind of fountain is suitable for restaurants because it can dispense a high volume of drinks and keep up with a varying rate of demand .
While it is luxurious for home use , it does generate a bit of blower noise , it takes up some space , and uses electric power .
In a warm room the chiller runs a duty cycle of about 5 minutes on for every 25 minutes .
The paddle stirrer runs constantly but does not make much noise or use much power .
I estimate an average usage of about 100 watts .
While one can turn the unit on and off manually , since it takes about 5 hours of constant running to first build the ice bank , you can't turn it on and expect to dispense drinks right away .
However , I have n't timed how long the ice bank lasts if the unit is shut off ; for home use , it might be feasible to set an outlet timer to run the unit to build an ice bank just once at the beginning of a day 's usage .
The Cold - Plate Flash Chiller
With the bar gun apparatus , chilling is accomplished by running the soda supply through a heat exchanger consisting of a " cold plate " immersed in ice .
A cold plate consists of about 10 ft of stainless tubing embedded in a shallow block of aluminum .
This accomplishes a rapid , continuous heat transfer from the liquid to the ice ( " flash cooling " ) as long as a constant supply of ice is maintained in contact with the aluminum block .
There are also commercial fountains that use a cold plate at the bottom of an ice dispenser , instead of a built - in chiller like mine .
You can recognize these because they typically have an ice dispenser in the middle of the row of fountain heads .
This method has the disadvantage that you need to have a separate ice machine to produce ice , and you must bucket the ice from the ice machine to the fountain .
However , this is an advantage for a situation like a wait station in a restaurant , where you want drink service near the dining tables , but you do n't want the noise and heat of a refrigeration compressor to bother your customers .
It is also more economical for a large restaurant to have one large , efficient ice machine in the back of the kitchen than a lot of separate ice - making devices .
One principle the different chillers all share is a thermodynamic phase change .
The efficiency of the system requires a phase change in the refrigeration source , either solid - to - liquid ( ice on a cold plate ) or liquid - to - gas ( refrigerant on a chiller plate ) .
This phase - change substance must be in intimate thermal contact with the cold plate to effect rapid heat transfer .
If you simply refrigerate the cold plate ( in air or in a chilled water bath ) , then the thermal mass of the system immediately warms as the warm beverage flows through ; the temperature quickly rises above the necessary chill for proper dispensing .
Thus , as much as we would like to believe it possible , it just does not work to park a cold plate ( or bare tubing , for that matter ) in a refrigerator and expect it to chill a flow of beverage .
You must have a pile of drained , wet ice completely covering the cold plate .
The pressure of the pile against the cold plate , and the draining of the melted ice , is critical .
The chiller will ideally reduce the liquid to an ice - cold temperature , but it must not actually freeze the liquid .
Ice in a melting state maintains by nature a proper temperature that will chill but not freeze the flow of water in the cold plate .
Refrigerated units use the combination of banked ice and circulating water to maintain the near - freezing ( but never freezing ) temperature of the product .
You can't " beat the system " , thermodynamically speaking , for flash chilling flowing beverages .
You must provide an active , continuously wasting supply of phase - changing stuff ( melting ice , or boiling Freon ) .
Chilled air or water are too " dilute " and unregulated as sources of chill .
Something has to run and consume power all the time ( or at least on some continual duty cycle ) , whether the system is delivering beverages or just idling .
Moreover , you can't use the freezer or refrigerator compartments of your household refrigerator ; the freezer is too cold and will freeze your lines solid , and the cool air of the refrigerator is not a phase - change heat sink .
You can put bottles in the refrigerator to chill them , but then you have lost the advantages of an on - tap continuous - process carbonation system .
Fountain Dispensers versus Bar Guns
Fountain dispensers differ from bar guns in several respects .
A bar gun is very compact , especially if you already have the ice machine anyway , which makes it appropriate for home use .
A fountain is larger since it has separate dispensers for each flavor , but in turn this lets you dispense much faster , such as is appropriate for a busy restaurant .
The slower dispensing rate of a bar gun is fine for home use .
The drip holster for a bar gun should be mounted next to a sink , whereas the fountain has a built - in drip tray and drain .
With one nozzle for all flavors , a bar gun can slightly cross-mix flavors unless you rinse and shake into the sink when changing flavors ( there is a water - only button for this purpose ) .
The unchilled length of hose on a bar gun would tend to warm the product a bit more than a fountain dispenser , and thus slightly reduce the carbonation level of the dispensed product , although proper levels can be maintained by a compensating adjustment of the CO2 supply pressure .
You may or may not want to have the big advertising stickers on the sides of a fountain unit in your home ; a bar gun is unobtrusive .
Finally , a bar gun or a fountain each have their " Wow , that 's cool " effect on guests , but a bar gun is more associated with bars serving alcohol , versus a fountain being associated with soft drinks in a restaurant or convenience store .
Bar guns do n't typically have brand - name soft drink labels on the buttons , and the proprietor can dispense cheaper generic flavors into alcoholic drinks where the taste is n't really critical .
I 'm not familiar with this angle of the saloon business , but I suspect that either the big soft - drink manufacturers or state alcohol laws do n't allow you to dispense from fountain heads displaying soft drink labels into cups that contain alcohol .
Syrup Pumps and Bag - in - Box versus Keg Syrup
To make the jump from serving just seltzer to serving a menu including soft drinks , I added several syrup pumps and boxes of syrups .
The FloJet pumps I use work on low pressure ( about 30 psi ) CO2 from a downstream regulator .
The gas operates a pair of pistons which alternate filling with syrup or gas , and thus no electric power is required .
This is an improvement over the older method of kegging the syrup , since you can pump out of a disposable cardboard box instead of having to return the empty steel kegs to the syrup distributor .
The kegs did n't need a separate pump though , since you pressurized them directly with CO2 .
Using the CO2 as an energy source to run the syrup pumps might seem crazy , but the amount consumed is negligible .
The volume is about equal to the syrup dispensed and the pressure is only about 1/3 that of the carbonation .
Since the syrup volume is 1/5 of the water , and the water itself has about 4 volumes of CO2 , the pumps are only using a proportion of about 1/20 extra CO2 .
Where Do You Buy the Syrup ?
I am happy to have a local fountain service that has accommodated my need for parts and syrup .
They sell a line of unbranded soft drink syrups that is quite good .
Some years back in another state , I used to buy Coca - Cola 's brands of syrup in gallon jugs from the local small - town distributor .
I would use this with my bottle - method of carbonation to make a chilled pre-mix product .
More recently I talked to the local Coca - Cola sales representative , seeking to buy their brand - name products .
He said that they do not even sell syrup in such small quantities here in Palm Beach County , Florida .
That seems reasonable , and I 'm probably the only guy in the county who ever asked , because he wanted to know how I even had a fountain at home to begin with .
He suggested I call the restaurant supplier , Sysco , who distributes to small restaurant users , and who also has a will - call counter .
But I have n't yet figured out if Sysco has any desire to bother with the occasional household order for soft drink syrup .
He also suggested I find a friend in the restaurant business to see I they could " retail " an occasional box to me ; I suppose at some price they should be willing at a mom-and - pop bistro , right ?
Maybe I 'll inquire about that someday .
You can buy so many things on the Web now , and sure enough there are Web - based sellers for small quantities of brand - name soft drink syrups .
But I find this is more of a novelty price that a regular supply , and the shipping is prohibitive .
Are the Fountain Soft Drink Costs Really Cheaper ?
Adding up the costs of fountain soft drinks shows that , unlike plain seltzer , they are not really a bargain for the home user .
Single 5 - gallon boxes of syrup sell locally for $ 38 for generic brands and $ 60 for name - brands ( plus sales tax ) .
These in turn yield 30 gallons of delivered product .
This works out to about 70 cents for generics or $ 1.12 for brand name per 2 - liters , which is about what the grocery store sales prices are for bottled products .
We have seen that the CO2 to carbonate adds only a few cents more in cost .
On the other hand , you have much less water to haul , no bottles to recycle or dispose , and you never have half - empty bottles going flat in the fridge .
On the other hand , you have extra power costs , investment in equipment and the space it uses , the risk of plumbing leaks and messy spills , and the risk that you 'll be drinking more soft drinks than may be healthy .
Now if you 're a restaurant or convenience store , especially a chain with national - account pricing from the big brand names , then I 'm sure your price for syrup is much better .
But until I 'm dispensing 100s or 1000s of drinks a day , I do n't expect to be entitled to any such break .
Miscellaneous Technical Facts
Stainless fittings must be used throughout the carbonated side of the plumbing , since brass or copper are leached by continuous contact with carbonated water .
This applies to the dispenser valves as well , which must be constructed of plastic and stainless parts .
Acquiring these stainless fittings ( flare and hose barb ) can be a problem , since they seem to be used commercially only for soda fountain applications , and are not available from hardware stores or homebrewing suppliers .
The best source has been the fountain repair shop of the local soft drink distributor ; they have been surprisingly kind and helpful with my quirky hobbyist efforts .
A soda dispenser head is much more sophisticated than a simple water faucet .
It must be constructed to control the relatively high liquid pressure ( 100 psi ) while not subjecting the liquid to physical forces that would tend to nucleate the dissolved CO2 ( passing through narrow orifices or rapid change of cross- sectional flow rate ) .
Modern dispenser valves consist of a specially articulated type of O - ring known as a " banjo " , spring - or solenoid - actuated levers to actuate the banjo pressure against a stop , and a specially designed set of passages and diffusers to reduce the energy of the high - pressure flowing soda to a gravity fall .
The design also attempts to minimize the thermal mass and conductivity of the containment path , so as to avoid rewarming the chilled product .
To all this sophistication is added a second circuit for syrup metering and dispensing , which is not a concern for simple seltzer delivery .
Antique chrome lever - style fountain dispensers used a large leather washer between disks to control the flow ; many of these are constructed of leaded brass and thus should not be used for carbonated products .
The typical neck of these dispensers has a significant dead space of unheated tubing that will tend to reintroduce ambient heat to the dispensed flow .
Beer faucets are similarly mismatched to the pressure , temperature , and corrosion requirements of soda dispensing .
One disadvantage to having soda on tap is the need for an extra chiller in the house .
The cold plate method requires a melting ice supply .
The plate cannot simply be placed in the refrigerator , since without contact with ice , the chilled plate will only chill a few ounces of water before warming , the specific heat of the mass of the aluminum block being so much less than the heat of fusion absorbed by a relatively small amount of ice .
Nor can the plate simply be placed in a freezer , because the liquid would just freeze solid in the tubing .
In a household setting , the ice supply for a cold plate would have to come either from burying the plate in an expensive separate ice machine appliance ( not an ice maker in the refrigerator , but one that works using a reflow chill - plate ) , or by transferring refrigerator ice to a cold plate container ( impracticably laborious and intermittent ) .
Perhaps one could afford a fountain dispenser with its own refrigerated chiller , which would be the most efficient , but even then you are constantly maintaining an extra refrigerated volume while dispensing happens only occasionally .
In commercial applications , this overhead is compensated by the volume of delivery , but household use may be so infrequent as to make it very uneconomical .
Compare this extra overhead to the bottle method , which can use ordinary refrigerator space that you already maintain for household needs .
For economical home use , the best solution to the chiller overhead would seem to be in altering the commercial design by refrigerating the pressure vessel .
This should be possible by separating the pressure vessel from the rest of the carbonation unit and installing the vessel in the household refrigerator .
The unit could then be operated at lower CO2 pressures .
This would require adapting the liquid and gas plumbing on the unit , and the electrical controls , to make them longer and to pass them through the walls of the refrigerator .
It may be that the kinetics of the dissolution at lower pressure and temperature do not favor this type of alteration .
The reservoir will also be warmed by each volume dispensed , as that volume is replaced by tap water .
As in many thermodynamic - kinetic processes , the deck may just be stacked against you , and you must pay the overhead to get a proper result .
As an alternative to the McCanns carbonator approach , I also have obtained for experimentation a modified 5 - gallon Cornelius keg which was designed to carbonate water in a refrigerated space at 30 psi or less .
Cornelius , a leading manufacturer of commercial soda fountain equipment , made this apparatus for a rather elaborate residential soda fountain which I understand to be discontinued .
This keg is the usual stainless steel keg body ( " Corny " keg ) with a modified lid .
( These kegs were universally used for post - mix fountain syrups before the introduction of bag - in - box ( " BIB " ) technology now used for commercial fountains , which made the kegs obsolete for fountains , although they are widely used now for the homebrewing hobby , where a glut of surplus kegs is available very cheaply . )
The modified lid contains a water - in fitting with float valve ( something like a miniature all - stainless ballcock ) which maintains the water level in the keg using only tap water pressure .
The head space is maintained with a 30 psi CO2 supply through a gas - in fitting with check valve on the keg body .
The soda - out connection is also on the keg body , and is fitted with a dip tube to take soda from the bottom of the keg .
The chief problem with this design is that a huge keg just about requires its own refrigerator .
No doubt the large reserve volume is needed to maintain a buffer of chilled soda that will not be too much displaced by warm water introduced from dispensing .
A soda fountain ( carbonator , refrigerated chiller , dispenser , syrup pumps ) is a costly set of equipment , priced at many thousands of dollars new .
I assembled a working setup for much less by purchasing the carbonator on eBay , where you can find them new for $ 150 to $ 200 .
I found a used cold plate and dispenser for $ 40 from the local fountain service shop .
I also acquired a nearly new 6 - flavor Cornelius countertop fountain unit ( Venture model ) inexpensively from a restaurant that underwent a remodeling .
Zahm and Nagel Company , Inc , makes interesting devices for CO2 quality control in the food and beverage industry .
They publish a chart of solubility of volumes of CO2 gas dissolved in water for given pressures and temperatures ( PDF file ) and a similar chart for beer ( PDF file ) .
According to the British Soft Drinks Soft Drinks Association ( see their fascinating Web page ) , one such volume is equal to about 2 grams CO2 per liter of water .
Autofrost publishes a chart of saturation pressure - temperature relationships for various refrigerants , one of which happens to be CO2 , which amounts to a solubility chart ( PDF file ) .
Carbonating large volumes of water such as at a commercial bottling plant is achieved by other apparatus such as this pinpoint carbonator made by Wittemann ( WittCold Systems , Inc ) .
The Coca -Cola Web site ( http://www.coca-cola.com) has a " virtual plant tour " of the modern commercial bottling process ( Flash movie ) .
This reveals several facts of interest to the carbonation hobbyist : Unlike fountain Coca - Cola , bottled Coca - Cola is first pre-mixed before being carbonated .
The uncarbonated pre-mix is made from Coke syrup and water .
The Coke syrup is mixed at the plant from simple syrup plus flavoring concentrate .
The simple syrup is made at the plant from sugar and water .
Once carbonated , the finished drink is filled into bottles by the counter - pressure method , ensuring " smooth flow of liquid , with little to no foaming " [ and therefore no loss of carbonation ] .
The Cube - Cola project in the UK seeks to develop an " open source " formula and process for homemade cola flavoring .
This seems to follow the Open Cola project [ Wikipedia article ] .

A Science Fair Project : Measuring the Fizziness of Carbonated Beverages
Here is a science fair project idea that uses the tire - valve bulkhead cap as the homemade apparatus .
You will also need an ordinary tire gage and a thermometer .
You can do a few demonstrations on the grade - school level , or use this to demonstrate more advanced high - school physics .
The basic scientific principle is the relationship of pressure and temperature in a sealed bottle of carbonated beverage to the degree of carbonation .
After measuring the pressure and temperature inside the bottle , you look up the carbonation level on a carbonation chart , and announce , to the amazement of your family and friends , " this soda has 3.8 volumes of CO2 carbonation , and is way fizzy . "
Or , " this soda has no more than 1.5 volumes of CO2 , and is flat , flat , flat , ptooie , bleah . "
To construct the pressure - reading apparatus , make a bulkhead cap fitting with the tire valve , such as is described above , except do n't remove the valve stem .
This specially - fitted cap will seal the soda bottle , while allowing you to measure the pressure inside the sealed bottle by applying an ordinary tire gage .
Take various store - bought 2 - liter soda products , chill well , remove the original cap , replace quickly with the tire - valve cap ( burping the air out while sealing ) , shake well , and measure the resulting headspace pressure with a tire gage .
Be careful when pushing the tire gage onto the tire valve that you do not leak pressure from the headspace , which would reduce the true sample pressure ; this requires a careful and skillful technique .
Repeat the pressure measurement for various samples , perhaps of a few different brands .
Make sure all are at the same temperature .
The pressure reading tells you how much carbonation is in the beverage .
Find the degree of carbonation ( in " volumes " ) for a given pressure using the Zahm - Nagel chart above .
Fresh soda should have about 3 or 4 volumes of carbonation .
You can experiment with samples to see how the level of carbonation is affected :
Measure warm versus chilled soda .
You should see a much higher pressure at room temperature than when chilled , but the chart readings should nevertheless indicate the same levels of carbonation , assuming you cap and uncap quickly so as not to effervesce and vent much CO2 .
Pour out about half of a bottle of soda , then immediately cap / shake / measure .
How much has the quality of the beverage remaining in the bottle , in terms of carbonation level from the original , deteriorated ?
Repeat the previous demonstration , except cap overnight , then cap / shake / measure .
Does the result of an overnight wait yield a different result ?
Open a well - chilled bottle of soda , pour it gently into a pitcher of ice , pour it back into the bottle , and cap / shake / measure .
How much carbonation was lost in the round trip ?
Repeat the previous demonstration , but without the ice .
Repeat yet again , pouring violently instead of gently .
Repeat -- whew !
-- one last time , onto ice but without chilling the bottle first .
Prove that no matter how gently you pour , warm soda is flat soda , even if you pour it directly onto ice .
Lecture your family and friends on this principle , waving your lab notebook in their faces if they dare to challenge your authority as a carbonation scientist .
-- one last time , onto ice but without chilling the bottle first .
Prove that no matter how gently you pour , even if you pour it directly onto ice .
Lecture your family and friends on this principle , waving your lab notebook in their faces if they dare to challenge your authority as a carbonation scientist .
Take pressure measurements of the same full - bottle sample , but with and without burping the small headspace when you apply the bulkhead cap .
See if you can detect the atmospheric pressure this way , as a difference in the total pressure inside the bottle .
Try to quantitatively settle the old quarrel over whether burping the air out of a partly - dispensed bottle of soda helps to preserve carbonation the next day .
Prepare samples of various carbonation levels to verify the following rough scale : 3 to 4 volumes CO2 = pleasantly carbonated , 2 volumes = noticeably flat , 1 volume = unpleasantly flat .
Make up samples of various carbonation levels , and use blindfolded random taste - tests to see how small a loss of carbonation is detectible by mouth - feel .
Take samples of fountain - dispensed soda from a convenience store or fast - food restaurant .
Dispense directly into your bottle apparatus , or pour cup contents into your bottle .
Are the fountains dispensing a properly carbonated beverage ?
If not , lecture the proprietor , and angrily demand your money back , projecting an arrogant know - it - all - scientist attitude .
Cap some room - temperature water , sugar , and yeast in a soda bottle .
Place this hideous brew in a warm place .
Measure the resulting CO2 pressure from fermentation after each day for a week or so .
See if it explodes .
Describe the odor upon venting .
Compare carbonation of soda versus beer or sparkling wine ( with adult supervision ) .
Try opening a warm bottle of soda , letting it sit quietly for a few minutes , and then capping and measuring the pressure ; you will quantify the general principle that :
Warm soda is flat soda .
Another interesting demonstration is to seal a large balloon over the threaded neck of a freshly - opened bottle of soda .
Warm the bottle in a water bath to about body temperature .
Shake the bottle and see how much gas is evolved into the balloon ; observe how much gas you must burp up when you drink a carbonated beverage .
Measure the balloon size and estimate its volume using geometry ( hint : have an assistant squish the oval balloon approximately into a sphere while you measure the diameter ) .
A 2 - liter bottle of soda should have about 6 to 8 liters of CO2 gas dissolved in it , most of which will evolve into the balloon .
You can then use the balloon as a CO2 fire extinguisher on a candle .
Or use the gas to purge a jar containing live insects , and see whether bugs can live on CO2 instead of air , heheheh .
The range of your instrumentation ( namely , the tire gage and thermometer ) determines what sample conditions you can read .
Chilled soda should be less than 30 psi , so an automobile tire gage should be sufficient .
Warm soda can produce pressures of about 100 psi , so you 'll need a tire gage that reads higher than an inexpensive automobile type , such as is made for truck tires or racing bike tires .
The thermometer should read from freezing to body temperatures .
It will be easiest to work with if it is a simple glass stem type that you can insert directly into the bottle .
The ultimate improvised instrumentation would be to take an inexpensive thermocouple - probe type outdoor digital thermometer and fit the wire through the cap so the probe dangles inside the sealed sample bottle .
Advanced topics which you can demonstrate with this project are :
The difference between absolute ( psia ) and gage ( psig ) pressures .
Improvised force - distance pressure gaging .
Measure how far in a constant pinching force squeezes the sides of the bottle , for various pressures , and calibrate your improvised instrument .
Partial pressure versus total pressure .
Use burping to remove atmosphere pressure from the bottle .
Commercial carbonation testers work exactly like the improvised tire - gage testing .
Such a tester is simply a hard plastic jar with a tight - sealing screw - on lid .
An accurate thermometer and pressure gage are threaded into the lid , to measure the temperature and pressure of the sample .
To measure the carbonation of a sample beverage , you first fill the jar with the sample , quickly close and seal the lid , shake , and read the pressure and temperature .
A printed chart on the side of the jar tells the carbonation for various pressure - temperature combinations .
Properly installing and maintaining a soda fountain in a restaurant requires carbonation testing .
This is how a technician checks that a soda fountain is delivering a properly fizzy product .
This is important to the brand - name soft drink makers , who want to make sure you have a properly delivered product from the on -site carbonation apparatus .
Let me know if you get to the International Science and Engineering Fair with this stuff .
I was there myself as a lad , four times from 1969 to 1973 , but I was just building computers in those days .
The Science : Understanding and Applying the Physics of Carbonation
To fully understand the carbonation process requires some scientific background involving gas laws and kinetics .
Without these principles , you cannot understand or predict how various systems are going to behave .
With these principles , you can design your own systems and calculate their performance .
This is the difference between being a hobbyist , who just learns to do a few fun things from others , versus being an engineer , who can have the nobler satisfaction of creating wondrous and innovative designs that lesser minds can only copy .
The " partial pressure " of CO2 ( pCO2 ) is fundamental to understanding carbonation :
The Fundamental Principle of Carbonation
( Henry 's Law as applied by Kinch )
At any given temperature , the equilibrium carbonation ( CO2 saturation ) of a given beverage depends only on the pCO2 of its headspace
Direct consequences of this fundamental principle :
When carbonating to some target level , you can always compensate for higher beverage temperatures by increasing the pCO2 ( although higher pressures complicate dispensing ) .
And , vice versa , you can compensate for lower available pCO2 , by lowering the beverage temperature .
, you can compensate for lower available pCO2 , by lowering the beverage temperature .
But , since you cannot chill liquid water below 32 deg F , there is an minimum pCO2 required to yield a given carbonation level .
A carbonated drink in an open container will go completely flat , sooner or later , no matter how chilled you keep it .
Tapping a carbonated beverage out of a closed container preserves more carbonation than uncapping and pouring .
Air in a headspace makes carbonating to a given level more difficult , since the total pressure will be higher than the pCO2 .
That is , it requires a higher pressure CO2 feed , and / or lower temperature , to achieve the same level of carbonation compared to a headspace of pure CO2 .
On the other hand , the pCO2 you apply will always yield the predictable level of carbonation , regardless of whether there is air also present .
The presence of air does not inhibit carbonation , other than presenting a mechanical problem of overcoming a higher total pressure to get the CO2 into the vessel .
A foam head on a poured beverage acts to create a virtual headspace with pCO2 of 1 atm , preserving as much as 1.71 volumes of carbonation ( depending on temperature ) as long as the head lasts .
In a flexible bottle with a small headspace of pure CO2 , squeezing the bottle with a fixed clamp will initially raise the headspace pressure and shrink the headspace volume ( Boyle 's Law ) .
But the headspace pressure will eventually return to about the original state as the equilibrium is restored , while the volume remains shrunk .
If clamped to maintain a regulated higher pressure , a headspace of pure CO2 will shrink until it disappears ; you can squeeze it all into solution !
The headspace in an opened can or bottle will briefly contain a residual pCO2 , slowing the de-carbonation .
Eventually this is lost by diffusion or turbulence into the ambient air .
Swallowing a carbonated beverage creates an eructable CO2 headspace in your stomach .
The process is enhanced by the difference in temperature of a chilled beverage versus your core body temperature .
Since gastric contents equilibrate at about 1 atm and 98.6 deg F , your stomach contents could be residually carbonated to as much as 0.56 volumes without further effervescence ( burping ) .
Pumping in air , or anything but CO2 , will not help preserve carbonation in an opened and recapped bottle , because you have not changed the pCO2 .
Gadgets that purport to " keep the fizz " by such techniques are implausible .
Note that many of the patents referenced above relate to just such devices .
The absence of them in commerce nowadays may be related to the fact that they do n't work .
Pinching out the headspace in a flexible bottle after a pour preserves more carbonation in the liquid versus exchanging air into the headspace , but you have to maintain the pinch .
If you relax the pinch on the bottle , the pCO2 of the solution will outgas and expand the bottle , creating a pure CO2 headspace , and losing some carbonation in the liquid , until an equilibrium pCO2 is reached between the headspace and the beverage .
Maintaining the pinch will stop a headspace from forming and better preserve the carbonation ; in effect the pinching repressurizes the CO2 without an outside supply of it .
The principle applies to equilibrium , while short - term states can be quite different .
Nothing short of a scientific understanding of physics can lead to the fundamental principle of carbonation .
Science in the 18th through 20th centuries determined the properties of how gases and liquids in general behave under various conditions .
These properties are listed in the following table of physical principles and laws :
Gas Laws Relevant to Carbonation Gas Law Relationship Governed Mathematical Expression Le Chatelier 's principle Relates dynamic equilibrium of dissolved gas in water to temperature of the water K = f( T ) Henry 's Law Relates solubility of a gas in a liquid ( water ) to partial pressure of that gas C = P/K Boyle 's Law Relates variations in gas pressure to variations in gas volume at constant temperature V2 = V1 * ( P1/ P2 ) Charles ' Law Relates variations in gas volume to variations in gas temperature at constant pressure V2 = V1 * ( T2/T1 ) Combined Gas Law Relates variations in gas pressure , temperature , and volume ( A combination of Boyle 's and Charles ' laws ) V2 = V1 * ( P1/ P2 ) * ( T2/T1 ) Dalton 's Law Relates total pressure of an unreacting ( inert ) mix of gases to the partial pressures .
Each gas in a mixture contributes its pressure independently of the other gases present .
The total pressure is thus simply the sum of all partial pressures .
P( total ) = P1 + P2 + ... +
Pn Bernoulli's Law Relates kinetic and potential energy of gases in flow .
The energy of a volume of gas is the sum of its kinetic energy ( from motion ) and its potential energy ( from pressure ) .
When gas flows , energy is conserved and the sum of kinetic and potential energy is constant , even though the two may be exchanged .
Omits consideration of viscosity and gravity .
pV + mv2/2 = Constant Pascal 's Law Relates the pressure of an unflowing gas to the region of its containment .
The pressure of a volume of static gas is the same everywhere and in all directions .
Changes in pressure are transmitted throughout the volume .
P( z1 ) = P ( z2 ) for all z Cole 's Law Relates vinegar and mayonnaise in a cabbage salad ( gotcha ! ) S = C + V + M
Le Chatelier 's principle actually states a more general idea : that a stress applied to an equilibrated system will move the system to a new equilibrium that minimizes the effect of the stress .
To apply this general principle to the solubility of CO2 in water , we observe that concentrating CO2 in water generates a small amount of heat .
Thus , chilling the solution moves the equilibrium to a higher concentration .
A lower temperature in an equilibrated system favors the formation of heat .
For most gases , solubility decreases as temperature increases .
Henry 's gas law relates the equilibrium solubility of CO2 gas in water to the partial pressure of that CO2 .
This law gives us a formula to compute the solubility for a given gauge pressure , if we know the Henry 's law constant for the applicable temperature .
Since Henry 's constants are published only for certain standard temperatures , we would also like to have another formula based on Le Chatelier which gives the Henry 's law constant as a function of temperature .
By using these two formulas together , we can compute the solubility for any given temperature and pressure , and dispense with the need for a Zahm - Nagel type of solubility chart ( at least for carbonating plain water ) .
Most of our analysis of carbonation has to do with getting the CO2 into solution by applying a partial pressure of CO2 ( pCO2 ) and ( usually ) chilling temperatures .
When a bottle is opened , or beverage flows through a dispenser , or is poured into a glass or swallowed , then the pCO2 has been lowered and perhaps the temperature has been raised .
In these cases CO2 will leave solution , either invisibly through the surface interface , or in spontaneous bubbling ( fizzing , effervescing ) , because the equilibrium conditions have changed .
It is this effervescence , after all , that is the chief aesthetic purpose underlying our sensual enjoyment of carbonation ( along with the carbonic acid tartness ) .
When you pour an open cup of carbonated beverage , even if the beverage is chilled upon dispensing , poured gently , and kept cold in the cup with ice , the surface of the liquid is exposed to the ordinary atmosphere .
The impinging pCO2 is thus practically zero , and therefore the equilibrium volume of CO2 in solution is likewise zero .
In short , the drink will eventually go flat , although not instantly .
The rate of diffusion of CO2 out of the beverage into the atmosphere depends on the instantaneous degree of carbonation ; highly carbonated liquids effervesce in the atmosphere ; while lightly carbonated liquids outgas slowly and invisibly .
If you were to apply a flexible barrier over that surface which was impermeable to CO2 gas , then the pCO2 at the surface is effectively 1 atm , and you retain a carbonation level up to 1.71 volumes .
At higher starting levels bubbles will form and rise to the top .
Note that the persistent foam head on root beer or malt beverages is just such a barrier , at least temporarily .
The same process governs the loss of carbonation of a bottled beverage which is uncapped , partly dispensed , recapped , and so on .
Each uncapping releases the equilibrium pCO2 in the headspace , which was determined by the initial filling .
As beverage is poured out , air replaces the CO2 gas in the headspace .
If quickly recapped , the pCO2 in the headspace may be about zero , but the CO2 in solution in the remaining beverage will remain at about the initial level .
The bottle is now out of equilibrium , because the liquid is carbonated by the pCO2 of the headspace above it is zero .
CO2 gas will leave solution and pass into the headspace , mixing with the air , until a new equilibrium of lower solution concentration and higher headspace pCO2 is reached .
This new equilibrium will be determined by the Henry 's Law characteristic ( solution concentration versus pCO2 ) governing the liquid on one hand , versus the Dalton 's Law characteristic ( pTotal = pCO2 + 1 atm ) governing the headspace on the other hand , and the relative volumes of the liquid and headspace .
When a bottle of carbonated beverage is unopened , or not much of the beverage has been dispensed , the ratio of liquid - to - headspace volume remains very high .
Even if the pCO2 is released and replace by air via uncapping , the liquid can refill the headspace with pCO2 to maintain equilibrium without losing much carbonation .
After repeated uncapping cycles , however , and especially as the ratio of liquid - to - headspace volume inverts unfavorably , the equilibrium dissolution to restore pCO2 to the headspace increasingly depletes the carbonation level .
The game is favorable with a full or mostly - full bottle , but quickly lost when the bottle is about one - half or one - third full .
Note that if we can dispense a carbonated beverage from a bottle without uncapping , then we gain a significant advantage because the CO2 volume lost from the headspace is merely the volume of liquid dispensed , not a repeated replacement of the entire headspace .
Furthermore , if the headspace is purged with pure CO2 during the bottling process , the headspace pCO2 is not reduced by air as is the case with uncapping .
This efficiency is the principle behind " soda syphon " type dispensers and kegging .
The headspace(s ) of the system are kept filled with pure CO2 instead of air , and the only CO2 that exits the system is that which is dissolved in the beverage , not from the headspace .
One source on the Web which formulates the Le Chatelier principle specifically for CO2 in water is a 4 - page unattributed geochemistry paper summarizing " Carbon dioxide transfer across the interface " from the Utrecht University in the Netherlands ( PDF file ) .
While this paper is concerned with characterizing and quantifying how atmospheric CO2 moves in and out of lakes and oceans , the physical principles are directly applicable to carbonation of beverages .
The paper gives the following empirical formula for the Henry 's law constant K in mol / liter - atm for CO2 in water as a function of temperature T in degrees Kelvin ( I have converted their mathematical formula to a C code fragment ) :
double a0 = - 5.7470126E2 ; double a1 = 2.154152E4 ; double a2 = - 1.47759E - 4 ; double a3 = 8.9892E1 ; double T , lnK , K ; T = ... /* degrees Kelvin */; lnK = a0 + a 1/T + a 2 * T*T + a 3* log( T ) ; K = exp ( lnK ) ; /* mole / liter-atm */
This formula yields a value of the Henry 's law constant for any desired temperature .
In contrast to the gas laws , which are all simply proportions or sums , this formula is very complex , involving logarithms and exponentials , reflecting the complexity of the underlying kinetics which determine the dynamic equilibrium of such a solution .
Note : in the C programming language math library , " log ( T ) " is the natural logarithm .
The result output by the formula is stated in units of mol / liter - atm , which is fine for the laboratory , but we want to know it in standard volumes of CO2 .
The relevant conversion factors are :
1 atm = 14.7 psi 0.0442 mol/liter-atm = 1 volume CO2 / atm 0.6550 mol/liter-atm = 1 volume CO2 / psia
For example , at 32 deg F = 273.15 deg Kelvin , the Henry 's law constant from the formula above is K = 0.0768 mol / liter-atm , or dividing by 0.6550 , we get K = 0.117 volumes of CO2 per psia .
At atmospheric pressure of 0 psig = 14.7 psia , we thus find the solubility of CO2 to be 0.117 * 14.7 = 1.72 volumes .
This agrees closely with the Zahm - Nagel chart value of 1.71 .
At 20 psig = 34.7 psia , we have 0.117 * 34.7 = 4.06 volumes .
Note that pressures input to the formula must be expressed as absolute values ( psia ) , not gauge readings ( psig ) , so you must convert gauge pressures to absolute by adding the atmospheric pressure of 14.7 psia .
Likewise you must convert temperature values in Celsius or Fahrenheit degrees to absolute temperatures of degrees Kelvin .
Consider solubility at two other temperatures of interest : room temperature solubility is 0.76 volumes , and body temperature solubility is 0.56 volumes .
Soda that has gone mostly " flat " by sitting out at room temperature still has 3 / 4 of its volume of CO2 dissolved in it .
Likewise a beverage warmed in your stomach will retain up to about 1/2 its volume of dissolved CO2 .
It will , however , outgas upwards of 3.7 - 0.56 = 3 volumes if you drink it cold and fully carbonated .
That 's a lot of burping !
I do n't know enough biochemistry to predict whether gastric juices or other factors play a role in getting that last 0.56 volumes to leave solution , or whether it just continues on to become intestinal gas after the water is absorbed later in the process .
Thermodynamic and transport properties of CO2 , including the Mollier chart and phase diagrams , are published by ChemicaLogic .
Carbonation in History : Carbonated water , known scientifically as carbonic acid , was known to ancient alchemists as a weak acid , and the gas carbon dioxide known as its constituent .
These substances were known by pre-scientific names , including : gas Sylvestre , gas of Van Helmont , Spiritus Sylvestris , gas of Dr Black , aerial acid , atmospheric acid , Mephitic acid , cretaceous acid , acid of charcoal , fixed air ( Priestley 's term in the 1700s ) , Hale 's solid air , acidulated air , and gaseous waters .
See the page on ancient chemical nomenclature at Guita 's Classical Chymistry , which lists an attempt by the best chemical experts in 1787 to rationalize the knowledge of the era .
Priestley 's pioneering paper of 1772 , Impregnating Water with Fixed Air ( full text , 330 KB PDF file ) , subtitled " In order to communicate to it the peculiar Spirit and Virtues of Pyrmont Water , And other Mineral Waters of a fimilar [ sic ] Nature " , was published at London .
The dedication to John Earl of Sandwich , First Lord Commissioner of the [ British ]
Admiralty , suggests that Priestley was employed as what we would today call a " Navy defense contractor " , the goal being " proposals for improving the water used at sea , by impregnating it with fixed air " .
In short , they were looking for a practical way to supply soda to sailors ( " I have drawn up the following easy [!] directions for making it " ) , hoping this would improve sanitation and palatability , the better to fight with .
Given that Priestley had at best atmospheric pressure gas to work with , and no refrigeration , his results must have been relatively poor by today 's standards of fizziness .
Priestley was also an pioneering advocate of what we would today call " open source " .
He states , " If this discovery ( though it doth not deserve that name ) be of any use to my countrymen , and to mankind at large , I shall have my reward .
For this purpose I have made the communication as early as I conveniently could , since the latest improvements that I have made in the process ; and I cannot help expressing my wishes , that all persons , who discover any thing that promises to be generally useful , would adopt the same method " .

Etymology :
The word " seltzer " is said to derive from the springs at the German village Nieder - Selters .
Is it possible to carbonate beverages with dry chemicals , like an Alka - Seltzer tablet minus the aspirin ?
No , this is a poor source of CO2 and yields excessive sodium if used in a beverage .
Other than the aspirin , Alka Seltzer is simply a mix of dried sodium bicarbonate ( baking soda , sodium hydrogen carbonate ) and citric acid ( hydrogen citrate ) , proportioned about 2:1 by weight ( 1.9 grams of bicarbonate to 1 gram of citric acid in the standard formula for Alka - Seltzer ) and pressed into a dry tablet .
While it may be fun to watch , it is a poor way to carbonate a beverage : 1.9 grams of bicarbonate yields about 1 gram of CO2 with a whopping half a gram of sodium .
To properly carbonate a liter of seltzer takes 8 grams of CO2 , so you would also be adding over 4 grams of sodiu
Continuing the theme of alternative approaches to teaching calculus , I take the liberty of posting a letter sent by Donald Knuth to to the Notices of the American Mathematical Society in March , 1998 ( TeX file ) .
Professor Anthony W. Knapp
P O Box 333
East Setauket , NY 11733
Dear editor ,
I am pleased to see so much serious attention being given to improvements in the way calculus has traditionally been taught , but I ’m surprised that nobody has been discussing the kinds of changes that I personally believe would be most valuable .
If I were responsible for teaching calculus to college undergraduates and advanced high school students today , and if I had the opportunity to deviate from the existing textbooks , I would certainly make major changes by emphasizing several notational improvements that advanced mathematicians have been using for more than a hundred years .
The most important of these changes would be to introduce the notation and related ideas at an early stage .
This notation , first used by Bachmann in 1894 and later popularized by Landau , has the great virtue that it makes calculations simpler , so it simplifies many parts of the subject , yet it is highly intuitive and easily learned .
The key idea is to be able to deal with quantities that are only partly specified , and to use them in the midst of formulas .
I would begin my ideal calculus course by introducing a simpler “ notation , ” which means “ absolutely at most . ”
For example , stands for a quantity whose absolute value is less than or equal to .
This notation has a natural connection with decimal numbers :
Saying that is approximately is equivalent to saying that .
Students will easily discover how to calculatewith :
I would of course explain that the equality sign is not symmetric with respect to such notations ; we have and but not , nor can we say that .
We can , however , say that .
As de Bruijn points out in [ 1 , 1.2 ] , mathematicians customarily use the sign as they use the word “ is ” in English : Aristotle is a man , but a man is n’t necessarily Aristotle .
The notation applies to variable quantities as well as to constant ones .
For example ,
if and if
Once students have caught on to the idea of notation , they are ready for notation , which is even less specific .
In its simplest form , stands for something that is for some constant , but we do n’t say what is .
We also define side conditions on the variables that appear in the formulas .
For example , if is a positive integer we can say that any quadratic polynomial in is .
If is sufficiently large , we can deduce that
I would define the derivative by first defining what might be called a “ strong derivative ” :
The function has a strong derivative at point if
whenever is sufficiently small .
The vast majority of all functions that arise in practical work have strong derivatives , so I believe this definition best captures the intuition I want students to have about derivatives .
We see immediately , for example , that if we have
so the derivative of is .
And if the derivative of is , we have
hence the derivative of is and we find by induction that
Similarly if and have strong derivatives and , we readily find
and this gives the strong derivative of the product .
The chain rule
also follows when has a strong derivative at point and has a strong derivative at .
Once it is known that integration is the inverse of differentiation and related to the area under a curve , we can observe , for example , that if and both have strong derivatives at , then
I ’m sure it would be a pleasure for both students and teacher if calculus were taught in this way .
The extra time needed to introduce notation is amply repaid by the simplifications that occur later .
In fact , there probably will be time to introduce the “ notation , ” which is equivalent to the taking of limits , and to give the general definition of a not - necessarily - strong derivative :
The function is continuous at if
and so on .
But I would not mind leaving a full exploration of such things to a more advanced course , when it will easily be picked up by anyone who has learned the basics with alone .
Indeed , I have not needed to use “ ” in 2200 pages of The Art of Computer Programming , although many techniques of advanced calculus are applied throughout those books to a great variety of problems .
Students will be motivated to use notation for two important reasons .
First , it significantly simplifies calculations because it allows us to be sloppy — but in a satisfactorily controlled way .
Second , it appears in the power series calculations of symbolic algebra systems like Maple and Mathematica , which today ’s students will surely be using .
For more than 20 years I have dreamed of writing a calculus text entitled O Calculus , in which the subject would be taught along the lines sketched above .
More pressing projects , such as the development of the TeX system , have made that impossible , although I did try to write a good introduction to notation for post - calculus students in [ 2 , Chapter 9 ] .
Perhaps my ideas are preposterous , but I ’m hoping that this letter will catch the attention of people who are much more capable than I of writing calculus texts for the new millennium .
And I hope that some of these
now - classical ideas will prove to be at least half as fruitful for students of the next generation as they have been for me .
Sincerely ,

Does perfect code exist ?
( Abstractions , Part 1 )
Bryan Cantrill recently wrote a blog entry , where among other things , he philosophized on the concept of “ perfect code ” .
He compares software to math , arguing that Euclid ’s greatest common denominator algorithm shows no sign of wearing out , and that when code achieves perfection ( or gets close to perfection ) , “ it sediments into the information infrastructure ” and the abstractions defined by that code becomes “ the bedrock that future generations may build upon ” .
Later , in the comments of his blogs , when pressed to give some examples of such perfection , he cites a clever algorithm coded by his mentor to divide a high resolution timestamp by a billion extremely efficiently , and Solaris ’s “ cyclic subsystem ” , a timer dispatch function .
Watching his talk at Google where his introduction and sidebar book review on Scott Rosenberg ’s “ On Dreaming in Code ” , it ’s clear that he very passionately believes that it is possible to write perfect code , and that one should strive for that at all times .
Perhaps that ’s because he mostly writes code for operating systems , where the requirements change slowly , and for one OS in particular , Solaris , which tries far harder than most software projects to keep published interfaces stable for as long as possible .
In contrast , the OS I ’ve spent a lot of time hacking around , Linux , quite proudly states that at least inside the kernel , interfaces can not and should not be stable .
Greg Kroah - Hart ’s “ Stable API Nonsense ” is perhaps one of the strongly and most passionate expositions of that philosophy .
I can see both sides of the argument , and in their place , both have something to offer .
To Bryan ’s first point , it is absolutely true that interfaces can become “ bedrock ” upon which entire ecosystems are built .
Perhaps one of the most enduring and impactful example would be the Unix programming interface , which has since become enshrined by POSIX.2 and successor standards .
I would argue , though , that it is the interface that is important , and not the code which initially implemented it .
If the interface is powerful enough , and if it appears at the right time , and the initial implementation is good enough ( not perfect ! ) , then it can establish itself by virtue of the software which uses it becoming large enough that it assumes an important all out of scale with its original intention .
Of course , sometimes such an interface is not perfect .
There is an apocryphal story that when S. Feldman at AT&T labs first wrote the ‘ make ’ utility , that he did so rather quickly , and then put it available for his fellow lab members to use , and then went home to sleep .
In some versions of the story he had stayed up late and / or pulled an all - nighter to write it , so he slept a long time .
When he came back to work , he had come up with a number of ways to improve the syntax of the Makefile .
Unfortunately , ( so goes the story ) that too many teams were already using the ‘ make ’ utility , so he did n’t feel he could change the Makefile syntax .
I have no evidence that this ever took place , and I suspect it is an urban myth that was invented to explain why Makefiles have a rather ugly and unfortunate syntax that many would call defects , including the use of syntactically significant tab characters which are indistinguishable from other forms of leading whitespace .
Another example which is the bane of filesystem designers everywhere are the Unix readdir ( 2 ) , telldir ( 2 ) , and seekdir ( 2 ) interfaces .
These interfaces fundamentally assume that directories are stored in linear linked lists , and filesystems that wish to use more sophisticated data structures , such as b- trees , have to go to extraordinary lengths in order support these interfaces .
Very few programs use telldir ( 2 ) and seekdir ( 2 ) , but some filesystems such as JFS maintain two b- trees instead of one just to cater to telldir / seekdir .
And yet , it is absolutely true that interfaces can be the bedrock for an entire industry .
Certainly no matter what its warts , the Unix / Posix interface has proven the test of time , and it has been responsible for the success of many a company and many billions of dollars of market capitalization .
But is this the same as perfect code ?
No , but if billions of dollars of user applications are going to be depending on that code , it ’s best if code which implement such an interface be high quality , and should attempt to achieve perfection .
But what does it mean for code to be perfect ?
For a particular environment , if the requirements can be articulated clearly , I can accept that code can reach perfection , in that it becomes as fast as possible ( for the given computer platform ) , and it handles all exception cases , etc. , etc .
Unfortunately , in the real world , the environment and the requirements inevitably change over time .
For example , Bryan ’s cyclic subsystem , which he proudly touts as being if not perfect , almost so , and which executes at least 100 times a second on every Solaris system in the world .
I have n’t looked at the cyclic system in any detail , since I do n’t want to get myself contaminated ( the CDDL and GPLv2 licenses are intentionally incompatible , and given that companies — including Sun — have sued over IPR issues , well , one ca n’t be too careful ) , but waking up the CPU from its low - power state 100 times a second is n’t a good thing at all if you are worried about energy conservation in data centers — or in laptops .
For example , on my laptop , it is possible to keep wakeups down to no more than 30 - 35 times a second and it would be possible to do more but for an abstraction limitation .
Suppose for example an process wants to be sleep and then receive a wakeup 1 milliseconds later , and so requests this via usleep ( ) .
At the same time , another application wants to sleep until some file descriptor activity takes place , or after 1.2 milliseconds takes place .
0.3 milliseconds later , a third process requests a sleep , this time for 0.8 milliseconds .
Now , it could be that in all of the above cases , the applications do n’t actually need exact timing ; if they all get their wakeups plus or minus some fraction of a millisecond , they would be quite cool with that .
Unfortunately , the standard timer interfaces have no way of expressing this , and so the OS ca n’t combine the three wakeups at T+1.0 , T+1.1 , and T+1.2 milliseconds into one wakeup at T+1.1ms .
So this is where Greg K - H’s “ Stable API Nonsense ” comes into play .
We may not be able to solve this problem at the userspace level , but we darn well can solve this problem inside the kernel .
Inside the kernel , we can change the timer abstraction to allow device drivers and kernel routines to provide a timer delta plus a notion of how much accuracy is required for a particular timer request .
Doing so might change a timer structure that previously external device drivers had depended upon — but too bad , that ’s why stable ABI / API ’s are not supported for internal kernel interfaces .
Is this that the interface could have been extended ?
Well , perhaps , and perhaps not ; if an interface is well designed , it is possible it can be extended in an API and / or ABI compatible way .
There usually is a performance cost to doing so , and sometimes it may make sense to pay that that cost , and sometimes it may not .
I ’ll talk more about that in a future essay .
Yet note what happened to the timer implementation .
We have a pretty sophisticated timer implementation inside Linux , that uses heap data structures and buckets of timers for efficiency .
So while I might not call it perfect , it is pretty good .
But , oops !
Thanks to this new requirement of energy efficiency , it will likely need to get changed to support variable levels of accuracy and the ability to fire multiple timers that are ( more or less ) coming due in a single CPU wakeup cycle .
Does that make it no longer perfect , or no longer pretty good ?
Well , it just had a new requirement impact the code , and if criteria for perfection is for the abstraction defined by the code to be “ bedrock ” and never - changing , and no need to make any changes in said code over multiple years , I would argue that little to no code , even OS code , can ever achieve perfection by that definition — unless that code is no longer being used .
( This is the first of a multi - part series of essays on abstractions that I have planned .
The next essay which I plan to write will be entitled “ Layer surfing , or jumping between layers ” , and will be coming soon to a blog near you …. )

That , or it would produce some hideous beast .

Doctors say there has been a rapid rise in infant health conditions Doctors in Afghanistan say rates of some health problems affecting children have doubled in the last two years .
Some scientists say the rise is linked to use of weapons containing depleted uranium ( DU ) by the US - led coalition that invaded the country in 2001 .
A Canadian research group found very high levels of uranium in Afghans during tests just after the invasion .
A US forces spokesman denied its weapons were affecting the health of Afghans or the country 's environment .
But claims made in the BBC World Service One Planet programme suggest the invasion may have left an unwelcome legacy for the country 's environment and the health of its people .
We do n't use depleted uranium in Afghanistan ; we do n't have a requirement to use that
Major Chris Belcher
Coalition spokesman Doctors in Kabul and Kandahar showed data indicating that the incidence of a number of health conditions , including birth defects , has doubled in under two years .
" We have premature births and malformations , " said one doctor , who wished to remain anonymous , in one of the main maternity and neo-natal hospitals in the country .
" Malformations include neural tube defects and malformation of limbs ; for example , the head is smaller than normal , or the head is larger than normal , or there is a big mass on the back of the baby .
" We do n't know what is the cause of these malformations . "
Heavy metal The Canada - based Uranium Medical Research Centre ( UMRC ) believes the cause might be depleted uranium .
In 2002 and 2003 the group ran programmes analysing urine from Afghans .
In some , it found levels of uranium hundreds of times greater than in Gulf War veterans .
Villagers near Tora Bora spoke of their concerns over US weaponry Asaf Durakovic , URMC 's president and a former US army adviser , believes that exposure to DU weapons may have brought a rise in birth defects as well as " symptoms of muscular - skeletal pains , immune system disorders , lung disease , and eventually cancer " .
Depleted uranium and natural uranium contain different ratios of two isotopes of the metal .
So scientists can tell whether a person has been exposed to the natural form , or to DU .
DU is used in armour - piercing shells because its density means it can penetrate further than other metals .
Dr Durakovic said his research showed that in Afghanistan , coalition forces had also used DU in " bunker buster " bombs , which can penetrate tens of metres into the soil .
" In Afghanistan it has to be ... a weapon that destroys not only bunkers or caves , but also penetrates through the soil and through the fragile environment of the mountains . "
Strange fruit Villagers near the Tora Bora mountains , scene of a massive coalition attack in 2001 aimed at forcing Osama bin Laden out of a cave complex where he was believed to be hiding , suspect the bombs brought an increase in diseases and other problems .
DEPLETED URANIUM
Has a reduced proportion of isotope Uranium - 235 Less radioactive than natural uranium and very dense Military uses include defensive armour plating , armour - penetrating ordnance Can be inhaled as dust or ingested in contaminated food and water near impact sites " There was a strange smell , and most of the trees here did not yield fruit , " recounted Yusuf Khan .
Another villager , Bakhtawar , said : " There were three or four babies born in our area whose arms and legs and faces were not normal ; they were malformed . "
But Faizullah Kakar , Afghanistan 's deputy health minister , countered : " Health defects are common in Afghanistan .
" We want to find out if it is nutritional deficiency or environmental contamination with certain radiation that is doing it . "
Disputed claims
The US military rejects claims that it used DU - containing bunker busters in Afghanistan .
It also denies allegations that the weapons it used in Afghanistan are affecting health and the environment .
" We do n't use depleted uranium in Afghanistan ; we do n't have a requirement to use that , " said Major Chris Belcher , spokesman for the coalition forces .
The coalition acknowledges DU may have been used here in the past
But he said such weapons might have been used in the past .
" I do n't have any knowledge of what might have been used in 2001 and 2002 .
If there was an armour threat , the DU rounds would have been used to counter that threat . "
Dr C Ross Anthony from the Rand Corporation , the US think - tank , suggested use of DU ordnance would have been light in Afghanistan .
" With very few of them ( DU weapons ) being used , it is hard for me to imagine that much of a real environmental problem exists , " he said .
What next ?
Some scientific experts suggested performing further research into the alleged damage caused by weapons used in the country .
But officials in Afghanistan 's newly established National Environmental Protection Agency said they did not have the necessary equipment or expertise to investigate properly .
And Chris Alexander from the United Nations Assistance Mission for Afghanistan ( UNAMA ) acknowledged it was a concern , but said : " We have no idea what the scale is , nor do we have special knowledge about environmental implications . "
Asaf Durakovic would prefer that concrete measures be taken now .
" The best thing is to relocate the population ; people have to be moved from the areas that have been highly contaminated to safe areas to provide medical testing and medical care . "
Following the use of DU weapons in Iraq and the Balkans , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) researched the impact on health and the environment .
It concluded , as did a 2001 European Union enquiry into the Balkans conflict , that DU posed little threat .
A senior WHO official told One Planet it had not received any request from Afghan authorities to investigate the current situation .

What are these ?
The 2007 average price was $ 72 per barrel and the current average is sitting at a healthy $ 94 per barrel .
Between 2004 - 2005 the oil prices started to go through the roof and we ’re not exactly dropping into an affordable range even with a big drop last week .
He was previously cool to the idea of alternative fuels but is now seeing that without alternative fuels , the transfer of wealth out of the country will be significant .
“ We ’re spending about $ 1.5 billion a day — $ 500 to $ 600 billion a year — on imported oil , ” he noted .
“ That ’s four times the cost of the Iraqi war .
We ca n’t continue to do that .
In 10 years you will have transferred wealth from the United States to the producing countries of about $ 5 or $ 6 trillion .
That wo n’t work .
I ’m not sure what it ’s going to do to us to remove that much wealth out of this country .
We have got to get on alternative fuels in the United States .
That ’s all there is to it . ”
Finnish National Bureau of Investigation ( NBI ) has labeled hundreds of publicly available web sites in USA , as well as several in Germany , The Netherlands and other countries , as child pornography .
The implication is that authorities in those countries are unwilling or unable to do anything about it , even when the sites operate openly and child pornography is definitely illegal in those countries as well .
Little or no attempt has been made , however , by the NBI to alert the FBI or similar authorities about said sites , with no explanation other than that the law does not require it .
Given that , e.g. , the FBI is well known to react quickly to reports of child porn sites even from individuals by email , it would hardly be any real strain on NBI resources to notify them whenever adding a site to the blacklist .
Why do n’t they , then ?
One cannot help suspecting the reason is that they know they ’re censoring sites that are not child porn at all , and attempting to initiate actual legal proceedings would reveal that – that they are in fact breaking the law themselves , as it explicitly states that only child porn sites may be put in the blacklist .
News of NBI ’s overbroad censorship came about when Internet activist Matti Nikki published part of the officially secret list on his web page `lapsiporno .

The NBI reacted by blacklisting his site as well , even though it contains no child porn , and after public outcry summoned him for questioning and announced he may be prosecuted for abetting child porn distribution .
The world has a new culprit to blame for the rising tide of software vulnerabilities -- code outsourcing .
The trend to outsource the coding of applications is now a major contributor to making business software more vulnerable , a survey - cum - report has claimed .
According to analyst group Quocirca , which surveyed 250 IT directors and executives in the U.S. , the U.K. and Germany for Fortify Software , ninety percent of the organizations that admitted to having been ' hacked ' had outsourced more than 40 percent of their applications to third parties .
But the rush to benefit from the speed , convenience and lower cost of outsourced applications was leaving security as an afterthought in an alarming number of cases .
Sixty percent of respondents reported not mandating security from scratch , while 20 percent of those surveyed in the U.K. failed to accommodate security at all in the outsourced applications .
So what 's behind this risky attitude ?
The report mainly blames the way companies have become enamored with relatively poorly - understood Web 2.0 technologies , and the parallel rush to use service - oriented architectures ( SOA ) to open up software to much - loved partners .
As to outsourcing itself , according to Fortify , the problem here is that the client company has no visibility on the coding behavior of the company carrying out the work , no matter how good the relationship appears to be .
As in other areas of technology , U.S. organizations have been at the forefront of the software outsourcing movement , with 61 percent of those surveyed reporting that they outsourced more than 40 percent of their programming .
Germany , by contrast was some way behind this percentage , with the U.K. somewhere between the two extremes , thanks to its financial services bias .
The U.K.'s uptake of Web 2.0 is also closer to the U.S. ' than Germany 's , which is to say that it has been significant .
" These survey results help explain the recent , sudden rise in data breaches and should serve as a wake - up call to any executive whose company sits on a pile of mission - critical application code , " said Fortify board member and former White House cybersecurity advisor Howard Schmidt .
At least companies can attempt to protect themselves against the specific threat posed by lazy programming using backdoor detection systems , a growing category of software .
As ever companies find themselves solving software security problems by buying yet more software .

All right , I thought a clean install , let 's read on and see how to do a clean install :
Place a small amount of nonabrasive , liquid soap on the shiny side of the CD or DVD .
Using your fingertips and warm water , gently rub the soap on the disc in a circular motion .
Rinse the disc thoroughly and dry it using a clean , soft T - shirt or lint - free towel .
Do not use paper towels or tissue paper .
Install the program .
Doing a " clean install " has now taken on a new meaning for me .

Who ’s Afraid of Wolf 359 ?
Ken MacLeod
When you ’re as old as I am , you ’ll find your memory ’s not what it was .
It ’s not that you lose memories .
That has n’t happened to me or anyone else since the Paleocosmic Era , the Old Space Age , when people lived in caves on the Moon .
My trouble is that I ’ve gained memories , and I do n’t know which of them are real .
I was very casual about memory storage back then , I seem to recall .
This could happen to you too , if you ’re not careful .
So be warned .
Do as I say , not as I did .
Some of the tales about me contradict each other , or could n’t possibly have happened , because that ’s how I told them in the first place .
Others I blame on the writers and tellers .
They make things up .
I ’ve never done that .
If I ’ve told stories that could n’t be true , it ’s because that ’s how I remember them .
Here ’s one .
I ran naked through the Long Station , throwing my smart clothes away to distract the Tycoon ’s dogs .
Breeks , shirt , cravat , jacket , waistcoat , stockings , various undergarments — one by one they ran , flapped , slithered , danced , or scurried off , and after every one of them raced a scent - seeking but mercifully stupid hound .
But the Tycoon had more dogs in his pack than I had clothes in my bundle .
I was down to my shoes and the baying continued .
I glanced over my shoulder .
Two dogs were just ten meters behind me .
I hurled a shoe at each of them , hitting both animals right on their genetically modified noses .
The dogs skidded to a halt , yelping and howling .
A few metres away was a jewelry booth .
I sprinted for it , vaulted the counter , grabbed a recycler , and bashed at the display cabinet .
An alarm brayed and the security mesh rattled down behind me .
The dogs , recovered and furious , hurled themselves
against it .
The rest of the pack pelted into view and joined them .
Paws , jaws , barking , you get
the picture .
“ Put your hands up , ” said a voice above the din .
I turned and looked into the bell - shaped muzzle of a Norton held in the hands of a sweet - looking lass wearing a sample of the stall ’s stock .
I raised my hands , wishing I could put them somewhere else .
In those days , I had some vestige of modesty .
“ I ’m human , ” I said .
“ That ca n’t hurt me . ”
She allowed herself the smallest flicker of a glance at the EMP weapon ’s sighting screen .
“ It could give you quite a headache , ” she said .
“ It could that , ” I admitted , my bluff called .
I ’d been half - hoping she would n’t know how to interpret the readouts .
“ Security ’s on its way , ” she said .
“ Good , ” I said .
“ Better them than the dogs . ”
She gave me a tight smile .
“ Trouble with the Tycoon ? ”
“ Yes , ” I said .
“ How did you guess ? ”
“ Only the owner of the Station could afford dogs , ” she said .
“ Besides … ” She blinked twice slowly .
“ I suppose you ’re right , ” I said .
“ Or serving - girls . ”
The stall - keeper laughed in my face .
“ All this for a servant ?
Was n’t it her Ladyship ’s bedroom window you jumped out of ? ”
I shuddered .
“ You flatter me , ” I said .
“ Anyway , how do you know about — ? ”
She blinked again .
“ It ’s on the gossip channels already . ”
I was about to give a heated explanation of why that time - wasting rubbish was n’t among the enhancements inside my skull , thank you very much , when the goons turned up ,
sent the dogs skulking reluctantly away , and took me in .
They had the tape across my mouth before I had a chance to ask the stall - keeper her name , let alone her number .
Not , as it turned
out , that I could have done much with it even if I had .
But it would have been polite .
The charge was attempting to wilfully evade the civil penalties for adultery .
I was outraged .
“ Bastards ! ” I shouted , screwing up the indictment and dashing it to the floor of my cell .
“ I thought polygamy was illegal ! ”
“ It is , ” said my attorney , stooping to pick up the flimsy , “ in civilized jurisdictions . ”
He smoothed it out .
“ But this is Long Station One .
The Tycoon has privileges . ”
“ That ’s barbaric , ” I said .
“ It ”s a relic of the Moon Caves , ” he said .
I stared at him .
“ No it is n’t , ” I said .
“ I do n’t remember ” — I caught myself just in time — “ reading about anything like that . ”
He tapped a slight bulge on his cranium .
“ That ’s what it says here .
Argue with the editors , not with me . ”
“ All right , ” I said .
A second complaint rose to the top of the stack .
“ She never said anything about being married ! ”
“ Did you ask her ? ”
“ Of course not , ” I said .
“ That would have been grossly impolite .
In the circumstances , it would have implied that she was contemplating adultery . ”
“ I see . ” He sighed .
“ I ’ll never understand the … ethics , if that ’s the word , of you young gallants . ”
I smiled at that .
“ However , ” he went on , “ that does n’t excuse you for ignorance of the law — “
“ How was I to know the Tycoon was married to his wenches ? ” “ — or custom .
There is an orientation pack , you know .
All arrivals are deemed to have
read it . ”
“ ” Deemed ” , ” I said .
“ Now , there ’s a word that just about sums up everything that ’s wrong about — “
“ You can forego counsel , if you wish . ”
I raised my hands .
“ No , no .
Please .
Do your best . ”
He did his best .
A week later , he told me that he had got me off with a fine plus compensation .
If I borrowed money to pay the whole sum now , it would take two hundred and fifty seven years to pay off the debt .
I had other plans for the next two hundred and fifty seven years .
Instead , I negotiated a one - off advance fee to clean up Wolf 359 , and used that to pay the court and the Tycoon .
The experimental civilization around Wolf 359 — a limited company — had a decade earlier gone into liquidation , taking ten billion shareholders down with it .
Nobody knew what it had turned into .
Whatever remained out there had been off limits ever since , and would be for centuries to come — unless someone went in to clean it up .
In a way , the Wolf 359 situation was the polar opposite of what the Civil Worlds had hitherto had to deal with , which was habitats , networks , sometimes whole systems going into exponential intelligence enhancement — what we called a fast burn .
We knew how to deal with a fast burn .
Ignore it for five years , and it goes away .
Then send in some heavilyfirewalled snoop robots and pick over the wreckage for legacy hardware .
Sometimes you get a breakout , where some of the legacy hardware reboots and starts getting ideas above its station , but that ’s a job for the physics team .
A civilizational implosion was a whole different volley of nukes .
Part of the problem was sheer nervousness .
We were too close historically to what had happened on the Moon ’s primary to be altogether confident that we would n’t somehow be sucked in ourselves .
Another part of it was simple economics : the job was too long - term and too risky to be
attractive , given all the other opportunities available to anyone who was n’t completely
desperate .
Into that vacancy for someone who was completely desperate , I wish I could say I stepped .
In truth , I was pushed .
Even I was afraid of Wolf 359 .
An Astronomical Unit is one of those measurements that should be obsolete , but is n’t .
It ’s no more — or less — arbitrary than the light - year .
All our units have origins that no longer mean anything to us — we measure time by what was originally a fraction of one axial rotation , and space by a fraction of the circumference , of the Moon ’s primary .
An AU was originally the distance between the Moon ’s primary and its primary , the Sun .
These days , it ’s usually thought of as the approximate distance from a G - type star to the middle of the habitable zone .
About a hundred and fifty million kilometres .
The Long Tube , which the Long Station existed to shuttle people to and from and generally to maintain , was one hundred and eighty Astronomical Units long .
Twenty - seven thousand million kilometres , or , to put it in perspective , one light - day .
From the shuttle , it looked like a hairline crack in infinity , but it did n’t add up to a mouse ’s whisker in the Oort .
It was aimed straight at Sirius , which I could see as a bright star with a fuzzy green haze of habitats .
I shivered .
I was about to be frozen , placed with the rest of the passengers on the next needle ship out , electromagnetically accelerated for months at 30 g to relativistic velocities in the Long Tube , hurtled across 6.4 light - years , decelerated in Sirius ’s matching tube , accelerated again to Procyon , then to Lalande 21185 , and finally sent on a fast clipper to Lalande ’s next - door neighbour and fellow red dwarf , Wolf 359 .
It had to be a fast clipper because Wolf 359 ’s Long Tubes were no longer being calibrated — and when you ’re aiming one Long Tube across light - years at the mouth of another , calibration matters .
A fast clipper — in fact , painfully slow , the name a legacy of pre-Tube times , when 0.1 c was a fast clip — also has calibration issues .
Pushed by laser , decelerated by laser reflection
from a mirror shell deployed on nearing the target system , it was usually only used for seedships .
This clipper was an adapted seedship , but I was going in bulk because it was actually cheaper to thaw me out on arrival than to grow me from a bean .
If the calibration was n’t quite right , I ’d never know .
The shuttle made minor course corrections to dock at the Long Tube .
“ Please pass promptly to the cryogenic area , ” it told us .
I shivered again .
Cryogenic travel has improved since then : subjectively , it ’s pretty much instantaneous .
In those days , it was called cold sleep , and that ’s exactly what it felt like : being very cold and having slow , bad , dreams .
Even with relativistic time - dilation and a glacial metabolism , it lasted for months .
I woke screaming in a translucent box .
“ There , there , ” said the box .
“ Everything will be all right .
Have some coffee . ”
The lid of the box extruded a nipple towards my mouth .
I screamed again .
“ Well , if you ’re going to be like that … ” said the box .
“ It reminded me of a nightmare , ” I said .
My mouth was parched .
“ Please . ”
“ Oh , all right . ”
I sucked on the coffee and felt warmth spread from my belly .
“ Update me , ” I said , around the nipple .
My translucent surroundings became transparent , with explanatory text and diagrams floating like after - images .
A view , with footnotes .
This helped , but not enough .
An enormous blue - and - white sphere loomed right in front of me .
I recoiled so hard that I hurt my head on the back of the box .
“ What the fuck is that ? ”
“ A terraformed terrestrial , ” said the box .
“ Please do try to read before reacting . ”
“ Sorry , ” I said .
“ I thought we were falling towards it . ”
“ We are , ” said the box .
I must have yelled again .
“ Read before reacting , ” said the box .
“ Please . ”
I turned my head as if to look over my shoulder .
I could n’t actually turn it that far , but the box obligingly swivelled the view .
The red dwarf lurked at my back , apparently closer than the blue planet .
I felt almost relieved .
At least Wolf 359 was where I expected it .
According to the view ’s footnotes , nothing else was , except the inactive Long Tubes in the wispy remnant of the cometary cloud , twelve light - hours out .
No solar - orbit microwave stations .
Not even the hulks of habitats .
No asteroids .
No large cometary masses .
And a planet , something that should n’t have been there , was .
I did n’t need the explanatory text to make the connection .
Every scrap of accessible mass in the system had been thrown into this gaudy reconstruction .
The planet reminded me of pictures I ’d seen of the Moon ’s primary , back when it had liquid water .
The most recent information , inevitably a decade or so out of date , came from Lalande 21185 .
Watching what was going on around Wolf 359 was a tiny minority interest , but in a population of a hundred billion , that can add up to a lot .
Likewise , the diameter of Lalande ’s habitat cloud was a good deal smaller than an Astronomical Unit , but that still adds up to a very large virtual telescope .
Large enough to resolve the weather patterns on the planet below me , never mind the continents .
The planet ’s accretion had begun before I set off , apparently under deliberate control , and the terraforming had been completed about fifty years earlier , while I was on route .
It remained raw — lots of volcanoes and earthquakes — but
habitable .
There was life , obviously , but no one knew what kind .
No radio signals had been detected , nor any evidence of intelligence , beyond some disputably artificial clusters of lights
on the night side .
“ Well , that ’s it , ” I said .
“ Problem solved .
The system ’s pretty much uninhabitable now , with all the mass and organics locked up in a planet , but it may have tourist potential .
No threat to anyone .
Call in a seedship , they can make something of what ’s left of the local Kuiper Belt , and get the Long Tubes back on stream .
Wake me up when it ’s over . ”
“ That is very much not it , ” said the box .
“ Not until we know why this happened .
Not until we know what ’s down there . ”
“ Well , send down some probes . ”
“ I do not have the facilities to make firewalled snoop robots , ” said the box , “ and other probes could be corrupted .
My instructions are to deliver you to any remnant of the Wolf 359 civilization , and that is what I shall do . ”
It must have been an illusion , given what I could read of our velocity , but the planet seemed to come closer .
“ You ’re proposing to dock — to land on that object ? ”
“ Yes . ”
“ It has an atmosphere !
We ”ll burn up !
And then crash ! ”
“ The remains of our propulsion system can be adapted for aerobraking , ” said the box .
“ That would have to be ridiculously finely calculated . ”
“ It would , ” said the box .
“ Please do not distract me . ”
Call me sentimental , but when the box ’s Turing functionality shut down to free up processing power for these ridiculously fine calculations , I felt lonely .
The orbital insertion took fourteen hours .
I drank hot coffee and sucked , from another nipple , some tepid but nutritious and palatable glop .
I even slept , in my first real sleep for more than half a century .
I
was awakened by the jolt as the box spent the last of its fuel and reaction mass on the clipper ’s final course correction .
The planet was a blue arc of atmosphere beneath me , the
interstellar propulsion plate a heat shield in front , and the deceleration shell a still - folded drogue behind .
The locations were illusory — relative to the clipper I was flat on my back .
The first buffeting from our passage through the upper atmosphere coincided with an increasing sense of weight .
The heat shield flared .
Red - hot air rushed past .
The weight became crushing .
The improvised heat shield abraded , then exploded , its parts flicked away behind .
The drogue deployed with a bang and a jolt that almost blacked me out .
The surface became a landscape , then a land , then a wall of trees .
The clipper sliced and shuddered through them , for seconds on end of crashes and shaking .
It ploughed a long furrow across green - covered soil and halted in a cloud of smoke and steam .
“ That was a landing , ” said the box .
“ Yes , ” I said .
“ You might have tried to avoid the trees . ”
“ I could not , ” said the box .
“ Phytobraking was integral to my projected landing schedule . ”
“ Phytobraking , ” I said .
“ Yes .
Also , the impacted cellulose can be used to spin you a garment . ”
That took a few minutes .
Sticky stuff oozed from the box and hardened around me .
When the uncomfortable process finished , I had a one - piece coverall and boots .
“ Conditions outside are tolerable , ” said the box , “ with no immediate hazards . ”
The box moved .
The lid retracted .
I saw purple sky and white clouds above me .
Resisting an unease that I later identified as agoraphobia , I sat up .
I found myself at the rear of the clipper ’s pointed wedge shape , about ten metres above the ground and fifty metres from the ship ’s nose .
The view was disorienting .
It was like being in a gigantic landscaped habitat , with the substrate curving the wrong way .
Wolf 359 hung in the sky like a vast red balloon , above the straight edge of a flat violet - tinged expanse that , with some incredulity , I recognised as an immense quantity of water .
It met the solid substrate about a kilometer away .
A little to my left , an open channel of water flowed toward the larger body .
The landscape was uneven , in parts jagged , with bare rock protruding from the vegetation cover .
The plain across which our smoking trail stretched to broken trees was the flattest piece of ground in the vicinity .
On the horizon , I could see a range of very high ground , dominated by a conical mass from whose truncated top smoke drifted .
The most unusual and encouraging feature of the landscape , however , was the score or so of plainly artificial and metallic gnarly lumps scattered across it .
The system had had at least a million habitats in its heyday ; these were some of their wrecks .
Smoke rose from most of them , including the nearest , which stuck up about twenty metres from the ground , about fifteen hundred metres away .
“ You can talk to my head ? ” I asked the ship .
“ You can see what I see ? ”
“ Yes , ” it said , in my head .
I climbed down and struck out across the rough ground .
I was picking my way along a narrow watercourse between two precipices of moss - covered rock when I heard a sound ahead of me , and looked up .
At the exit from the defile , I saw three men , each sitting on the back of a large animal and holding what looked like a pointed stick .
Their hair was long , their skin bare except where it was draped with the hairy skin of some different animal .
I raised one hand and stepped forward .
The men bristled instantly , aiming their sharp sticks .
“ Come forward slowly , ” one of them shouted .
Pleased that they had not lost speech along with civilization , I complied .
The three men glowered down at me .
The big beasts made noises in their noses .
“ You are from the space ship , ” said one of them .
“ Yes , ” I said .
“ We have waited long for this , ” the man said .
“ Come with us . ”
They all turned their mounts about and headed back towards the habitat hulk , which I could now see clearly .
It was surrounded by much smaller artificial structures , perhaps twenty in all , and by rectangular patches of ground within which plants grew in rows .
No one offered a ride , to my relief .
As we drew closer , small children ran out to meet us , yelling and laughing , tugging at my coverall .
Closer still , I saw women stooped among the ordered rows of plants , rearranging the substrate with hand tools .
The smells of decayed plant matter and of animal and human ordure invaded and occupied my nostrils .
Within the settlement itself , most entrances had a person sitting in front .
They watched me pass with no sign of curiosity .
Some were male , some female , all with shrivelled skin , missing or rotting teeth , and discoloured hair .
The ship whispered what had happened to them .
I was still fighting down the dry heaves when we arrived in front of the hulk .
Scorched , rusted , eroded , it nevertheless looked utterly alien to the shelters of stone and plant material that surrounded it .
It was difficult to believe it had been made by the same species .
In front of what had once been an airlock , the rest of the young and mature men of the village had gathered .
A tall man , made taller by a curious cylindrical arrangement of animal skins on his head , stepped forward and raised a hand .
“ Welcome to the new E–- , ” he said .
As soon as he spoke the taboo word for the Moon ’s primary , I realised the terrible thing that had happened here , and the worse thing that would happen .
My mind almost froze with horror .
I forced myself to remain standing , to smile — no doubt sickly — and to speak .
“ I greet you from the Civil Worlds , ” I said .
In the feast that followed , the men talked for hours .
My digestive and immune
systems coped well with what the people gave me to eat and drink .
On my way back to the ship that evening , as soon as I was out of sight , I spewed the lot .
But it was what my mind
had assimilated that made me sick , and sent me back sorry to the ship .
The largest political unit that ever existed encompassed ten billion people , and killed them .
Not intentionally , but the runaway snowball effect that iced over the planet can without doubt be blamed on certain of the World State ’s well - intended policies .
The lesson was well taken , in the Civil Worlds .
The founders of the Wolf 359 settlement corporation thought they had found a way around it , and to build a single system - wide association free of the many inconveniences of the arrangements prevalent elsewhere .
A limited company , even with ten billion shareholders , would surely not have the same fatal flaws as a government !
They were wrong .
It began as a boardroom dispute .
One of the directors appealed to the shareholders .
The shareholders formed voting blocs , a management buyout was attempted , a hostile takeover solicited from an upstart venture capital fund around Lalande ; a legal challenge to that was mounted before the invitation had gone a light - minute ; somebody finagled an obscure financial instrument into an AI with shareholding rights ; several fund management AIs formed a consortium to object to this degrading precedent , and after that there began some serious breakdowns in communication .
That last is n’t an irony or a euphemism : in a system - wide unit , sheer misunderstanding can result in megadeaths , and here it did .
The actual shooting , however horrendous , was only the coup de grace .
Towards the end of the downward spiral , with grief , hate , and recrimination crowding what communication there was , someone came up with an idea that could only have appealed to people driven half mad .
That was to finally solve the co-ordination problem whose answer had eluded everyone up to and including the company ’s founders , by starting social evolution
all over again : to build a new planet in the image of the old home planet , and settle it with people whose genes had been reset to the default human baseline .
That meant , of course ,
dooming them and their offspring to death by deterioration within decades .
But when did such a consideration ever stop fanatics ?
And among the dwindling , desperate millions who remained in the orbiting wreckage and continuing welter , there were more than enough fanatics to be found .
Some of them still lived , in the doorways of huts .
Their offspring were no less fanatical , and more deluded .
They seemed to think the Civil Worlds awaited with interest the insights they ’d attained in a couple of short - lived generations of tribal warfare .
The men did , anyway .
The women were too busy in the vegetation patches and elsewhere to think about such matters .
“ The project had a certain elegance , ” mused the ship , as we discussed it far into the night .
“ To use evolution itself in an attempt to supercede it … And even if it didn ”t accomplish that , it could produce something new .
The trillions of human beings of the Civil Worlds are descended from a founding population of a few thousands , and are thus constrained by the founder effect .
Your extended lifespans further lock you in .
You live within biological and social limits that you are unable to see because of those very limits .
This experiment has the undoubted potential of reshuffling the deck . ”
“ Do n’t tell me why this was such a great idea ! ” I said .
“ Tell me what response you expect from the Civil Worlds . ”
“ Some variant of a fear response has a much higher probability than a compassionate response , ” said the ship .
“ This planetary experiment will be seen as an attempt to work around accidental but beneficial effects of the bottleneck humanity passed through in the Moon Caves , to emerge in polyarchy .
The probability of harm resulting from any genetic or memetic mutation that would enable the founding of successful states on a system - wide scale — or wider — is vastly greater than the benefits from the quality - adjusted life - years of the planet ’s population .
And simply to leave this planet alone would in the best case lay the basis
for a future catastrophe engulfing a much larger population , or , in the worst case , allow it to
become an interstellar power — which would , on the assumptions of most people , result in catastrophes on a yet greater scale .
The moral calculation is straightforward . ”
“ That ’s what I thought , ” I said .
“ And our moral calculation , I suppose , is to decide whether to report back . ”
“ That decision has been made , ” said the ship .
“ I left some micro-satellites in orbit , which have already relayed our discoveries to the still - functioning transmitters on the system ’s Long Station . ”
I cursed ineffectually for a while .
“ How long have we got ? ”
The ship took an uncharacteristic few seconds to answer .
“ That depends on where and when the decision is made .
The absolute minimum time is at least a decade , allowing for transmission time to Lalande , and assuming an immediate decision to launch relativistic weapons , using their Long Tubes as guns .
More realistic estimates , allowing for discussion , and the decision ’s being referred to one of the larger and more distant civilizations , give a median time of around five decades .
I would expect longer , given the gravity of the decision and the lack of urgency . ”
“ Right , ” I said .
“ Let ’s give them some reason for urgency .
You ’ve just reminded me that there ’s a Long Tube in this system , not calibrated to take or send to or from other Tubes . ”
“ I fail to see the relevance , ” said the ship .
“ You will , ” I told it .
“ You will . ”
The following morning , I walked back to the settlement , and talked with the young men for a long time .
When I returned to the ship , I was riding , most uncomfortably , on the
back of an animal .
I told the ship what I wanted .
The ship was outraged , but like all seedship
AIs , it was strongly constrained .
( Nobody wants to seed a system with a fast burn . )
The ship did what it was told .
Two years later , Belated Meteor Impact , the tall young man who ’d greeted me , was king of an area of several thousand square kilometers .
The seedship ’s bootstrapped nanofactories were turning substrate into weapons and tools , and vegetation cellulose into clothes and other goods for trade .

A mum - of - five who claimed she was gang raped by a group of teens who posted a video of the incident on YouTube has been arrested in connection with the incident .
In a shocking twist , the 24 - year - old currently living in temporary accommodation in south - west London with her partner and young children , was arrested on Friday on suspicion of having sex with a minor and perverting the course of justice .
She was subsequently bailed pending further inquiries and is due to return to the same police station later this month .
No charges will be brought against the three teens - two aged 16 and one aged 14 - who were arrested over the episode earlier this year .
The woman claimed the three youths spiked her drink and raped her repeatedly in a 14 - hour ordeal at her south London home last November .
But she did not report it to the police straightaway and claimed she was too scared to do so because the teenagers kept threatening her .
It was only a few months later , when a friend spotted the sickening three - minute clip of the incident on YouTube , that her partner encouraged her to report it to police .
The video had been posted on the site shortly after the episode took place and was seen by 600 people before it was removed by YouTube in February .
The footage shows the mum having sex with the teens , while she is seemingly unconscious .
Two of her children are heard crying in the background and at times the youths laugh into the camera .
But despite the horrific nature of the video , investigating police officers have questioned the woman 's version of events .
She could now be charged with having sex with a minor and perverting the course of justice .
Her children have also been placed on the Child Protection Register and she fears social services will take them away from her .
" I had no idea this would happen - I thought everything would be OK because I have told the truth , " she said .
" The police are turning it on me - it 's ridiculous .
I can't take much more .
Her partner of 10 years , and father of her children , added : " What 's happened is totally outrageous .
And we 've been forced to stay where we are living for seven weeks - it 's unacceptable .
" We 've done nothing wrong and we 're the ones suffering . "
A police spokesman confirmed the woman had been arrested and bailed and the teens are unlikely to face charges .

Ron Paul Questions Ben Bernanke during the Joint Economic Committee hearings on April 2nd 2008
The cumulative effect of these partisan differences is enormous .
If the pattern of income growth under postwar Republican presidents had matched the pattern under Democrats , incomes would be more equal now than they were in 1950  a far cry from the contemporary reality of what some observers are calling a New Gilded Age .

It might be tempting to suppose that these partisan differences in income growth are a coincidence of timing , merely reflecting the fact that Republicans held the White House through most of the past three decades of slow , unequal growth .
The partisan pattern , however , is remarkably consistent throughout the postwar period .
Every Republican president since Dwight Eisenhower presided over increasing economic inequality , while only one Democrat  Jimmy Carter  did so .
( I allow one year for each president ’s economic policies to take effect , so the recession of 2001 is counted against Clinton , not Bush . )
If middle - class and poor people do so much better under Democratic presidents than under Republican presidents , why do so many of them vote for Republicans ?
One popular answer , advanced by Thomas Frank and others , is that they are alienated by Democratic liberalism on cultural issues like abortion , gay marriage and gender roles .
This does not appear to be the case .
In recent presidential elections , affluent voters , who tend to be liberal on cultural matters , are about twice as likely as middle - class and poor voters to make their decisions on the basis of their cultural concerns .
A better explanation for Republican electoral successes may be that while most voters , rich and poor alike , do vote with their economic interests in mind , they construe those interests in a curiously myopic way .
Their choices at the polls are strongly influenced by election - year income growth but only weakly related to economic performance earlier in the president ’s term .
And while Republicans have presided over dismal income growth for middle - class and poor families in most years , they have , remarkably enough , produced robust growth in election years .
Why have Republican administrations typically presided over strong election - year growth ?
The pattern probably reflects the fact that presidents have more clout early in their terms than at election time .
Republicans have often used that clout to rein in inflation and social spending , producing or prolonging economic contractions that then wear off by the time of the next election .
New or newly re-elected Democrats , for their part , have frequently stimulated the economy and expanded employment , producing economic booms that raise all boats in their second and third years but trail off as the next election approaches .
As a result , even working - poor families have experienced stronger income growth under Republicans ( 1.8 percent ) than under Democrats ( 1 percent ) in election years .

Bush dials back Watergate - era reforms on spying safeguards Nick Juliano

Print This Email This Executive order weakens intelligence oversight board A little - noticed executive order President Bush signed last month dials back checks on the Intelligence Community that have been in place since revelations that spy agencies abused their power in the 1960s and 70s .
The Boston Globe 's Charlie Savage , who is among the top reporters uncovering Bush administration secrecy , shines some light on the new order and its implications in an article Friday .
Almost 32 years to the day after President Ford created an independent Intelligence Oversight Board made up of private citizens with top - level clearances to ferret out illegal spying activities , President Bush issued an executive order that stripped the board of much of its authority .
[...]
The board 's investigations and reports have been mostly kept secret .
But the Clinton administration provided a rare window into the panel 's capabilities in 1996 by publishing a board report faulting the CIA for not adequately informing Congress about putting known torturers and killers in Guatemala on its payroll .
But Bush downsized the board 's mandate to be an aggressive watchdog against such problems in an executive order issued on Feb. 29 , the eve of the anniversary of the day Ford 's order took effect .
The White House said the timing of the new order was " purely coincidental . "
Under the old rules , whenever the oversight board learned of intelligence activity that it believed might be " unlawful or contrary to executive order , " it had a duty to notify both the president and the attorney general .
But Bush 's order deleted the board 's authority to refer matters to the Justice Department for a criminal investigation , and the new order said the board should notify the president only if other officials are not already " adequately " addressing the problem .
Bush 's order also terminated the board 's authority to oversee each intelligence agency 's general counsel and inspector general , and it erased a requirement that each inspector general file a report with the board every three months .
Now only the agency directors will decide whether to report any potential lawbreaking to the panel , and they have no schedule for checking in .
President Ford created the independent board in 1976 to blunt Congressional calls for additional legislative checks on the Intelligence Community .
A White House spokesman denied Bush 's order reduced the board 's authority .
Bush 's executive order was crafted as the president continues to press Congress to update the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
FISA was passed in 1978 to rein in freewheeling surveillance of Americans by US spy agencies ; debate over how to update the law has been fierce since revelations that the president authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on Americans without warrants .
The House is set to vote today on a FISA update that does not include Bush 's key demand -- retroactive immunity for telecommunications programs that participated in what critics say was an illegal program .
Such immunity would scuttle ongoing judicial oversight by dismissing dozens of lawsuits aiming to determine what the president authorized and whether laws were broken .
Before effectively rendering toothless the three - decade - old intelligence oversight board , Bush last month also gutted a Privacy & Civil Liberties Oversight Board that was created in 2004 based on recommendations from the 9/11 commission .

BBC Radio 4
Ilse Roemer in 1940
But then her father told her that the cries of " Sieg Heil " were a signal for the Nazis " to start hunting the Jews " .
She had barely been aware of her Jewishness before .
" Nobody ever asked if I was Jewish , " she recalls .
Now everything changed .
She went to a cafe with her best friend , whose father was an ardent Nazi .
Suddenly Hitler 's voice came on the radio as he spoke euphorically of his Austrian homeland 's absorption into the Third Reich .
I did n't have the feeling that Austria was guilty but that many individuals had been guilty
Gabriele Matzner , Austrian ambassador to UK
The waiter insisted that everyone stand and raise their right arms in the Hitler salute .
Her friend told her to do likewise .
" It was the last time I went to a cafe because it was unbearable that I had to greet the Fuehrer , " she says .
The 70th anniversary of the Anschluss this month will be sombre and low key .
It is still a deeply troubling episode for Austrians , who grew up in post - war decades with the idea that they were victims of Nazism , not its supporters .
Homes taken over
The wartime Allies against Hitler first encouraged the idea , hoping to stimulate Austrian resistance .
And it provided a comforting myth for post - war Austria , masking a frequent refusal to face up to what had really happened .
Ilse Roemer managed to escape in 1938 as a refugee to Britain , where she worked as a nanny in Yorkshire .
Ilse Aschner in 2007
Her parents were less fortunate , prevented from crossing the German - Dutch border as war broke out in 1939 , and murdered in a concentration camp a few years later .
After the war , Ilse , now married with a baby and named Aschner , returned to Vienna to reclaim her family 's substantial flat .
It had been " Aryanised " - given to a loyal Nazi family .
Her ownership claim , backed with documents , was dismissed by the local authorities , who scolded her for trying to " throw people out on the street " .
Wall of silence
The guilty past was either wilfully ignored , or proved too painful to face .
Gabriele Matzner , a historian born in 1945 and today 's Austrian ambassador to Britain , says : " I did n't have the feeling that Austria was guilty , but that many individuals had been guilty . "
Her own family was divided between those who had resisted Nazism and those who had prospered under it .
Many people , in family life and in politics , preferred silence .
That was broken in 1986 when former UN Secretary General Kurt Waldheim , standing for election as president of Austria , was shown to have concealed wartime service in a German army unit which had been involved in war crimes .
Waldheim was never linked directly to such crimes , and was elected president .
But he was shunned by much of the outside world , and his repeated claim - that he had simply been " doing his duty " during the war - became less and less acceptable .
Slowly but steadily , debate has opened up .
Belated recognition
A significant gesture came last autumn when Franz Jaegerstaetter , an Austrian farmer executed in 1943 in Berlin for his refusal on religious grounds to fight for the German army , was beatified by the Catholic Church .
Franz Jaegerstaetter refused to fight for Germany
His home village near Salzburg embodies the Nazi period 's lasting division of Austrian society .
Some villagers opposed the Nazis but were betrayed by the village midwife , a Gestapo agent .
Jaegerstaetter 's widow , Franziska , who is in her 90s , still lives there .
She remembers that many villagers " were not good to me " during and after the war , as they felt her husband 's actions had undermined the dutiful war service of local men .
Her husband 's beatification last October has offered satisfying , if very late , recognition of the price her family paid .
But progress remains patchy towards restitution for all those , like Ilse Aschner , whose family property was stolen under Nazi rule .
Decades - long wait
Multi-million dollar funds have been established by the Austrian government , paying out limited amounts to claimants after often long and painstaking investigations .
Some claimants die of old age before they receive anything .
This is Austria - here things take a little bit longer
Ilse Aschner
Hannah Lessing , whose father was Jewish , runs the restitution funds on behalf of the government in Vienna .
She admits the frustrations , but says her enthusiastic staff prove " there is a young generation that is willing to do it differently " .
Meanwhile Ilse Aschner , who grew up in pre-Anschluss Vienna in her parents ' smart flat , now lives aged 89 in a council flat up several flights of stairs with no lift .
She has received a few modest payments in compensation , and is waiting for more .
She sometimes walks past the old family flat , sees its current owners looking out of the windows " and I know that those were our windows .
It 's hard , but that 's it " .
Asked why compensation , first applied for in 1946 , has taken so long , she laughs ruefully and replies : " This is Austria , here things take a little bit longer " .

Al - Qaeda Dismisses Conspiracy Theories , Defends Israel , Attacks Iran and Hizbollah .
They encourage ignorance of history by repression of truth and critical thinking , obedience , fear and paranoia by disinformation and hoax through the staged events .
First , they need to subdue Spanish Empire by staging the sinking of USS Maine in the Havana Harbor to start Spanish - American War .
Second , they need to destroy RMS Lusitania by baiting the German military to attack the British luxury ocean liner ship that prompted U.S. to declare war on Germany and enter WWI .
Third , they goaded Japan -- by withholding crucial oil and materials and freezing assets needed to fuel Japanese war machine in its attempted conquest of Asia -- to attack Pearl Harbor that prompted U.S. to declare war on the Axis and enter WWII .
Fourth , they fabricated the Gulf of Tonkin incident that prompted U.S. to escalate its war operation in the Southeastern Asia region of Indochina to justify the protracted " sustained war " with Vietnam ( and invade subsequent neighboring nations Laos & Cambodia ) .
Fifth , they lied to Saddam Hussein about the claim of American neutrality towards Saddam 's dispute with Kuwait over border - crossing underground oil ' theft ' .
Saddam perceived American view as the green light to invade Kuwait .
Saddam was a useful ally from the 60's on as the CIA asset to Iran - Iraq war until the 1990 invasion .
U.S. need a new opportunity to demonstrate its strength in military and technology superiority and they baited Saddam into the trap which even Saddam could not extricate with offer of ceasing operation which U.S. rejected ( and they did again with his offer of exile on condition of $ 1 billion reception before 2003 U.S. invasion ) .
Between the end of WWII and late 1991 , U.S. continued the fear - mongering Red Scare campaign on the danger of Communism through media propaganda , most prominently the since - dissolved U.S.S.R.
Cuban Missile Crisis was one of the points of high tension on the razor edge of a total war between the two superpowers .
After Soviet Union 's ill - logical and disastrous invasion of Afghanistan , the propaganda on the side of the U.S. heightened .
CIA assisted in the war on the Soviet invaders by training and arming the Afghans .
After USSR collapsed , U.S. was left without the " ultimate " enemy to wage the war on , low - intensity or overt , which meant the dwindled material supports and profits of the military - industry - Congressional complex .
Imperial Empire ( Spanish - German ) , Axis Fascism and Communism - the first two abolished and now Communism is subdued with the collapse of USSR which left Russia economically and militarily weakened .
This left the U.S. as the sole superpower on Earth .
But the collapse of USSR ended the Cold War between the East and the West .
The closure of Cold War may give U.S. the spoil of victory , but its appetite remain insatiable favoring " perpetual war for perpetual peace " in the name of U.S. military - economic prowess , geopolitical hegemony and profiteering through lucrative defense contracting with the Pentagon and the manufacturers & developers of advanced military technology .
They need the new enemy .
They chose , through the intelligence services of CIA , MI - 6 and MOSSAD , to create Al - Qaeda as the front for false flag terrorist activities .
This is the solution in their indulgent desire to alleviate the psychological emptiness of peace in order to induce violence & terror that provide the cause for taxpayer funding ( to the tune of several trillion dollars , including long - term post - invasion occupation of Iraq & Afghanistan ) to develop the strength and readiness of the military by purchasing hardware and fuel and exercise to prepare for overwhelming attack to maximize the acquisition of victories to effect radical geopolitical alternations , for the benefit of U.S. and her allies Great Britain & Israel .
Enter the Neoconservative faction in the mid-1990's , whose influence was minimal until the fraudulent ( s) election of Bush - Cheney in 2000 .
They helped devise the policy that lays out the plan of what U.S. can and must do to realize its full potential of the superpower status by exercising ( with unrestrained vigor in the lust for glory ) the military - economic domination of the civilized world .
With Al - Qaeda as the frankensteined goblin of the world brought to consciousness by media propaganda with the bombing attacks of World Trade Center in 1993 , U.S. embassies in Tazania and Kenya , Africa in 1998 , Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia in 1996 and USS Cole in Yemen in 2000 , et cetera , they need the large - scale terror attack on a single day to press the indelible impression on the U.S. and the world uninformed of the great deceit .
September 11 , 2001 .
Neocon proponents -- too many to count here ; some prominent members include Dick Cheney ( assumed control from the emergency bunker that fateful day as well as managing the secretive group Energy Task Force ) , Donald Rumsfeld , Paul Wolfowitz ( architect of Iraq war ) , Dov Zakheim ( 2.3 + trillion heist as comptroller of the Pentagon preceding 9 - 11 ) , Richard Perle and Douglas Feith ( the co-authors of " A Clean Break " , a 1996 policy essay for Israeli government ) , John Bolton , William Kristol and his father Irving and Commentary editor Norman Podhoretz -- rejoiced with perverse applause at the horrific atrocity of 9 - 11 , because it meant their neoconservative vision - as laid out in the manifesto of Project for the New American Century that calls on the U.S. government to assume the domination of the Earth militarily , economically and morally - will come to fruition beginning with the invasion of Afghanistan ( to control Caspian oil , re-establish opium poppy crop farming to reinvigorate international heroin trade and install the puppet regime after eradicating the previously CIA & ISI - supported Taliban ) and culminating with the radical transformation of the entire Middle East and Central Asia after conquering Iraq , Iran , Syria , Lebanon , Libya and Somalia , in no particular order .
And possibly more ' stubborn , independently sovereign ' countries that U.S. wants to overthrow to establish the international economic hegemony concentrated in the controlling hands of European - American Zionist elite for absolute power and pure greed , as the 1997 Asian collapse [ history ] demonstrate what Western financial terrorist imperialists are capable of in their conspiracy to impoverish sovereign Asian powers and offer the solution by way of IMF and World Bank in vulture funds .
And the question is - which nation , besides the U.S. , stand to benefit in magnificent gains from the fabricated " war on terror " to force change in the region partially hostile to Western imperialism after Iranian revolution and the collapse of U.S.S.R.?
Israel .
What do Israel want in greatly substantial gain , besides subduing the " existential threat " in the hostile neighboring nations by the exceptional aptitude of U.S. military power at the behest of the treasonous Commander - in - Chief and the Pentagon in Zionist - occupied U.S. government that sacrifice American military servicepeople for a belligerent foreign power which emphasize the spread of global Zionist influence to ensure her survival by means of financial usurpation , psychological terrorism and propaganda ?
Re-drawn borders [ article ] in a massive land grab and Israel 's increased power wielded as the de facto hegemony of the Middle East - Central Asia region , with the concentration of wealth ( capital and U.S. - European tax - subsidized foreign aid ) and intellectual , political , military and psychosocially ethnocentric expertises combined to form -
Greater Israel .
I predict with absolute certainty the very existence of the illegitimate Zionist regime of Israel - since her creation by declaration of independence on May 14 , 1948 - will be the cause of World War III .
The beginning of this future and yet most destructive great war traces to the Mossad - CIA coordinated assassination of President John F. Kennedy ( who opposed Israel 's then - secret nuclear proliferation as security assurance to counterattack aggressive Arab nations in the future conflict ) which in turn caused American foreign policy to re-align and lock with Israel , regardless of America 's natural self - interests and Founding Fathers ' warning against entangling alliance with despotic foreign powers .
Israel depends on the U.S. for massively generous foreign aid in conjunction with the supplemental cargoes of fossil fuel and military hardware .
Israel is the functioning Frankenstein monster , partially because of Uncle Sam 's nurturing and support of her from its infancy founded on terrorism of Palestinian and British people ( April 1948 Deir Yassin massacre , July 1946 Hotel King David bombing attack ) to its now - emerging adulthood as the premier terrorist state that essentially usurped the significant sectors of the U.S. government through the employment of Zionist moles and pressure arms of AIPAC and other US - based Zionist organizations ( ZOA , JINSA , ADL and JDL ) .
Israel is the greatest mortal enemy of the civilized world , because its existence threatens to drag the world down with it through the deployment of nuclear weapons for strategic or suicidal attacks and other methods of terror warfare when Israel 's defeat is viewed to be a certainty .
This is why Zionism must be vanquished for the good of humankind , and U.S. must rid itself of this parasitic disease .
U.S. must emphasize peace and goodwill as the moral necessity to stabilize the world peace , but it must begin this tremendous responsibility by abolishing the CIA , outlawing certainly influential think tanks that promote subversion of American sovereignty such as Council on Foreign Relations and reforming the Pentagon ( abolish Office of Special Plans ) and establishing relations with hostile nations by lifting trade sanctions to quell bitter attitudes .
Alas , it is impossible because the ruling Elite , in cooperation with Zionists , do everything in their power to control the financial and political power of America because of the polluting influence of corporate media which encourage the ignorance and apathy of the People , which assure the concentrated power is permanent with the managed electoral process of the presidential candidates to uphold status quo and assure almost - complete subservience to Israel and to an equal degree the corrupt theo - autocracy of Saudi kingdom for its access to seemingly - infinite oil product needed to fuel not only the national economy but also the military war machines to continue the conquest of the world until the goal is complete , regardless of its demandingly ambitious feasibility in achieving the megalomaniacal fantasy of global supremacism that the previous empires thrived to attain yet fell short of the goal due to the catastrophic costs of sustaining rapid expansionism and war which ultimately led to the decline and fall of the empires .
The United States , judging its irreversible expansionist policy by conquest in unwinnable & protracted wars and economic difficulties of stabilizing the declining US Dollar value , building gigantic credit bubble owing to Federal Reserve 's corrupt practice of monetized debt in lending and other crises , is destined to follow the footstep of the tragedy .
The American Empire is its last throes , partly because of the corrupt Washington and New York body politics insisting on continuing the uselessly depleting wars & looting the treasure by fleecing taxpayers in increasing credit debt and partly because of its pathetic entanglement with State of Israel and Saudi kingdom as the two - headed parasite that have triumphed the Founding Fathers ' ages - old wisdom never to engage in permanent alliances provenly detrimental to the socioeconomic life and national security of the Republic .

I know that I seem to be more of child bearing age than cancer producing age , and I know that my newly flat chest due to a recent double mastectomy makes my belly protrude and makes me look preggers .
I 'm not .
I know also that , despite eating healthfully and exercising a ton , the roids and the hormone therapy I 've had the pleasure to experience are to thank for the nice round tummy growing before my eyes .
Hell , even I tend to think I look pregnant .
But I 'm not .
Yes , I realize too that I tend to wear a lot of empire waist and babydoll dresses these days , further adding to the " pregnant look " .
but frankly , since most of my pants hide in fear when I approach them in the closet , these dresses are a much better option .
I'm flattered that maybe you think I'm " glowing " .
I guess 25 rounds of radiation will do that .
But please , PLEASE , unless you see my water breaking , do n't ask me " Is it a boy or a girl ? " .
Um , it 's tamoxifen , thanks for asking .
I do n't want to have to blurt out the truth any more than you want to hear it .
But frankly , I 'm tired of trying to make you feel better about your dumb mistake .
Now , I just answer , " NOPE .
It 's cancer .
Bellies look bigger when you 've had your breasts removed . "
Sorry .
I know you 're probably driving home feeling stupid .
Good .
And of course , the irony that you 'll never know , is that I probably wo n't EVER be pregnant , thanks to all this lovely crap .
Do n't you know that you never , unless you 're absolutely sure , ask a woman if she 's pregnant ?
You just do n't .
Ok , maybe if she 's got her legs up in the air , is panting like a race horse , and someone with a surgical mask is yelling " PUSH " at her .
But even then , you should really be sure before you ask .
And for god 's sake , please , please PLEASE do n't pat my belly .
It 's just fat and it 's really embarassing when you do that .
So unless you literally see a baby 's head poking out of my vagina , please stop asking me if I 'm pregnant .
I kicked cancer 's ass .
I can certainly kick yours .
Thanks .
PS - To be fair , I should mention that I am somewhat flattered that people think I might actually be having sex .
It all started with Sting , this fad for owning one 's very own patch of tropical rainforest , though it is probably unfair to blame him entirely for creating the boom industry that buying up forests piecemeal has become .
It is 20 years since the musician first set foot in Brazil and pledged to fight the cause of the Yanomami Indians , setting up the Rainforest Foundation to protect forests and their indigenous inhabitants .
Today , protecting forests has acquired a more international purpose .
Climate change , rather than assuring the livelihoods of local people , has become the issue .
Celebrities and politicians , and many others just in search of a quick buck , are falling over each other to advocate plant - a- tree conservationism as a salve to global warming .

Sienna Miller , Tony Blair , Josh Hartnett , Desmond Tutu and Prince Charles all endorse Global Cool , an initiative that encourages individuals to reduce their carbon emissions by , among other things , buying a " tonne of cool " .
David Cameron has proudly owned up to offsetting any flights he takes by making a donation to Climate Care , which calculates the cost of the carbon your flight has pumped out and does good stuff , like planting trees , to right the wrong .
Sir David Attenborough is a patron of the World Land Trust , which is currently offering to " save a whole acre in perpetuity " , for just £ 50 .
However , critics say that there can be no ultimate guarantee of the future of any piece of land .
The wealthy financier Johan Eliasch , who advises Gordon Brown on deforestation and green energy , provoked the ire of the Brazilian government with his purchase , in 2006 , of 400,000 acres of Amazon rainforest .
" The Amazon is not for sale , " said the Brazilian President , Lula da Silva .
Eliasch then joined forces with Frank Field MP , and launched a grand tree - buying plan called Cool Earth late last year .
Cool Earth stresses that it " leases " rather than buys land , to keep it safe from eager logging companies .
Its website explains that saving one acre of endangered rainforest keeps 260 tonnes of carbon safely " locked up " within the forest itself , unable to escape and pollute the atmosphere .
Whoever owns the land or the trees , this method of " capturing " or " locking " carbon into forests is not going to have the knock - on effect of saving the planet .
Cool Earth does not claim explicitly to be in the offsetting game , but the carbon that it claims can be " locked up " in one acre of forest would offset 30 round - trips to Rio de Janeiro , say .
For the environmental groups Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth , this forestry offsetting craze is acting as a smokescreen , and detracting from real solutions to escalating emissions .
" Taking a dodgy accounting proposition , which is that you can somehow identify the amount of carbon that any given new bit of forest picks up out of the atmosphere and sequesters , and make that correspond somehow to emissions elsewhere , " is how Greenpeace sees carbon offsetting , according to its senior climate adviser Charlie Kronick .
" It ca n't be done .
The methodology is poor , and the logic is n't very good either .
Once the carbon you 've put in from fossil fuels is up there , nothing is going to make it go away . "
Friends of the Earth 's Marie Reynolds points out that not only is offsetting no substitute for real emissions cuts , but there is no guarantee , when you plant a tree , what the future of that tree will be .
Robin Oakley , Greenpeace 's climate and energy campaigner , agrees : " The issue with offsetting is that , fundamentally , it does n't undo the damage done by carbon pollution .
The vast number of players in the offsetting market are not reducing emissions in any accountable or measurable way . "
In some cases , local people , far from benefiting , suffer when huge new plantations spring up .
Survival International campaigner David Hill says : " Numerous reports show how indigenous peoples have suffered as a result of carbon projects : invasion of their land , evictions , the destruction of villages and crops , reduced access to or destruction of traditional resources , and violent conflict . "
Offsetting is popular because it makes people feel much better about taking long - haul flights or driving gas - guzzling vehicles .
" They are being misled , " says Oakley .
" Most carbon offsetting companies are making a killing . "
Climate Care , the company David Cameron pays his green - guilt tax to , has recently been bought by the investment bank J P Morgan .
In the credit - crunch climate , any new acquisitions are thought through very carefully , and only the most watertight pass muster .
This move suggests that carbon offsetting is currently considered one of the most risk - free industries around .
Very few not - for - profit offsetting companies exist .
Myclimate is one , and only uses " Gold Standard " offsets , a strict set of criteria for measuring where the money is going , drawn up by a number of international campaigning organisations .
Since last year 's conference in Bali to discuss how to take climate - change proposals past the Kyoto Protocol agreement , the Environment Secretary Hilary Benn has been working on a certification system to keep carbon cowboys out of the market .
Redd – reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation – is the UN 's proposed trading mechanism , which aims to pay countries not to cut down their forests .
" Turning the forest into just another commodity is not going to protect the climate or the lives of the people who live there , " says Kronick .
Surprisingly , perhaps , Greenpeace is in favour of extracting value from forests in other ways , such as the deal that was recently hammered out between Guyana and Canopy Capital , a group of British financiers to protect the Iwokrama Forest last week .
The Independent first reported a plea from the Guyanan President , Bharrat Jagdeo , last November , to structure exactly this type of deal for all of Guyana 's forests .
Michael Woods , a partner in the law firm Stephenson Harwood and head of its environment department , oversaw the deal .
" It focuses on eco-systems services and the value a forest provides , " he explains .
" Rainfall is the best example .
Without the trees , the eco-system will not produce the rainfall that then benefits other parts of South America , even as far as the American Midwest .
It 's a global utility service on which agriculture relies , and its value should be recognised . "
However , this sort of protectoral behaviour , especially when overseen by foreign advisers , provokes worried disapproval from many green corners , giving rise to cries of neo- or eco-colonialism .
" If there 's going to be financial compensation for eco-systems services , which recognises that they provide a service other than locking up carbon , it should be for the people who live in those forests , " says Kronick .
" How do they get a share of the proceeds ?
How do you preserve national sovereignty , so that under the banner of climate change it does n't become a kind of eco-colonialism ? "
" This is not about buying land or trees , " says Andrew Mitchell , a director of Canopy Capital and an experienced conservationist .
" It is about trying to put a new value on forests for countries such as Guyana that are not destroying their forests .
We need a new economic paradigm that values them , so that there 's more of an incentive to leave them standing than cutting them down . "
This sort of deal is in its infancy .
It is described by climate - change specialists as " avoided deforestation " , and similar projects should be rolled out in the next phase of the Kyoto Protocol .
Other countries are already envious of Guyana 's pioneering deal .
Indonesia , Brazil , Papua New Guinea and the Democratic Republic of Congo would all benefit massively from similar arrangements .
Despite the potential quagmires over forest ownership , Greenpeace is in favour , because safe - guarding a forest , as well as ensuring the livelihoods of its inhabitants , has a real effect on climate change .
" It is like sticking a cork in an industrial process , " says Kronick .
" It is taking one of the sources of climate change – deforestation accounts for up to 30 per cent of total carbon emissions in the atmosphere – and removing it .
" It must be a part of whatever solutions we come up with for climate change .
Protecting forests is one of the smartest things that we can do . "
Alternatives to offsetting
The people who live in forests are the first to be hit by their destruction .
Survival International and the Forest Peoples Programme help indigenous communities to protect their rights to manage and control their own habitat .
www.survival-international.org www.forestpeoples.org
Rather than " buying your cool " ( carbon emissions ) back from suspect sources , Global Cool has suggestions for reducing emissions in real terms : turn the heating down ; switch appliances off at the mains ; use an energy supplier that invests in renewables
www.globalcool.org
Do n't forget that conserving forests ( as long as they 're not ring - fenced and the local people pushed out ) is a good thing , and lots of organisations who have jumped on the offsetting bandwagon started out in straightforward conservation .
The Woodland Trust estimates that , for a £ 2.75 monthly membership fee , it can " protect and care for " half an acre of native woodland .
They wo n't sell you areas of woodland , but you can have spaces dedicated to a loved one .
As there is no major problem with deforestation in the UK , this saves ancient woodland , but it wo n't stop climate change .
www.woodland-trust.org.uk
You could still pay for offsets , but check you are giving your money to a not - for - profit organisation that is selling Gold Standard carbon offsets , such as myclimate .
Do n't expect your money to save trees ; most of the Gold Standard projects involve switching communities from fossil fuel to other types of power .

Virgin Media CEO
Neil Berkett has attacked the principle of net neutrality , whereby internet service providers do not interfere with or degrade the speed at which content is delivered from websites to consumers , branding it as " b**** cks " .
Berkett 's cable operator ranks as the second largest internet service provider in the UK with approximately 3.6 m customers .
In an interview with the Royal Television Society 's Television magazine , Berkett said that " this net neutrality thing is a load of b**** cks " , and revealed that Virgin is already in talks with unnamed content providers about paying to have their content delivered faster than others .
Feeding into the debate between internet service providers and the BBC over iPlayer , Berkett even warned that public service broadcasters who choose not to pay for faster access to Virgin 's subscriber base would end up in " bus lanes " , effectively having their content delivered to consumers at a lower speed .
Thus far , Ofcom has made little comment on the network neutrality debate .
In 2007 , long before the current iPlayer discussions , the then Ofcom policy chief Douglas Scott indicated that the regulator planned a " hands off " approach to the issue .
Scott has since departed the regulator for Channel 4 .

Lazy square roots of power series
Lately for various reasons I have been investigating the differential equation : $ $ ( f( x ) ) ^2 + ( f '( x ) ) ^2 = 1 $ $ where !!f '!! is the derivative of !!f!!.
This equation has a couple of obvious solutions ( !! f( x ) = 1 !! ; !! f( x ) = \ sin( x ) !! ) and a bunch of not - so - obvious ones .
Since I could n't solve the equation symbolically , I decided to fall back on power series .
Representing !!f( x ) !! as !!a_0 + a_1 x + a_ 2x ^2 + \ldots !! , one can manipulate the power series and solve for !!a_0 , a_1 , a_2 !! , etc .
In fact , this is exactly the application for which mathematicians first became intersted in power series .
The big question is " once you have found !!a_0 , a_1 !! , etc. , do these values correspond to a real function ?
And for what !!x!!
does the power series expression actually make sense ? "
This question , springing from a desire to solve intractable differential equations , motivates a lot of the theoretical mathematics of the last hundred and fifty years .
Order
Higher - Order Perl
from Powell 's Higher - Order Perl to calculate !!a_0 !! , etc .
So far , not yet , although I am getting closer .
The key is that if $ series is the series you want , and if you can calculate at least one term at the front of the series , and then express the rest of $ series in terms of $ series , you win .
For example : # Perl my $ series ; $ series = node ( 1 , promise { scale ( 2 , $ series ) } ) ;
This is perfectly well - defined code ; it runs fine and sets $ series to be the series !![ 1,2,4,8,16 ... ] !!.
In Haskell this is standard operating procedure : -- Haskell series = 1 : scale 2 series
But in Perl it 's still a bit outré .
Similarly , the book shows , on page 323 , how to calculate the reciprocal of a series !!s!!.
Any series can be expressed as the sum of the first term and the rest of the terms : $ $s = s_H + xs_T $ $
Now suppose that !!r=\frac1s !!. $ $ r = r_H + xr_T$ $
We have : $ $ \begin{array}{rcl} rs & = & 1 \\ ( r_H + xr_T ) ( s_H+xs_T ) & = & 1 \\ r_Hs_H + xr_Hs_T + xr_Ts_H + x ^2r_Ts_T & = & 1 \end{array} $ $ Equating the constant terms on both sides gives !!r_Hs_H=1 !! , so !!r_H = \ frac1{s_H} !!.
Then equating the non-constant terms gives : $ $\begin{array}{rcl} xr_Hs_T + xr_Ts_H + x ^2r_Ts_T & = & 0 \\ x\frac1{s_H}s_T + xr_Ts_H + x ^2r_Ts_T & = & 0 \\ \ frac1{s_H}s_T + r_Ts_H + xr_Ts_T & = & 0 \\ r_T & = & \ frac{ -\frac1{s_H}s_T}{s_H+xs_T} \\ r_T & = & \frac{ -\frac1{s_H}s_T}s \\ r_T & = & {- \frac1{s_H}s_T}r \end{array} $ $ and we win .
This same calculation appears on page 323 , in a somewhat more confused form .
( Also , I considered only the special case where !!
s_H = 1 !!.)
The code works just fine .
To solve the differential equation !!
f^2 + ( f ' ) ^2 = 1 !! , I want to do something like this : $ $f = \sqrt { 1 - { ( f ' ) } ^ { 2}} $ $ so I need to be able to take the square root of a power series .
This does not appear in the book , and I have not seen it elsewhere .
Here it is .
Say we want !!r^2 = s !! , where !!s!!
is known .
Then write , as usual : $ $ \begin{array}{rcl} s &=& \operatorname{head} ( s ) + x·\operatorname{tail}(s ) \\ r &=& \operatorname{head} ( r ) + x·\operatorname{tail} (r ) \\ \end{array} $ $ as before , and , since !!r^ 2 = s !! , we have : $ $ ( \operatorname{head} ( r ) ) ^2 + 2x \operatorname{head}(r ) \operatorname{tail} ( r ) + x ^2(\operatorname{tail}(r ) ) ^2 = \operatorname{head}(s ) + x·\operatorname{tail}(s ) $ $ so , equating coefficients on both sides , !!( \operatorname{head} ( r ) ) ^2 = \operatorname{head}(s ) !! , and !!\operatorname{head} (r ) = \ sqrt{\operatorname{head}(s ) } !!.
Subtracting the !!\operatorname{head}(s ) !!
from both sides , and dividing by !!x!! : $ $ \begin{array}{rcl} 2\operatorname{head}(r ) \operatorname{tail} (r ) + x·( \operatorname{tail}(r ) ) ^2 &=& \operatorname{tail}(s ) \\ \operatorname{tail} ( r ) · ( 2·\operatorname{head} ( r ) + x·\operatorname{tail}(r ) ) &=& \operatorname{tail} (s ) \\ \operatorname{tail} ( r ) ·( \operatorname{head} ( r ) + r ) &=& \operatorname{tail} (s ) \\ \operatorname{tail} ( r ) &=& \ frac{\operatorname{tail}(s)}{\operatorname{head} (r ) + r} \end{array} $ $ and we win .
Or rather , we win once we write the code , which would be something like this : # Perl sub series_sqrt { my $s = shift ; my ( $ s0 , $ st ) = ( head ( $s ) , tail ( $s ) ) ; my $ r0 = sqrt ( $ s0 ) ; my $ r ; $r = node ( $ r0 , promise { divide ( $ st , add2 ( node ( $ r0 , undef ) , $ r ) ) } ) ; return $ r ; } I confess I have n't tried this in Perl yet , but I have high confidence that it will work .
I actually did the implementation in Haskell : -- Haskell series_sqrt ( s0:st ) = r where r = r0 : ( divide st ( add [ r0 ] r ) ) r0 = sqrt( s0 )
And when I asked it for the square root of !!
[ 1,1,0,0,0 , \ldots ] !!
( that is , of !!1+x !! ) it gave me back !![ 1 , 0.5 , - 0.125 , - 0.0625 , \ldots ] !! , which is indeed correct .
The Perl code is skankier than I wish it were .
A couple of years ago I said in an interview that " I wish Perl 's syntax were less verbose . "
Some people were surprised by this at the time , since Perl programmers consider Perl 's syntax to be quite terse .
But comparison of the Perl and Haskell code above demonstrates the sort of thing I mean .
Part of ths issue here , of course , is that the lazy list data structure is built in to Haskell , but I have to do it synthetically in Perl , and so every construction of a lazy list structure in Perl is accompanied by a syntactic marker ( such as node ( ... ) or promise { ... } ) that is absent , or nearly absent , from the Haskell .
But when I complained about Perl 's verbose syntax in 2005 , one thing I had specifically in mind was Perl 's argument acquisition syntax , here represented by my $s = shift ; .
Haskell is much terser , with no loss of expressiveness .
Haskell gets another win in the automatic destructuring bind : instead of explicitly calling head ( ) and tail ( ) to acquire the values of s0 and st , as in the Perl code , they are implicitly called by the pattern match ( s0:st ) in the Haskell code , which never mentions s at all .
It is quite fair to ascribe this to a failure of Perl 's syntax , since there 's no reason in principle why Perl could n't support this , at least for built - in data structures .
For example , consider the Perl code : sub blah { my $ href = shift ( ) ; my $ a = $ href - >{ this} ; my $ tmp = $ href - >{ that} ; my $b = $ tmp - > [ 0 ] ; my $c = $ tmp - > [ 2 ] ; #
Now do something with $ a , $b , $c } It would be much more convenient to write this as : sub blah { my { this => $ a , that => [ $b , undef , $ c ] } = shift ( ) ; #
Now do something with $ a , $b , $c } This is a lot easier to understand .
There are a number of interesting user - interface issues to ask about here :
What if the assigned value is not in the expected form ?
Are $ a , $ b , and $c copied from $ href or are they aliases into it ?
And so on .
One easy way to dispense with all of these interesting questions ( perhaps not in the best way ) is to assert that this notation is just syntactic sugar for the long version .
I talked to Chip Salzenberg about this at one time , and he said he thought it would not be very hard to implement .
But even if he was right , what is not very hard for Chip Salzenberg to do can turn out to be nearly impossible for us mortals .
[ Addendum 20071209 : There 's a followup article that shows several different ways of solving the differential equation , including the power - series method . ] [ Addendum 20071210 : I did figure out how to get Haskell to solve the differential equation . ]

The spring before his wife began her White House campaign , former President Bill Clinton earned $ 700,000 for his foundation by selling stock that he had been given from an Internet search company that was co-founded by a convicted felon and backed by the Chinese government , public records show .
Mr. Clinton had gotten the nonpublicly traded stock from Accoona Corp. back in 2004 as a gift for giving a speech at a company event .
He landed the windfall by selling the 200,000 shares to an undisclosed buyer in May 2006 , commanding $ 3.50 a share at a time when the company was reporting millions of dollars of losses , according to interviews .
A spokesman for the William J. Clinton Foundation declined to identify the buyer who was willing to pay so much for a struggling company ’s stock , saying only that the transaction was handled by a securities broker .
It occurred seven months before Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton announced her bid to run for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination .
The spokesman , Ben Yarrow , declined last week to say whether Mr. Clinton knew about the Chinese government ’s connection to Accoona or the felony fraud conviction of one of the company ’s founders .
“ President Clinton gave a speech ; he did not endorse a product , ” Mr. Yarrow said .
The $ 700,000 capital gains was listed on the tax returns of Mr. Clinton ’s foundation that were reviewed by The Washington Times .
The lack of disclosure about the buyer and the general activities of former presidents ’ foundations troubles some ethics experts .
Sheila Krumholz , executive director for the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics , which studies political money and ethics , said even though the law does n’t require former presidents to disclose donations and stock transactions to their foundations , they should do so to avoid the appearance that money was buying special access .
“ We ’re in a unique period where the wife of a former president is running for the job of the son of a former president , ” she said , referring to Mrs. Clinton and the current President Bush .
Accoona offered its own Internet search engine as a rival to giants Google and Yahoo , and Mr. Clinton was the keynote speaker at the company ’s Dec. 6 , 2004 , launch in New York .
He even joked about the price of the stock that he was given that day as compensation for his speech .
“ So I hope you get a big run -up in your stock price , I hope you have a great time doing it , but remember you ’re doing something profoundly good for humanity and the future as you do , ” Mr. Clinton told Accoona executives .
Accoona , based in Jersey City , N.J. , was co-founded by Armand Rousso , who as of last year held more than 14 percent of the company ’s shares .
He pleaded guilty in 1999 to federal money laundering and other charges in a fraud investigation in New Jersey .
After being jailed for 19 months and cooperating with government investigators for several years , he was sentenced to probation in 2006 and was barred from working in the securities industry .
Rousso “ does not get involved in the management of this company ; if he did , I would not be here , ” Accoona ’s chief executive , Valentine J. Zammit , said in an interview .
“ I did n’t come on board to be told what to do .
…
We ’ve made a lot of changes .
The China Daily Information Co. , or CDIC , a subsidiary of the Chinese - controlled newspaper China Daily , holds nearly a 7 percent stake in Accoona , records show .
Mr. Zammit said CDIC also has no management role .
Still , the company has touted its ties to China to potential investors .
“ CDIC ’s market knowledge and its parent ’s ownership by the Chinese government gives us an advantage over companies that do not have such a relationship , ” the company said in a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) last year .
The stock
Accoona officials have declined to discuss the arrangement they had with Mr. Clinton .
“ Obviously , we ’re a private company . …
I ’m not about to give out that [ information ] , ” said Mr. Zammit , who was n’t with the company when Mr. Clinton got the stock .
Mr. Clinton ’s foundation has raised more than $ 250 million for the William J. Clinton Presidential Library and other charitable causes since 2004 .
“ The foundation is proud of the work that it does , and its tremendous successes — including its success on previously intractable problems such as the cost of AIDS medicine in the developing world — would not be possible without the generous support it receives from donors , ” Mr. Yarrow said .
Before calling off a plan to raise money on the stock market last year , Accoona said in a detailed prospectus filed with the SEC that it had issued 200,000 shares of common stock in 2004 for what it called “ marketing services , ” valuing the deal at 66 cents per share .
The documents do not name a recipient .
When Mr. Clinton ’s foundation sold its 200,000 Accoona shares in 2006 , the transaction was worth $ 3.50 per share .
The IRS document does n’t name the buyer , and officials did not respond to a request for more information about the transaction .
There is no established market price for the stock because the company is private .
But records show that the company posted at least $ 60 million in losses during the period from 2004 to 2006 .
The Chicago Tribune , reporting the stock transaction on Tuesday , quoted a business agent for former Russian chess champion Garry Kasparov , saying his client also was paid in stock options after attending Accoona ’s launch in 2004 .
However , the agent said , Mr. Kasparov did not exercise the options because financial advisers said the shares were worth less than the $ 1 option price , according to the report .
The agent , Owen Williams , declined to comment when contacted by The Times .
Pat Huddleston , former branch enforcement chief for the SEC , did not describe the $ 3.50 per share paid to the Clinton Foundation as inappropriate but speculated that Accoona may have agreed in 2004 to buy back the stock at a predetermined price .
“ A private company still owes a fiduciary responsibility to the shareholder , … but the definition of fair price in a private company is what a willing seller and what a willing buyer agree on , ” he said .
“ I wonder if there was n’t an agreement where whoever is arranging the former president ’s [ speaking ] engagement is saying , ‘ I ’m going to take stock , but you agree that when I sell it , you ’re going to have to buy it at such and such a price , ’ ” Mr. Huddleston said .
The concerns
Not all political leaders have been as enthusiastic about Accoona as Mr. Clinton .
One prominent member of the British Parliament raised concerns about the company ’s close ties to the Chinese government after it introduced a European search engine .
Derek Wyatt , who chaired a House of Commons committee on Internet - related issues , reportedly called on advertisers at the time to “ shun ” the company .
In a telephone interview , Mr. Wyatt told The Times that he was concerned that the company was too close to China , which has been criticized by human rights groups for restricting Web sites critical of the Chinese government .
“ You ca n’t have a search engine and restrict the search , ” Mr. Wyatt said .
Larger search engines have faced scrutiny over cooperation with the Chinese government .
Reporters Without Borders in 2005 accused Yahoo of acting as a “ police informant ” for China in the arrest of a Chinese journalist .
Mr. Zammit said the company does not keep information on its users , adding , “ We have n’t been approached by the Chinese government to provide any information . ”
In an SEC filing , the company said , “ We are required to report any suspicious content to relevant government authorities and to undergo computer security inspections . ”
Despite Accoona ’s connections in China , the company has struggled to turn a profit .
Last year , the New York Times reported that plans to raise $ 80.5 million through a stock offering halted when an underwriter withdrew from the deal .
Accoona disclosed Rousso ’s criminal history in a prospectus filed with the SEC .
The document says Rousso was convicted of securities fraud in France in 1999 and separately pleaded guilty to securities fraud and money laundering in federal court in New Jersey .
Rousso worked for at least two years as an outside consultant to Accoona through New York - based SPBD Consulting , which was paid millions of dollars .
Attempts to reach Rousso through the business were unsuccessful .
“ SPBD and Mr. Rousso are no longer consulting for Accoona Corporation , ” the company said in an e-mail last week , adding that Rousso would not comment on any Accoona - related matters .
“ The principal underlying activities occurred during a period ending over nine years ago and are themselves completely unconnected to us , ” Accoona said in its SEC filing .
Rousso has been credited with helping secure 11 criminal convictions and $ 7 million in forfeited assets during the years that he spent cooperating with the FBI and U.S. Attorney ’s Office in New Jersey , according to court records .
“ Before I was arrested in January 1999 , my conduct was illegal and I deeply regret it , ” Rousso told a judge in federal court in Newark at his sentencing in 2006 .
“ The 19 months I did in jail between January 1999 and August 2000 was the best thing that could happen to me .
It gave me the strength and courage to carry on , ” he said .

You know the feeling .
It 's happened to all of us at some point : you 've pored over the code a dozen times and still can't find a problem with it .
But there 's some bug or error you can't seem to get rid of .
There just has to be something wrong with the machine you 're coding on , with the operating system you 're running under , with the tools and libraries you 're using .
There just has to be !
No matter how desperate you get , do n't choose that path .
Down that path lies voodoo computing and programming by coincidence .
In short , madness .
It 's frustrating to repeatedly bang your head against difficult , obscure bugs , but do n't let desperation lead you astray .
An essential part of being a humble programmer is realizing that whenever there 's a problem with the code you 've written , it 's always your fault .
This is aptly summarized in The Pragmatic Programmer as " Select Is n't Broken " :
In most projects , the code you are debugging may be a mixture of application code written by you and others on your project team , third - party products ( database , connectivity , graphical libraries , specialized communications or algorithms , and so on ) and the platform environment ( operating system , system libraries , and compilers ) .
It is possible that a bug exists in the OS , the compiler , or a third - party product -- but this should not be your first thought .
It is much more likely that the bug exists in the application code under development .
It is generally more profitable to assume that the application code is incorrectly calling into a library than to assume that the library itself is broken .
Even if the problem does lie with a third party , you 'll still have to eliminate your code before submitting the bug report .
We worked on a project where a senior engineer was convinced that the select system call was broken on Solaris .
No amount of persuasion or logic could change his mind ( the fact that every other networking application on the box worked fine was irrelevant ) .
He spent weeks writing workarounds , which , for some odd reason , did n't seem to fix the problem .
When finally forced to sit down and read the documentation on select , he discovered the problem and corrected it in a matter of minutes .
We now use the phrase " select is broken " as a gentle reminder whenever one of us starts blaming the system for a fault that is likely to be our own .
The flip side of code ownership is code responsibility .
No matter what the problem is with your software -- maybe it's not even your code in the first place -- always assume the problem is in your code and act accordingly .
If you 're going to subject the world to your software , take full responsibility for its failures .
Even if , technically speaking , you do n't have to .
That 's how you earn respect and credibility .
You certainly do n't earn respect or credibility by endlessly pawning off errors and problems on other people , other companies , other sources .
Statistically , you understand , it is incredibly rare for any bugs or errors in your software not to be your fault .
In Code Complete , Steve McConnell cited two studies that proved it :
A pair of studies performed [ in 1973 and 1984 ] found that , of total errors reported , roughly 95 % are caused by programmers , 2 % by systems software ( the compiler and the operating system ) , 2 % by some other software , and 1 % by the hardware .
Systems software and development tools are used by many more people today than they were in the 1970s and 1980s , and so my best guess is that , today , an even higher percentage of errors are the programmers ' fault .
Whatever the problem with your software is , take ownership .
Start with your code , and investigate further and further outward until you have definitive evidence of where the problem lies .
If the problem lies in some other bit of code that you do n't control , you 'll not only have learned essential troubleshooting and diagnostic skills , you 'll also have an audit trail of evidence to back up your claims , too .
This is certainly a lot more work than shrugging your shoulders and pointing your finger at the OS , the tools , or the framework -- but it also engenders a sense of trust and respect you 're unlikely to achieve through fingerpointing and evasion .
If you truly aspire to being a humble programmer , you should have no qualms about saying " hey , this is my fault -- and I 'll get to the bottom of it . "
CLOSE-UP : BARACK OBAMA CLOSE-UP : BARACK OBAMA
In - depth : Latest Obama news , video , photos , timeline , more ... Barack Obama on the campaign issues : Iraq | Immigration | Health care | Education | Abortion | Gay civil rights KOGELO , Kenya  American shock jocks , dirty tricks masterminds and political bloggers :
Beware the wrath of an 86 - year - old Kenyan villager .
A frown replaces the dimpled beam of Sarah Hussein Obama , grandmother of U.S. senator Barack Obama , when asked on Wednesday about recent attacks on her grandson that include the spreading of rumors that he is secretly a Muslim and the repeated use of his middle name — Hussein — by a radio host at rally of the Republican presidential candidate .
" Untruths are told that do n't have anything to do with what Barack is about , " she said in the local Luo language , her gray hair smoothed neatly under a headwrap .
" I am very against it . "
Obama and fellow senator Hillary Clinton are close in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination after results from races on Tuesday .
Clinton , who was trailing Obama , won the crucial states of Texas and Ohio and won big in Rhode Island .
Obama 's thin lead narrowed further after he only picked up Vermont .
In recent weeks , two Clinton volunteers in the state of Iowa resigned after forwarding false e-mails falsely saying he was a Muslim and a threat to national security .
Matt Drudge , who publishes the political blog the Drudge Report , said that he was e-mailed a widely circulated picture of Obama in a turban and robe by the Clinton campaign .
" Bringing such pictures that are trying to imply that not only is he a foreigner , he is a Muslim is wrong , because that is not what he is , " scolded Sarah Obama .
The photo was taken when he was presented with the outfit while on a visit to his late father 's native Kenya , where many of the family still live .
Clinton campaign officials have said they did not condone any such dirty tricks .
Obama 's grandfather had converted to Islam from Roman Catholicism and taken the name Hussein , Sarah Obama said , but his children had inherited only the name , not the religion .
Each person should be able to choose how they worshipped , she said .
" In the world of today , children have different religions from their parents , " she said .
She , too , is a Christian .
Barack Obama has visited his Kenyan relatives three times in Kogelo , and his grandmother has gone to the U.S. twice .
She says they are close , although they have to speak through an interpreter .
Sarah Obama was the second wife of the candidate 's late grandfather , so is not his biological grandmother .
But Barack Obama 's half sister , Auma Obama , said : " By our definition , in our culture , she is his grandmother , " she said .
The intense interest generated by the race for the Democratic nomination — between two candidates who would either be the first female or the first black president — has thrust Obama 's Kenyan family into the spotlight .
Four wheel drive vehicles packed with journalists bounce over the rutted red roads , and students at the local high school named after him do n't even turn anymore to watch as crews unload satellite equipment under a mango tree .
Each twist and turn of the race is closely scrutinized , says Auma Obama .
The family gathered in his grandmother 's house on Tuesday night to watch the results come in , she said , on a television donated by a family friend — the grandmother 's own simple house does not have one of its own .
" Barack 's done extremely well and we 're very proud of him , " Auma Obama said when asked for a reaction to the losses on Tuesday .
" This is like a football match .
The game continues . "

Even now , some of you are irate that I revealed an important plot point about that movie , that 19 - year - old movie .
Others recognize that in order to discuss movies , you actually have to be able to mention things about them , or all movie discussions will look like this :
Movie Buff One : I was watching Terminator on Blu-ray last night .
What a great movie !
I loved the part where Arnold does that thing with the items he purchases from the location .
Movie Buff
Two :
Me too !
And the thing he does before he says the line he says !
I 'm glad robots in the future will be programmed to say cool stuff .
Movie Buff Three : Arnold 's a robot ?
SPOILER !
Movie Buff
Two :
He has a metal face on the poster !
Movie Buff
Three : Shut up !
I just killed your dog !
Clearly , where lawlessness and chaos rule , someone has to step in and establish order , just like that one guy in that one movie .
That 's why I 'm providing the following iron - clad , indisputable , rough guideline for when it 's OK to post a spoiler without suffering the censure of a cadre of wounded geeks .
Start with the baseline : six weeks .
Then add and subtract time according to the rules below .
When you 're done , you 'll have the amount of time you 're required to wait before revealing the spoiler without a huge flashing warning .
Negative results are taken literally :
You can reveal these things before the movie even comes out .
If the spoiler is :
revealed in the trailer : Subtract four weeks .
obvious if you think about it even a little , like " Spider - Man rescues someone ! " : Subtract four weeks .
about someone dying :
Add three weeks .
about the death of a character who 's been in one or more previous installments of the series :
Add another three weeks .
about who murdered whom :
Add another three weeks .
a rip - off of a previous scandalous spoiler – specifically anyone being anyone 's father , anyone actually being a different gender or people naming their sled anything : Subtract two weeks .
the climax of the movie : Add four weeks .
in the real - life events the movie is based on : Subtract two weeks .
in the book the movie is based on : Subtract six weeks .
in the TV show the movie is based on : Subtract 12 years .
about a betrayal , unless the betrayer has a facial scar :
Add one week .
about a betrayal in which the betrayer has a facial scar : See " obvious . "
in the title of the movie : Subtract 12 weeks .
a hilarious joke :
Add two weeks .
an awful joke : Subtract two weeks .
not in full release outside the United States : tough luck , foreign people .
already a running gag on two different late - night programs : Subtract four weeks .
in the first 10 minutes of the movie : Subtract four weeks .
a cameo appearance by anyone but William Shatner : Add one week .
( Geeks can intuitively sense incipient Shatner cameos , so those are never spoilers . )
involves an undercover cop in more than 2 ounces of latex makeup and / or a wimple : Do n't see the movie in the first place .

GOP Congressman : Right questions Obama 's patriotism ' to drive the left crazy ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday February 28 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Once Barack Obama became the Democratic front - runner , the right began gearing up to question his loyalty to the nation .
MSNBC's Dan Abrams invited one Republican member of Congress onto his program to discuss this strategy , but he was unable to get Rep. Jack Kingston ( R - GA ) to admit that it amounts to anything more than good - natured fun .
" It is starting , " Abrams began .
" The right - wing smear machine on its way to shaping the attack on Senator Obama .
...
If Obama succeeds in nailing down the nomination , be prepared for an assault on his patriotism . "
Abrams noted the use of a repeated refrain of " Barack Hussein Obama " at a recent McCain rally together with photographs of Obama in traditional Somali tribal attire while on a visit to Africa .
He also pointed to a widely - reproduced photograph of Obama not putting his hand over his heart during the playing of the national anthem , which led Rep.
Kingston to charge last week that " the guy would not say the Pledge of Allegiance . "
( There are various guidelines available for flag etiquette which give conflicting advice .
USFlag.org states , " When the national anthem is played or sung , citizens should stand at attention and salute at the first note and hold the salute through the last note . "
However , Answers.com advises more casually , " Some people choose to put their hand on their heart but in etiquette this is only required for the Pledge of Allegiance . " )
" Is n't this pure sleaze ? " Abrams asked Kingston .
" Those are just questions that the American people want to know about , " Kingston insisted .
" When you listen to why he does n't wear an American flag button , it 's a very convoluted answer .
...
Everybody wears them ... and it's curious that suddenly there 's a guy that does n't want to do it .
...
You 're running to be the number one cheerleader in the country , so I think these questions are n't off limits . "
" You 're not wearing a lapel pin , are you ? "
Abrams observed .
" I will wear one , " Kingston answered brightly .
" But Barack Obama says he wo n't wear one .
That 's a completely different thing . "
Kingston went on from there to reveal that his real motivation -- which he apparently learned from the Ann Coulter school of political discourse -- is simply to annoy the left .
" I do n't really think they 're attacks , " he said cheerfully .
" I think it 's just a little banter back and forth .
I think that the left has had their hyper - sensitivity buttons on .
But it works !
Apparently , it 's like scratching fingernails across a blackboard when you say ' Barack Hussein Obama . ' "
" I think that the far right is not going to focus on [ substantive ] issues , " Abrams complained .
" Instead , they 're going to focus on this nonsense like whether he wears a lapel pin . "
" It 's the left that wants to continue talking about it , " Kingston insisted .
" And that 's why the right 's going to do it .
...
It seems to drive the left crazy , and we 're having a good time watching it . "

make sure you are wearing it . :: i'll bring you one .
I have a confession to make .
I get so competitive about heart rates when I am at the gym that my husband will not tell me his .
“ How was your workout ? ” I ’ll ask when we get off of Spinning bikes or elliptical cross-trainers .
He ’ll reply that it was good , he worked at “ 80 percent . ”
But 80 percent of what ?
I want to know what he thinks his maximum is .
But he wo n’t say .
Of course , I know it ’s ridiculous to think that a higher maximum heart rate means that I ’m a better athlete than my husband .
He may have a slower heart rate , but he can beat me in cycling any day .
And , after all , the goal in exercise is to get more blood to your muscles .
The heart does that by beating faster and by pumping more blood with each beat .
If your heart is more powerful , it does not have to beat as fast .
“ There is no association between maximum heart rate and exercise performance , ” said Hirofumi Tanaka , the director of the Cardiovascular Aging Research Laboratory and an exercise physiologist at the University of Texas in Austin .
In fact , Dr. Tanaka said , when people start exercising regularly their maximum heart rate often goes down .

God bless Helen Thomas , the best thing about the White House Press Corps .
More than a week after the revelation that President Bush knew and endorsed the Principals ' specific plans of torturing detainees , the media has been largely silent over it other than cursory mentions at best .
But Helen
Thomas is n't about to go silently into that good night and becomes the first White House reporter to ask White House spokesliar Dana Perino about how the president could have lied multiple times that we do not torture only to turn around and admit that not only do we , but he approved of it .
Unfortunately , the designation of " spokesliar " fits Perino very well , as she denies and lies again that the U.S. does not torture .
Who you gonna believe , Perino or your lying eyes ?
Think Progress :
During this afternoon ’s White House press briefing , reporter Helen Thomas noted that Bush “ has admitted that he did sign off on torture ” saying it damages “ the credibility of this country . ”
But press secretary Dana Perino denied that the United States has ever tortured detainees and referred to testimony from CIA Director Michael Hayden as evidence . [..]
In fact , during a February 5 Senate Intelligence Committee hearing , Hayden said outright that “ waterboarding has been used ” on three detainees in U.S. custody .
But Hayden has refused to label waterboarding “ torture , ” calling it a “ legal term ” which seems to fit nicely with the Bush administration ’s self - serving narrowed legal definition .
But waterboarding is torture and illegal under both U.S. and international law – with experts , government officials and those who have been subject to the harsh treatment all agreeing .
Seeming to acknowledge her colleagues ’ absence on this story , an exasperated Thomas said out loud after her exchange with Perino : “ Where is everybody ?
For God ’s sakes . ”
That 's the $ 64,000 question , Helen .
Where is everybody ?
Kossack Elisinora finds that no one in the Principals group really wants to be confronted with the reality of their decisions .

Full Transcript below the fold :
THOMAS : The President has said publicly several times , in two consecutive news conferences a few months ago , and you have said over and over again , we do not torture .
Now he has admitted that he did sign off on torture , he did know about it .
So how do you reconcile this credibility gap ?
MS . PERINO : Helen , you 're taking liberties with the what the President said .
The United States has not , is not torturing any detainees in the global war on terror .
And General Hayden , amongst others , have spoken on Capitol Hill fully in this regard , and it is -- I 'll leave it where it is .
The President is accurate in saying what he said .
THOMAS : That 's not my question .
My question is , why did he state publicly , we do not torture --
MS. PERINO : Because we do not .
THOMAS : -- when he really did know that we do ?
MS . PERINO : No , that 's what I mean , Helen .
We 've talked about the legal authorities --
THOMAS : Are you saying that we did not ?
MS. PERINO : I am saying we did not , yes .
THOMAS : How can you when you have photographs and everything else ?
I mean , how can you say that when he admits that he knew about it ?
MS . PERINO : Helen , I think that you 're -- again , I think you 're conflating some issues and you 're misconstruing what the President said .
THOMAS : I 'm asking for the credibility of this country , not just this administration .
MS . PERINO : And what I 'm telling you is we have -- torture has not occurred .
And you can go back through all the public record .
Just make sure -- I would just respectfully ask you not to misconstrue what the President said .
THOMAS : You 're denying , in this room , that we torture and we have tortured ?
MS. PERINO : Yes , I am denying that .
Elaine , did you have one ?
Q I have one on Zimbabwe , actually .
THOMAS : Where is everybody ?

A closer look at Vallejo 's woes 1 / 8 Back to Gallery
The city of Vallejo was in trouble long before James Moore bought a freshly butchered pig's head , mounted it on a Weber barbecue grill and wheeled it into a packed City Council meeting last week .
" Vallejo has been hogtied by its police and fire unions , " Moore , a local businessman , said later .
" The unions are killing the goose that laid the golden egg .
Do I need to bring a dead goose to next week 's meeting ?
I hope not . "
Crippled by a free - falling economy , an inability to create tax revenue , management recklessness and a legacy of generous contracts for police officers and firefighters , officials are slashing senior center hours and closing firehouses in a frantic bid to keep Vallejo from becoming the first large city in California to declare bankruptcy .
The city 's financial ruin can be seen in its decaying downtown , where businesses sit dark and locked , and at City Hall , where seven people - including , briefly , the chief of police - have held down the city manager 's post in the past four years .
Choice plots of land on an attractive waterfront lie undeveloped .
Nearby housing tracts sit unfinished .
And in a city that recorded 17 homicides last year , the most since 1994 , police are asking residents to be judicious when calling 911 .
When a city contractor called acting City Clerk Mary Ellsworth recently to make a pitch , she quickly told the caller : " If it involves paying any money at all , I can't even talk to you . "
Many Bay Area cities are struggling through the collapse of the housing market and a broader economic downturn .
But Vallejo's problems go back further and run deeper .
A key moment was the decommissioning of the Mare Island Naval Shipyard on April 1 , 1996 , after 150 years as the city 's economic and cultural lifeblood .
Since then , Vallejo has made few strides in reinventing itself .
" The city did not , over a long period of time , set aside tracts of land for industry or business parks or malls , " said Assistant City Manager Craig Whittom , who oversees economic development and has become the city 's point man in dealing with the crisis .
" The development pattern in Vallejo has been largely residential . "
New malls in neighboring cities have beckoned Vallejo shoppers , and taken their sales taxes .
In the past two years , sales tax revenue is off 10 percent , or $ 1.8 million , records show .
Property transfer taxes are down 56 percent , a $ 3.4 million annual blow .
Meanwhile , public safety salaries and benefits have ballooned , demanding an unusually high 74 percent of the city 's general fund budget , which also funds services including street repairs and senior centers .
Vallejo's police officers and firefighters are among the highest paid in the Bay Area , even after the unions have deferred raises and taken salary cuts during the city 's fiscal crisis .
Crisis of small failures
Despite the city 's current woes , residents have n't given up on it .
Thomas Selva , 82 , griped about Vallejo 's financial woes as he strolled along the waterfront on a recent afternoon .
But he also held forth on its qualities .
The diverse city has a funky charm that 's endeared it to generations of Mare Island shipyard workers , working - class families seeking affordable housing and thousands of artists , gay people and others who 've fled San Francisco in recent years in search of Victorians , fog - free summers and a tolerant community .
" It 's a town that has a lot of potential , " said Selva , who still believes it after 51 years living there .
Vallejo residents have turned out by the hundreds at City Council meetings , demanding to know why the city has sunk into a swamp while its neighbors persevere .
The answers they 're given are complicated and varied , a tale of seemingly endless small failures .
A telling example involves Wal - Mart , which leased a temporary site along Highway 29 in Vallejo and sought to build a Supercenter , complete with groceries .
While city leaders bickered over the project and Wal - Mart 's corporate record , the company built a store in neighboring American Canyon .
Wal - Mart closed the Highway 29 store in September .
Meanwhile , high - end Nugget Markets ditched plans to build a store in Vallejo after failing to get assurances that it would n't have to compete with a Wal - Mart .
Now , Vallejo has neither a Wal - Mart nor a Nugget .
Plans to unite Vallejo's downtown and waterfront in a bustling mix of condominiums , gourmet restaurants and offices have stalled with the housing market .
At Mare Island , only 250 of the 1,400 units envisioned for the former shipyard have been built .
Firefighters ' salaries
Perhaps the thorniest dilemma , city officials say , revolves around contracts with Vallejo 's powerful public safety unions .
Many residents of the historically pro-labor city have directed anger at firefighters who , according to campaign finance records , pumped nearly $ 50,000 into last November 's council election , riding two winners and one loser .
The firefighters are now paying for a decades - long record of savvy at the bargaining table .
Union president Kurt Henke , a tenacious assistant chief who was once fired and then rehired and later sued a batch of city officials for slandering him , acknowledged that his members once made 15 percent more than counterparts in the Bay Area and now earn perhaps 10 percent more .
Vallejo's base pay for firefighters is more than $ 80,000 a year .
Last year , 21 of them topped $ 200,000 in salary and overtime , according to city payroll records .
The city has stumbled repeatedly in dealing with the union , interviews and records show .
For example , the city has matched the average percentage of firefighter raises in other Bay Area departments , which boosts Vallejo 's salaries because its firefighters are paid more to begin with .
" You do that for 20 years , and here you are , " said acting finance director Susan Mayer , who said the city had not taken a survey of other fire departments ' salaries in real dollars since the 1980s .
Making matters worse , the city budgeted a savings of $ 5 million last year after cutting the number of firefighters working each day by four , only to see an arbitrator side with firefighters and order the higher staffing level to ensure public safety .
That fight accounted for part of the city 's $ 500,000 tab for labor attorneys in the past three years , Mayer said .
Henke said his members have been scapegoated and , along with police officers , have saved Vallejo $ 18 million in concessions since 2000 .
Firefighters in Vallejo often work 96 hours straight as a result of staffing shortages , leading to severe fatigue , Henke said .
Henke said city leaders in the past hid money before entering contract negotiations as a cry-poor bargaining ploy .
" I have a high school diploma , a driver 's license and a pulse , " he said .
" You mean to tell me that all of us good - old country boys went in and snookered them ?
...
That 's what they 're asking people to believe . "
Emergency cost-cutting
After two years of budget deficits that prompted city leaders to drain reserves , Vallejo narrowly dodged bankruptcy last Monday , when the City Council approved a cost- cutting plan to keep the city solvent through June 30 .
The plan includes layoffs of 16 city staffers and the elimination of 12 slots for police officers .
There are deep cuts to the arts and transportation , and closures of two fire stations , which took effect last week .
The cuts , combined with 8 percent salary reductions that police and firefighters have agreed to , will save the city about $ 4 million .
But bankruptcy looms if the city can't come up with a long - term financial plan by April 22 , City Manager Joe Tanner told the council last week .
" This is not a cure .
This will only stop the bleeding for four months , " Tanner said .
" I am not recommending this plan with confidence . "
Tanner himself has faced criticism for making a city - best $ 316,688 salary last year - $ 71,881 more than San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom .
Since the council first discussed bankruptcy at a Feb. 13 meeting , 20 police and firefighters have retired , concerned that their retirement packages would be jeopardized .
But it 's not clear when the city will be able to pay them a total of $ 2.5 million in payouts .
Whittom , the assistant city manager , said Vallejo 's credit rating is falling and that officials had to factor in $ 300,000 in extra interest on bank loans over the next four months .
Shuttered storefronts
Vallejo's struggles are perhaps most visible in its old downtown , which once drew shoppers to stores like Sears , JC Penney and Montgomery Ward .
The sidewalks are wide and some of the architecture is inviting , but the energy has been sucked away .
Only a few businesses - including a store selling the type of hydroponic lighting used in marijuana cultivation - get a steady flow of business .
On a recent weekday afternoon on a central stretch of Georgia Street , two blocks from the waterfront , 46 - year - old Calvin Cosey - who washes windows for a few dollars - swept the sidewalk outside an art gallery that was temporarily closed .
" I used to have 13 clients , " Cosey said .
" Now I have four .
If no one gets on this case , they may lose this downtown . "
On one side of the gallery , an eviction notice was taped to the locked door of a boutique .
The building on the other side , once a jewelry store , was boarded up .
Across the street , Joshua Dowdie was advertising a " liquidation sale . "
" We 've been broken into twice in the last six weeks , " said Dowdie , 20 , who runs the Excess Outlet for his mother , selling everything from designer jeans to kits for painting Easter eggs .
" Half the people down here are selling drugs .
The other half are walking around , but they 're not buying anything . "
For all of Vallejo 's challenges , there also are also assets and a measure of hope .
The city has an undeveloped waterfront , a ferry connection to San Francisco , deep water supplies and a public housing authority , as well as expanding hospitals and colleges .
It also has the Empress Theatre , a focal point for dreams of better days .
General Manager Randy Bobst - McKay and his staff last week put finishing touches on the revival of a 96 - year - old venue that has been dark since the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake .
Breathing life into the onetime vaudeville house took four years , $ 6.85 million and a deal between a downtown developer , the Vallejo Community Arts Foundation and the city 's redevelopment agency , which loaned funds .
The grand opening is set for Saturday , with a 7:30 p.m. showing of " Casablanca . "
INEZ , Kentucky ( Reuters ) - Republican presidential candidate John McCain on Wednesday demanded the North Carolina Republican Party withdraw an advertisement critical of Democrat Barack Obama over his controversial pastor .

“ We asked them not to run it , ” McCain told reporters on his campaign bus as he rode to an anti-poverty event in the coalfields of eastern Kentucky .
“ I ’m sending them an e-mail as we speak asking them to take it down .
I do n’t know why they do it .
Obviously , I do n’t control them .
But I ’m making it very clear that there ’s no place for that ” in his campaign .
Obama has come under fire for attending a Chicago church for two decades where the Rev. Jeremiah Wright was pastor .
Wright espoused inflammatory views including saying the U.S. government spread the AIDS virus to African Americans .
He has since retired .
The 30 - second ad in question attacks Democratic North Carolina gubernatorial candidates Beverly Perdue and Richard Moore for their endorsements of Obama , referencing the Illinois senator ’s “ judgment ” in supporting Wright and calling him “ too extreme for North Carolina . ”
North Carolina is one of two states holding the next crucial Democratic primaries on May 6 in the tight race between Obama and Hillary Clinton to oppose McCain in the November presidential election .
Traveling with McCain , Republican National Committee Chairman Mike Duncan said he had tried to call the chair of the North Carolina party to ask the ad be withdrawn .
McCain said he wanted to run a respectful campaign .
“ Americans want better , ” he said .
“ I understand that it moves ( opinion ) numbers , negative ads and all that , but that does n’t mean it ’s right . ”

Trial judges in New York have long been selected in a way that allows the party in power to coronate whoever it wants .
The system is overrun with corruption and dominated by insiders , and has resulted in judges completely beholding to their political bosses .
Both the federal district court in Brooklyn and the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that this system was neither very transparent or democratic .
In a ruling today , the Supreme Court disagreed .
Justice Scalia and the other members of the high court were not persuaded by arguments that " one- party rule " effectively denied some people " a fair shot " at a judicial nomination .
" The reason one - party rule is entrenched may be ( and usually is ) that voters approve of the positions and candidates that the party regularly puts forward , " Justice Scalia wrote .
" I completely agree , " said Mr. Stalin .
Chairman Mao , Kim Jong
Il , and others also sent notes in praise of this decision .
" For years , we 've been suffering from the lie that you need more than one party to have a democracy , " said Pol Pot .
" I 'm glad to see the United States Supreme Court put an end to that lie . "

His boss respected him , his coworkers would n't hesitate to help him , and it was work that he genuinely enjoyed .
In fact , the only things Jeremy could complain about were minor — the coffee sucked , the vending machine did n't have Whatchamacallits , and the keycard - protected doors were slow to open .
It had n't really registered with him until he was jogging down the hallway , late for a meeting , and found himself waiting for 10 , 20 , 30 seconds for the door to open after he swiped his keycard .
The embarrassment was eased when another coworker showed up even later than Jeremy , complaining that " the damn door took like a minute to open ! "
What he could n't really understand , however , was why the delay was so variable .
Sometimes he'd swipe his card and hear the door click unlocked in less than five seconds .
Other times , and often when he was already running late , it 'd take 30 or more seconds .
Rumors circulated on how to get the doors to open quicker .
Some employees would swipe the card quickly , others slowly .
Some would just swipe once and wait , others would furiously swipe their cards over and over while waiting for the door to unlock .
Sometimes by sheer luck the door would open instantly , cementing the behavior in the employee 's mind .
When Jeremy was working late one night , he heard a distant click .
Probably someone else in the office working late or maybe someone in the cleaning crew .
Every few seconds , another click .
Again , probably the cleaning crew going back and forth for new toilet paper or something .
Jeremy was too absorbed in his work to care , though it was starting to get distracting .
After a few hours it had become Jeremy 's personal Tell - Tale Heart , driving him more and more crazy with click after incessant click .
Jeremy * click * could hardly * click * maintain a coherent * click * thought with all the * click * distracting clicks .
He 'd had enough .
Jeremy locked his workstation , and got up to buy a snack .
As he turned to go back to his desk , the door clicked again .
OK , I 'm going give whoever is doing this a piece of my mind , he thought to himself .
The office was almost entirely dark ; only areas with lights or desk lamps on or were still visible — the elevators , the break room , and Jeremy 's desk .
He opened the door that had just unlocked , looked down the hallway and saw nothing .
As soon as Jeremy turned around to go back to his desk , the door clicked again .
He spun around immediately to look .
No one .
Is this thing just opening on its own ?
He examined the card reader and swiped his card .
With a typical delay of 15 seconds , it unlocked .
He traced a line from the card reader to the reception area just on the other side of the door , and upon further investigation discovered that it ran into a floor - level cabinet which was obscured by a trashcan and some stacks of paper and folders .
Clearing the crap out of the way , he opened the cabinet and saw a computer and monitor covered in a thin layer of dust .
Jeremy turned the monitor on , and saw what looked like a log of some sort — each line with an eight digit number and a timestamp .
At the bottom of the list , he saw one timestamped just a few seconds ago .
Comparing his card to the log , it was his card number .
Prior to that , the last swipe had been over three hours ago .
The earliest entry was from about 8:00 the previous morning .
After staring at it for a few seconds , he 'd figured it out .
Technically , the doors were working fine — card swipes were validated and recorded properly .
Each time it unlocked corresponded with a single swipe .
The problem was that cards had been swiped faster than the system could handle , so new swipes were being queued .
So many were queued up that it was still processing swipes from 8:00 AM the previous morning , the situation worsened by impatient employees swiping their cards multiple times in a row .
The doors would be locking and unlocking long into the night .
Jeremy was about to turn around and shrug it off — it 's not his job to worry about the doors , anyway .
But the clicking kept breaking his focus , so he decided to see what he could do .
The software 's UI was next to useless , and Jeremy could n't figure it out at all .
The log file seemed to be a key piece of the equation , so eventually he decided that he'd rename the file and see if it cleared things up any .
Jeremy took a deep breath and renamed accesslog. txt to accesslog2.txt .
Immediately , a startling clatter of doors locking shut echoed throughout the floor .
Jeremy bit his lip and walked over to the nearest card reader .
He swiped his card and instantly the door clicked unlocked .
Trying it again , it unlocked immediately .
His solution had worked !
The following morning the buzz around the water cooler among those that noticed the improvement was that some anonymous hero had fixed the doors .
Others could n't put their finger on what it was exactly , but they knew something was right with the world that morning .
In the complex human equation that produces a turncoat , rarely is only one motive at play .
But different periods have featured different motives in the ascendancy .
The first great wave was ideology , growing from an early fascination with the Soviet experiment , which promised freedom from the grinding inequities of capitalism .
Julius Rosenberg , for instance , whose parents worked in New York City sweatshops , joined the Young Communist League as a teenager ; he was one of dozens of American and British Communists who fed secrets to Soviet intelligence in the first half of the 20th century .
But by the 1970s , disillusionment with the crimes of Communism meant that few took up the Soviet cause gratis .
Money dominated the second wave : hundreds of thousands of dollars for the spy ring led by John A. Walker Jr. , a Navy warrant officer ; $ 4.6 million for Aldrich Ames of the C.I.A. ; $ 1.4 million for Robert P. Hanssen of the F.B.I. , who once sent his handler a note seeking diamonds , saying cash was harder to hide .
Perhaps no would - be spy was so indiscriminately mercenary as Brian P. Regan , an Air Force master sergeant who worked at the National Reconnaissance Office , overseer of spy satellites , and was sentenced to life in prison in 2003 after seeking to sell secrets to Iraq , Libya and China .
The third wave of spying shows much less greed .
Money , the sole or primary motive for two - thirds of spies who got their start in the 1980s , was the main draw for just a quarter of spies from 1990 to date , Ms. Herbig ’s new analysis concludes .
No money at all was paid in the 11 most recent cases .
The largest share was made up of naturalized Americans who spied out of devotion to another country : Cuba , the Philippines , South Korea , Egypt , Iraq .
In a handful of cases , Muslims have been accused of ties to Al Qaeda or other terrorist groups ; these include Hassan Abujihaad , an American convert to Islam convicted last month of supplying information on Navy ships to a suspected terrorist financier .
Then there is the rash of Chinese cases , notably that of Mr. Mak .
Prosecutors called him a classic “ sleeper ” agent who worked for years in technical jobs before delivering military information to China , including three encrypted computer disks of data .
Still , such cases seem murkier than those with a money trail .
Mr. Mak , as well as his friends and some Chinese - Americans , argue that his prosecution reflected anti-Chinese paranoia .
They noted that the information he provided was unclassified and had been presented at international conferences .
House Democrats work on huge Iraq money bill WAR IN IRAQ

House Democratic leaders are putting together the largest Iraq war spending bill yet , a measure that is expected to fund the war through the end of the Bush presidency and for nearly six months into the next president 's term .
The bill , which could be unveiled as early as this week , signals that Democrats are resigned to the fact they can't change course in Iraq in the final months of President Bush 's term .
Instead , the party is pinning its hopes of ending the war on winning the White House in November .
Bay Area lawmakers , who represent perhaps the most anti-war part of the country , acknowledge the bill will anger many voters back home .
" It 's going to be a tough sell to convince people in my district that funding the war for six months into the new president 's term is the way to end the war , " said Rep. Lynn Woolsey , D - Petaluma , a leader of the Out of Iraq Caucus who plans to oppose the funding .
" It sounds like we are paying for something we do n't want . "
The bill is expected to provide $ 108 billion that the White House has requested for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Lawmakers who are drafting it say it also will include a so - called bridge fund of $ 70 billion to give the new president several months of breathing room before having to ask Congress for more money .
The debate is shaping up as a key test for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
The San Francisco Democrat , who opposed the war from the start , faces fierce criticism from the anti-war left for refusing to cut off funding for the war .
She 's trying to hold together a caucus split between anti-war lawmakers , who 'd prefer a showdown with the White House , and conservative Democrats , who believe cutting off the war funding would make the party look weak on national security and put its majority at risk .
Guns - for - butter
Pelosi is plotting a " guns- for - butter " strategy to try to force Bush to accept some new domestic spending in exchange for the money he needs to fight the war .
The speaker is floating a proposal to extend unemployment benefits for 13 weeks for those whose benefits have run out .
The package also could include a new GI Bill benefit to help veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan pay for college .
Bush is already vowing to veto any spending that goes over his $ 108 billion request .
House Republicans , eager for an election - year fight with Democrats over spending , are pledging to back up his veto threat .
" We 're going to insist that this is about funding the troops and nothing else , " House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , said last week .
Pelosi has been trying to ease tensions within her caucus over the bill .
Anti-war lawmakers - including Woolsey , Rep. Maxine Waters of Los Angeles and Rep. Barbara Lee of Oakland - met with the speaker last week to urge her to keep the votes on war spending and domestic spending separate .
" We raised concerns , " Lee said .
" It just would n't make sense to force ( members of Congress ) to choose between providing food stamps for people who are hurting and need help during this terrible time and funding an occupation that people do not support . "
House leaders may be able to get around the issue by splitting the votes .
Last May , Democrats used a similar tactic , staging votes on two amendments - one for $ 22 billion in domestic spending , and another for $ 98 billion for the two wars - to allow anti-war lawmakers to vote for the domestic spending , but against the money for the war .
The strategy would let many Democratic lawmakers register their opposition to the war , but it would n't change the outcome .
The Senate would eventually wrap all the spending into one package to send to the White House for Bush 's signature .
Democrats may use the bill to put Republicans on the defensive by offering an amendment to boost tax incentives for renewable energy as well as language that would block the administration from implementing new rules that would cut Medicaid payments and shift those costs to the states .
House leaders also may introduce an amendment that would require Bush to use any new war money only for redeploying U.S. troops from Iraq .
Bush vetoed a bill with similar language last year and Democrats lacked the votes to override it .
Still , Democrats say it would remind voters that it 's Bush and Republicans who are refusing to end the war .
But anti-war activists say Democrats are being disingenuous by claiming to oppose the war while also preparing to give the president even more war funding than he requested .
" They are the biggest hypocrites in the world , " said Medea Benjamin , the San Francisco - based founder of the anti-war group CodePink .
" They want to paint the Republicans as warmongers and they want to keep funding the war , and they think we do n't see through this ? "
Bay Area anti-war activists met at Oakland 's Grand Lake
Theater last week to discuss ways to protest the war spending bill .
CodePink plans to renew its protests outside Pelosi's home in San Francisco and at lawmakers ' offices , Benjamin said .
Pelosi on hot seat
Pelosi was pressed on the issue last week during a sit - down with CNN's Larry King .
" Your party became the majority in the House primarily pledging to end the war , " King said .
" That did n't happen . "
" No , " Pelosi acknowledged .
" It did n't happen because we had hoped that the president would listen to the will of the people and at least be willing to compromise on ... how the war is conducted and some timetable for redeployment of our troops . "
Congress watchers said Democrats are still stung after losing repeated battles with the White House and Republicans over the war last year .
" Last year they tried a lot of confrontation and they went nowhere , " said Louis Fisher , a constitutional scholar at the Library of Congress and an expert on congressional war powers .
He said Democrats still fear being portrayed as putting U.S. troops at risk if they try to shut off war funds .
" That argument seems to win almost every time , " Fisher said .
" Look how long it took to cut off the funding in Vietnam .
It was n't until the summer of 1973 . "
Congressional scholar Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution said House leaders are making a wise choice to give a new president , whether Democrat or Republican , some time to chart a new course in Iraq .
He noted that even the Democratic presidential candidates , Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton , have said it would take a few months to begin withdrawing troops .
Democrats in Congress may risk frustrating their base by funding the war into next year , but Mann said it 's unlikely to hurt them in the November election .
The public still generally sees the Iraq conflict as Bush 's war , he said .
" This only becomes a Democratic war if a Democratic president fails to deliver on his or her promise to end the war , " Mann said .

If you lose hope , somehow you lose the vitality that keeps life moving , you lose that courage to be , that quality that helps you go on in spite of it all .
And so today I still have a dream .
- Martin Luther King , Jr.
Several long - time activists have told me recently they are overwhelmed , worried , and think that we may be losing the struggle to end the imperial wars , save our Constitution , and stop false flag terrorism .
One very smart friend asked me if there is any basis for hope .
But hope is an , not a passive mood .
Admittedly , things are easier when circumstances bring hopeus , and we can just receive the hopeful and inspiring news .
But if we care about winning , we have to be able toto have hope even when outer circumstances are n't so positive .
I have children who are counting on me to leave them with a reasonably safe and sane planet .
As I 've said elsewhere , " I care too much about my kids and my freedom to be afraid .
I care enough about them that it gets my heart beating , connects me to something bigger than myself , and that gives me courage , the chips are down .
"
If I allowed myself to lose hope about exposing false flag terror , about protecting our freedom , about preventing World War III , I would be dropping the ball for my kids .
I would be condemning them to a potentially very grey world where bigger and more violent false flags are carried out , where their liberties and joys are wholly stripped away , where every ounce of vitality is beholden to " the war effort " .
Many of us may be motivated by other things besides kids in our fight against fascism , propaganda , perennial war , and government - sponsored terrorism .
Only you can know what that is .
But wemust dig down deep , and connect with our most powerful motivations to win the struggle for freedom and truth .
I do n't know about you . . . but I do n't have the luxury of giving up hope .
When I get depressed , overwhelmed or exhausted by the stunning acts of savagery , treason , and disinformation carried out by the imperialists , or the willful ignorance of many Americans , Imyself into finding some reason to have hope .
Because the struggle for liberty is too important for me to give up .
Do not let your fire go out , spark by irreplaceable spark , in the hopeless swamps of the approximate , the not - quite , the not - yet , the not - at - all .
Do not let the hero in your soul perish , in lonely frustration for the life you deserved , but have never been able to reach .
Check your road and the nature of your battle .
The world you desired can be won .
It exists , it is real , it is possible , it is yours .

The Supreme Court yesterday refused to review a legal challenge by the American Civil Liberties Union to President Bush ’s domestic terrorist surveillance program but did not rule on several key issues , including whether the government could intercept international phone calls and e-mails .
With questions remaining on whether Congress will reauthorize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) program , legal scholars said , the court might have opted to let pending legislation in Congress run its course .
They noted that the court only issued an order in the case and that none of the justices wrote an opinion .
“ Some justices may have been persuaded by the 6th Circuit ruling that found plaintiffs lacked standing and were content to let that ruling stand , ” said Carl Tobias , a law professor at the University of Richmond .
“ Other justices may have been persuaded by the government argument that the court should stay its hand while FISA legislation is pending in Congress and may pass . ”
The ACLU brought the case on behalf of journalists , scholars , lawyers and nonprofit groups who said the National Security Agency program disrupted their ability to communicate with sources and clients .
The high court ’s decision let stand a ruling by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati , which said the plaintiffs could not show with certainty that they had been wiretapped by the government .
“ Although we are deeply disappointed with the Supreme Court ’s refusal to review this case , it is worth noting that today ’s action says nothing about the case ’s merits and does not suggest in any way an endorsement of the lower court ’s decision , ” said ACLU legal director Steven R. Shapiro .
“ The court ’s unwillingness to act makes it even more important that Congress insist on legislative safeguards that will protect civil liberties without jeopardizing national security , ” he said .
House Democrats allowed a temporary update of FISA to expire Saturday , rather than meet White House demands that the law include retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies that aided the surveillance program after the September 11 attacks .
At least 40 civil rights lawsuits are pending against the telephone companies .
Bush administration officials say those lawsuits and the potential for more discourages the companies from voluntarily participating in future counterterrorism programs .
The Democrat - led Congress passed the temporary measures in August to modernize the 1978 FISA law and eliminate the need for the secret FISA court to oversee wiretaps of foreign communications .
The temporary update did not address the immunity issue .
The standoff has Democrats and Republicans accusing each other of playing political games with national security .
The debate is expected to continue next week when Congress returns from a weeklong break .
In July , an appeals court panel dismissed the ACLU lawsuit in a 2 - 1 ruling , but did not rule on the legality of the surveillance program .
It also vacated a 2006 order by a lower court in Detroit that found the post - September 11 program unconstitutional .
The Justice Department called the surveillance program “ an essential tool for the intelligence community ” in the nation ’s war on terror .
The court also :
• Refused to intervene in lawsuits by Hurricane Katrina victims that seek to force insurers to pay for damages from the flooding that followed the failure of New Orleans ’ levees .
• Stepped into a dispute over a labor union ’s use of fees paid by nonunion employees to finance the labor organization ’s court battles in other states .
• Agreed to consider whether evidence must be suppressed when authorities base an arrest on incorrect information from police files .
• Declined to hear an appeal from two former Alabama assistant football coaches who lost their jobs after an NCAA investigation of the Crimson Tide ’s football program .
• Said it would decide a dispute between Montana and Wyoming over water rights in two rivers that flow through both states .
• Turned away an appeal by Ford Motor Co. in a tax dispute from Washington state with the cities of Seattle and Tacoma .

President Bush puts his arm around French President Nicolas Sarkozy during a press availability after their meeting at Mount Vernon in Virginia , November 7 , 2007 .
BUCHAREST ( Reuters ) -
It ’s “ Love me tender ” between the United States and France after President George W. Bush compared French President Nicolas Sarkozy with rock ’n ’roll singer Elvis Presley .
Bush told NATO leaders at a Bucharest summit on Thursday that when Sarkozy visited the United States recently , he was seen as “ the latest incarnation of Elvis ” .
Such an example of “ Burning love ” marks a sea change from the “ Suspicious minds ” that clouded Franco - American relations under Sarkozy ’s predecessor , Jacques Chirac , who often seemed to see Washington as “ The devil in disguise ” .
Bush has made clear the diminutive French leader , who recently married another singer , Carla Bruni , is now his “ Good luck charm ” and “ My little friend ” .
Sarkozy has shown he is “ All shook up ” by heaping praise on Bush as the first U.S. leader to understand the need for a strong European defense .
Here 's the stuff that you 'll need .
Doublecheck that the gun is unloaded , and fieldstrip as per the manual .
Note the anti-seizure compound applied at the factory ...
Take a suitable pin and push the plastic sleeve forward as indicated .
While doing that , slide the back cover of the slide downwards , and pull the firing pin ( Glock refers to this part as " the striker " , which is probably a better name , as the gun is striker fired , i.e. there is no hammer .
I 'm going to use the two words interchangeably in this article ) and extractor spring that become visible clear to the rear .
Firing pin and extractor spring .
When the cover comes off , there is some spring pressure , but not a whole lot ...
Push the firing pin safety in with your thumb , and wiggle the extractor lose .
The firing pin safety is all that is holding the extractor at this point .
Once the extractor is lose , lift the firing pin safety out of the slide .
Be careful with the small spring that is under it so you do n't lose it .
This is easier to do than to explain ...
Stand the firing pin assembly up on the table , and pull the spring down .
The plastic sleeve in the picture is split in two halves , that can be taken off .
When they are out of the way , carefully ease off on the striker spring , and separate the parts .
The slide is now completely disassembled .
Using your punch , press the first pin out of the frame , from left to right .
Some older guns do n't have this pin .
Some force may be required , but be careful so you do n't mar the slide or hurt yourself .
Start pushing the second pin ( the larger one that holds the trigger and the slide stop ) left to right .
The slide stop sits in a recess in the pin , so you may have to tinker with it to get it lined up .
Pull the slide stop out of the frame to the rear and slightly up .
Push the third pin out of the frame , left to right .
Insert the punch under the locking block , support it on the left side of the frame , and gently pry the locking block out of the frame .
Insert the punch under the ejector in the same way , and gently pry the trigger assembly out of the frame .
The impression here is that the whole guts of the gun are coming out , that 's as it should be .
Trigger assembly .
Gently twist the trigger bar out of the plastic block that holds it and the ejector .
Unhook the spring that connects them .
Take a mental note of how it 's all hanging together .
Take a small screwdriver , and locate the point where the connector is fastened .
Push it gently to start it out of the plastic block .
Push the disassembly catch spring down , tilt the frame to the side , and shake .
The catch will come out .
The spring that held it is just lying loose in the frame at this point .
If you only want to get to the trigger , you can skip this step .
Here 's another one that 's easier to do than to explain ... look down the magazine well .
You will see the magazine catch and it 's spring .
There is a small slot cut in the magazine catch where the spring can be guided out .
Use a small screwdriver ( pushing the magazine release can help ) and do that .
The magazine catch will come out of the frame to the right .
You can skip this step if you were only interested in the trigger .
The gun is now completely disassembled .
If you want to go the de-luxe route ( and blow the $ 0.25 budget .
I know I did ... ) , replace the standard 5.5 lb trigger connector with a 3.5 lb one .
It looks almost the same , but has a small minus sign stamped near the top .
There is also a + marked one , refered to as the 8lb connector , and two alternate trigger springs , refered to as N.Y 1 and N.Y.2 that can be put in the gun instead of the original at this point if you want a heavier trigger pull for some reason .
To each his own .
Locate the parts in the picture , and using a Q - tip and some mild polishing compound , polish at the indicated spots .
The idea is to work on the metal parts that rub against each other when you pull the trigger .
We are not trying to change anything , just to make things go smoother , so take it easy .
Clean off all polishing compound .
Start the connector back into the housing .
Hook up the spring to the trigger bar , and put it back the way it was .
It does not take any force other than to overcome the small spring .
Put the trigger assembly back into the frame , and check that the holes align .
Put the disassembly catch spring back the way it was , push it down with something , and insert the catch from the side ( left or right ) .
There is a groove cut into one side of the catch .
The catch goes into the frame with this groove facing to the rear .
The serrated " ears " ( the parts of the catch sticking out of the frame when the gun is assembled ) should face down .
The part will go in either way , but this is how it should be put in .
Put the locking block back in the frame , and check that the holes align .
Put the smaller of the two forward pins in first , right to left .
Note the notch that the slide stop is riding in .
Start the second pin back in , right to left .
Insert the slide lock from the rear .
It rides in a notch in the trigger , and the spring goes under the first pin ( that was why that pin was put in first ) .
Push the pin back in , being careful to get everything lined up .
You will usually hear when the slide stop hits the notch , do n't force it beyond that point .
Put the firing pin in it 's plastic sleeve , and put the firing pin spring back on the firing pin .
If you want to cheat , you can stuff the rear end of the sleeve with TP , but it can be done without .
Push the spring down with one hand , and put the little plastic retaining thingies back around the pin using hands two and three ;-) .
Do n't let the spring slip .
Congratulate yourself .
The firing pin assembly is complete .
Put the firing pin safety back in it 's hole on the slide , push it in as far as it will go ( use your thumb ) , then drop the extractor into it 's cutout .
Ease off on the firign pin safety , and check that everything holds together .
Insert the firing pin assembly and the extractor spring from the rear as shown .
You will have to push down on the firing pin sleeve and the extractor spring pin when the cover reaches them .
Almost there , time for a function check :
Push the firing pin safety in , and shake the slide back and forth .
The firing pin should move freely .
Let go of the safety , and pull the firing pin slowly to the rear ( not enough to start cocking the spring ) .
You should hear / feel when the pin goes past the safety , and you should not be able to push the firing pin forward far enough to see it 's tip in the breechface .
If that was what happened , you passed .

The 8 - bit and 16 - bit Nintendo markets have really taken off in the last five years even in comparison to the growing retro gaming landscape as a whole .
At the same time , we are starting to see some of the true rarities and gems surface into collectibles and some less rare classics hold steady instead of getting further out of hand .
With so many more obscure games rising in value , this list could give you more motivation to dig through your piles for valuables and give you a solid reference while treasure hunting in the wild .
While it may not be a surprise , boxed copies are continuing to see even more of a premium .
In stark contrast to the Cheapest Games series , this Rare and Valuable series will round up the rarest and most valuable games for a given console or handheld so you ’ll know what to look for whether you are buying or selling .
Below you will see two prices beside each title .
The first is the average daily selling price , which is typically the going rate for the cartridge by itself .
The second price is the highest daily selling price of recent history .
The list is ordered by the balance of the two prices .
Values Current as of January 2018
The Expensive Super Famicom Releases
It ’s rather difficult to find solid rarity and value information on Super Famicom titles unless you have a Japanese connection , but here are some of the most desirable Super Famicom releases from the research we did .
If you have more to add , please use the comments section below .
Kunio- kun no Dodge Ball Zenin Shuugou Tournament Gold Cart : $ 950 – $ 1200
There were a number of Super Famicom games that were released as limited edition gold carts for tournaments in Japan , one of the most valuable being the Kunio - kun no Dodge Ball Zenin Shuugou Tournament Special .
It was given away as a prize to winners of Technos Japan ’s Dodgeball Tournaments which they used to host several times during 1993 .
There has n’t been a lot of value changes in this cartridge in the last 7 years .
Back in 2010 and 2013 , we had this in the $ 1,100 to $ 1,300 range based on some Japanese Yahoo Auctions , but it can been seen in Japanese shops in a more narrow range .
Rendering Ranger R2 : $ 500 – $ 2200
From the makers of the Turrican series , this run-and - gun shooter is one of the most desirable and beautiful standard - issue Super Famicom games .
It is one of those import titles that is worth the hype , but it has been climbing up in value .
It is hard enough to find a bare cartridge of this game , but boxed copies are quite the rarity .
Loose copies get listed for $ 700 or more without sales on eBay , but $ 500 is the approximate price you ’ll need to sell for if you want it to move quickly .
Complete copies can command more than $ 2000 ( although some have tried listing it for more than $ 3000 without sales ) .
This is a dramatic increase from our 2013 valuation of a $ 120 to $ 299 price range for loose and complete .
Iron Commando : $ 240 – $ 1220
This Final Fight clone was put out by French developer Arcade Zone in 1995 .
It was localized for a PAL release , but that was later cancelled .
It has been seen at Japanese game shops for $ 1000 but has sold for more than $ 1200 complete on eBay .
It is also worth mentioning that Piko Interactive completed funding for an Indigogo campaign to obtain rights to reproduce NTSC SNES cartridges of the game and sell them for $ 45 for a cartridge and $ 55 for a boxed edition .
It will be interesting to see what long - term effect this development has on the valuation of the Super Famicom version .
Magical Pop’n : $ 200 – $ 1200
This cute gem is like a arcade - friendly Metroid with extra Japanese cuteness that you might expect from the likes of Cotton , Magical Chase , or Kid Dracula .
It did n’t really get much exposure outside of Japan until recent years , but as collecting of the 16 - bit era heats up , this is increasingly becoming one of the hot imports with the perfect blend of rarity and interesting gameplay and style .
Back in 2013 , this lovely title was going for a range of $ 180 to $ 250 , but you ca n’t blame 16 - bit Nintendo fans for scooping this up to round out their collections and skewing the supply and demand curves .
Fire Emblem Box Set Fire Emblem Thracia 776 Box Set : $ 300 – $ 330
Before the Fire Emblem series came to the West on the GBA and Gamecube , it was a very popular strategy RPG series in Japan .
To satisfy the many fans of the series , a feature - packed box set was released that included maps , posters , toys , and other cool stuff .
What makes this particular Fire Emblem entry so rare is that it was such a late release in the Super Famicom ’s lifespan .
It was originally released in 1999 on a Super Famicom flash cartridge through Nintendo Power and received this extremely limited release in 2000 – just one year before the Gamecube launched .
Check out this forum thread to see pictures of the complete Box set .
Since we bought more attention to this set earlier in the decade , we have seen more boxed units surface on eBay .
The value certainly has n’t declined , but it has had a modest increase from its 2013 $ 150 – $ 270 valuation ( There were fewer complete / pristine copies at the lower value , so good condition sets really only increases 10 % to 15 % ) .
Limited Edition Collectables
Nintendo Powerfest 1994 : $ 10,000 – $ 23,000
Nintendo experienced a wave of hype from their 1990 World Championship competition ( the buzz from the 1989 film , The Wizard , may have helped ) , and the resulting game cartridges that were given out to finalists ( gold ) and used in the competition ( grey ) have become holy grail fixtures in video game collecting .
In 1994 , Nintendo tried to replicate the experience during their Super Nintendo era , but for various reasons , it did n’t quite build up quite the same enthusiasm .
In the US , the NES dominated the 8 - bit era and was synonymous with video games .
The SNES was still indeed popular , but Sega had kicked in as the “ cool kid ” by 1994 .
Nintendo also did not follow the same model of giving out and using collectible game cartridges this time around .
Instead the 1994 Powerfest used beefy , improvised cartridges containing several EPROMs ( one for each game plus the front - end in addition to a DSP chip to be used in Super Mario Kart ) and 8 dip switches to customize the amount of time players got to spend playing the games .
The Powerfest Competition tested how many points could be racked up in a certain amount of time in level 1 –1 of Super Mario Bros. :
The Lost Levels , the first track of the Mushroom Cup in Super Mario Kart , and the home run derby in Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League Baseball .
Nintendo produced around 33 cartridges for the PowerFest ’ 94 .
These were used in stores across the country in 1994 for around 130 different events .
The winners of each event won a trip to San Diego , CA to play in the World Championships .
The second - place winner at each event got a Star Fox Jacket , which had been left over from the Star Fox Competition the year before .
Out of the 33 cartridges , there is said to be only two remaining today .
The rest were supposedly returned to Nintendo where they were reused for parts .
This relative rarity combined with the growing hype and valuations of the NES Championship Cartridges has led a certain group of collectors to pay large sums to own a copy .
One of the owners put up his cartridge on an auction in 2007 for $ 50,000 , but it failed to attract an offer .
Collector and game store owner , JJ Hendricks , bought the other cartridge in a private exchange for $ 12,000 in 2012 and then re-sold a year later on eBay for $ 23,100 .
Since these cartridges are n’t polished , and decorated cartridges intended to be in the hands of a Nintendo fan , it should n’t be surprising that the valuations are n’t at the same level as a NES Championship Cartridge .
One could argue that there are n’t really in the same league as the valuable retail games or collectors editions but instead more of a rare promotional cartridge that leans towards a prototype build .
Nintendo Campus Challenge 1992 : $ 4,000 – $ 7,000
The Nintendo Campus Challenge cartridge was created by Nintendo for a video game competition like the Nintendo World Championships in 1990 ( and later the Powerfest in 1994 , mentioned above ) , but these contests would tour college campuses and spring break hot spots .
There was a competition and accompanying cartridge in 1991 for the NES ( see the NES Rare and Valuable guide plus our look at the 1991 NES Campus Challenge Cartridge ) , but this Super Nintendo installment took place a year later in 1992 .
This particular competition tested players ability on Super Mario World , F - Zero , and Pilotwings .
Much like its NES counterpart ( and the later ’ 94 Powerfest ) , these bulky cartridges were supposed to be destroyed and not designed for fan or collector consumption .
Currently , there seem to be three known 1992 Campus Challenge cartridges .
One was found in 2006 at the same New York City garage sale by Rob Walters as the 1991 cartridge .
The cartridge is owned by a video game collector named Rick Bruns .
A second unit was listed on eBay in 2011 .
A third unit was found in 2012 within an attic of a former employee of a company who did projects for Nintendo .
Like the ’ 94 Powerfest cartridge mentioned above , these are items that start out as “ one - of - a- kind ” items until more get discovered and are only worth what people are willing to pay .
Back in 2011 ( back before the third unit was discovered ) , the eBay auction closed with no bids with an asking price of $ 15,000 .
Before that , the first unit sold in a private sale for $ 4,000 in 2006 ( when it was the only known unit ) .
So supply has increased , but values have yet to officially climb .
M.A.C.S. Multipurpose Arcade Combat Simulator 1500
By now , most of us have heard about military use of video games to train soldiers in an inexpensive and low - risk environment .
It maybe be rather surprising , however , to learn that the the US Army used Super Nintendos for combat training .
The Multipurpose Arcade Combat Simulator ( or M.A.C.S. ) was a shooting simulator that was teamed with a rifle peripheral .
The light gun rifle used is a replica of a Jäger AP 74 ( an M16A2 clone ) .
The unit is far more accurate than the Super Scope and has the weight and feel of an authentic weapon .
The gun includes a scope used for aiming , and the light sensor is in the barrel of the gun .
The cord that connects to the controller port of the SNES comes out near the end of the barrel .
It is worth noting that the game cannot be played with a standard controller although a Super Scope can be used .
The cartridges that came with the guns were rather generic SNES cartridges with a white label and black text .
Rumor is that there were only about 600 of these units produced , and many less are likely to have survived in good condition .
You can find more info and pictures here .
Exertainment Mountain Bike Rally / Speed Racer Combo : $ 1000 – $ 4800
While some people are hawking the single game carts for a handful of money , the rare version of these games actually has both the Speed Racer and Mountain Bike Rally game on it together for use with the LifeFitness Bike Unit .
It is one of the rarest games for the system as it may have not seen full or even any retail distribution .
This 2 in 1 most likely never made it to stores , and most copies that have been found have been from Nintendo of America ’s warehouse itself .
Loose cartridges have been hovering in the $ 1000 to $ 1900 range .
A boxed copy finally showed up and sold successfully in 2014 for about $ 2700 .
A sealed copy later sold in 2016 for $ 4800 .
However , another sealed copy was listed for $ 3700 in 2017 from a reputable seller and did not sell successfully .
Batman Forever Woolworths Box Set : $ 900 – $ 1000
This PAL Limited Edition box set was only available from Woolworths and is very hard to find .
The set includes the game , a “ Making Of ” VHS , Batman diary , Batman sticker , competition entry form , and the outer slipcase .
As many of you know , the game was n’t especially popular , and in the days of people not really collecting video games , most people who purchased it would not have kept all the items and packaging together let alone in good condition .
It has surfaced on eBay a few times in recent years , but it has n’t always reached its asking price .
It just recently sold complete for about $ 1000 .
Donkey Kong Country Competition Cartidge : $ 1200 – $ 2500
Donkey Kong Country Competition cartridges were used exclusively by Blockbuster Video stores in tournaments held within the store .
The competition cartridge is rumored to have a print run of 2,500 copies and looks very similar to the standard commercial release other than the little accent in the corner of the label .
If you ’re lucky , there are also official clamshell cases out there that are green plastic and have some special cover art .
As typical with most video rental stores , a few leftover carts were tossed into the bargain bins for customers to purchase .
Nintendo Power also offered some extra carts in their catalog .
These “ official ” means of distribution makes them a little less mysterious than other Nintendo and Sega competition cartridges , but it ’s still a pretty cool collectors item .
Bare carts can go for between $ 1200 and $ 2000 recently .
There has also been an empty case with artwork sell for $ 500 .
You can do the math on what complete copies can reach , but it ’s worth noting that the $ 3900 listing did n’t close with a bid on eBay .
Star Fox : Super Weekend Cartridge : $ 400 – $ 1000
Much like the DKC Competition cartridges , this Star Fox cart was used by Blockbuster for game tournaments , and extra carts were sold off by Blockbuster and Nintendo Power .
An article included in the original packaging suggests that the Starfox Weekend cart actually had a smaller production number ( around 2,000 ) than the DKC cart , but for some reason , the Star Fox cart has shown up on auction sites a bit more often and has fetched a lower price .
Back in 2013 , it had been listed on eBay a number of times and not sold for asking prices of $ 255 and $ 285 .
However , as more interest in Super Nintendo collecting has grown , we have seen loose copies sell for $ 1000 on eBay
It does n’t seem that this cartridge was offered with packaging like the Donkey Kong Country cart , but there were other related items offered
Treasured Standard North American Releases
Hagane : The Final Conflict : $ 675 – $ 1375
This was a hidden gem for many years and has recently become one of the best Super Nintendo collectors pieces .
Just a handful of years ago , you could find a copy of this game for around $ 50 .
However , in July of 2012 , Mike of AVGN posted this video of obscure SNES games that praised Hagane and mentioned it being a Blockbuster - exclusive title although some Blockbuster store managers mentioned that they saw it sold new in Electronic Boutiques stores .
Regardless , the fire of rare game talk was lit , and Hagane has been near the top of SNES collectors ’ lists since .
We may never truly know what the real circumstances are ; we can only observe the true supply and demand on the open market .
The game itself is a side - scrolling action game from Hudson Soft that has a graphical style that feels more at home on the Genesis or TG16 and a gameplay style that seems inspired by the likes of Shinobi III on the Genesis .
Aero Fighters – $ 600 – $ 1450
Aero Fighters was released as an arcade game in 1992 and then ported to the SNES two years later in very limited quantities .
After being under the radar for a while with collectors of 2D shooters driving prices of many 16 - bit shmups up , this gem is finally getting more recognition in collecting circles and has taken off in value and keeps climbing with prices nearly doubling every few years ( could n’t avoid the aviation analogies ) .
The $ 1400 value mentioned above for a complete copy actually a conservative estimate .
I have n’t seen a successful sale of a complete copy on eBay in a while , but asking prices currently range from $ 1500 to $ 2500 for an opened complete copy ( There ’s even a graded , sealed copy up for $ 11,000 + right now .
Loose cartridges can clear up to $ 800 in pristine shape , and an empty box by itself ( not even 100 % pristine ) is currently listed on eBay for $ 1000 ( or best offer ) , if that gives you any indication .
Mega Man X3 : $ 240 – $ 1250
The NES and SNES both were crucial platforms for fans of the Blue Bombers , and this particular beauty has continued to climb several of spots on this list each time we update the guide .
Mega Man X3 has essentially doubled in value every three years since 2010 .
Mega Man X3 was one of two games to use a specialized chip called Cx4 that allowed for some 3D graphics in games ( Mega Man X2 being the other title ) .
Because of this chip , it is an oddity and has some of the best graphics on the SNES .
It is also quite hard to find .
These two factors combine to make it one of the more expensive Super Nintendo games .
Earthbound : $ 190 – $ 1500 ( +$ 4000 sealed )
One of the easiest to find games on this list , Earthbound is also one of the most popular .
The game is famous for its cult like following of fans , and those who love it most are always on the hunt for one in wonderful condition .
Earthbound a non-traditional RPG taking place in suburbia , and the game ’s weapons are everyday household items .
It is still regarded as one of the most enjoyable RPGs to this day .
Prices have increased quite a bit for Earthbound over the last decade .
Back in 2007 , you could score a cartridge for under $ 70 and a complete copy for about $ 180 , but it has seen been doubling in value every 3 years ( for each condition level ) .
Currently , loose copies range from $ 130 to $ 250 each .
Complete copies go from $ 400 to $ 1500 depending on condition of the box and manual .
A sealed copy recently sold for $ 4000 ( up from $ 2500 four years ago ) .
Pocky & Rocky 2 : $ 285 – $ 1050
This installment of cult - classic series from Taito and Natsume is often regarded as a favorite in the franchise .
It ’s a charming top - down shooter that has an adventurous story and support for 2 - player co-op .
I ca n’t blame collectors for wanting to round out their Super Nintendo collection with this gem .
Pocky & Rocky 2 has always been quite hard to find in the wild , but in the last 5 years , more attention has been drawn to the game , and eBay hunters often swarm when it shows up for auction .
Back in 2013 , you could find it for less than $ 100 for a cartridge and $ 300 complete .
Now , you ’re looking at nearly $ 300 for a cart and $ 400 to $ 1000 + for a boxed copy depending on condition .
EVO the Search for Eden : $ 200 – $ 750
The game can not only be tricky to find , but is has a bit of a following .
It is a unique platforming / role - playing game that is based around the evolution of a creature .
It can be rather slow - paced and has lots of grinding , but it has an interesting way of letting you determine how your create evolves ( which also adds to re-playability ) .
Being a truly unique RPG title and a SNES exclusive helps solidify its collectibility for the platform .
( SNESDrunk has a great video of EVO , in case you are interested )
EVO made a huge jump in value between 2010 ( $ 60 to $ 115 ) and 2013 ( $ 150 – $ 200 ) , but the last four years have seen a bit slower growth than some of its peers mentioned above .
Cartridge values have seen a modest 25 % increase over 4 years , but complete copies have more than tripled in value .
Also worth noting that back in 2013 , we saw a sealed copy sell for $ 3,500 but have not seen another sealed copy sell recently .
Final Fight Guy : $ 200 – $ 950
The original Super Nintendo port of the arcade classic ( released in 1991 ) only had two playable characters – Mike and Cody – with the third character , Guy , trimmed to help it fit on a cost - effective cartridge .
This second variation of the classic Final Fight brawler had a full retail release in Japan a year later .
It swapped out Cody and let you play as Guy instead .
In the States , this variation did n’t show up until the summer of 1994 as a rental exclusive at Blockbuster stores .
It eventually had a very limited retail release .
Metal Warriors : $ 200 – $ 900 ( +$ 2650 sealed )
This sidescroller was published by Konami but developed by LucasArts .
Metal Warriors is very much influenced by Cybernator / Assault Suit Valken franchise and is considered by some to be an unofficial spinoff of the series .
According to an interview with the developer , it was built on the game engine of “ Zombies Ate My Neighbors , ” but you ’d never guess by looking at it .
Metal Warriors has slowly built up a bit of a following among collectors and has recently begun climbing these rankings .
Loose cartridges range from $ 150 – $ 265 each while complete copies range from $ 520 to $ 900 depending on condition of the box and manual .
A sealed copy also recently sold for $ 2651 .
Wild Guns : $ 225 – $ 800
There are n’t a ton of Western - based video games or really good Cabal clones ( shooting gallery - style shmups ) , but Wild Guns delivers in every area from graphics , music , controls , and challenge .
With this being a high - quality , unique SNES exclusive , it ’s not hard to see why the value of this game has been climbing , especially for complete copies .
Wild Guns has essentially doubled in value since its $ 140 to $ 400 range in 2013 , although before that , it was actually a rather affordable gem .
Mega Man 7 : $ 200 – $ 1000
After seeing NES Mega Man games rise in value , it is no surprise to see the trend continue with the SNES installments .
While Mega Man 7 did n’t really bring anything new to the series ( and was possibly even a step backwards for Capcom ) , it still ended up as a collector ’s item .
It is the first and only title in the main series to make use of 16 - bit graphics , and the eight Robot Masters in the game are the product of design contests held for fans in Japan .
Mega Man 7 has actually appreciated quicker than most games on this list .
Back in 2010 , you could find cartridges for under $ 40 and a mint boxed copy for under $ 80 .
2013 jumped to a $ 100 – $ 306 range before going from 2X to 3X of that today .
Zombies Ate My Neighbors ( Box Variant ) : $ 400 – $ 1000
This classic top - down shooter with a humorous flair was developed by LucasArts and saw solid commercial exposure on both the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis , but it can be extremely difficult to find the game with this late - release artwork .
There were some rumors that this variant was only sold in Mexico , due to these particular boxes stating they were “ Made in Mexico ” .
There are actually a good handful of SNES titles that had notices of being made in Mexico , but they were all sold in the US and other parts of North America .
The more logical explanation is that for a later run of games after the ESRB ratings were put in place , Konami ( who served as the game ’s publisher ) decided to change out the artwork .
Most gaming fans actually prefer this artwork as it captures the personality of the game and is a great illustration .
Sadly , the game cartridge and the manual still features the original commercial artwork .
Because the artwork is only a variant on the outer box , the pricing above is only either the empty box , boxed , and complete copies of the game .
The bare cartridge does not have any premium .
See our forum discussion for more info and photos of this great variant .
Harvest Moon : $ 155 – $ 555
The original Harvest Moon was released on the Super Nintendo the same year the Nintendo 64 was launched , so many gamers had already moved onto Nintendo ’s new console and did n’t bother picking up this game .
However , the Harvest Moon series eventually grew into cult classic series ( including an installment on the aforementioned N64 ) , and many fans and collectors starting hunting down the cartridge that started it all .
Even with the series picking up beforehand , we have seen some strong value appreciation over the last 8 years .
In 2010 , the game was selling for $ 57 for a cart and less than $ 100 in complete form .
2013 saw a jump to the $ 150 to $ 500 range , and it has seen modest increases since then .
Incantation : $ 175 – $ 400
This little title got lost in obscurity due to being seen as a mediocre Mega Man knock - off at the very end of the SNES ’s lifespan .
The developer , Titus , already had a relatively bad reputation during the 16 - bit generation , so the game really got buried in the bargain bins by the time it left stores .
Over the last two decades , Super Nintendo collectors have been trying to flesh out more of their collections , and finding this piece can be be a challenge to track down in good condition .
Back in 2010 , the cart could be found for $ 15 and complete boxed for only $ 25 .
Once it got on collectors ’ radars , we saw a rise to a $ 60 to $ 760 ( sealed ) range in 2013 .
Loose copies have nearly tripled since then and complete copies remain strong .
Super Turrican 2 : $ 195 - $ 540
This installment of the underground - popular run-and - gun series saw a release late in the Super Nintendo ’s platform life .
Between the rather niche following and the 1995 release , it should n’t be surprising that there are n’t a lot of copies floating around .
In 2010 , it was pretty easy to find loose copies in the $ 20 range and boxed versions in the $ 50 range .
Collecting heated up by 2013 with values rising to the $ 100 to $ 300 range ( it may have also been boosted by getting retired from the Virtual Console in all regions without explanation that same year ) .
However , in the last 5 years , we have seen values nearly double from that 2013 mark .
Complete copies in solid condition can be tricky to find and command a grand premium .
Castlevania Dracula X : $ 210 – $ 380
Castlevania Dracula
X is the final Castlevania game released on the SNES , and like many games in a series , the later versions did n’t sell initially .
As the Castlevania series got a boost with Symphony of the Night on the PS1 and then the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS , the series saw many more collectors jumping back to older installments .
However , now the series is firmly a pillar in the retro gaming landscape , so there is very little surprise in its collectability .
“ Dracula X ” on the Super Nintendo is actually an adaptation of the classic Japan - exclusive PC Engine game , Castlevania : Rondo of Blood .
While it may be simple to view this SNES version as a port , there are game elements ( including level designs ) that are drastically altered from the original .
It is also worth noting that Dracula X is considered be in a different universe than the official Castlevania timeline .
While not having as dramatic of value increases as some others on this list , we did see Dracula X go from $ 58 to $ 125 in 2010 to $ 100 to $ 230 ( or $ 400 sealed ) in 2013 before nearly doubling again 5 years later .
Chrono Trigger : $ 115 – $ 650 ( +$ 1250 Sealed )
Chrono Trigger is probably one of the most abundant of the games on this list , but it has such a strong bond with Super Nintendo and RPG fans that it commands a strong premium .
As one of the most loved RPG games of all time ( especially outside of the Final Fantasy series but still inside Square ’s domain ) , it is considered an essential addition to any Super Nintendo collection .
Even by Square standards , Chrono Trigger was created by an all - star cast of developers and stands up to the test of time in terms of story and game play .
While we have obviously seen both the SNES and NES libraries inflate in price quite a bit , Chrono Trigger actually has n’t increased in value too much over the last 8 years .
Even compared to 2010 , we have only seen an increase of loose cartridges go from $ 70 to $ 115 now .
Complete copies have even remained around the $ 200 to $ 650 range ( depends mostly on condition , of course ) while sealed copies have stayed around the $ 1200 level since 2010 as well .
Even though Chrono Trigger has a strong following , its heavy premium despite its lack of rarity combined with a DS release and digital re-issues have kept these values in check over the years .
Space MegaForce : $ 155 – $ 395
While RPGs have a stronger presence on the Super Nintendo , shmups have become a strong collecting force on many retro platforms .
The Aleste series from Compile is often a mainstay with collectors , and Space Megaforce ( known as Super Aleste outside of North America ) is the offering for Nintendo ’s 16 - bit platform .
While it did n’t quite get the attention that it ’s Sega Genesis counterpart , MUSHA did , Space Megaforce is starting to climb the ranks for SNES collectors .
Earlier in the decade , the game was mostly isolated to hardcore shooter fans and could be found in the $ 50 range for a cartridge .
It was n’t until about 2014 or 2015 that we really saw values rising .
By 2016 , Space MegaForce had nearly tripled from the levels just two years earlier .
Bronkie The Bronchiasaurus : $ 180 – $ 270
This rarity was part of series of health educational games from Raya Systems that was a simple run-and - jump platformer aimed at teaching children about asthma and how to prevent it .
While the game and Raya ’s series had good intentions , the games are nothing to get excited about other than their current collectible status .
Upon booting up the games , you can tell that Raya Systems ( who was actually a supplier of health devices ) worked with developers that could create a game quickly and cheaply .
YouTuber Kim Justice actually has a brief video discussing their work ( focusing on one of the most unfortunate releases , Captain Novalin ) .
Five years ago , Bronkie could be picked up for about $ 35 for a bare cartridge and about $ 100 for a complete copy .
After getting more exposure , SNES collectors are noticing how hard this title is to find on a regular basis and are willing to pay a premium .
Final Fight 3 : $ 135 – $ 495
Much like Final Fight 2 , this third installment was an exclusive to the Super Nintendo .
Critics at the time of the game ’s release were n’t especially impressed as it did n’t add a whole lot to the formula other than it being the first Final Fight title to give four playable characters .
However , in hindsight , if you are a fan of the series , you can appreciate that Capcom did put some effort into refining the Final Fight experience on the SNES .
Running attacks are a subtle , but welcome addition and there are also special moves that can be pulled off with Street Fighter - like control motions .
Up until 2012 , you could find loose carts of the game for $ 30 to $ 40 and $ 100 for complete .
In 2013 , prices doubled in the span of a year or two and has increased gradually from then .
With it being a solid installment in a classic franchise and a late - release SNES exclusive , it should n’t be too surprising that Final Fight has started to attract attention .
Ghoul Patrol : $ 130 – $ 400
If you ever fell in love with top - down shooter Zombies Ate My Neighbors , you will feel at home with the follow - up , Ghoul Patrol .
LucasArts worked with a third - party developer on Ghoul Patrol , but it runs on essentially the same gameplay engine as Zombies .
Unfortunately , it lost a bit of its charm and humor while adding a few clumsy gameplay elements .
Overall , critics marked it as a “ worthy follow - up ” , but it did n’t get nearly the exposure of Zombies Ate My Neighbors ( the Sega Genesis / Megadrive port was also cancelled )
After being relegated to a forgotten title that would claim only $ 25 to $ 30 for a loose cartridge in 2012 and 2013 , the game started picking up a bit of steam in 2014 .
Ninja Gaiden Trilogy : $ 150 – $ 295 ( +670 Sealed )
After the Ninja Gaiden series was rejuvenated on the Xbox in 2004 , more attention was brought back to the classic games in the series .
This particular cartridge brought back the original NES titles to the SNES with enhanced graphics and music ( plus some slight tweaks to the gameplay ) .
Unfortunately , this release did suffer from some slowdown , unresponsive controls , spotty hit detection , and censorship .
With this all in mind , it is understandable why 1995 gamers did n’t think this warranted a purchase originally .
The Trilogy release remains a nice SNES collectors ’ item , but the value increases have cooled over the last 5 years .
Cartridge prices have only increased about 30 % over those five years and complete copies have really only increased about 10 % or so .
Demon ’s Crest : $ 115 – $ 355
This game is a follow - up to the Gargoyle ’s Quest games on the Game Boy and NES ( and stars Firebrand , a baddie from the Ghosts ‘n Goblins series ) , but unlike its predecessors , shared a dark , gothic feel with the Castlevania series .
After being regulated to its Hidden Gem status for a while , fans have increasingly grown appreciative of Demon ’s Crest ’s mix of standard platforming with mild RPG elements .
However , after rising from obscurity , values have leveled off a bit since 2013 — only increasing about 15 % over five years .
R - Type III : The Third Lightning : $ 120 – $ 225
R - Type III : The Third Lightning is one of the more popular games in the influential shmup series and one of the best shooters on the SNES due to its huge levels , impressive bosses , and a solid difficulty level .
R- Type III also made good used of the SNES ’s Mode 7 graphics to bring in rotating backgrounds .
Irem also worked to cater to the SNES hardware to avoid slowdown .
With this in mind , it is n’t a big surprise that R - Type III never saw an arcade release , but it was eventually ported to the Gameboy Advance .
In the mid 1990s , this was a bold move , but it makes for a nice console exclusive for collectors .
Even though the R - Type series has been a mainstay in the shmup community , cartridges were relatively easy to find in the $ 25 range up until about 2014 when values started to appreciate .
In the next two years , values of the game doubled or tripled .
Complete copies started hitting the $ 200 + mark in 2015 and have stayed rather steady since then .
