The demon was just under three feet tall , horned , and a luxurious shade of crimson .
It was lean , but small straps of muscle cut across its back and arms , indicating a form well suited to labor .
Its mane was thick and black with flecks of gray , woven into a broad rope braided down the beast ’s back .
It sat upon a sheet of newspaper , inside a water stained bamboo cage , gnawing at a toenail with tiny , pointy teeth .
A black cover for the cage was folded neatly on top .
Each bamboo pole was strapped to the others with thin , rusty wire .
“ I do n’t see the purpose . ” said Charles Smith , “ For the price you are asking , I could just hire a girl to do chores around the house for the next three years .
No hiding her from sight , no locking her in a cage .
Why would I want a demon wandering about my home ? ”
“ A girl is so common . ” said the shopkeeper , “ This is something else , something much more exotic .
Let me ask you this – have you ever even seen a denizen of Hades before ? ”
“ No , of course not .
But how do I know this is n’t some strange shaved ape , or mutant kid , or , hell , I do n’t know . ”
The imp looked up at Charles and whip cracked its tail three times in rapid succession .
“ Demon ! ” it said , “ From Hell ! ”
It pronounced Hell like an evangelist would – Hayallll .
“ It talks ? ” Charles said , trying to hide his interest .
The sum for the creature was absurd .
“ Sometimes . ” said the shopkeeper , “ When it wants to .
It is quite intelligent , quite a servant , quite dastardly .
It ’s straight from the seventh circle you know .
Formerly a castle servant to Lucifer himself , so it told me once .
The story made my skin crawl . ”
Charles put a considering face on , trying to display uncertainty .
Unfortunately Charles felt the battle was already won .
A demon as a possession was an intriguing thought .
“ Sounds despicable .
All this tasteless satanic nonsense .
Should n’t a Christian such as myself avoid contact with beasts such as this ?
And how did it wind up here anyway ? ”
The shopkeeper laughed , “ Christian , eh ?
Ah well , yes , I suppose I might have misjudged you , for which I deeply apologize .
I would suspect that the possession of a mere imp would hardly tarnish the heart of a charitable man such as yourself , but who would want to gamble ? ”
Gamble was a trigger word in Charles ’ mind .
Charles liked to gamble , and always had .
He frowned ; this shopkeeper seemed to be reading him too well .
“ And as for how it got here ? ” the shopkeeper continued , “ It has been about the island for some time now .
Rumor has it that a hundred years ago it was on a vessel from Haiti that wandered too close to our reef .
A wrecker rescued the crew and confiscated the cargo as payment .
The demon was aboard .
It passed from family to family , I suppose , and eventually … ”
“ I ’ll take it . ” said Charles .
His grandfather had made the family fortune as a wrecker .
Maritime law allowed rescuers to keep the cargo of ships they salvaged back then .
Some claimed that the wreckers would move the lighted buoys on dark windy nights , luring ships onto the reef , only to appear quickly as savior to the crew .
Savior or pirate , the pay had been quite lucrative .
Charles owned one of the largest , most beautiful homes in Key West , which had been handed down to him from his grandfather ’s days .
Charles was the modern day keeper of a great family legacy , and suddenly this imp appeared – bounty from a wrecker ’s cleverness , a treasure in the tradition of the island .
“ I ’ll pay the price .
I want to take it home with me tonight . ”
“ Of course you do . ” said the shopkeeper with a toothy smile .
“ I knew this was the gift for a discerning man such as yourself .
You will be very pleased with … ”
“ I said I would take it . ” Charles interrupted .
He reached into his trouser pockets and pulled out a roll of hundred dollar bills as big as a baseball .
He peeled them off one at a time and sat them on the counter in front of the shopkeeper .
“ A man wit’ many ‘ tings ” said the demon quietly from its cage .
“ Yes , ” said the shopkeeper in agreement , watching the hundred dollar bills stack before him , “ A man with many things . ”
“ What do I feed it ?
What care does it need ? ” Charles asked .
“ No food , sir , is necessary .
Neither does it need water nor air nor anything else that we commonly associate with living things .
It is a creature of the underworld , and can not be killed . ”
Both men looked toward the cage at the imp within .
It was standing now on its clawed feet , peering at them through the bars of the cage .
A small gold ring shone from its right index finger .
It licked its black lips with a forked tongue .
“ It is your servant the moment you leave this store , sir , and as such it will obey your every command .
It is a demon , though , and as such it is mischievous .
Keep it safe and keep it out of trouble .
The easiest way to do that is to either lock it up or keep it busy with tasks .
So long as it is serving you , you will not be disappointed in it .
But should it ever be left to its own devices , well , idle hands … ”
“ Are the Devil ’s playground . ” Charles completed .
“ Anything else ? ”
“ Locked up or busy , ” said the shopkeeper , “ that will be enough .
Should you have any problems , please come see me .
I exist but to please . ”
Another flash of toothy smile , and the deal seemed fully arranged .
Charles grabbed the cage by a ring at its top , and then slid the black cover down to hide the cages contents .
He walked from the store into the cool ocean evening , and strolled home .
The next morning Charles took the cage and sat it on his breakfast table , near a second story window of his million dollar home , in the light of the morning sun .
He lifted the cover , and saw that the demon was cleaning itself by licking its palms and wiping them over its chest and arms .
When it saw the ocean through the window , it let out a coo of delight .
“ Alright Demon , I am your master . ”
Charles said with authority .
“ Oh yes . ” said the imp .
“ And do you intend to obey me ? ” Charles asked .
When the imp nodded its head Charles demanded , “ That ’s not good enough Demon .
I want to hear you say it . ”
“ Oh yes , Master . ” said the imp .
“ And you wo n’t try to escape ? ”
“ No , Master ” the imp whispered .
“ Alright then . ”
Charles said , and undid the clasp to the demon ’s cage .
That day the demon scrubbed the floors and dusted the china .
It polished the silver and made the beds .
It did the dishes and folded the laundry , scrubbed garbage cans , and removed all the staples from some papers Charles was reviewing , then put them into binders .
In the evening , it sat at Charles ’ feet and watched television with him .
It laughed gleefully at the news , which described the horrid slave trade in Asia .
“ You are a terrible beast , are n’t you ? ” Charles asked in amazement .
The imp curled its long pointy tail around his ankle .
The demon proved to be a wonderful companion .
It performed all tasks flawlessly and tirelessly .
Every morning , Charles recited to the demon a list of things that must be accomplished , while it listened closely to his every word .
It never seemed to grow tired , and never needed any food or drink .
When Charles had to go away on business for more than a day , he locked the imp in a cedar chest at the foot of his bed .
After becoming comfortable with the demons ways and patterns , Charles began to trust it to accomplish its tasks while he was not there .
Only once did the demon get into any true mischief .
Charles had left the beast with a list of things to accomplish , and had then went to attend a meeting with the city planners .
The meeting went longer than expected , and when Charles came home late he found the imp talking into the telephone , one hand cupped over its mouth to mask the words .
“ Hey there ! ” Charles shouted , “ What do you think you are doing ? ”
The imp leaped in surprise , then slammed down the phone .
“ Oh , nutting , nutting , I do nutting master .
So sorry , sorry , master .
I do nutting . ”
When Charles stepped forward it threw its arms over its head and shrieked , “ No master !
No pain , no pain !
Do n’t hurt ! ”
Charles scooped up the imp and locked it in its cage , scolding it to never touch the telephone again .
The imp looked utterly dejected .
Not much later the phone rang , and when Charles answered it , a woman with an angry Cuban voice was at the other end .
“ You horrible bastard ! ”
She screeched , “ I star sixty - nine ’d you , and you can bet I am calling the police !
You are a disgusting man and deserved to be locked up forever ! ”
She sounded like she might be crying in her anger .
“ Wait , please . ”
Charles interjected , “ Look , I am so sorry .
It was n’t me who called you .
I am watching a…nephew … a young boy who is not quite right in the head .
He got to the phone while I was n’t watching and made this call .
I am really , truly , terribly sorry that he upset you . ”
“ A child ! ” the woman said in shock , “ How could a boy say such terrible things . ”
Charles listened for a minute while the woman sobbed into the telephone .
He did his best to console her , and to promise her that the nephew would be punished .
She hung up still crying .
“ What in the world did you say to her ? ” Charles asked the demon , but it refused to answer .
“ Well , ” Charles said to himself , “ that ’s why I must keep it busy . ”
A year passed with no further incidents , because Charles was careful to never leave the imp idle again .
It continued to perform its tasks with precision , which indeed made it a wonderful servant .
Periodically , though , it reminded Charles of its origins .
It laughed devilishly at bad news on the television .
Once , it surprised Charles by asking for a baby .
When Charles showed his shock at the request , the imp went silent and refused to discuss the matter any further .
Charles learned that it could be kept quiet and out of trouble for hours with pornographic video tapes , which the imp watched with rapt attention .
“ Horny little devil , are n’t you ? ” Charles once teased .
“ Bah ! ” said the imp , “ Dis is da tame stuff .
Da tings I have seen , now , make dis look like da church choir .
People wit out skin all … ”
“ No need to tell me about it , Demon . ” Charles interrupted , and the imp went back to its videos .
Charles met a woman named Sandy , and their relationship grew .
Sandy had two children , a home in Miami , and a Lexus , all from a previous marriage .
Her children were named Kimberly and Harold .
Whenever any of them came over to Charles ’ place he made sure to first lock the demon up in the cedar chest , with orders to remain quiet .
Sandy bought a condo in Key West so they could see more of each other .
Charles took her children sailing , and spent many contented evenings sitting on the beach with them all , watching the sunsets that have made the Keys famous .
The daughter , Kimberly , turned out to be a true sweetheart , always wanting to cuddle up to Charles and have him braid her hair .
The boy , Harold , was a smart young man who took quick to boating , and loved tales of Charles ’ ancestors , who made their fortunes gathering the treasures of the ocean .
Sandy was a kindred spirit .
She had a keen understanding on when Charles wanted company , and when he was best left alone .
She brought plants into his house , and ensured they survived .
Long before Charles proposed , they were already entertaining fantasies of living their lives in a sailboat , dropping anchor in whatever tropical port the wind blew them to .
Eventually Charles little secret got out .
One day the kids got out of school early and came to visit Charles house as the imp was cleaning windows .
Kimberly let out a high pitched squeal of terror and bolted , and Charles had to run down United Street to catch her .
Since the cat was now out of the bag , he brought the kids back to his home and introduced them to the imp .
“ Where did he come from ? ” Harold asked .
“ Haiti . ” Charles replied , and that was at least partially the truth .
“ Does it do tricks ? ” Kimberly asked .
“ Well , sort of .
But really it is my servant .
It cooks and cleans and takes care of the house . ”
“ He looks mean . ” Kimberly stated from the safety of Charles ’ arms .
The demon snapped its tail in the air and continued cleaning windows .
“ Momma wo n’t like it . ”
“ No . ” Charles said , “ I guess she wo n’t . ”
Men who think too much often find the concept of marriage daunting .
As the love between Charles and Sandy grew , Charles found himself checking off a list of her faults in his mind , and then cursing himself for his stupidity .
She was not perfect , but neither was he , and their imperfections fit together perfectly .
She opened a T - shirt shop on Duval Street and was turning a profit in the first year .
On her birthday , she received a phone call from the Governor of Florida , who she chatted with for half an hour .
She was smart , successful , sexy , and he found her positive outlook contagious .
Charles had his grandmothers ’ wedding ring cleaned and cut to Sandy ’s size .
The night before he intended to ask her hand in marriage Charles grew excessively nervous .
He called up some old chums and demanded they drop everything to go out drinking .
He took the demon and sat it on his lap facing him .
“ Now look Demon , I am asking Sandy to marry me tomorrow .
I need this house as clean as it can possibly get .
I want the floors swept and mopped and the stairs scrubbed .
I need the windows spotless and every dish in the entire house , clean or not , wiped down .
I want beds made and carpets beaten .
Clean out the light fixtures .
Polish the silver and brass .
Clean the soot from the chimney .
I want the bathroom spotless , the tub and the loo must shine !
Fold all the towels and stack them neatly in the closet .
Water the plants , but not too much now .
I do n’t want to take the blame for them dying .
Rearrange the cupboards ; I never liked the glasses where they are .
I want them put in the cupboard over the sink , and the spices put over the stove where they belong .
You can watch video tapes while you work if you want , but not too loudly , and stay away from the telephone ! ”
The demon took it all in with diligent attention .
It nodded , accepting its orders and confirming its understanding .
Charles sighed ; he wondered how in the world he would ever live without it .
It was his full intention to return the demon to the shop tomorrow .
When Charles met his buddies at Irish Kevin ’s , they did n’t know what the motivators were , but they could tell that Charles was in the mood to party .
They had a hell of a night .
They got every woman on Duval Street drunk , including two strippers from Teasers .
Bill Carmichael , who was a bastard when it came to zoning regulations and one of the most feared men in Key West , actually stripped to his underwear and danced on the bar .
The bouncers were told to let them go - it was going to be one of those nights .
They ended the night at Bill ’s house , drinking scotch and smoking illegal Cuban cigars .
The two strippers danced for them , and Stoney Walters declared himself sober enough to take them both on .
The three of them retired into Bill ’s master bedroom , leaving Bill and his wife to take the guest room .
Charles puked in Bill ’s backyard , leaning his shoulder against a coconut tree , and then passed out in Bill ’s hammock .
Charles woke the next morning to his cell phone ringing and the morning sun shining into his eyes .
It was barely seven in the morning .
“ Good morning . ” said Sandy from the other end of the cell phone , “ I have been briefed by some girl friends about your partying last night , you bad boy you . ”
“ Oh , Sandy , ” Charles groaned , “ you ’re going to have to be extra patient with me today . ”
“ I ’m patient with you every day , Lover .
I just do n’t let you sleep in . ”
She replied .
“ But I think we are both going to want this day to be as perfect as possible . ”
Charles said , and the phone went quiet .
That was the only hint he planned on giving her , but he knew that it would be enough .
She would be her most beautiful when he met her in the evening .
“ I love you , Charles . ” Sandy said .
“ Then let me sleep . ” Charles said laughing , and hung up on her .
That was a mischievous thing to do , but he knew she would take it well .
That ’s why he loved her ; she took things so very well .
There was no more sleep in Charles .
He felt grimy from sleeping outdoors and his mouth tasted awful .
His stomach was giving warning signs , but altogether he was nowhere near the condition he deserved .
He wondered how much they had all spent on drinks last night .
Thank God for good friends and booze .
Charles car was still parked off Duval Street , so he decided to just walk home .
He stopped off at Dennis Pharmacy for a cup of coffee , and by the time he made it to his front walk it was almost noon .
Something was cooking .
Charles smelled the unmistakable aroma of wood smoke and sizzling meat .
He opened his front door and found his house as spotless as he wanted it to be , except , of course , for the body of a young girl in the kitchen .
It was Kimberly .
She had been bound at the ankles and wrists with an extension cord .
Her face was barely visible in silhouette through the white garbage bag that had been put over her head and taped around her neck .
Charles screamed .
Not a peep or a whimper or a sharp intake of air , but a full bodied , from the diaphragm , bellow of fear .
He ran around the body on the floor , heading for the back yard , but slipped on part of Kimberly ’s dress and cracked his forehead against a corner of the stove .
Blood immediately began to ooze from the cut and drip onto the tile .
He got up , holding his aching head with a grimace , and ran to the back door .
As soon as the door opened he saw it all .
There was the imp , turning an improvised spit .
Harold was skewered through the mouth and anus on a galvanized steel fence post , bound at intervals along its length with sisal rope from Charles ’ garage .
He looked just about done , with skin crisped to the same shade of red as the imps .
Charles howled with terror and grabbed for a nearby push broom .
He broke the broom against the imp ’s back .
The imp squealed and accepted three more hits , hard ones , before running into the house bawling , and hiding itself beneath a sofa .
Charles lost all reason .
He grabbed for the fence post and partially lifted it , then dropped it when the heat burned through to his frenzied brain .
His hands were instantly blistered , and he wound up dropping the end of the pole off its sawhorse .
Harold ’s body , still skewered , crashed into the wood fire in a shower of sparks .
Charles realized he had to get the boy out of the fire , then realized he did n’t want to touch the body , then realized he had to .
He ran into the house in total confusion and revulsion , and fell onto the cool floor of the dining room , gasping for air .
After laying there for some time , questions began to form in his mind .
What would he do ?
Should he kill the demon ?
Could he kill the demon ?
What would he tell the police ?
What would he tell Sandy ?
Could he hide the bodies ?
Should he confess the truth ?
Should he make up a lie ?
Had his neighbors heard his yelling , or peeked over the fence to see a young boy cooking ?
“ Demon , ” Charles said , “ go get Harold ’s body and bring it inside here .
Do it right goddamned now ! ”
The demon leapt out the door to comply .
It came back into the house seconds later , dragging at one end of the spit , quite unconcerned about the heat .
It eyed Charles cautiously .
“ Get him off that pole , you rat fuck of a bastard ! ” Charles screamed , and the imp leaped in fright , then planted its clawed little feet against the boy and pulled at the fence post .
It came out of the boys wide open mouth with the predictable sounds of teeth and gristle reverberating through the hollow , galvanized steel .
Harold now looked burned on one side .
“ I do as you say , Boss . ” said the demon , and grinned nervously at Charles , as if hoping for praise .
Charles leapt at the imp , grabbing it around the waist before it could get away .
He punched it several times , as hard as he could , on its head and round red belly .
It whined and cried , and no matter how much hatred Charles had inside him , he could not get it out of his mind that it felt like he was beating up a child .
He carried it by the neck to its cage , threw it in , and clasped the door shut .
He put the black cover over the cage and carried it , running , out his front door .
Charles ran down United Street carrying the cage , right past one of his neighbors .
Mr. Crandal was wearing a faded , old Hawaiian shirt and palm frond hat .
“ That pig you ’re roasting smells almost done . ”
He yelled at Charles as Charles ran by .
“ Nancy and I have smelled it all night .
Smells damned good too .
You know it takes a long time to get them done in the middle .
I remember … ” But Charles was already gone .
Several tourists stopped and stared as Charles darted past , a wild eyed man with blood dripping from his forehead , carrying some small animal in a cage .
By accident , Charles ran right over a young woman in a string bikini .
Her boyfriend yelled viciously at him , but by the time he got done checking to make sure she was alright , Charles was already a block away , and not slowing at all .
He arrived at the shop in the very brightest part of a Key West summer day .
“ I need help ! ” Charles screamed .
It was dark in the shop , and it seemed there was nobody there but the shopkeeper , still bolted to his position behind the counter .
“ Something wrong , sir ? ” the shopkeeper asked .
“ The demon , this , this thing - I do n’t want it .
I am in trouble .
What do I do if it has done something wrong ? ”
“ Wrong , sir ? ” asked the shopkeeper .
“ Terribly wrong . ” Charles confirmed .
“ Ah .
Idle hands then , I suppose .
What can I possibly do ?
It is n’t a washing machine , you know .
I ca n’t just contact the manufacturer and tell them that it has spit suds all over your carpet . ”
The shopkeeper shrugged .
“ There is nothing that can be done . ”
A sudden cool calmness came over Charles .
If he had any sense left , he might have been shocked at the next thing he said .
“ You call someone .
You call the right someone .
I am holding a demon in a cage and the two children of the woman I love are dead in my house because of it .
You call the right someone right now or the cops will find you cut up in the freezer . ”
“ Well , ” said the shopkeeper , seemingly nonplussed , “ perhaps I can contact the manufacturer after all .
You go home now , sir , and take the demon with you .
By the time you get there , some … one … will be arriving to help you resolve this issue . ”
Charles left the shop .
He vowed that if the shopkeeper called the police , Charles ’ last act would be to follow through on his promise to put the shopkeeper in the freezer , in individually wrapped pieces .
The sun was very bright , and Charles had never been as physically , emotionally , and mentally wrecked as he was at that moment .
He stumbled down the street with a dazed expression that made people get out of his way .
The imp was restless inside its cage .
He could feel it stirring around nervously .
Charles wound up passing the young man whose girlfriend he ran over earlier .
The man , who was walking around shirtless to expose his impressive chest and abdomen , grabbed Charles by the nape of the neck .
“ I ’m gonna break your fucking face . ”
The young man said .
He cocked back a fist that looked , indeed , capable of shattering bone .
Charles lifted up a part of the cover and showed the young man the demon in its cage .
“ Wha ... what ’s that ? ”
The young man asked , stepping backward .
Charles continued heading home .
By the time he got there , not much later , the Bargainer was already waiting .
He looked to be a vampire , dressed all in black , skin unnaturally pale , eyes washed out gray .
The Bargainer was examining the corpse of the girl .
He had already ripped through the garbage bag over her face , and was looking at her teeth .
She had died screaming , it seemed .
“ Quite a mess you have here . ”
The Bargainer said .
On the sound of his voice , the imp went wild in its cage , thrashing from side to side and making wild monkey sounds .
It began to speak in a rapid fire tongue which Charles could not quite understand .
“ Ah , I see it remembers me . ”
The Bargainer smiled and took long , graceful strides to stop in front of Charles .
It was at least eight feet tall .
“ You have been gone long , my dove . ”
The Bargainer pulled up the cover .
The imp was crouched in its cage , as far away from the Bargainer ’s hands as it could get .
“ Now then , what can I do to help ? ” The Bargainer asked Charles .
It clasped its hands together and looked down at him with feigned paternal interest .
“ You can help ? ” Charles asked stupidly .
“ I mean , I mean … how ? ”
“ Well , let ’s see here . ”
The Bargainer said , looking professional .
“ It seems we are a perfect pair .
The problem you have on your hands , and , presumably , want to get rid of , is exactly what I would like to have .
I will take the Orobas from you , and return it to its home . ”
The imp whimpered .
“ And the bodies ? ” Charles asked .
He was numb .
“ Oh , ” said the Bargainer , looking at Charles with interest , “ oh yes , the bodies .
Just let me take a look here . ”
It went to stand straddle over Harold ’s red body , and ran its hands over the charred flesh , muttering to itself in a language that Charles , again , could not understand .
“ Oh certainly , certainly yes .
I can find a use for these indeed . ”
It turned back to look at Charles .
“ Dispose of them , I mean , of course . ”
It said .
Charles mind was n’t working right , but he did his best to think the situation out .
Everything was wrong .
He knew that , but there was nothing that he could do .
The children were dead , and would certainly be missing .
The police would know where to look .
Evidence was certainly all over .
Liquid fat had pooled under Harold ’s body .
A bonfire was still smoldering in his backyard .
At some point he knew that Sandy would come to the horrible conclusion that he had been involved in the death of her children .
So much for the perfect day .
The Bargainer examined each child with satisfaction , paying closest attention to their teeth and palms and soles of their feet .
It caressed the young girls ’ locks of hair .
“ Perfect . ”
It muttered , “ Just so very perfect . ”
It scooped both children up , one in each arm , and looked at them adoringly .
“ Give me the Orobas . ”
It said .
“ Wait . ” Charles said , and the Bargainer looked at him with disappointed malice .
“ Just wait .
Just wait and …and let me think . ”
“ There is no reason to wait , Mr. Smith .
I have given you quite a wonderful deal .
We have agreed . ”
“ Yes , but the children .
Ca n’t you , possibly … ” Charles gulped , “ bring them back ? ”
“ Bring them back ? ” The Bargainer guffawed .
“ Bring them back from the dead , you mean ?
Oh no , no , no , Mr. Smith .
Such a thing , it , well , it reduces my profits now , does n’t it ? ”
The Bargainer looked at Charles with a wide smile .
“ You can have me . ” Charles said , and a great sense of doom , the depths of which he could not comprehend , overcame him .
“ Whatever do you mean ? ” The Bargainer asked .
“ You can have me .
I will be yours .
I will do as you say , forever . ”
Charles sighed .
“ But you have to bring the children back . ”
The Bargainer seemed puzzled , then momentarily shocked .
“ You mean now ?
Right now ?
I can take you when you are still …alive ? ”
It set the children ’s bodies on the floor and looked at Charles with interest .
A live soul .
Such things were very rare , the Bargainer thought , so very , very precious .
The Tempter himself had scant access to them all , and they were an extreme amusement to him .
The Bargainer considered the rewards of bringing a live soul to the Master , the terrible , bloody rewards of a pleased king of Hell .
But raising a person from the dead , now , that was no small thing .
Permission should be obtained , through some very hard administrators .
That took time .
Failure to obtain permission could land him in the arms of the Incubus as punishment .
But then again , if the Master discovered that there had been a chance at getting a live soul , and that opportunity had been squandered ?
Hell hath fury indeed .
“ You drive a hard bargain . ”
The Bargainer said , tapping its fingernails together in nervous thought .
“ I see it runs in your bloodline .
I accept your offer .
I do .
I accept . ”
“ Then let ’s do this , before I try to run . ”
Charles said , but he doubted he had the strength to move .
“ Oh Boss . ”
The imp said from its cage .
“ Oh , da ‘ ting you do now .
It be black .
It be black indeed . ”
The imp looked almost sorrowful .
“ He knows that .
Or , he soon will . ” said the Bargainer as he untied the children .
It lidded its dead eyes in concentration , summoned forth all it was worth in terms of black magic , and fulfilled the deal .
Flesh knit together and smoothed .
Twisted limbs straightened .
Chests heaved in breath .
The children sat up , rubbing their eyes in bewilderment .
They looked at each other for a long moment , and by the time they looked away at the room around them , the others were already off to Hell , suffering an arguably deserved fate .
When the children returned home , their mother was glowing with a serene happiness .
Sandy barely seemed to notice the unusual look in their eyes .
“ Hello my darlings . ”
She called from the bedroom .
She was trying on dresses .
“ How was the sleepover ? ”
The children went to the kitchen , opened a drawer , and each took a large knife in their tiny hands .
“ Today is going to be a perfect day . ”
Sandy called out , partially to them , partially to herself in the mirror .
She let out a contented sigh , and looked toward the doorway , where her little angels stood hand in hand .
When they showed her the knives , she barely knew what to make of the looks in their eyes .
When a federal judge reviews their plea , though , the question ought to be whether the punishment is adequate - along with the judges being bounced from the bench , disbarred , and losing their pensions .
The debate about the use of stop and search – be it protesters or young black and Asian men , be it in the case of stopping knife crime or deterring terrorism – is one that has ( understandably , perhaps ) been fixed on the police results rather than the times they get it wrong .
But it is in the cases where they get it wrong that attitudes towards police are sharpened and the rights we feel we have as citizens practically defined .
So I offer this card for readers to download , print and carry .
It warns police officers that if a stop and search is intrusive , unlawful or malicious , you will pursue the issue through the Independent Police Complaints Commission and , if necessary , to civil proceedings .
You might want to offer this card to an officer before a search takes place .
Enjoy .

Then print , cut it out , fold it in half and carry it around with you .
Radar Magazine has photos taken of octuplet mom Nadya Suleman back when she was pregnant with one of her other many children , and she has a normal size nose and regular non-painful looking lips .
Suleman had people assuming she ’d had extensive work done after she sat down with Ann Curry for her first interview on the day she was released from the hospital last Thursday .
Her lips curled up in an obvious - looking trout pout and her nose was so thin it looked comical .
Suleman cuddled with her babies in the neonatal unit in footage aired on The Today Show yesterday .
She had on filled nail tips that looked entirely out of place on a new mother , even one in the media spotlight .
Many outlets are noting Suleman ’s facial and coloring similarities to Angelina Jolie .
The comparison is not a diss to the actress as she seems to be having children she can take care of , and is more of an observation about Suleman ’s assumed obsession with Jolie .
It ’s interesting that Suleman ’s first interview was with Ann Curry , who is one of Angelina ’s favorites .
If Suleman had it right she ’d adopt some children and work hard so she could take care of them , not foist them off to her parents and try to have as many as she could at once .
This is a woman who is primarily concerned with herself , and seems to see children as an extension of her own needs despite all of her self - righteous statements to the contrary .
Many people are wondering how she could afford such obvious and expensive plastic surgery procedures when she was living on disability and never helped her mother with any of the household bills .
Suleman receives food stamps and child disability payments for three of her children , her publicist has confirmed .
She told Ann Curry “ I ’m not receiving help from the government .
I ’m not trying to expect anything from anybody , ” and added that money was “ superfluous ” and “ paper . ”
Although it was previously reported that Suleman did not get paid for her NBC interview , Jossip has a source that claims she received at least $ 300,000 .
I wonder if her mother , who has been caring for her other six children for years and had to declare bankruptcy after supporting Nadya , will see a dime of that money .

An approach of avoiding HTML form spam is using CSS .
Non-human spammers usually fills out every input field in a form and submit it , and to overcome this kind of spam you must be able to differ between real human form submits and non -human spam .
A technique to distinguish between non-spam and spam is using CSS ; the basic idea is to make an extra dummy input text field in your form , and using CSS to make it invisible to the real human users .
Thereby , if a post is sent to your php script handling the request and this extra text field contains information , you know that the submit must be spam , and the script can ignore the post .
Here is a small example form :
Name : Comment :
The human text field is used for detecting spam , you might call it something else than “ human ” , however this should be hidden by using CSS such that it is not visible for the user on the webpage .
This can be achieved add the following to your CSS file :
#human { visibility : hidden ; display : none ; }
The solution is as you see very to implement and proves to be effective .
Additional notes :
Using JavaScript to hide the dummy input text field is also an option .
E.g. using a JavaScript Framework like Prototype.js it can be done with one line of code :
$ ( ' human ' ) .hide ( ) ;

Bernard L. Madoff is facing life in prison for operating a vast Ponzi scheme that began at least 20 years ago and consumed billions of dollars of other people ’s money .
While his fate will not be certain until he is sentenced , his lawyer told a federal judge on Tuesday that he intended to plead guilty on Thursday to all the criminal charges that federal prosecutors had filed against him  a list that could yield a prison sentence of 150 years .
Mr. Madoff was arrested Dec. 11 at his Manhattan home by federal agents who accused him of running what was perhaps the largest fraud in Wall Street ’s history .
The scheme zigzagged across the world , drawing in foreign banks , hedge funds , charities , celebrities and ordinary retirees who had entrusted their savings to his investment firm .
The charges , made public late Tuesday , offered a few fresh details about how Mr. Madoff conducted his long - running fraud .
And they raised its price tag from his own estimate of $ 50 billion to nearly $ 65 billion , the total amount that thousands of customers were told they had in their accounts at his firm .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. healthcare system is pinched by a persistent nursing shortage that threatens the quality of patient care even as tens of thousands of people are turned away from nursing schools , according to experts .
The shortage has drawn the attention of President Barack Obama .
During a White House meeting on Thursday to promote his promised healthcare system overhaul , Obama expressed alarm over the notion that the United States might have to import trained foreign nurses because so many U.S. nursing jobs are unfilled .
Democratic U.S. Representative Lois Capps , a former school nurse , said meaningful healthcare overhaul cannot occur without fixing the nursing shortage .
“ Nurses deliver healthcare , ” Capps said in a telephone interview .
An estimated 116,000 registered nurse positions are unfilled at U.S. hospitals and nearly 100,000 jobs go vacant in nursing homes , experts said .
The shortage is expected to worsen in coming years as the 78 million people in the post - World War Two baby boom generation begin to hit retirement age .
An aging population requires more care for chronic illnesses and at nursing homes .
“ The nursing shortage is not driven by a lack of interest in nursing careers .
The bottleneck is at the schools of nursing because there ’s not a large enough pool of faculty , ” Robert Rosseter of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing said in a telephone interview .
Nursing colleges have been unable to expand enrollment levels to meet the rising demand , and some U.S. lawmakers blame years of weak federal financial help for the schools .
Almost 50,000 qualified applicants to professional nursing programs were turned away in 2008 , including nearly 6,000 people seeking to earn master ’s and doctoral degrees , the American Association of Colleges of Nursing said .
PAY DIFFERENCES
One reason for the faculty squeeze is that a nurse with a graduate degree needed to teach can earn more as a practicing nurse , about $ 82,000 , than teaching , about $ 68,000 .
Obama called nurses “ the front lines of the healthcare system , ” adding : “ They do n’t get paid very well .
Their working conditions are n’t as good as they should be . ”
The economic stimulus bill Obama signed last month included $ 500 million to address shortages of health workers .
About $ 100 million of this could go to tackling the nursing shortage .
There are about 2.5 million working U.S. registered nurses .
Separately , Senator Dick Durbin and Representative Nita Lowey , both Democrats , have introduced a measure to increase federal grants to help nursing colleges .
Peter Buerhaus , a nursing work force expert at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee , said the nursing shortage is a “ quality and safety ” issue .
Hospital staffs may be stretched thin due to unfilled nursing jobs , raising the risk of medical errors , safety lapses and delays in care , he said .
A study by Buerhaus showed that 6,700 patient deaths and 4 million days of hospital care could be averted annually by increasing the number of nurses .
“ Nurses are the glue holding the system together , ” Buerhaus said .
Addressing the nursing shortage is important in the context of healthcare reform , Buerhaus added .
Future shortages could drive up nurse wages , adding costs to the system , he said .
And if the health changes championed by Obama raise the number of Americans with access to medical care , more nurses will be needed to help accommodate them , Buerhaus said .

Sometimes there are things that just add up to the joy of riding a bike .
It could be the path you take to ride , or the person you ride with or even something as simple as the bike itself !
Matias Conti is an awesome Spanish designer from Barcelona who has designed the supercool Transformable Spin Vehicle .
It is designed to allow the rider to have a number of options regarding style and stance .
It will also have different levels of difficulty to make the rider get adjusted to ride the real thing .
He bike is desigend for those who are aged 12 but the designer says he can design it for adults as well .
This bike reminds me of all those racing games which come with the possibility of adjusting difficulty levels and the like .
I should say , just go for this cool vehicle when it is released .
If you want more information about the bike , the designer would be more than glad to help you out .

To rebut the literalist interpretation of the Genesis creation week propounded by the young - earth theorists is a central concern of this article .
At the same time , the exegetical evidence adduced also refutes the harmonistic day - age view .
The conclusion is that as far as the time frame is concerned , with respect to both the duration and sequence of events , the scientist is left free of biblical constraints in hypothesizing about cosmic origins .
The opening section gives a biblico - theological sketch of the two - register nature of cosmology as presented in Scripture .
The second major section shows how two - register cosmology informs and shapes the treatment of both the space and time dimensions in the Genesis prologue .
It is found that a metaphorical relationship exists between the two levels ; the heavenly level ( upper register ) is described in figures drawn from the earthly level ( lower register ) .
As for the seven - day scheme , it belongs to the upper register and is , therefore , to be understood figuratively , not literally .
The point of the concluding section is that Genesis 1 , on any view that identifies the narrative order with the temporal sequence , would contradict the teaching of Gen. 2:5 concerning the natural mode of providence during the creation process .
A
Two - Register Cosmology
Cosmology of the Genesis Prologue

While the " let there be " is uttered

The summary chart of the space dimension theme in the Genesis prologue ( Table 1 ) shows that two - register cosmology is present not only as a concept but as a pervasive factor in the organization of the composition .
Additional evidence of its influence on the literary structure of the passage will be noted below .
Replication Relationship of the Two Registers
The six days fall naturally into
two triads , one dealing with
creation kingdoms and the other
with the creature kings given
dominion over them .
Table 2

Here again we see that the two - register cosmology construct was a decisive factor in determining the literary shape of the Genesis prologue .

The Time Coordinate
Lower Register Time
The non-sequential nature of the
creation narrative , and thus the
non-literal nature of the creation
" week , " is evident from the
recording of the institution of
lower register time in both the
fi
and fourth day - sections .
All indicators tell us that " in the
beginning " belongs to the upper
register , where Father , Son , and
Spirit act together in sovereign
purpose , word , and power to
create the world .
Upper Register Time
The six evening - morning days
then do not mark the passage of time
in the lower register sphere .
They are not identifiable in terms
of solar days , but relate to the
history of creation at the upper
of the cosmos .
Replication : The Sabbath Ordinance
Cosmogony and Providence
The Genesis 2 Context
The weekly scheme of the Sabbath
ordinance portrays this overall
seventh - day - bound design of
lower register time while it
symbolically mirrors the
archetypal heavenly creation
week itself .
Exegesis of Genesis 2:5-7
Gen. 2:5 reflects an environmental
situation that has obviously
lasted for a while ; it assumes a
far more leisurely pace on the
part of the Creator , for whom a
thousand years are as one day .
Genesis 2:5 and the Creation " Week "
The more traditional
interpretations of the creation
account are guilty not only of
creating a conflict between the
Bible and science but , in effect , of
pitting Scripture against Scripture .

Day the banks were just three hours from collapse
Narrow escape : The Bank of England was forced to contact RBS 's creditors abroad to persuade them not to withdraw their funds
Britain was just three hours away from going bust last year after a secret run on the banks , one of Gordon Brown 's Ministers has revealed .
City Minister Paul Myners disclosed that on Friday , October 10 , the country was ' very close ' to a complete banking collapse after ' major depositors ' attempted to withdraw their money en masse .
The Mail on Sunday has been told that the Treasury was preparing for the banks to shut their doors to all customers , terminate electronic transfers and even block hole - in - the - wall cash withdrawals .
Only frantic behind - the - scenes efforts averted financial meltdown .
If the moves had failed , Mr Brown would have been forced to announce that the Government was nationalising the entire financial system and guaranteeing all deposits .
But 60 - year - old Lord Myners was accused last night of being ' completely irresponsible ' for admitting the scale of the crisis while the recession was still deepening and major institutions such as Barclays remain under intense pressure .
The build - up to ' Black Friday ' started on Monday , October 6 , when the FTSE 100 dropped by nearly eight per cent as bad news on the economy started to multiply .
The following day , Chancellor Alistair Darling began all - night talks ahead of an announcement on the Wednesday that billions of pounds of taxpayers ' money would be used to pour liquidity into the system .
But shares continued to plummet , turning into a rout on the Friday when the FTSE crashed by ten per cent within minutes of opening .
Both Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS were nearing complete collapse - but Lord Myners , who built up his fortune during a long career in the City , said the problems ran far wider .
' There were two or three hours when things felt very bad , nervous and fragile , ' he said .
' Major depositors were trying to withdraw - and willing to pay penalties for early withdrawal - from a number of large banks . '
Lord Myners :
' There were two or three hours when things felt very bad , nervous and fragile '
The threat to the system was so severe that the Bank of England was forced to contact RBS 's creditors in New York and Tokyo to persuade them not to withdraw their funds , but it is not known which other banks faced a run on their reserves .
' We faced the very real problem of how banks could stop depositors from withdrawing their money , ' a Treasury source said yesterday .
' The banks themselves were selling their shareholdings , accelerating the stock - market falls , and preparing to shut up shop .
Mortgages would have been sold on and savers would have been spooked , to put it mildly .
It would have been chaos . '
After a weekend of crisis talks , which concluded at dawn on the Monday , it was announced that Lloyds TSB was taking over HBOS , supported by £ 17 billion of taxpayers ' money , and RBS would receive an injection of £ 20 billion - prompting the resignation of RBS 's infamous chief executive , Sir Fred ' the shred ' Goodwin .
Share prices at last started a small rally .
Ruth Lea , economic adviser to the Arbuthnot Banking Group , said last night that it was ' highly irresponsible ' for Lord Myners to reveal the scale of the problems because it could serve to further wreck already fragile levels of confidence .
' We are not out of the woods yet , ' she said .
' I fear for Barclays , after the fall in its share price , and Lloyds has been damaged by the HBOS takeover . '
She added : ' If it was panning out in that way , then the Government would have had no choice but to step in and nationalise the entire financial system . '
Angela Knight , chief executive of the British Bankers Association , said : ' The issues related only to HBOS and RBS .
To imply that all the banks would have gone under is wrong .
It is complicated . '
Lord Myners also said that bank executives had been ' grossly over - rewarded ' during the ' golden days ' of big bonuses .
' They are people who have no sense of the broader society around them , ' he said .
' There is quite a lot of annoyance and much of that is justified . '

Attorney Bill Smith worked out a plea agreement six years ago so Paul Duran Jr. would be young enough to enjoy life after he got out of prison .
Smith said he ’s sad and disappointed Duran will never have that chance .
Duran , 23 , was beaten and found dead Wednesday night just 15 minutes after being put in a cell at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary with a man he testified against , a state prisons spokesman said .
Duran was in an altercation with Jessie James Dalton , 32 , authorities said .
Dalton was serving a life sentence for the March 2002 shooting death of Billy Ray Wayne , 19 .
Dalton , then 25 , Duran and Warren Alan Plank , 16 , carried guns as they broke into Wayne ’s Oklahoma City home and demanded money from the family .
Duran testified against Dalton in exchange for a lesser charge and a 28 - year prison term , Smith said .
" He was a scared 16 - year - old kid who was hanging out with the wrong guy , ” Smith said .
Smith said Duran was extremely remorseful over Wayne ’s death .
" I remember he apologized to the young man ’s family , ” Smith said .
" If he could have changed what happened that night , he would have . ”
Relatives seek peace
Duran ’s sister , Candace Duran , said the family is treating his death as a private matter .
Smith has been in contact with family members since Thursday .
They ’re crushed and ask the media to give them time to grieve , he said .
Smith said he ’s trying to find out how Duran ended up in a cell with Dalton .
Since Duran testified against Dalton , the two men were ineligible to share a cell .
That type of information is normally listed in a prisoner ’s file , and it ’s the responsibility of the supervising guards to check the file before assigning a prisoner a new cell mate , state Corrections Department spokesman Jerry Massie said .
He said to his knowledge , no agency employees were put on suspension in connection with Duran ’s death .
The district attorney will determine whether to file charges .

Goldblog bemoans the emergence of an anti-Arab racist as the public face of Israel to the world .
We should keep in mind that Lieberman might just have a cold - blooded capacity to make some tough deals .
Begin , after all , signed the treaty with Sadat ; Reagan ended the Cold War ; Nixon went to China ( with that crackpot Freeman ) .
But still .
And Haaretz recently published a poll ( full data in a PDF here ) that reveals how Lieberman 's views of Arabs are not that marginal among Israelis themselves :
Sixty - eight percent of Israeli Jews would refuse to live in the same apartment building as an Israeli Arab , according to the results of an annual poll released Wednesday by the Center for the Struggle Against Racism ...
Forty - six percent of Jews would refuse to allow an Arab to visit their home while 50 percent would welcome an Arab visitor .
Forty - one percent of Jewish support the segregation of Jews and Arabs in places of recreation and 52 percent of such Jews would oppose such a move .
These are attitudes not unlike that of the Jim Crow South .
Lieberman is not that fringe a figure :
The poll further revealed that 63 percent of Jewish Israelis agree with the statement , " Arabs are a security and demographic threat to the state . "
Thirty - one percent of Jews did not agree .
Agreement with the statement was strongest among Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox Jews and low - income earners .
Forty percent of Jews believe " the state needs to support the emigration of Arab citizens " and just 52 percent do n't agree with the statement .
Thirty - four percent also agreed with the statement that " Arab culture is inferior to Israeli culture . "
Fifty - seven percent did not agree with the statement .
Half of Israeli Jews express fear or discomfort when hearing people speaking Arabic .
Eighteen percent of Jews said they feel hate when hearing Arabic speakers .

Another year , another J.D. Power survey .
Since the non-profit Consumer Reports organization prohibits carmakers from using its ratings in their ads , “ ranked highest in initial quality by J.D. Power and Associates ” should start flooding the airwaves and Internet any minute now , with print sure to follow .
But does all of this noise signify anything ?
Should those seeking trouble - free wheels be sure to buy one of J.D. ’s winners ?
Hardly .
First , note the “ initial ” that qualifies “ quality . ”
Power surveys car owners on “ problems ” encountered within their first 90 days of ownership .
Most people understand that a car that ’s reliable for 90 days is n’t necessarily reliable beyond that .
But there ’s a bigger issue .
J.D. Power ’s IQS has been redesigned ( for the second time ) to encompass a larger number of potential defects .
And the more the IQS includes , the less it measures what most people want to know : vehicle reliability .
The previous redesign doubled the average number of reported problems per car by extending the IQS beyond defects ( that can be fixed ) to designed - in annoyances ( that must be endured ) .
For example , cupholder dissatisfaction famously slammed MINI ’s score .
The 2006 IQS report takes a step in the right direction by including subscores for " design quality " and " production quality . "
Combining two very different elements into a single score makes it unclear what the number represents .
Yet this score receives 99 percent of the press coverage and 100 percent of the ad citations .
If you compare the rankings based on production quality alone , the brands ’ relative positions change dramatically .
BMW bounds 24 places to third ; Buick jumps 14 to eighth ; MINI ascends 13 to 16th ; Mercedes - Benz climbs nine also to 16th ; Subaru also gains nine to 19th .
At the same time , Dodge drops eight to 27th ; GMC plummets 13 rungs to 22nd ; Nissan plunges ten , also to 22nd .
Eight others change position by at least five slots .
These include Chrysler , which shares many models with Dodge yet moves up five places , to fifth .
Out of 37 brands , 16 rankings are heavily affected by the inclusion of design quality .
Beyond the cloudiness of the revised methodology , the way the results are reported and spun continues to put too much emphasis on relative rankings .
In fact , absolute differences are often minuscule .
Looking at defect rates alone , 22 out of 37 brands fall within one - tenth of a Problem per Car ( PPC ) of the 0.64 average .
Thirty of 37 brands fall within two - tenths .
Of the seven beyond this range , only one , Lexus , is on the top , and it only betters the average by 0.22 problems per car .
Stay with me here .
The best brand , Lexus , has 0.42 problems per car , while the worst , Isuzu , has 1.10 : a best - to - worst difference of 0.68 problems per car .
Even this range results from a few especially low - scoring brands .
The difference between number three ( Toyota ) and number 32 ( Hummer ) is a scant 0.27 problems per car .
It ’s ironic , since brands at the bottom of the chart receive the least attention in J.D. Power ’s press releases .
For years they did n’t even publicly release below - average scores .
Put another way , a Toyota compared to a Hummer has a one in four chance of having a single additional problem .
Even comparing a car from Isuzu with one from Lexus , only two in three cars will have a single additional problem .
What ’s more , this additional problem is likely to be the only problem .
Folks , we 're talking about a single trip to the dealer for a single problem–which you still face nearly even odds of taking if you buy the best brand .
The reason why J.D. Power lumps design quality into the IQS is clear : without it , the differences between brands are rarely worth debating .
And the smaller the differences , the less people care about IQS .
And the less the pubic cares about IQS , the less automakers will pay to advertise IQS scores , and hire Power consultants to help improve them .
This would truly be a problem– for J.D. Power .
J.D. needs to re-think their methodology and reporting .
They should keep problems that require repair separate from other issues .
Forget the brands , they do n’t vary enough .
Instead , emphasize model scores .
Next , focus less on rankings and who is the best and more on the size of the differences and who is within spitting distance of the best .
Finally , J.D. Power needs to shift their emphasis away from “ initial quality ” towards long - term durability .
Manufacturers wo n’t like that a longer - term study keeps new models off J.D. - branded consumer radar , but anything less is , well , less .
Heck , J.D. Power might even rake in more cash this way .
Anyone reasonably near the top — and not just those at the top — could advertise “ ranked good enough in quality that you should focus on other criteria by J.D. Power and Associates . ”
No , it ’s not punchy .
Just the truth .

Jacob Burckhardt and Robert Conquest : Truth telling titans in the annals of Western historiography
During a thoughtful , revealing interview with the Boston Globe ’s Jeff Jacoby ( published March 8 , 2009 ) , Dutch Parliamentarian Geert Wilders clearly unnerved the mainstream conservative journalist with this frank characterization of Islam :
I have nothing against the people .
I do n’t hate Muslims .
But Islam is a totalitarian ideology .
It rules every aspect of life – economics , family law , whatever .
It has religious symbols , it has a God , it has a book – but it ’s not a religion .
It can be compared with totalitarian ideologies like Communism or fascism .
There is no country where Islam is dominant where you have a real democracy , a real separation between church and state .
Islam is totally contrary to our values
Wilders remained steadfast , dismissing Jacoby ’s invocation of the hollow , if oft repeated trope “ radical Islam is the problem , and moderate Islam is the solution . ”
This tired mantra — reiterated constantly for the past decade without a scintilla of supportive evidence — is defied by hard polling data from 2006 / 2007 , and their most recent follow - up reported February 25 , 2009 .
Overwhelming Muslim majorities i.e. , better than two - thirds ( see the weighted average calculated here ) of a well - conducted survey of the world ’s most significant , and populous Arab and non-Arab Muslim countries , want these hideous , immoderate outcomes : “ strict application ” of Shari’a , Islamic Law , and a global Caliphate .
Specifically , the World Public Opinion.org / University of Maryland poll ( released February 25 , 2009 ) indicated the following about our erstwhile Muslim ally nations of Egypt and Pakistan : 81 % of the Muslims of “ moderate ” Egypt , the largest Arab Muslim nation , desire a “ strict ” application of Shari’a , Islamic Law ; 76 % of the Pakistan ’s Muslims — one of the most important , and sizable non-Arab Muslim populations — want this outcome .
Furthermore , 70 % of Egyptian Muslims and 69 % of Pakistani Muslims desire the re-creation of a “ … single Islamic state or Caliphate . ”
Earlier , I detailed the totalitarian impact of these fulfilled Islamic desires — based upon their doctrinal and historical application , across space and time .
The tenaciously held pieties of Mr. Jacoby and his ilk notwithstanding , Wilders ’ keen , if blunt conceptions articulate contemporary realities irrefragably , while re-stating seminal insights on Islam observed by great scholars whose works antedate the present day morbid affliction of cultural relativism .
Jacob Burckhardt ( d. 1897 ) , an iconic figure in the annals of Western historiography , believed it was the solemn duty of Western civilization ’s heirs to study and acknowledge their own unique cultural inheritance — starting with the culture and heritage of classical Athens .
Burckhardt emphasized how the Western conception of freedom was engendered in Athens , where its flowering was accompanied by the production of some of history ’s most sublime literary and artistic works .
Moreover , while Burckhardt affirmed the irreducible nature of freedom , and upheld equality before the law , he decried the notion — a pervasive , rigidly enforced dogma at present — that all ways of life , opinions , and beliefs were of equal value .
Burckhardt argued that this conceptual reductio ad absurdum would destroy Western culture , heralding a return to barbarism .
And contra the Western legacy of Athens — epitomized by freedom — Burckhardt referred to Islam as a despotic , or in 20th century parlance , totalitarian ideology .
All religions are exclusive , but Islam is quite notably so , and immediately it developed into a state which seemed to be all of a piece with the religion .
The Koran is its spiritual and secular book of law .
Its statutes embrace all areas of life … and remain set and rigid ; the very narrow Arab mind imposes this nature on many nationalities and thus remolds them for all time ( a profound , extensive spiritual bondage ! )
This is the power of Islam in itself .
At the same time , the form of the world empire as well as of the states gradually detaching themselves from it cannot be anything but a despotic monarchy .
The very reason and excuse for existence , the holy war , and the possible world conquest , do not brook any other form .
The strongest proof of real , extremely despotic power in Islam is the fact that it has been able to invalidate , in such large measure , the entire history ( customs , religion , previous way of looking at things , earlier imagination ) of the peoples converted to it .
It accomplished this only by instilling into them a new religious arrogance which was stronger than everything and induced them to be ashamed [ emphasis in original ] of their past
G.H. Bousquet ( d. 1978 ) , one of the foremost 20th century scholars of Islamic Law , explained how Islam ’s unique institution of jihad war , and its eternal quest to impose the Shari’a on all of humanity , represented the quintessence of Islamic totalitarianism .
Writing in 1950 , Bousquet further warned that these ancient Muslim doctrines remained alive , and relevant to the modern era .
Islam first came before the world as a doubly totalitarian system .
It claimed to impose itself on the whole world and it claimed also , by the divinely appointed Muhammadan law , by the principles of fiqh , to regulate down to the smallest details the whole life of the Islamic community and of every individual believer …
Viewed from this angle , the
study of Muhammadan Law ( dry and forbidding though it may appear to be to those who confine themselves to the indispensable study of the fiqh ) , is of great importance to the world of today .
Robert Conquest , in the Preface to the 40th Anniversary Edition of The Great Terror , his seminal indictment of Soviet Communist state tyranny under Stalin , observed :
One of the strangest notions put forward about Stalinism [ substitute Islamic Jihadism ] is that , in the interests of “ objectivity ” we must be — wait for it — “ non- judgmental . ”
But to ignore , or downplay , the realities of Soviet [ substitute Islamic ] history is itself a judgment , and a very misleading one .
Let me conclude with Patrick Henry saying in 1775 , “ I know no way of judging of the future but by the past . ”
The corollary is that misreading of the past incapacitates us as regards our understanding of the future — and of the present too .
I have indicated above , in brackets , where one could readily substitute Jihadism for Stalinism , and Islamic for Soviet .
This past August ( 2008 ) , in commemoration of Solzhenitsyn ’s passing , Roger Kimball described the following anecdote related by Kingsley Amis , about the reception of Professor Conquest ’s landmark study , which “ for many years , ” was “ ignored where possible or dismissed as propaganda . ”
As Amis notes ,
Then , in 1988 , favorable references to it began to appear in the Soviet media .
. . . [ A ] n American publisher suggested a new edition of the book .
“ What about a new title Bob ?
We wo n’t pretend it ’s a new book , but a new title would be good .
. . . Bob answered in terms that get a lot of his character into small compass .
“ Well , perhaps , I Told You So , You Fucking Fools .
How ’s that ? ”
Geert Wilders , alone among contemporary political leaders , stands on the shoulders of intellectually honest Western scholars such as Burckhardt , Bousquet , and Conquest , unabashedly addressing contemporary Islam , and the scourge of resurgent jihadism its mainstream religio- political leadership actively promotes .
Wilders pellucid , uncompromised views on the threat of totalitarian Islam might be expressed in this formulation ,
Islam is the problem ; radical reform is the solution .
Let us hope Wilders moral clarity and wisdom counteracts what Robert Conquest described as “ … the credulity of supposed intellectual elites , ” who misunderstood and misrepresented Soviet totalitarianism , making , “ … the pursuit of rational foreign policy difficult . ”
As Conquest underscored , aptly ,
It hardly needs saying that we must do our best to avoid , or prevent , anything resembling a repetition — in fact that the lesson should be learned .

Astronauts will launch into space this week aboard the space shuttle Discover to install the last four solar arrays on the International Space Station ( Image : NASA )
Update Wednesday 1840 EDT : NASA called off Wednesday ’s launch attempt after a slight leak was detected in a gaseous hydrogen vent line outside the external fuel tank .
The system is used to carry excess hydrogen safely away from the launch pad .
Officials are discussing how to proceed , but the next launch attempt will not occur before Sunday , 15 March .
The space shuttle Discover is set to blast off from Florida on Wednesday night on a mission to install the last set of solar arrays on the International Space Station .
Launch is planned for 2120 EDT ( 0120 GMT on Thursday ) from Florida ’s Kennedy Space Center .
The chance that the weather will be good for launch is 90 % , says Kathy Winters , NASA ’s shuttle weather officer .

If all goes well , the mission will provide the station with a power boost that will enable it to expand science activities in two new service modules and double its crew , to six , in May .
Astronauts will perform up to four spacewalks to install four 35 - metre - long solar arrays on the starboard side of the station and perform other tasks .
The full complement of arrays will provide up to 120 kilowatts of power to the station , enough to power 40 average US homes .
To accomplish the task , the crew will use both the station and shuttle robotic arms to manoeuvre the 14.5 - tonne solar panel truss into position .
Water recycler
Discovery will also carry replacement distillation equipment to fix the station ’s $ 250 million water recycler , which is supposed to convert urine to potable water .
The space shuttle ’s fuel cells have supplied most of the outpost ’s water , but the shuttle is set to retire in 2010 .
To fill in the gap , astronauts installed the water recovery system in November 2008 , but ongoing glitches in the system have slowed the testing process needed to get the system ready for a crew of six .
Cracked valve
The launch was repeatedly delayed as programme managers worked to sort out potential problems with engine valves that are used to maintain pressure in the vehicle ’s external fuel tank .
One of the three fuel valves aboard the previous shuttle mission , Endeavour , cracked during launch in November .
Although the shuttle reached orbit without incident , agency officials wanted to be sure that a similar problem aboard Discovery would not cause catastrophic damage .
For example , they were concerned that a stray fragment from a cracked valve could rupture one of the shuttle ’s hydrogen fuel lines , resulting in a loss of pressure that could shut down one of the engines and potentially prevent the shuttle from reaching orbit .
Damage might also cause hydrogen fuel to vent into an oxygen - rich area , creating a potential fire hazard .
Valve replacement
NASA ordered engineers to remove and inspect Discovery ’s three valves , which had each flown 12 times , in February .
Electromagnetic tests revealed one valve was damaged , and it was replaced .
NASA also replaced another of the three valves , since the cracking problem might result from the fatigue of repeated use .
That means the shuttle will fly with only one of the valves it was originally intended to use for this flight .
Agency officials have calculated that the chance of a catastrophic problem occurring as a result of the valves is low , clearing the way for the upcoming launch .
“ We showed that if [ a stray fragment ] got in the plumbing it ’s very unlikely to cause damage and then we showed that even if it does cause damage , that damage is not something that we needed to worry about , ” shuttle program manager John Shannon told reporters Friday , according to CBS News .
“ The vehicle ’s in great shape and we ’re ready to pick up with our normal countdown , ” Shannon said .
GPS antenna
If time permits , the Discovery crew will also install a GPS antenna to help guide Japan ’s new cargo supply vessel , the H - II transfer vehicle , whose first flight is targeted for September 2009 .
Discovery will also deliver Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata to the space station for a six - month stay aboard the outpost .
Wakata will replace NASA astronaut Sandra Magnus as flight engineer for the station .
NASA plans to send seven more shuttle missions to the station before the shuttle fleet is retired in 2010 .
This seems like a break in the ranks ...
From Kansas City Fed President Thomas Hoenig : Too Big has Failed
We have been slow to face up to the fundamental problems in our financial system and reluctant to take decisive action with respect to failing institutions .
...
We have been quick to provide liquidity and public capital , but we have not defined a consistent plan and not addressed the basic shortcomings and , in some cases , the insolvent position of these institutions .
We understandably would prefer not to " nationalize " these businesses , but in reacting as we are , we nevertheless are drifting into a situation where institutions are being nationalized piecemeal with no resolution of the crisis .
[ T ] here are several lessons we can draw from these past experiences .
• First , the losses in the financial system wo n’t go away – they will only fester and increase while impeding our chances for a recovery .
• Second , we must take a consistent , timely , and specific approach to major institutions and their problems if we are to reduce market uncertainty and bring in private investors and market funding .
• Third , if institutions -- no matter what their size -- have lost market confidence and can’t survive on their own , we must be willing to write down their losses , bring in capable management , sell off and reorganize misaligned activities and businesses , and begin the process of restoring them to private ownership .
emphasis added
How should we structure this resolution process ?
While a number of details would need to be worked out , let me provide a broad outline of how it might be done .
First , public authorities would be directed to declare any financial institution insolvent whenever its capital level falls too low to support its ongoing operations and the claims against it , or whenever the market loses confidence in the firm and refuses to provide funding and capital .
This directive should be clearly stated and consistently adhered to for all financial institutions that are part of the intermediation process or payments system .
...
Next , public authorities should use receivership , conservatorship or “ bridge bank ” powers to take over the failing institution and continue its operations under new management .
Following what we have done with banks , a receiver would then take out all or a portion of the bad assets and either sell the remaining operations to one or more sound financial institutions or arrange for the operations to continue on a bridge basis under new management and professional oversight .
In the case of larger institutions with complex operations , such bridge operations would need to continue until a plan can be carried out for cleaning up and restructuring the firm and then reprivatizing it .
Shareholders would be forced to bear the full risk of the positions they have taken and suffer the resulting losses .
While hardly painless and with much complexity itself , this approach to addressing “ too big to fail ” strikes me as constructive and as having a proven track record .
Moreover , the current path is beset by ad hoc decision making and the potential for much political interference , including efforts to force problem institutions to lend if they accept public funds ; operate under other imposed controls ; and limit management pay , bonuses and severance .
If an institution ’s management has failed the test of the marketplace , these managers should be replaced .
They should not be given public funds and then micro-managed , as we are now doing under TARP , with a set of political strings attached .
Many are now beginning to criticize the idea of public authorities taking over large institutions on the grounds that we would be “ nationalizing ” our financial system .
I believe that this is a misnomer , as we are taking a temporary step that is aimed at cleaning up a limited number of failed institutions and returning them to private ownership as soon as possible .
This is something that the banking agencies have done many times before with smaller institutions and , in selected cases , with very large institutions .
In many ways , it is also similar to what is typically done in a bankruptcy court , but with an emphasis on ensuring a continuity of services .
In contrast , what we have been doing so far is every bit a process that results in a protracted nationalization of “ too big to fail ” institutions .
... [ S ] ome are now claiming that public authorities do not have the expertise and capacity to take over and run a “ too big to fail ” institution .
They contend that such takeovers would destroy a firm ’s inherent value , give talented employees a reason to leave , cause further financial panic and require many years for the restructuring process .
We should ask , though , why would anyone assume we are better off leaving an institution under the control of failing managers , dealing with the large volume of “ toxic ” assets they created and coping with a raft of politically imposed controls that would be placed on their operations ?
In contrast , a firm resolution process could be placed under the oversight of independent regulatory agencies whenever possible and ideally would be funded through a combination of Treasury and financial industry funds .
Furthermore , the experience of the banking agencies in dealing with significant failures indicates that financial regulators are capable of bringing in qualified management and specialized expertise to restore failing institutions to sound health .
This rebuilding process thus provides a means of restoring value to an institution , while creating the type of stable environment necessary to maintain and attract talented employees .
Regulatory agencies also have a proven track record in handling large volumes of problem assets – a record that helps to ensure that resolutions are handled in a way that best protects public funds .
Finally , I would argue that creating a framework that can handle the failure of institutions of any size will restore an important element of market discipline to our financial system , limit moral hazard concerns , and assure the fairness of treatment from the smallest to the largest organizations that that is the hallmark of our economic system .
Update : More excerpts ( ht Josh ) : That is a call for temporary nationalization .
How would nationalization work ?
And Hoenig concludes : This strikes me as a break in the ranks , and although Hoenig is speaking for himself ( not the Fed ) , this might indicate a change in direction .
Evidence of its effectiveness :
Researchers , working with police , identified 34 crime hot spots .
In half of them , authorities set to work — clearing trash from the sidewalks , fixing street lights , and sending loiterers scurrying .
Abandoned buildings were secured , businesses forced to meet code , and more arrests made for misdemeanors .
Mental health services and homeless aid referrals expanded .
In the remaining hot spots , normal policing and services continued .
Then researchers from Harvard and Suffolk University sat back and watched , meticulously recording criminal incidents in each of the hot spots .
The results , just now circulating in law enforcement circles , are striking : A 20 percent plunge in calls to police from the parts of town that received extra attention .
It is seen as strong scientific evidence that the long - debated “ broken windows ” theory really works — that disorderly conditions breed bad behavior , and that fixing them can help prevent crime .
[…]
Many police departments across the country already use elements of the broken windows theory , or focus on crime hot spots .
The Lowell experiment offers guidance on what seems to work best .
Cleaning up the physical environment was very effective ; misdemeanor arrests less so , and boosting social services had no apparent impact .
Almost eighteen months ago , on the 18th of October 2007 , Canonical announced the release of Ubuntu 7.10 , codename Gutsy Gibbon .
Many important features and updates made Ubuntu fans all over the world extremely happy and eager to upgrade .
The default desktop environment for Ubuntu ( GNOME ) reached then a very important milestone : 2.20 , bringing a huge list of changes .
Ubuntu 7.10 ( Gutsy Gibbon ) was the first Ubuntu operating system to include Compiz 3D effects enabled by default .
Tracker replaced Beagle as the desktop search tool of choice .
Also , the Ubuntu restricted extras package was included , enabling users to install almost all proprietary codecs on their system with just a few clicks .
Not only that , but the Adobe Flash Player 9 could be installed just as easily , allowing the increasing number of flash - based websites to display better .
Of course , new wallpapers , redesigned Boot Splash and fresh login screen themes were part of Gutsy 's menu .
Also newly introduced , the Fast user switching function gained many supporters .
The monitor and video card configuration got a lot easier with Ubuntu 7.10 's new Graphical configuration tool and printers were automatically detected and installed .
It was undoubtedly an awesome release , allowing many to make the switch from other operating systems and plunge into the Linux experience without any regret .
But as we all know , all good things eventually come to an end , so here we are today , announcing the end of life for Ubuntu 7.10 ( Gutsy Gibbon ) on April 18th , 2009 .
This means that starting with April 18th , Canonical will stop " feeding " its Ubuntu 7.10 operating system with security / critical fixes and software updates !
Those of you who still use Gutsy and want to upgrade will have to do that incrementally , from Ubuntu 7.10 to Ubuntu 8.04 LTS and from Ubuntu 8.04 LTS to Ubuntu 8.10 .
Or wait for Ubuntu 9.04 ( Jaunty Jackalope ) and do a clean install with the new EXT4 filesystem .
What is Ubuntu ?
Ubuntu is an open - source piece of software , 100 % FREE to download and use .
Users are free to customize or alter the included software in order to meet their needs .
Since its launch in October 2004 , Ubuntu has become one of the most highly regarded Linux distributions with millions of users in homes , businesses , schools and governments around the globe .
To learn more about the upcoming features in Ubuntu 9.04 , take a look at our detailed " What You Should Expect from Ubuntu 9.04 " article !
Federal authorities have arrested four animal rights activists suspected in anti-vivisection actions in Santa Cruz and Alameda counties , a federal terrorism task force reported Friday .
[ social_buttons ]
The Joint Terrorism Task Force of the FBI arrested four animal rights activists as “ terrorists . ”
Details of the arrests and the charges are still coming , but this is the most sweeping expansion of the War on Terrorism and the “ Green Scare ” to date .
Three of them were linked to the Riverside Avenue home police raided after the attempted home invasion attack of a UC Santa Cruz researcher a year ago .
However , in what authorities consider the most egregious of animal rights - related incidents targeting UC scientists during the past year : two August 2008 firebombings at the homes of UCSC biomedical researchers .
These “ terrorism ” arrests are not related to that bombing , though .
And they ’re also not related to the destruction of property .
These activists –Nathan Pope , Adriana Stumpo , Joseph Buddenberg , and Maryam Khajavi– were arrested for First Amendment activity .
Lovely !
With the passage of the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act , a sweeping new law labeling animal rights activists as “ terrorists , ” corporations and industry groups have been pushing the federal government to use their new powers .
For more than two years , the law has sat on the shelf .
The government has finally put it to use .
As background , a fierce campaign is being waged in California against animal research at the University of California system .
There has been a wide range of both legal and illegal tactics .
Illegal tactics have included the destruction of UC vans .
In August , an incendiary device was left at the home of a UC researcher ; no animal rights group has claimed responsibility for this crime , but the university , the FBI and others have recklessly attributed it to activists .
According to the act :
Whoever uses or causes to be used any facility of interstate commerce for the purpose of damaging or interfering with the operations of an animal enterprise , and in connection with such purpose intentionally places a person in reasonable fear of fear of death or serious bodily injury to that person or an immediate family member , or conspires or attempts to do so , by a course of conduct involving threats , acts of vandalism , property damage , criminal trespass , harassment or intimidation , shall be imprisoned for not more than five years .
Stephen E. Thorsett , the dean of UCSC ’s Division of Physical and Biological Sciences .
“ Our students , staff , and faculty — who are doing important research into the causes and cures for human diseases such as cancer and Parkinson ’s — deserve to work and live in a safe environment , without fear that they and their families will be targets of violent actions and threats . ”
The suspects will be charged at least in part under the federal Animal Enterprise Terrorism
Act , which carries a penalty of up to five years for each violation .
It was n’t immediately clear how many counts the suspects will face when they appear in U.S. District Court later this month .
The foursome are accused of being involved in demonstrations in front of homes of UC Berkeley researchers in October 2007 and January 2008 , as well a protest and home invasion attempt at the California Street house in February 2008 .
In that attack , which occurred during a child ’s birthday party , the scientist ’s husband suffered minor injuries .
UCLA researchers have also been the target of firebombings .
“ The investigation is still going on , ” Schadler said .
“ There is much more being done .
It does n’t just stop with an arrest . ”
Here are the four charges they are facing , according to GreenIsTheNewRed.com :
Protesting outside the home of a University of California Berkeley professor .
Some activists , “ wearing bandanas to hide their faces , trespassed on his front yard , chanted slogans , and accused him of being a murderer because of his use of animals in research . ”
At another protest , activists “ marched , chanted , and chalked defamatory comments on the public sidewalks in front of the residences . ”
At one protest , a group of five or six activists allegedly “ attempted to forcibly enter the private home of a University of California researcher in Santa Cruz . ”
Fliers titled “ Murderers and torturers alive & well in Santa Cruz July 2008 edition ” were found at a local coffee shop .
They listed the names , addresses , and telephone numbers of several researchers .
The fliers said “ animal abusers everywhere beware we know where you live we know where you work we will never back down until you end your abuse . ”
The FBI says three of the defendants are tied to the “ production and distribution of the fliers . ”
Chalking , leafleting and protesting are crimes of violence ?
I have to agree with Will Potter :
The government is chipping away at fringe elements , silencing the speech of so - called radicals as “ terrorists . ”
But this is not the end , it is the beginning .
Such an overt targeting of First Amendment activity puts every social movement , every activist , and every American at risk .
Targeting free speech as “ animal enterprise terrorism ” sets a precedent set for targeting the speech of other activists as “ defense enterprise terrorism , ” “ timber enterprise terrorism , ” and “ financial enterprise terrorism . ”
At issue here is not the validity or morality of animal research , nor is it the efficacy of controversial tactics .
Differences of opinion on those issues no longer matter .
What ’s at issue is whether the War on Terrorism should be used to target protesters as terrorists .

This is what a two year old toddler looks like
A boy just like the sweet little kid above is imprisoned right now in one of Zimbabwe 's most brutal and notorious prisons .
His name is Nigel Mupfuranhehwe .
His crime is that his mother is being charged with recruiting " bandits " to topple the government of Robert Mugabe .
Zimbabwe lawyers who are representing his mother and the other accused in the case say that this little child has been beaten in front of his mother to get her to confess .
Imprisoning a two year old in a maximum security prison together with murderers and rapists and some of the worst kinds of people on earth boggles the mind .
I do not know how the government of Robert Mugabe is justifying this cruelity to itself , but I am more shocked at our own reaction , our silence and complicity in all this .
Where is our sense of outrage , Zimbabwe ?
Where is our humanity ?
In all the hundreds of thousands of column inches written about the Jestina Mukoko abduction and trial , this toddler is but a footnote in only a handful of them .
He lies there on the cold floor of one Zimbabwe 's most notorious prisons every day and night , forgotten by a world that is screaming very loudly for a 50 plus year old woman ( Jestina ) to be freed .
He can not speak up for himself .
And if the stories from the lawyers are true , he is puzzled as he is beaten by strangers , not knowing what crime he committed to deserve this .
He sees his mother , whom he instinctively considers his protector , watch helplessly while he is being beaten .
I would like to believe that these stories about the child being beaten are false , because the inhumanity of that would simply be too much , even for Mugabe 's government .
But we can not be sure until we see him physically , until he is examined by doctors to see whether he really was beaten or not .
Regardless , it is the height of inhumanity to keep an innocent 2 year old toddler in conditions such as exist at Chikurubi Maximum Secuirty Prison where he is beng kept .
I ask you : how do you think this experience will shape this child as he grows up ?
What do you think he will grow up thinking of a world that kept silent even as he suffered all this ?
Will he ever forgive us ?
If you are a believer , then I ask , Will God ever forgive us ?
Did
He not say " suffer the little children " ?
Is this what he meant ?
I ask that we at least do something :
Please leave your name in the comments section of this article ( below ) .
Just your name .
We will put the all the names together and present them to Mr Tomana , the Attorney General of Zimbabwe , asking that the child be given access to Child Welfare agents immeditely and freed from that prison .
This has been eating away at me and this is the only thing I can think of doing immediately .
I should like to think that his jailers also have children .
Let us put in this appeal and telll the world about the plight of this little two year old .
Let us keep at it .
If anyone else out there wants to start a petition as well please do so and we will consolidate the list of names for presentation to the AG .
Let us give ourselves a week in which to do this .
So , on Thursday 15 January , we should have a consolidated list that we will put together and seek to deliver to the Attorney General in Zimbabwe calling for this little boy to be released .
I hope you put your name down .
Better still , I hope you start your own lists .
If you do , please submit here , or get in touch so that we can coordinate our efforts .
PLEASE SIGN THE PETITION BY LEAVING YOUR NAME IN THE COMMENTS FORM BELOW .
Democracy Video Challenge : Win An Expenses Paid Trip to The USA
On another note , the State Department in the United States of America launched a video competition on September 15 last year ( the day Zimbabwe 's leaders signed the power - sharing deal , coincidentally ) .
You will have to do a short video completing the sentence : " Democracy is ..... "
The prize is an all expenses paid trip to the USA , visiting several American cities , including Washington D.C. and Hollywood , where you will attend gala screenings of the winning videos .
IMPORTANT UPDATE : SUCCESS , EVERYBODY !!!
THE BOY HAS NOW BEEN RELEASED .
THE ZIMBABWE LAYWER BEATRICE MTETWA CONFIRMED TO ME A FEW MINUTES AGO ( TODAY BEING WEDNESDAY , JANUARY 14 2008 ) THAT THE BABY WAS " TAKEN AWAY " FROM THE PRISON YESTERDAY , AFTER THE ATTORNEY GENERAL GOT ASHAMED OF THE COVERAGE THIS ATROCITY IS GETTING AL OVER THE WORLD SINCE I STARTED THIS PETITION ON THURSDAY LAST WEEK .
HE ASKED THE LAWYERS TO ASK TO ARRANGE FOR " SOMEONE " TO COME AND " TAKE HIM AWAY " , WHICH WAS DONE YESTERDAY .
I AM STILL TO GET INFORMATION ON WHO EXACTLY TOOK HIM , BECAUSE BEATRICE MTETWA , THE LAWYER REPRESENTING THE ACCUSED " BANDITS " , WHO INCLUDE NIGEL'S MOTHER , SAYS IT IS STILL UNCLEAR AT THE MOMENT WHO EXACTLY TOOK HIM AWAY .
THANKS FOR YOUR CONCERN AND I WILL KEEP YOU UPDATED ON WHO EXACTLY HAS THE BABY NOW .
I DOUBT THE MOTHER WOULD HAVE RELEASED HIM TO PEOPLE SHE DOES NOT KNOW .

Social networking and microblogging are the latest buzz words around the internet these days .
Twitter is a social networking site that has become home to many celebrities , news organizations , and companies that want to join the conversation .
Lately , there has been an surge of Star Trek alums , and even TrekMovie has joined in on the fun .
Now , we take a more in depth look at life on Twitter , from a Trekkie ’s perspective .
What is Twitter anyways ?
It seems like we ’ve been hearing all about the new social networking and microblogging buzz around the internet lately .
But , what does it all mean , and where does Twitter fit in ?
Well , simply put , Twitter is a service for friends , family , and co–workers to communicate and stay connected through the exchange of quick , frequent answers to one simple question : “ What are you doing ? ”
You can send ‘ tweets ’ and follow others tweets on the web , via a number of applications , and via mobile devices .
Now , many celebrities , websites , news organizations , and companies are joining the conversation .
There has been a recent emergence of many Star Trek alums on the scene lately , and TrekMovie has joined in as well .
To get started and join the Twitterverse , head over to Twitter.com to set up your free account .
Who ’s tweeting ?
A few big Trek celebrities are tweeting .
The King of all Trek Twitter is @wilw ( Wil Wheaton ) who with around 90,000 is ranked 15th in total followers .
Other Trek Twitterers in the top 200 are @LeVarburton ( LeVar Burton ) and @ BrentSpiner ( Brent Spiner ) .
Rounding out the Trek celeb list are @georgetakei ( George Takei ) , @WilliamShatner ( William Shatner ) , and @jj_abrams ( JJ Abrams ) .
All the Trek Tweeters have different styles .
Both Wil and LeVar are truly classic tweeters in that they embrace the microblogging style of communication .
Wil updates followers on new posts to his blog , new projects he is working on , and interesting little things that go on during his day .
LeVar updates followers about little goings on in his day - to - day life .
Both seem to enjoy the ability to directly interact with so many people .
For example , LeVar has just quit smoking , and has sent out thanks to those who are sending encouraging tweets .
Check out what LeVar has to say about his first couple of weeks on Twitter at CES last month :
George Takei ’s tweets are of a similar flavor ; he tweets about his thoughts on current events in his life , but not so often as Wil and LeVar .
While you tend to know where Wil is or what he is doing or thinking about at just about any given time of day , George is not so forthcoming .
He is a more reserved tweeter , and saves his communications for only the very important updates .
Brent Spiner seems to tweet rather sporadically , and his tweets do not always seem to , well , make sense .
Often times it seems like we only see one side of a conversation Brent is having with several people at once .
Other times , he just makes crazy comments about random things , like a proposal to make his and LeVar ’s birthdays a national holiday .
While often confusing , they are definitely entertaining !
William Shatner ’s tweets are not so much on a personal level , but more of self promotion for his website and video blogging .
They are informative , but do not make his followers feel like we have become friends as with the rest of the Trek Tweeters .
Lastly , JJ Abrams seems to have signed up back in 2007 , but has only made one tweet since that first day , maybe he lost the password .
@ BrentSpiner commenting on @ LeVarburton‘s Bday
Trekkies Tweeting
One of my favorite aspects of Twitter stems from the function to send messages directly from user to user .
Many of the Trek Tweeters have used this function to have public conversations with one another .
Wil , LeVar , and Brent generally share the most banter , and play off each other very well .
It is nice to see our favorite actors from the Star Trek of so many years ago in active friendships .
They invite each other to lunch , exchange birthday wishes , and send each other links to funny YouTube videos .
You know , the same kind of stuff you do with your friends .
@ BrentSpiner and @wilw share friendly banter
More Trek Twitter
There are Twitters for Trekkies to follow .
There are a couple of Star Trek novelists who are fairly regular tweeters @kevindilmore ( Kevin Dilmore ) and @daytonward ( Dayton Ward ) .
Novelist @bobgreenberger ( Robert Greenberger ) is also on Twitter , but does n’t update as often
You can also follow some of the companies behind Trek : @paramountpics ( Paramount Pictures ) , @idwpublishing ( IDW – Trek Comics ) , @crypticstudios ( Cryptic – Publisher of Star Trek Online ) [ also worth following @crypticZinc – Craig Zinkievich , Executive Producer on STO ] .
Lastly , you can actually follow a number of Star Trek characters , or people who have decided to adopt the personalities of a number of characters from Capt .
Kirk to Spot the cat .
Check out Capt .
Picard ’s followers page if you want to fill your twitter screen up with ‘ trek chatter ’
Tweet - a- Thon with Wil Wheaton
In order to demonstrate the power of this new venue , New York Times best - selling author and Internet television Producer Joel Comm has pulled together the world ’s largest collection of Twitter celebrities for the very first LIVE broadcast Tweet - a- thon .
Teamed up with WaterIsLife.com , a non-profit committed to helping battle waterborne disease , the Tweet - a - thon will be a way to raise money to bring clean water solutions to developing nations .
Among the ranks of celebrity tweeters is Star Trek ’s own Wil Wheaton .
The Twitter Power Tweet - a- Thon is a 12 HOUR charity event that will be played out concurrently in two social media venues ; a live video broadcast on Ustream.tv and on Twitter.com itself .
The action will unfold this Thursday , February 19th .

TrekMovie on Twitter
Now you know what Twitter is all about , and how much fun it can be !
Following @ TrekMovie is a great way to keep up to date with the latest in Star Trek news and goings on in the trekverse .
All the articles get updated automatically , plus the editors also send out Tweets on various things such as advance previews of articles , TV tune - in reminders , mini reviews , and some random thoughts .
Anthony also sends out requests for suggested questions for interviews he is doing ( some of the questions in the recent Frakes and Burton interviews came from our Twitter followers ) .
Although we are a fairly new addition to Twitter , TrekMovie already has over 1,500 followers which puts it in the same range as other nerdy and media sites like AICN , GeeksofDoom , Screenrant and even Variety .

After 35 years of filling the state ’s prisons with drug offenders who needed treatment and disproportionately punishing poor and minority offenders , New York is on the verge of dismantling its infamous Rockefeller drug laws .
To get there , Gov. David Paterson and some prosecutors will have to drop their objections to a reasonable provision on second - time offenders .
The Assembly voted last week to restore judicial discretion and end mandatory sentencing for many nonviolent low - level drug crimes .
The bill , which has been introduced in the State Senate as well , would limit the longstanding and widely discredited system under which prosecutors decide who goes to jail and for how long .
Once the measure becomes law , courts would be able to sentence many addicts to treatment instead of cramming them into prisons where addiction generally goes untreated .
Republican senators who represent prison districts have long obstructed reforms like these .
The latest attempt seems likely to succeed now that Democrats control the governor ’s mansion and both houses of the Legislature  if Assembly lawmakers can broker a deal with the governor and some prosecutors in the state .
Bankrupt Britain
Part 1 : Europe Blames America While U.K Warned of Bankruptcy
by Chris Tew , February 4 , 2009
Niall Ferguson , respected economic historian , warns of other European countries facing an Iceland style bankruptcy .
' Switzerland is first in line … and Britain is not far behind , ' he says .
While many politicians in Europe like to shift the blame for the credit crisis to the U.S. Niall points out that excessive lending and leveraging was much more endemic in countries such as Germany and the U.K .
Yet the U.K Prime Minister , Gordon Brown , like many European politicians continues to argue that the world is being brought down by a U.S. caused recession .
Before we get Niall 's version of current events let 's look at what Gordon has to say :
Gordon Brown 's View on the Global Credit Crisis - Blame America
BBC Politics Show 23rd November 2008 Gordon Brown interview with Jon Soper
" I mean what 's happened is we 've had a banking crisis which started in America ; makes me incredibly angry about what happened , the irresponsibility of risk taking and the irresponsibility of not disclosing things ...
... This is an international crisis that has not been generated in Britain " .
Niall Ferguson Calls Collapse of U.K Financial System
Here Niall mentions the excessive leveraging taking place in the banking system .
Leveraging essentially means how much money the bank actually has , compared to how much it is borrowing .
It has become standard practice ( and legal ) for banks to lend out a lot more money than they actually have and excessive leveraging has been identified by many as a fundamental cause to the worldwide financial collapse .
While financial tools such as credit default swaps are largely blamed for creating a bubble instead of leverage , credit default swaps were essentially a clever way for the bank to create more leverage .
In other words banks were doing whatever they could to sell more loans , with no care for how much real money they had to back those loans .
This situation was much worse in Europe than in the U.S .
Pointing the finger at the U.S. banking system
is not a justifiable stance for a European politician .
The lower a bank is leveraged the lower the risk but the lower the potential reward , the higher it is leveraged the higher the risk , but higher the potential rewards .
Every bank getting bailed out took too much risk and hence needed a bailout to avoid bankruptcy .
Niall states that leveraging has averaged 12:1 in the U.S. , whereas in Europe it was much higher with German banks having an average leverage ratio of 52:1 .
That 's essentially $ 52 of debt based money for every $ 1 of real assets / money .
So pointing the finger at the U.S. banking system is not a justifiable stance for a European politician .
The chart below shows how excessive the leveraging was among many European banks :

The Global Downturn Excuse
When questioned about the recession Gordon Brown repeatedly refers to the fact this is a global problem .
In the news video above Gordon Brown describes the situation as a ' Global banking crisis ' and calls for ' international cooperation ' .
It could very well be argued that this repeated message from Gordon Brown is a way to shift the focus of blame .
How can you blame the local government for things happening all over the world ?
More recently Gordon has pushed this message even harder stating :
" This is a global banking crisis and you 've got to deal with it for what it is , a global banking crisis "
However , as previously stated , with many respected economists and the IMF arguing that Britain is among the worst placed economies of western nations , the global blame shift diminishes .
Gordon Brown also points out that countries across the world are adopting a stimulus and bailout strategy .
" Britain , like many other countries in Europe , is prepared to make its contribution for a temporary and affordable fiscal stimulus .
It is now clear that the need for an urgent fiscal stimulus , within a medium term framework of fiscal sustainability , is overwhelmingly accepted across the world . "
This infers that because everybody else is doing it then it must be right .
However , this argument is completely flawed and here 's why :
It 's Gordon 's Idea :
Gordon Brown is pushing the stimulus agenda across the world urging other countries to take up this strategy .
He is not simply adopting this strategy , he is encouraging other countries to use it .
Gordon Brown is pushing the stimulus agenda across the world urging other countries to take up this strategy .
He is not simply adopting this strategy , he is encouraging other countries to use it .
Britain Might Not Be Able to Afford it :
While other countries are bailing out banks and pushing a stimulus package it does n't mean that Britain can afford it .
As David Cameron has warned , the U.K may need a bailout from the IMF , while others discuss how the IMF will need a bailout .
While other countries are bailing out banks and pushing a stimulus package it does n't mean that Britain can afford it .
As David Cameron has warned , the U.K may need a bailout from the IMF , while others discuss how the IMF will need a bailout .
World Leader 's Decisions Worked in Unison to Cause a World Recession
Just because many countries are adopting the bailout and stimulus approach it does not mean it is right .
The same people making decisions over the past decade allowed a financial bubble to be created by allowing banks to leverage excessively and encourage debt based consumption .
This detrimental approach , which caused the recession , was largely done in unison across many nations so it is clear that leaders world - wide can make bad decisions in unison , or make decisions which damage the average citizen in the long - run .
The stance ' everybody 's doing it so it must be right ' has already proven to be a dangerous strategy .
Just as the decisions of world leaders helped cause the recession , world leaders can make it worse .
U.K Heading for Bankruptcy ?
While leveraging in Germany is very high the country arguably has a much more resilient economy than the U.K with a trade surplus resulting in more money coming into Germany than going out of it .
Compare this to the U.K which has an excessive trade deficit with approximately £ 100 billion leaking out of Britain in 2007 alone .
That means in 2007 the U.K had to borrow approximately £ 100 billion from abroad to make up for the loss .
That was before the U.K government first nationalized Northern Rock , announced a £ 500 billion bailout plan in October , and then a further bailout scheme in January 2009 .
While difficult to calculate , the total bailout package , including all cash injections , loan guarantees and removal of toxic debts , comes roughly to a scary £ 900 bn .
Worse is that this may not be the end with further expensive bailouts are to come .
As the IMF has speculated , the U.K is going to be the hardest hit western nation by the recession .
Some fundamental reasons for Britain 's expected poor performance are :
With this arguably dire economic situation the question remains ...
Part 2 : Is the British Government Bankrupting the U.K ?
ASK physicists what they would most like to find lurking in the debris created by experiments such as the Large Hadron Collider , and they ’ll likely say “ supersymmetry ” .
That ’s because it is the best candidate for solving several niggling problems in today ’s theories .
But if Nathaniel Craig of Stanford University in California is right , there could be another way to find evidence of supersymmetry .
It could be there all around us , in the form of ripples in the fabric of space - time .
The standard model of particle physics , which explains all known particles and their interactions , suffers from several problems .

A Los Angeles federal judge Monday refused to sentence a Morro Bay man who ran a medical marijuana dispensary and sold the drug to minors until the government clarifies its newly revised position on such cases .
Charles Lynch , 46 , was convicted last August of five federal counts , including distributing marijuana , conspiring to distribute marijuana and providing the drug to people under the age of 21 .
The case has become something of a cause celebre among proponents of medical marijuana .
The courtroom Monday was crowded with spectators , many wearing green ribbons in a show of support for Lynch .
U.S. District Judge George H. Wu said he would postpone sentencing until prosecutors could provide a written clarification from the Justice Department about the government 's position on medical marijuana prosecutions .
President Barack Obama 's newly appointed attorney general , Eric H. Holder Jr. , said last week that the Justice Department now has no plans to prosecute dispensary owners who comply with their state law .
The cultivation , use and sale of doctor - prescribed marijuana is legal in certain instances under California law , but is banned altogether under federal law , which supersedes state law .
" From reading the reports , there is a change , " Wu told U.S. Attorney David P. Kowal .
" I really would like this from the DOJ . "
Kowal argued unsuccessfully that he did n't think Holder 's comments in any way affected the Lynch case or the U.S. Attorney 's Office in Los Angeles and urged Wu to go ahead with the sentencing .
Medical cannabis prosecutions by his office in the Southland are " still ongoing , " Kowal said , adding the Lynch case is " completely consistent " with Holder 's policies .
Wu refused to budge .
" I read and heard that something has changed and I want to know what it was , " he said .
" I want it in writing . "
Wu set a telephone status conference for Friday with Kowal to determine if and when the DOJ might clarify its stance .
An April 30 date was then set to sentence Lynch , but Wu said he might revise that date depending upon when he receives a response from Holder 's office .
During trial , defense attorneys painted Lynch as an honest businessman who had the blessings of Morro Bay 's city attorney and mayor prior to the 2006 opening of his Central Coast Compassionate Caregivers .
U.S. Attorney Thomas P. O'Brien said his office prosecuted Lynch for good reason .
" In every single ( medical marijuana ) case we have prosecuted over the past several years , the defendants violated state law as well as federal law , " O'Brien said .
In postponing sentence Monday , Wu said the Justice Department 's clarification would likely not change Lynch 's conviction , but it could affect his sentence .
700 years on , a proper funeral for the ' teenage witch ' who had her head chopped off
The body of a 14th century teenager thought to have been beheaded as a witch and buried on unconsecrated ground has been exhumed and given a proper burial .
The girl , named Holly by archaeologists because her remains were found beneath a holly bush , had had her head laid at her side , a sign that she might have been suspected of witchcraft .
Holly 's body was found six years ago in Hoo , Kent , during an excavation by archaeologists prior to work starting on a housing development and was taken away for research .
Mourners gathered to pay their respects at Hoo St Werburgh Parish Church , in Kent , to a teenager whose identity remains a mystery
The remains were dated from medieval pottery found in the same area .
Dr Paul Wilkinson , director of the Kent Archaeological Field School , said the decapitation - which it was believed would deny eternal life - meant Holly was ' shamed ' and was either a teenage witch , a criminal or had committed suicide .
Two plumed horses and a glass carriage carried the remains of the girl to what should now be her final resting place in the churchyard at Hoo St Werburgh Parish Church , in Kent .
A crowd of more than 200 mourners - who had responded to an appeal to give the suspected witch a respectable funeral - gathered to pay their respects to a teenager whose identity remains a mystery .
Despite such little knowledge about the girl being laid to rest , as the little wicker coffin was lifted from the carriage by four bearers , heads were bowed and one mourner placed flowers on the coffin as it was lowered into the ground .
The grave and coffin were blessed by Father Victor , Catholic priest for Hoo St Werburgh , and the Reverend Andy Harding , who pressed to give Holly a funeral denied her at the time she died
A joint Anglican and Catholic funeral service was held for the mystery girl .
The grave and coffin were blessed by Father Victor , Catholic priest of the church , and the Reverend Andy Harding , who pressed to give Holly a funeral denied her at the time she died .
Her body was found six years ago during an excavation by archaeologists .
Witchcraft , alleged or real , was treated as any other sort of heresy during the Middle Ages
Before the weekend funeral , the Reverend Harding said : ' When I found out about it , I thought it was a tragic story .
' We just wanted to give her a funeral that was denied to her at the time .
At the end of the day , God will be our judge .
She obviously came from Hoo so she will probably be buried close to the rest of her family . '
He added : ' We do n't know exactly what happened to her but what we do know is that her life came to an horrific end and even in death she was treated appallingly .
' When I found out about it , I thought it was a tragic story and I felt a need to give her what had clearly been denied to her all those years ago , and that is a proper burial .
' We wanted to put her back where she should have been when she first died , and we will be placing her with her head on her shoulders as it should be .
' Execution in those days would have been for such things as witchcraft , so if they had gone so far as to take her head off , she would have had to have committed a mortal sin . '
Speaking after the funeral he said it had been lovely to see so many people moved by Holly 's story .
' I believe everybody should receive a respectable funeral and that was something that had been denied her , ' he said .
' At the end of the day God will be our judge . '
Pottery found in the same area dates back to medieval times and so it is suspected the body was from the same period .
Hugo Chavez Marcha por el SI a la Reforma

Hugo Chavez became a U.S bogeyman primarily
because he refused to make the ' structural adjustments ' to Venezuela's
economy the U.S dictated to the rest of Latin America .
Having seen the
region devastated
by neo-liberalism , Chavez has forged a new type of socialism that has
had dramatic effects on poverty and inequality .
There is no doubt that
Chavez has many faults - his personality cult and domination of the
media is clearly not good for democracy , and there are huge problems
with crime that Chavez has failed to deal with .
But he has never
challenged the will of voters
whenever an election has come up , and has accepted term limits on his
Presidency ( which is not the case in countries like Britain ) .

In an interesting and balanced article on Hugo Chavez 's Venezuela , the Guardian
reports on Chavez 's remarkable accomplishments , and his failures .
Economically , there is no doubt that the country is in much better

Today a third of the population is classified as poor , compared with
half in 1998 .
Extreme poverty is said to have tumbled even more
dramatically , from 42 % to 9.5 % .
Inequality narrowed and Venezuela rose
up the UN 's human development index .
Social programmes known as
" missions " widened access to health and education and reduced
illiteracy .
The economy ballooned by 526 % , unemployment was halved to
6 % and Venezuela instituted Latin America 's highest minimum wage at
$ 372 ( £ 254.80 ) a month .
However , the state of the countries infrastructure and social problems is not so good :
Corruption and bureaucratic chaos - ministers rotated with bewildering
frequency - atrophied infrastructure and public services .
Roads and
hospitals deteriorated , a housing shortage worsened and jails remained
shockingly overcrowded and violent .
Some prisoners languish for years
without trial .
It will be interesting to see what Obama 's relationship with Chavez
will look like , and whether Obama will continue to refer to him as a
dictator as his predecessor did .
The region is changing , and leftist
movements are spreading quickly .
Whatever the U.S may think , it must
come to accept the new reality in Latin America .
And that means dealing
with Hugo Chavez .

When a Rockefeller says something publicly , you can bet he does n’t just express his humble personal opinion but speaks on behalf of the Family .
You can also be sure that his every word reflects a decision already made , corresponding measures defined , and detailed instructions on their implementation sent to executives at the lower levels of the pyramid .
So when on March 18 , 2009 , the US senator Jay Rockefeller claimed that the internet is the biggest threat to US national security and that “ it should have never existed , ” it was not just his point of view , it was an instruction : let the long prepared war on the free internet begin !
Nothing is and ever was a bigger threat to the US national and the whole world ’s security than the Rockefellers themselves .
The alternative media , which have been growing from strength to strength on the internet in recent years , make this fact evident .
The free internet is a fast growing threat to the power of these very inventors and absolute world champions of organized crime .
Not the internet in general , as Jay Rockefeller claims .
It is the internet of free , independent and uncensored opinions that they would prefer to have “ never invented . ”

This ship was conceived and developed by the Marine Physical Laboratory ( MPL ) at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography , University of California , San Diego .

If that is n't unusual enough , it really flips !.
" When the ship is in the horizontal traveling mode , the long , hollow ballast area trails behind .
When it reaches the desired location , the " tail " is flooded until the nose sticks straight up into the air , taking about twenty - eight minutes to reach vertical position . "
I am not looking for green shoots .
The image that the phrase conjures up is n't appropriate .
This is n't springtime in an economy that has undergone a hard winter .
My picture is rather that a hurricane has been passing overhead .
Immense damage has been done to the economy by the seizing up of the banking system .
I look anxiously to the sky to see whether the storm is moving away or not .
And what I have seen this week is a new plan for repairing the American banking system .
Banking systems are working badly because everywhere they are weighed down with bad loans .
Many of the lending arrangements that were made at the height of the boom now suffer from two grave problems .
Borrowers can no longer afford to pay interest as it falls due .
And the security that the banks took for protection against default has declined in value so sharply ( see prices for commercial and residential property ) that it is worth much less than the funds at risk .
This means in turn that great chunks of bank capital have been destroyed .
In response , governments are struggling to find methods for removing the bad loans from the banks ' balance sheets and for making good the missing capital .
The storm will have passed when both these outcomes have been achieved .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The American plan , announced by Timothy Geithner , the US Secretary of the Treasury , comes a few weeks after Alistair Darling , the Chancellor of the Exchequer , announced the British solution to the same problem .
Mr Darling 's approach is that the Government insures the bad debts .
Mr Geithner , on the other hand , has asked private investors to partner the US government in buying the bad debts from the banks , what is called a " public - private investment programme " .
Both schemes are extremely favourable to the private sector but in different ways .
In the British case the terms are very attractive for the banks .
Take as an example a bad loan held by a British bank that has a face value of , say , £ 1,000 .
The British Government says the bank must take first £ 60 of any losses but need only pay £ 20 to insure 90 per cent of the rest .
In other words , for a premium of £ 20 , the bank with the insurance may dump up to £ 847 of potential looses into the Government 's lap .
Under the American proposal , it is private investors who get attractive terms .
Assume that a US bank has a bad loan with a face value of , say , $ 1,000 .
Say that the bank in question was willing to sell the dud asset for $ 840 to the private / public partnership .
Each side puts up just $ 60 dollars in equity , making $ 120 in all .
The rest ( $ 720 ) is borrowed from Government institutions .
Thus American taxpayers carry all but $ 60 of the $ 840 at risk .
However Mr Geithner 's plan has one advantage that the British approach lacks .
In effect private investors set the prices for bad loans that the banks can either accept or reject .
This process is called " price discovery " .
In Mr Darling 's insurance scheme , there is no price discovery and therefore greater scope for banks to take the taxpayer for a ride .
On neither side of the Atlantic are banks compelled to participate in these schemes , though all may do so .
In fact in this country progress has been relatively slow .
Only Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds have signed up so far .
There are similar doubts as to how many American banks will avail themselves of Mr Geithner 's facility .
The reason is that the banks are frightened of crystalising their losses .
For then they may find that they are insolvent or approaching that dread state .
In either case , they would have an urgent need to raise fresh capital with the risk that only the government would supply it with all the unpleasant consequences that such a course entails .
Left to their own devices , banks would far prefer to do without government help and nurse their losses in the hope that sooner or later conditions would improve so that they could recover their money .
Meanwhile in order to preserve some capital , they would stop lending .
As this 19th - century attitude is fatal for modern economies , governments are driven to the elaborate schemes described above , enormously costly as they are to tax payers .
Nonetheless , Mr Darling and Mr Geithner have , in their different ways , done the best that can be done .
They have each provided an escape route for their banks .
Some have taken it or will take it .
Many will prefer not to do so .
So as I look up again I find that the clouds are still there , albeit a little less threatening .

Lawful access is back .
Two developments this month suggest that there may bi-partisan support for the always controversial attempt to establish new Internet surveillance powers for law enforcement .
First , the Globe and Mail reports today that new Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan has indicated that lawful access legislation is being prepared that will force ISPs to allow law enforcement to monitor Internet - based conversations .
The power to compel will apparently be subject to court order .
Second , Liberal MP Marlene Jennings has reintroduced her lawful access private member 's bill , called the Modernization of Investigative Techniques Act .
The Jennings bill is a virtual copy of a failed Liberal lawful access bill that died in 2005 .
Given the past proposals , there is plenty of reason for concern since earlier lawful access initiatives focused on new instrusive powers , some without any court oversight .
That said , the government has the option to provide law enforcement with the powers it needs with appropriate oversight .
For example , the Jennings bill would require ISPs to disclose customer name and address information to law enforcement without court oversight .
In 2007 , then - Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day committed to court oversight for such disclosures .
I believe Canadians expect the government to stand by that commitment ( and I amazed that Jennings would propose a more intrusive approach ) .
Further , earlier proposals to mandate surveillance equipment have been rendered moot as most ISPs already have the technical capabilities to monitor Internet traffic .
So what is the way forward ?
For starters , I think Van Loan should commit to active consultations with the privacy community before introducing the legislation ; renew the government 's pledge for full court oversight ( including for customer name and address information ) ; and there must be full hearings on the bill that place the burden on law enforcement to demonstrate that there is a problem with the law as it currently stands .
Update :
As the Privacy Commissioner expresses concern about lawful access plans , Van Loan now says that the legislation is not imminent .

Dr Manhattan : like a Smurf but meaner ( Image : Warner Bros )
It ’s 1985 .
Nixon ’s still in the White House and Zeppelins fill the sky .
And a motley crew of costumed heroes have come out of retirement to unravel a mystery that starts with the brutal slaying of a former colleague and ends with … well , that ’d be telling .
This is the alternate world of the new movie Watchmen – a world populated by ordinary people who do extraordinary things , and one extraordinary person who has forgotten what it ’s like to be ordinary .
That person is Dr Manhattan , formerly physicist Jon Osterman , whose body is destroyed by an “ intrinsic field subtractor ” before he somehow learns to reconstruct himself as an omniscient blue giant who can teleport , replicate himself , manipulate objects using only his mind , and see through time .
He ’s basically a giant Smurf with spooky quantum powers .
Advertisement
Not impossible but …
Teleportation , for example , is currently impossible on a macroscopic scale , but researchers are making progress .
It ’s been possible to teleport the quantum states of photons from one side of a lab to another for some time , but earlier this year , researchers succeeded in teleporting information about the state of an ytterbium ion .
Physicist Michio Kaku , of the City University of New York , now says macro teleportation may be only a “ class I impossibility ” – something that requires sophisticated engineering , rather than rewriting the laws of physics .
Dr Manhattan can also see into the past and future , making him somewhat indifferent about the fate of lesser mortals , which he believes to be predetermined .
( He ’s in some ways a caricature : the aloof scientist for whom the pursuit of pure knowledge trumps all human considerations . )
Given how poorly we understand time , it ’d be a mistake to write this off as pure fantasy – it sounds a little like the world envisaged by independent physicist Julian Barbour , in which time really is just an illusion .
World on the brink
Even Manhattan has his limits , however : he ca n’t see into his own future , thanks to a flood of tachyons – theoretical particles that move faster than the speed of light , and therefore travel backwards in time .
This blindness is one of the factors that persuades him to abandon his fatalism and intervene in humanity ’s affairs – along with a meditation on the astonishing fact of life ’s existence ( specifically , his former girlfriend ’s ) that sounds a lot like a rediscovery of the anthropic principle .
Humanity certainly needs the help .
As in our own world , the hunt is on for a source of energy that will meet the world ’s growing need for clean , safe power .
To make matters worse , the world stands on the brink of nuclear annihilation – a threat that ’s considered more remote in our own world , but certainly has n’t gone away .
That provides Ozymandias – the smartest man in the world – with the excuse he needs to build a chain of power generators based on Dr Manhattan ’s powers .
Ozymandias ’ intellect does n’t seem to be a result of superpowers ; rather , his extraordinary mental abilities are the result of extensive training – a feat that autistic savant Daniel Tammet suggests we could all replicate if we put our minds to it .
Quirky cast
Ozymandias ’ work sets in motion a chain of events that draw in the film ’s other protagonists : the Comedian , a ( literally ) lady - killing bad boy ; the sociopathic vigilante Rorschach ; everyman Dan Dreiberg , aka Nite Owl ; and Dr Manhattan ’s former girlfriend , the Silk Spectre .
Many of these characters have their own characteristic takes on morality .
Rorschach , for example , is a sociopath whose strong identification with the victims of crime leads him to mete uncompromisingly brutal justice to wrongdoers .
The Comedian believes ideas of morality are just a figleaf covering up humans ’ innate , animalistic brutality .
That makes him a “ veneer theorist ” , whose ideas contradict those who accept the animal roots of morality , but believe they exert a positive , rather than a negative , influence .
And Ozymandias believes that humanity must be coerced into cooperation by the threat of war – an idea supported by one theory of social evolution .
Troubled journey
The complex journey these characters take before ultimately coming to a consensus on the threats facing humanity is part of the appeal of the seminal 1986 graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons on which the movie is based – and one of the reasons it ’s often been described as “ unfilmable ” .
It ’s certainly had a long and troubled journey to the big screen : directors have come and gone , lawsuits have been filed and settled , and the notoriously perfectionist Moore has disowned the end result without even seeing it .
He probably wo n’t be kicking himself for making that decision .
Zack Snyder ’s adaptation is faithful to a fault , but it ’s true to the letter rather than the spirit of the book , collapsing the latter ’s dense , multi-layered storytelling into a relatively conventional – if bleak – Hollywood narrative .
Nonetheless , it ’s still a thought - provoking exploration of the compromises that must be made by those who wield scientific and social power .
And Dr Manhattan is the best quantum - mechanical superhero – in any universe .

As you know , the experience of anal intercourse is best for both of us if you get me extremely drunk and / or high , make me come first , and grab the vibrator to use on me during .
I 'm sorry that I wo n't let you put it in my ass all the time like your last girlfriend did .
Before I started dating you , no penis had ever been in my ass before .
Rest assured that while I do n't give it to you everyday , I was never a butt slut like she is .
Here 's the thing schmoopie - woopie :
When you put your fingers in my ass during regular sex , it ruins the experience for me .
If I 'm about to come and then I feel something in my pooper , my orgasm immediately comes to a screeching halt and I become tense and stop enjoying the sex .
I would like to make a deal with you : I 'll consent to continue to let you put your dick in my ass once a month or so .
You consent to leaving my butt alone at other times .
Not even at all other times .
We have sex about once a day , right ?
So how about you put your fingers in my butt once a week , and your penis in my butt once a month ?
We do not have to adhere to a strict ass - play schedule , just a resonable approximation .
I will continue to give you head , 69 , do it any location , position , pair of shoes or piece of lingerie you desire at any time .
But please , leave my butt alone ( except under the terms expressed . )
Thank you , and have a nice day .
In these harsh economic times when many companies are struggling to stay afloat , a local brewery is beginning to expand quicker than it can handle .
Surly Brewing Company , which hails its name from âÄ ú the anger fueled by the inability to find good beer , âÄ ù celebrated the third anniversary of its first sale Monday .
In those three years , the beer has built a strong fan base and expanded to bars in the region , including nearly 30 in Chicago .
Owner Omar Ansari said âÄúSurly NationâÄ ù
âÄî his name for the beerâÄôs fan base âÄî has helped the beer grow in popularity during the economic downturn .
While he said his beer is more expensive and might deter some people because of the crisis , he originally thought the economy might not affect beer .
âÄúI always sort of thought beer would be recession - proof because thereâÄôs always a reason to drink âÄ¦ good times or bad times , âÄ ù he said .
And people are drinking .
Bender , one of SurlyâÄôs five year - round brews , is an oatmeal brown ale made with Belgian and British malts flavoring the beer with cocoa , coffee , caramel and vanilla ..
JESSICA JANOSKI , DAILY
When Ansari and his brewer , Todd Haug , began brewing in January 2006 , they were making about 50 kegs a week .
Now , they brew between 150 and 300 a week and still cannot meet demand .
âÄúWe canâÄôt ever make enough beer , so it seems to be a constant problem , âÄ ù he said .
While this âÄúproblemâÄù seems like a great one to have in the market today , the economy is making it more expensive to make beer .
When Surly opened in 2006 , Ansari said hops cost only $ 3.50 per pound .
Now , the cost is $ 20 per pound .
The âÄúSurly NationâÄù has grown despite increased prices , and a local liquor store owner is upset that he cannot serve the fans .
Irv Hershkovitz , owner of Dinkytown Wine and Spirits , said the store was put on a waiting list for Surly nearly two years ago and continues to lose customers to other stores , including U Liquors across campus , that request the local beer .
The college market has helped Dinkytown Wine and Spirits become one of the stateâÄôs top sellers of other local beers , including Summit and Grain Belt , Hershkowitz said , adding that he can stock any Minnesotan or Wisconsin beers being sold in Minnesota âÄî except Surly .
âÄú When youâÄôre first turning 21 , youâÄôre experimenting with what youâÄôre probably going to drink the rest of your life , âÄ ù Hershkowitz said .
Ansari said the company is continuing to focus on brewing more kegs than cans because it is a better way to âÄúget the name out there , âÄ ù and some campus bars are seeing people flock for the beer .
Big Ten Restaurant and Bar co-owner Todd DuPont serves the Bender variety of Surly and said itâÄôs among the top - five sellers of the restaurantâÄôs 16 beers .
Dupont said beers have to pass a taste test from the shopâÄôs employees and some regular customers , and now that people are drinking the beer , it will remain on tap .
Downtime Bar and Grill General Manager Chris Shaffner also said Surly is among his top selling beers , and he likes it because âÄúitâÄôs local and itâÄôs good .
âÄù Local was one of the topics on AnsariâÄôs mind when he opened the brewery in 2006 because he initially saw room in the market for another brewery .
âÄúI thought the Twin Cities could use another brewery , and I thought maybe thereâÄôs a chance the market would want to drink the kind of beers I want to brew , âÄ ù Ansari said .
Summit Brewing Company opened in St. Paul 23 years ago , and Grain Belt Beer opened more than 100 years ago in Minneapolis and has since moved out of the Twin Cities .
Initially , the hardest thing for Ansari was finding a building .
His parents owned an industrial supplies manufacturing company , Sparky Abrasives , and let him rent out 5,000 square feet to begin brewing .
Now , Surly is operating on the entire 22,000 square feet , making beer and offering free tours .
Almost every Friday as many as 100 people show up to tour the facilities and taste a few of the varieties of Surly .
âÄú
They should be able to come in and try your beers so they know what they want to purchase in the stores , âÄ ù Surly employee Sarah Lawson said .
Fifth - year ecology , evolution and behavior masterâÄôs student Will Ratcliff said he went on the tour because it was âÄ ú the best beer in the Twin Cities .
âÄ ù
Ratcliff also brews beer at home and was interested in seeing how the larger operation works .
Chris Stern , a third - year neuroscience graduate student , said he drinks Surly weekly .
Although the beer is more expensive than most , Stern said , âÄúIâÄôm not a heavy drinker , so I go for quality over quantity .

Dozens of anti-Israel demonstrators have clashed with Swedish police in Malmo as they sought to disrupt a tennis match between Sweden and Israel .
At least five rock - throwing protesters were held in the southern city , police say .
There were no reports of injuries .
The demonstrators , mostly youths , tried to storm an arena where the Sweden - Israel Davis Cup match was being held .
They chanted slogans condemning Israel 's recent offensive in Gaza and urged support for the Palestinians .
Swedish police said the clashes near the Baltic Hall arena began soon after thousands of people attended the peaceful Stop the Match rally in central Malmo .
Some protesters then tried to break through police barricades set up around the sports complex , police said .
They hurled stones , firecrackers and bottles of paint at police vans , but were dispersed by hundreds of riot police .
Protesters tried to break through police barricades around the Baltic Hall arena
Only about 300 specially - chosen guests were allowed to watch the doubles match , because Malmo officials said they could not guarantee security at the venue .
Israeli player Andy Ram said it was a " stupid decision " to play the tie behind closed doors .
" Playing without a crowd is like playing a practice match , " he said .

After 15 hard punches to the flipper , we 'll recount the important moments in your life and the accomplishments you 've managed to rack up before even being allowed to legally buy cigarettes and porn in most states :
• 1987 : MINIX , the more dangerous and hardcore older brother you 've always idolized , was born .
Advertisement
• 1991 : Linus Torvalds is pissed he can't access his university 's UNIX servers to his liking , so he wrote the code that would become your DNA .
Which I guess is better than your parents just getting blind drunk and conceiving you in their Vegas drive - through honeymoon suite .
• March 13 1994 : Judging by this pretty hardcore looking log file , your version 1.0 was release on this day 15 years ago .
• 1996 : You 're two years old , and you already have a logo .
Tux the penguin is created .

• 1998 : Richard Stallman , kind of like your step dad , shaves his beard .
It grows back to the same fullness the next day .
• November 2000 : The first Linux - powered cellphone is announced , the IMT - 2000 in Korea .
It was developed by SK Telecom , Seoul National University and " PalmPalm Technology . "

• 2003 : IBM releases those creepy ads comparing Linux to an ( autistic ? ) sponge - like kid soaking up all the world 's knowledge .
• 2004 : Ubuntu 's first release .
You 're going mainstream kind of !
• ??? : Linux will finally power the toaster in my home .
It 's been a great life , and here 's to many nerdier years to come .
Ok I just wrote a birthday card to an operating system .
I think I need to go shotgun a Coors Lite to balance out the 1,020 geek points I just accumulated .
Shotgunning it just because , not in honor of any birthday or anything .
It 's Friday , and here at TCC , we 're feeling a little punchy .
Some of us are looking forward to lunch , some are looking forward to Miller Time , and some in New Orleans are looking forward to a long , festive Carnival weekend .
In the spirit of all that giddiness , and in keeping with yesterday 's bar - chart fun , we present a comparative graphic that pits Tesla 's Roadster against Tesla , the rock band .
It all started when someone asked a fairly stupid question : how can you tell a Tesla owner from a member of Tesla ?
Which only goes to show that goofing off at work can be a productive activity .
Or maybe we just have too much time on their hands .
Needless to say , we were surprised to find so many similarities between the target demographics for each Tesla .
In fact , there are far more than we 've listed here , but we opted to keep it in PG territory .
Maybe we 'll post the late - night version after you put the kids to bed .
UPDATE : Of course neither the car nor the band bears any resemblance to their namesake , Nikola Tesla , or his beloved Tesla coil .
If you 've never seen a Tesla coil in action , here 's a clip of two " performing " the theme song from Dr. Who .
Well , at least that 's what the DJ says they 're doing .

Mapping a Galactic Transit System
I love the London Underground and have a great fondness for wandering about the city with a tube map stuck in my pocket .
My wife and I last did this a few years back , making an early March trip in which we rented a Bloomsbury apartment for ten days and hopped all over the area , station to station , emerging for blustery walks to various historical sites ( we were both , at one time , medievalists ) , then ducking into nearby restaurants for tea and warming up , talking about what we had seen and examining the map for our next stop .
A map of the London Underground is a schematic diagram that has a beauty of its own , reducing a city beyond its topography to a sequence of formalized connections and zones .
The fascination is in the abstraction of the familiar , rendering distance and space intelligible .
Now look at what we might call a ‘ tube map ’ of the Milky Way , as produced by Samuel Arbesman , a postdoc at Harvard with an interest in computational sociology and , obviously , big maps .
Click on the image to see Arbesman ’s larger version of it , which in turn links to a downloadable PDF .
This is the route map of what Arbesman calls the Milky Way Transit Authority , inspired by his recent re-reading of Carl Sagan ’s Contact and the notion of a vast subway handling galactic traffic .
Remember its main hub ?
And swimming into her field of view as the dodec rotated was … a prodigy , a wonder , a miracle .
They were upon it almost before they knew it .
It filled half the sky .
Now they were flying over it .
On its surface were hundreds , perhaps thousands , of illuminated doorways , each with a different shape .
Many were polygonal or circular or with an elliptical cross section , some had projecting appendages or a sequence of partly overlapping off - center circles .
She realized they were docking ports , thousands of different docking ports — some perhaps only meters in size , others clearly kilometers across , or larger .
Every one of them , she decided , was the template of some interstellar machine like this one .
Big creatures in serious machines had imposing entry posts .
Little creatures , like us , had tiny ports .
It was a democratic arrangement , with no hint of particularly privileged civilizations .
The diversity of ports suggested few social distinctions among the sundry civilizations , but it implied a breathtaking diversity of beings and cultures .
Talk about Grand Central Station !
she thought .
Well , the London Underground was never like what Ellie Arroway saw , but I still love it .
Ramping up to a galactic scale reminds me , too , of Jon Lomberg ’s Galaxy Garden , which renders our vast city of stars in the form of a gorgeous botanical display .
I think Arbesman is right in saying “ … there is power in creating tools for beginning to wrap our minds around the interconnections of our galactic neighborhood . ”
Maybe we ’re at the dawn of the era when the galaxy will begin to be represented as a more or less familiar place , rather than a vague stripe of stars across the sky , all but unnoticeable unless you get away from city lights in many parts of the world .
That sense of context , of our place within that part of the universe that is immediately around us , is one we need to explain and enhance for our children .
Astronomy education can do this , and it does n’t always hurt to include a bit of whimsy — check out Arbesman ’s MWTA tote bags !
Political rapper talks about ' dark side of revolution ' Larisa Alexandrovna
Published : Tuesday February 17 , 2009
Print This Email This Part 1 | Part 2
Felipe Coronel is , all at once , a Peruvian - born student of history , a thickly - accented New Yorker , a child of Harlem , and an incredibly well - read man .
Better known by his stage name  Immortal Technique  he writes and performs some of the most politically saturated and emotionally charged music to appear in the work of any American artist since perhaps Bob Dylan , only darker and more raw .
Tech does not create music that is peace - oriented or anti-war .
He does not create music about gang violence or the need for racial equality .
Instead , he explores the history of all of these issues and shows , rather than tells , his listener why he believes we  humanity , America , African Americans , Latinos , et cetera  are where we are .
In a song called The 4th Branch from his second album , Revolutionary Volume 2 , for example , Tech sings :
Media censorship , blocking out the video screens
A continent of oil kingdoms , bought for a bargain
Democracy is just a word , when the people are starvin '
The average citizen , made to be , blind to the reason
The song is an exploration of how the United States got into the Iraq war , rather than something as overly simplistic as a call for peace .
Who is responsible ?
How could this war have happened ?
Tech places the blame for the selling of this war on the shoulders of the fourth estate , the press .
Tech expresses his frustration with the whole concept of " fair and balanced " reporting , telling Raw Story that facts dont always have another side to them nor should two sides always be portrayed as equally balanced and equally legitimate .
" What if there is no other side of it ? " he asks .
" That is not enough for [ the media ] .
They feel that they are supposed to present two sides of a story , which is great most of the time , or should be most of the time .
But when it comes to the balance of those two sides , they take great care in making them equally balanced when they are not always equally balanced or even equally true .
They give credence and legitimacy to ideas that deserve no legitimacy . "
Tech was born in Lima , Peru in 1978 and first came onto the New York underground Hip - Hop scene as a battle rapper in 1999 .
In 2001 , he released his first album , called Revolutionary Volume 1 , and in 2002 , his second album , Revolutionary Volume 2 .
With hardly any marketing campaign , he has become an underground international folk hero of sorts , from South America to the Middle East and , of course , on his home turf in Harlem .
Tech says that he uses imagery to explore complex issues .
" I think putting together historical facts to rhymes and metaphors helps people to understand what it is I am talking about and it gives people a direction if they want to look up something in a particular discipline .
Like putting a bookmark into music and saying ' Look over here . ' "
In a song called " Peruvian Cocaine , " for example , Tech presents the narrative from the viewpoint of each of the participants along the route of drug trafficking , from the poor South American farmer , to a political leader , to a drug distributor , to an undercover cop , and so forth .
Each point of view , each persona , shows the listener their motivations .
The Peruvian leader shows one face of this saga :
Yo , it do n't come as a challenge
I 'm the son of some of the foulest
Elected by my people ... the only one on the ballot
Born and bred to consult with feds , I laugh at fate
And assassinate my predecessor to have his place
In a third - world fashion state , lock the nation
With 90 % of the wealth in 10 % of the population
The Central Intelligence Agency takes weight faithfully
The finest type of China white and cocaine you 'll see Tech 's interview with Raw Story was wide - ranging , extending from the Ottoman Empire to European colonialism in South America .
He brings off conversation with the ease of a professor in front of a graduate level history class .
" We still emulate the European oppressor in everything :
In terms of the standards of beauty ; in terms of governmental structure or even in terms of religion , " Tech says .
" Contemporary America would look at Aztecs as savages for sacrificing people to their God .
But you would not look at Europeans in the same light , even though they used to burn people alive as heretics to honor their God . "
Tech also speaks about the side of him that was involved in petty theft and assault , running with a rough crowd in Harlem and eventually doing time in Philadelphia .
While in college at Penn State , Tech was sent to jail for a year , after getting into a altercation with crack dealers .
He was paroled to his fathers home , on the condition that he attend school at least part time and work .
This time , he excelled , until his music career took him away from formal study .
He says he read everything he could get " his hands on " as he joined the battle rap scene .
The complete Raw Story interview follows .

Larisa Alexandrovna :
Where does the name Immortal Technique come from ?
Immortal Technique : Originally I battled under the name Technique .
But I always felt like a persons spirit is immortal , you know ?
LA : Yes
IT : [ It s ] not simply what we just do in this life , but how we are remembered , and how we affect the world around us .
In that sense , some people enjoy a sort of immortality based on their contributions .
Technique is what you need to accomplish anything .
So the combination of the two can change the world , you know ?
Besides , I feel like a man who walks with God can walk anywhere .
LA : You were born in Lima , Peru .
Are both your parents Peruvian ?
IT : My mothers father is black , from the Caribbean .
His family bought their freedom from slavery and moved down to South America and lived there ever since .
LA : How did that affect you as a child ?
IT : You know , I grew up with my mother being very honest and candid about that , and with some of our people had a certain amount of racism ingrained in them .
You are going to find many Latino people who are in denial about their African blood .
LA : And you are not ?
IT : No , I have never been like that .
I look at my grandfather and by all means and standards he is more black than people that consider themselves black in America .
They dont consider themselves Black or  Indio out there because they cling to nationalistic titles rather than embrace cultural and racial origin .
An interesting way to discount a majority and create a Eurocentric ideology by not acknowledging that such a thing exists .
And the people in these countries didnt want to maintain a relationship with their ex-colonial powers .
The people who ran the countries were in themselves all European and not of any indigenous background until the late 1980s early 1990s .
LA : The cycle where the victim becomes the oppressor .
IT : Yeah .
If you re less than indigenous , it is because you are in some part African .
So people avoid that like the plague .
It s terrible .
We still emulate the European oppressor in everything :
In terms of the standards of beauty , in terms of governmental structure , or even in terms of religion .
Contemporary America would look at Aztecs as savages for sacrificing people to their God .
But you would not look at Europeans in the same light , even though they used to burn people alive as heretics to honor their God .
LA : You dont even have to go back to Europe .
You can look at the Salem witch trials in America .
Your family moves from Peru to the United States , Harlem in particular .
Why do you move ?
IT : The economy had collapsed .
There was massive inflation .
Of course there was a war going on between the Shining Path and the US - backed government [ of Peru ] .
At this point it was violent , there were no jobs and my father was looking for opportunity .
LA : So why Harlem ?
IT : [ laughs ]
My father was trying to find a place less violent than Peru , right ?
So we move to Harlem , New York in the 1980s .
The Fourth Estate LA : Lets talk about " The 4th Branch , " from Revolutionary Volume 2 ( The song is available to listen to below ) .
You take the 4th Branch  the media  to task for failing to do their job in the lead - up to the Iraq war .
Do you think it is a matter of systemic corruption , a trade - off of truth for access , or do you think it is more based on wanting ratings and churning out sensational stories ?
IT : Oh they did their job .
They did their job .
LA : Do you think it is yellow journalism ?
IT : It was their job to do what they did .
That is their real job .
LA : When you say that is their real job , what does that mean ?
IT : Their real job is to sell an agenda , not the news .
I can see parts of the news on the news , you know ?
It is like when democracy is not fully a democracy .
As soon as one aspect of it is betrayed , it stops being what it is .
In this case it stops being the news .
LA : So once the ethics of it are violated , once a little is traded off for expediency or for ratings , it all becomes suspect ?
IT : More like when I look at it from that perspective , it is as though I am capable of telling everyone what is going on , in telling 100 percent truth .
I have that ability , right ?
But because I cannot present another side of it , for example , then I can not tell any of it ?
What if there is no other side of it ?
That is not enough for them .
They feel that they are supposed to present two sides of a story , which is great most of the time or should be most of the time .
But when it comes to the balance of those two sides , they take great care in making them equally balanced when they are not always equally balanced or even equally true .
They give credence and legitimacy to ideas that deserve no legitimacy .
And not just from the right either .
They give people legitimacy from the progressive side who deserve no legitimacy , just to have out there as an example of how radically left someone is , when they dont represent the left at all .
Instead of finding someone logical enough to express themselves , they find people who are ignorant enough to just get by on the topic .
That bias really exists no matter what the topic is .
We could be talking about Iraq , or we could be talking about the Israeli - Palestine conflict , you know ?
LA : So where do you get your news ?
IT : I am not saying that I dont watch the news or read the news .
It is just that I will see it or read it and supplement that with what I have read about the history of the country or issue and I will talk to people who are there .
So if I want to hear something about Gaza , for example , I can call someone there .
I know people there , I can call them or they can call me , you know ?
I can be in contact with them and be like yo , what is really going on over there ?
LA : But what do you say to your listeners who do not have the benefit of knowing someone in Gaza or in any other place ?
IT : Hopefully they could read stuff on The Raw Story .
LA : [ laughs ]
Thank you for the plug .
Who else ?
IT : Democracy Now is a very good program .
There is also the Real News.com .
There is plenty of independent media and although they may not have maybe the legitimacy in the market of a CNN or something like that , I think they are a lot less filtered .

Listen to " The 4th Branch " :
Get Raw exclusives as they break -- Email & mobile Email - Never spam :
Illustrating its further intent to marginalise Hamas , Israel illogically blames Hamas for rocket strikes claimed by the al - Aqsa Martyrs Brigades , the military wing of the Fatah faction led by Mahmoud Abbas .
Olmert , again demonstrating his war criminality , booms :
“ We ’ve said that if there is rocket fire against the south of the country , there will be a severe and disproportionate Israeli response to the fire on the citizens of Israel and its security forces . ”
The monstrous Olmert , lusting for more innocent blood , is promising further criminal responses :
“ The response will come at the time , the place and the manner that we choose . ” …
Palestinian witnesses reported huge explosions on Sunday and the Israeli military confirmed strikes on half a dozen locations , including an abandoned police station in northern Gaza and suspected smuggling tunnels in the south near the Egypt - Gaza border .
Disproportionate responses are forbidden by the Geneva Conventions .
This has never stopped Israel before from collectively punishing citizens of Gaza , whose lives are treated as expendable by the Zionist entity .
As highlighted by Sherri Muzher in the Detroit News :
The Israeli Defense Force ’s revelation in a Haaretz article that it overestimated Gaza ’s rocket severity went unnoticed by our media .
The bombing continued , as did the self - righteousness .
Perhaps , Israeli historian Ilan Pappe put it best in a recent article on Gaza .
He wrote : “ The self - righteousness is a powerful act of self - denial and justification .
It explains why the Israeli Jewish society would not be moved by words of wisdom , logical persuasion or diplomatic dialogue . ”
Though we live in the 21st century , it seems that maybe our Western world ( specifically the United States ) has been caught in a time warp .
Some actually think it can atone for the crimes of World War II by giving Israel the green light to commit more crimes against humanity .
But ignoring Israel ’s embargo and the killing of Palestinians dishonors the memories of those who were murdered for who they were during World War II .
Just because there are no ovens or gassing in the conflict does n’t mean that it ’s less genocidal .
And when Israel intentionally blocks humanitarian goods and aims to make life so miserable that Palestinians will want to leave all the while dehumanizing them in the process , Israel is committing genocide .
Article II of the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide does n’t make exceptions for motive .
In other words , using Hamas as an excuse is unacceptable .
The convention discusses “ Deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to destroy a group includes the deliberate deprivation of resources needed for the group ’s physical survival , such as clean water , food , clothing , shelter or medical services .
Deprivation of the means to sustain life can be imposed through confiscation of harvests , blockade of foodstuffs , detention in camps , forcible relocation or expulsion into deserts . ”
As to Israel ’s 2005 pullout from Gaza ?
Israel ’s B’Tselem , a human rights group , notes that Israel has maintained complete control over the airspace , waterways , the movement of goods and most elements of the taxation system .
Israeli Palestinian citizens continue to be denied entry into Gaza even to visit family .
Israel , a victim ?
Not even close .
WND follows up , finding that Hamas has demanded Fatah , America ’s ‘ partner for peace ’ cease firing rockets .
Contacted by WND , the leadership of Islamic Jihad in both Gaza and the West Bank were not aware their group launched any rockets .
The claimed results of an immediate investigation launched by both Hamas and Islamic Jihad were shared with WND .
The probe found the Islamic Jihad rockets were actually fired by Fatah .
Hamas and Islamic Jihad sources explained that when Hamas took over Gaza from its Fatah rivals in 2007 , about 100 members of Fatah ’s Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades joined Islamic Jihad , and it was those members who launched today ’s attacks .
Hamas has demanded Islamic Jihad immediately clamp down on the Fatah members within its ranks , prompting some tension between the two allies .
A top member of Hamas ’ so - called military wing told WND today the Fatah members who shot today ’s rockets will be dealt with harshly , hinting they may even be killed .
“ If we catch them , I think they will not live to see the light of day , ” he said .
Earlier today , the Al - Arabiya television network quoted Hamas sources stating the group has accepted an Egyptian proposal for a year - long truce with Israel in Gaza starting on Thursday .
The report said Hamas agreed to an international mechanism along the Egypt - Gaza border that includes members of Fatah , as long as those Fatah members coordinate their activities with Hamas .
One of Israel ’s main goals for its offensive was to halt Hamas ’ ability to smuggle weapons across the Egypt - Gaza border .
Previous international monitors stationed along the Egypt - Gaza border fled their duty and repeatedly failed to stem Hamas ’ weapons smuggling .
The monitors were stationed at the border following Israel ’s 2005 evacuation of the Gaza Strip .
Hamas in 2007 seized control of Gaza from Fatah , taking over all U.S. - backed security compounds in the territory .
Top diplomatic sources in Jerusalem told WND last month Abbas and his top representatives had waged a quiet campaign for months asking the Israeli government to target Hamas in Gaza just before the PA president ’s term in office expired Jan .
9 . Hamas leaders repeatedly had warned they would not recognize Abbas after Jan. 9 and that they would launch a major campaign to delegitimize the PA president and install their own figures to lead the Palestinian government .
Abbas used the violence to declare an emergency government that will keep him in office at last another year .
How bizarre is it then that Israel , the US and EU are hell bent in maintaining Abbas as a peace partner by maintaining a new , even more virulent siege on the people of Gaza , a siege that prevents the reconstruction of society , that causes further hatred and contempt ?
Because they know Abbas does n’t have the support of the people and thus will fit the dictatorial puppet role which has been the usual historical method these big swinging dickheads have chosen to control the middle east ?
Yep , without a doubt .
UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-Moon and other Western leaders had proposed creating a temporary international committee to oversee the funding and organisation of the reconstruction effort .
However , Abbas and his supporters rejected such a mechanism on the grounds that “ it presumes that the separation between Gaza and the West Bank will continue , ” as acting PA Prime Minister Salam Fayyad put it , adding that international donors who are eager to reconstruct Gaza “ will risk deepening the Palestinian division by ignoring the role of the PA ” .
The PA ’s stance , if followed , would condemn Arab pledges made in Kuwait — as well as any pledges made in a possible international conference on the reconstruction of Gaza called for by Egypt , the PA and the EU president — to remain pending until such time as a “ viable peace partner ” secures a steady seat in Gaza .
Although the participants at the Kuwaiti summit stressed the need for the reconstruction of Gaza in principle , they failed to reach an agreement over the mechanism .
Differences between leaders obstructed a proposal to create a reconstruction fund and the most participants managed to agree upon was to make reconstruction contingent upon Palestinian reconciliation , a task they designated to Arab foreign ministers without setting a date or place for a ministerial meeting for this purpose , leaving us with the question as to when and how Arab ministers are to succeed where their heads of state failed .
Of course this procrastination through delegating makes the pledge to reconstruct Gaza barely worth the paper it was written on and will probably consign it to the same oblivion fated for so many other Arab summit resolutions .
One of those forgotten resolutions was that adopted by the emergency Arab summit in Cairo in October 2000 calling for the creation of an Al - Aqsa and Jerusalem Fund for the purpose of reconstructing Palestinian infrastructure , especially in the sectors of healthcare , education , agriculture and housing .
Apparently Arab leaders in Kuwait did not wish to recall that that resolution did not restrict the distribution of funds through the channel of the PA but also provided for other channels such as UNWRA , the Egyptian and Qatari Red Crescents , the Jordanian Royal Philanthropic Organisation , the UN Arab Gulf Programme and other such regional and international humanitarian agencies .
Perhaps , too , they did not want to remind anyone that when that earlier resolution was passed there was no “ Hamas problem ” behind which are hiding those who do not really want to reconstruct the occupied territories , whether in Gaza or in the West Bank . …
There is nothing to debate about humanitarian relief .
The Israeli offensive destroyed all the civil infrastructure of the government in Gaza on the grounds that it served as bases for Hamas whereas in fact it was PA infrastructure paid for by taxpayers in donor countries .
Whole residential quarters were flattened , totally destroying 4,000 homes and severely damaging around 16,000 more .
There are now some 100,000 civilians in urgent need of shelter , temporarily accommodated in some 12 refuges opened by UNWRA in schools that were also targeted by Israeli guns and therefore need to be repaired as well .
In addition , agricultural land ruined by bombardment has to be reclaimed , potable water needs to be supplied to half a million Palestinians , electricity has to be restored to about the same number of people , and about 80 per cent of the inhabitants of Gaza are in urgent need of food relief ( these are all UN estimates ) .
Any political argument for postponing such urgent aid is morally outrageous .
The Israeli list of “ prohibited materials ” even before its offensive includes such items as iron , steel and cement , which are now absolutely vital to reconstruction .
UN Commissioner for Humanitarian Affairs John Holmes pointed out this self - evident truth in a statement last Tuesday saying that if Israel refuses to allow in construction materials reconstruction cannot begin .
Abbas is therefore holding the people of Gaza in siege as surely as does the Israeli – both are occupiers , abusers and criminals .
Gideon Levy comments that the Israeli threats and attacks are still linked to the forthcoming elections – who can prove the bloodiest war criminal will win the vote from a hypnotised Israeli public .
“ There is a domestic struggle between candidates and who will be more extreme and who will take a hardline stance towards the rocket fire coming from Gaza .
The main lesson is that the Palestinians and Israelis did not learn any lessons from the war – it will bring more agony and destruction .
Both parties are in a game of fools . ” …
Ron Kampeas , an Israeli political analyst , said the underlying motive of the strikes was that the ruling Kadima party wanted “ to show it is as hawkish as the Likud ” .
He told Al Jazeera that Benjamin Netanyahu , the leader of Likud , appeared likely to win the February 10 election and Livni was now trying to keep her job as foreign minister in a coalition government .
Kampeas added that it remained to be seen whether Netanyahu , if he won , would form a coalition with Avigdor Lieberman , who is seen as further right than Netanyahu , and “ could mean an even more hardline stance towards Hamas ” .
Conveniently , whilst not recognising Hamas , Israel holds it responsible for all attacks against the Zionist state .
A Hamas spokesman responded to Olmert ’s bellicose threats :
“ We condemn the statements by Olmert and others today threatening the Gaza Strip , ” Taher al - Nunu , a Hamas spokesman , said in a statement on Sunday .
“ This is an attempt to find a false excuse to escalate the aggression against the Palestinians , to destroy the Egyptian efforts to improve the calm and to use pressure against the Palestinian people to accept Israeli conditions in those talks . ”
Egyptian mediators have been attempting to secure a longer - term ceasefire addressing Israel ’s concerns over rocket attacks and weapons smuggling into Gaza , as well Palestinian demands for the Israeli siege of the territory to be lifted .
The non-involvement of Hamas in the latest rocket attacks is confirmed by Israeli intelligence :
Israel ’s military intelligence chief Amos Yadlin said that Sunday ’s attacks were not waged by Hamas but other militant groups that “ are challenging Hamas and carrying out attacks for a renewed escalation . ”
“ Hamas , for its part , has been deterred and is honoring the ceasefire , but is not deterring the others enough , ” added Yadlin .
Meanwhile Hamas and Palestinian Authority officials are in Cairo for cease fire talks mediated by Egypt .
An adviser to Ismail Haniya , who heads the Hamas government in Gaza , told AFP news agency the militant group was waiting for Israel ’s response to a truce offer , transmitted by Egypt , adding that things were “ moving in a positive direction ” .
The Egyptians have been leading efforts to broker a permanent ceasefire by holding separate talks with officials from Israel and Hamas .
Abbas is seeking to destabilise talks again :
But Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas told journalists in Cairo that talks were impossible with anyone who rejected the supremacy of the Palestine Liberation Organisation – in an apparent reference to Hamas ’s leadership .
He also accused Hamas of having “ taken risks with the blood of Palestinians , with their fate , and dreams and aspirations for an independent Palestinian state ” .
Abbas miraculously also appears to be in Paris today for talks with Sarkozy and the prime minister of Qatar .
Mitchell is having talks with Sarkozy ’s chief of staff and French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner .
Israeli opinion is divided as to the success of their slaughter of Gazan people .
A poll conducted for Haaretz newspaper at the weekend predicted that Likud and its allies would win 65 seats in the elections , giving it a 12 - seat advantage over the centre - left parties , which are expected to capture just 53 of the 120 parliamentary seats up for grabs .
“ Forty - one per cent said that the war was a success and 41 % said it was n’t , ” said Tel Aviv University professor Camil Fuchs , who conducts a poll for Haaretz newspaper and Channel 10 .
The war has served to boost the importance of Netanyahu ’s key campaign issue – national security – and the debate about its aftermath has strengthened his hand .
“ Of those who said it was n’t a success , 37 % said it was because they did n’t finish Hamas off while 31 % said it was n’t a success because they did n’t bring home [ the captured Israeli soldier ] Gilad Shalit , ” Fuchs said .
Some 11 % said the government failed because of the high number of Palestinian casualties .
The Turkish public is showing solid support for Erdogan ’s courageous stance at Davos against Olmert ’s war criminality .
A recent public survey conducted among Turks immediately after the incident in Davos revealed that 78.3 percent of the Turks polled said they welcomed Erdo ? an ’s protest , while 13.7 percent said it was a negative act , 5.6 percent said they had no idea and 2.4 percent responded they knew nothing about the incident .
The survey was carried out Friday by the Metropoll Strategic and Social Studies Center by telephone with 1,002 respondents from 30 cities in order to measure how Erdo ? an ’s public spat and protest were perceived .
According to the poll , 81.7 percent welcomed the Turkish government ’s policy throughout the Gaza crisis , 10.2 percent expressed disapproval and 8.1 percent said they had no idea .
The Davos incident was the peak of a month of strong rhetoric from the prime minister against Israel since its military operation into Gaza Strip began Dec. 27 .
Erdo?an said the offensive was “ savagery ” and a “ crime against humanity ” and said Israel should be barred from the United Nations .
There had also been huge anger among the populace toward Israel ’s operation in Gaza .
Erdogan pragmatically recognises Israel ’s war crimes agaisnt Gaza are aligned with the Israeli elections .
On Saturday , Erdogan said once again that Israel did not act fairly and expressing his disappointment .
He warned , “ We have serious relations ( with Israel ) and they should not be sacrificed for the elections , ” referring to the general elections in Israel this month .
Yet , it appears Israel is vindictively seeking to sabotage Turkey ’s chances of joining the EU .
The Foreign Ministry has learned that senior European Union diplomats were highly critical of the vociferous criticism Erdogan had leveled at Israel over the operation in Gaza and for his support of Hamas .
According to one report , senior European officials said , “ Erdogan wants to be part of the European Union , but now he can forget about it . ”
In other war crimes news , an Israeli IDF officer has been severely reprimanded for handing out a propaganda booklet encouraging IDF to show no mercy to enemies .
The unnamed officer distributed the booklet to troops during the Israeli offensive in Gaza .
It said the soldiers were fighting “ murderers ” .
The military said its chief rabbi , Gen Avichai Rontzki , did not know of the booklet before it was given out .
A rights group said the booklet bordered on “ incitement to racism ” .
The army described the case as an isolated incident .
The booklet cites an ultra-nationalist civilian rabbi who supports the Jewish settler movement in the West Bank .
The rights group , Yesh Din , said the booklet ’s contents could be “ interpreted as a call to act outside the confines of international laws of war ” .
The Times is running a story on the ICC looking at ways to prosecute Israelis for war crimes committed in Gaza .
The alleged crimes include the use of deadly white phosphorus in densely populated civilian areas , as revealed in an investigation by The Times last month .
Israel initially denied using the controversial weapon , which causes horrific burns , but was forced later , in the face of mounting evidence , to admit to having deployed it .
When Palestinian groups petitioned the ICC this month , its prosecutor said that it was unable to take the case because it had no jurisdiction over Israel , a nonsignatory to the court .
Now , however , Luis Moreno - Ocampo , the ICC prosecutor , has told The Times that he is examining the case for Palestinian jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed in Gaza .
Palestinian groups have submitted arguments asserting that the Palestinian Authority is the de facto state in the territory where the crimes were allegedly committed .
“ It is the territorial state that has to make a reference to the court .
They are making an argument that the Palestinian Authority is , in reality , that state , ” Mr Moreno - Ocampo told The Times at the World Economic Forum in Davos .
Part of the Palestinian argument rests on the Israeli insistence that it has no responsibility for Gaza under international law since it withdrew from the territory in 2006 .
“ They are quoting jurisprudence , ” Mr Moreno - Ocampo said .
“ It ’s very complicated .
It ’s a different kind of analysis I am doing .
It may take a long time but I will make a decision according to law . ”
Mr Moreno - Ocampo said that his examination of the case did not necessarily reflect a belief that war crimes had been committed in Gaza .
Determining jurisdiction was a first step , he said , and only after it had been decided could he launch an investigation .
The prosecutor ’s office has already received several files on alleged crimes from Palestinian groups and is awaiting further reports from the Arab League and Amnesty International containing evidence gathered in Gaza . …
The case has wide - reaching ramifications for the Palestinian case for statehood .
If the court rejects the case , it will highlight the legal black hole that Palestinians find themselves in while they remain stateless .
However , it also underlines some of Israel ’s worst fears about a Palestinian state on its borders .
A Palestinian state that ratified the Rome treaty would then be able to refer alleged Israeli war crimes to the court without the current legal wrangling .
The case could also lead to snowballing international recognition of a Palestinian state by countries eager to see Israel prosecuted .
One avenue would be for Israel to agree to investigate its commanders and prosecute any crimes discovered .
That would remove any case from the orbit of the international court .
So far that appears unlikely , given Israel ’s repeated denials of war crimes in Gaza .
The Israeli army has , however , launched an internal inquiry into whether white phosphorus was used in some cases in built - up areas , having eventually admitted that it did use the incendiary substance , which is not illegal as a battlefield smokescreen but is banned from being used in civilian areas .
Camera footage from one such attack shows what appears to be white phosphorous raining down on a UN school in Beit Lahiya , where Red Crescent ambulances and their crews were stationed .
A coalition of Israeli human rights groups has urged the country ’s attorney - general to open an independent investigation into allegations of war crimes by troops , urging that to do so could head off international court cases .
The groups , including the antisettlement organisation B’Tselem , said that there had been reports of Israeli forces firing into civilian areas , denying medical aid to the wounded and preventing Palestinian ambulances from reaching them , and of firing at people carrying white flags .
Meanwhile , the UN is preparing an inquiry into the bombardment of a UN school in Jabaliya , in the northern Gaza Strip .
Israeli forces fired artillery shells outside the school , which had been converted into a refugee shelter for Gazans fleeing their homes .
At least 43 people were killed .
Israel said that Palestinian militants had fired from the compound , which was denied by the UN .
It appears the US supplied the white phosphorus shells which Israel used on civilians in Gaza .
The United States sold phosphorus artillery shells made at the Pine Bluff Arsenal to Israel — the same kind of rounds allegedly used against civilians during the recent fighting in Gaza .
A State Department official told The Associated Press that the rounds — typically used to light up darkened battlefields or provide smoke cover for combat troops — were most recently shipped to Israel in 2007 .
International human rights groups accuse the Israeli military of firing the chemical rounds into civilian homes , causing severe burns to those inside and killing at least one woman .
…
The State Department official , who spoke on condition of anonymity over the sensitivity of the issue , stressed that the white phosphorus rounds should only be used to “ obscure , and thereby protect , troops and their movements . ”
The official said the United States would take any unauthorized use of the rounds seriously and “ would take appropriate , corrective action . ” …
Amnesty International has issued a report about a shelling in a residential area of Gaza City , concluding that Israel used white phosphorus rounds improperly .
Amnesty also said Israel used white phosphorus shells in an attack on U.N. warehouses in Gaza City on Jan. 15 , an incident that infuriated U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon .
Amnesty has accused Israel of committing a war crime by firing the munitions into densely populated areas .
More from Amnesty , this time on Israel ’s attacks on ambulances and paramedics .
Emergency medical rescue workers , including doctors , paramedics and ambulance drivers , repeatedly came under fire from Israeli forces while they were carrying out their duties .
At least seven were killed and more than 20 were injured while they were transporting or attempting to collect the wounded and the dead .
In one case Arafa Hani Abd - al - Dayam , a paramedic , was killed by flechettes , tiny metal darts packed 5 - 8,000 to a shell , which should never be used in civilian areas ( see yesterday ’s post ) .
On 4 January 2009 , an ambulance arrived about 15 minutes after a missile strike in Beit Lahiya that apparently targeted five unarmed young men .
It was hit a few minutes later by a tank shell filled with flechettes .
Two paramedics were seriously wounded in the incident .
One of them , Arafa Hani Abd - al - Dayam , later died .
Examining the wall of the shop beside where the ambulance had been , we found it pierced by hundreds of these darts .
In another case , three paramedics in their mid 20s – Anas Fadhel Na’im , Yaser Kamal Shbeir , and Raf ’at Abd al - ‘ Al – were killed in the early afternoon of 4 January in Gaza City as they walked through a small field on their way to rescue two wounded men in a nearby orchard .
A 12 - year - old boy , Omar Ahmad al - Barade ’e , who was standing near his home indicating to the paramedic the place where the wounded were , was also killed in the same strike .
Artintifada has a chilling first hand account of life during Israel ’s attack from Gazan Rehaf Alagha .
Doctors say that some of these bombs - that were used on us – are made in the U.S.A. and they have caused instant cancer .
These will die within 6 - 7 months .
More than 1,300 are already dead , more than 5500 are injured .
How many more will be dead in 6 - 7 months ….
you do the math !!
Oh but then I guess Israel will not count them as “ civilians ” that are killed as a result of what they have done , they ’re “ human shields , ” right ?
Who would use their own children as human shields ??!!
The Israeli army does it all the time , but of course to our children .
But who would do that to their own children , it ’s just ridiculous .
The Israeli army they handcuff Palestinian kids to their cars so protesters wont throw rocks at them .
They have children and even adults walk in front of the army as it goes around the town going into houses .
How dare they say we use human shields , how dare they say the red cross or the UN schools or the shelters or where they store the food that has come for us , or the ambulances , or where reporters are staying ( all places that are clearly marked and they have the coordinates for ) are carrying weapons or resistance fighters …
They only try to justify what can not be justified .
As for the resistance fighters they do not go near any such area .
Even the homes they justify bombing them and say there were weapons inside , come look , come have an independent organization to come look … there is nothing of the sort .
George Mitchell meets with King Abdullah in Saudia :
… any Middle East solution should ensure the establishment of an independent state for the Palestinians where they can live , the agency said .
Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al - Faisal attended the talks at the king ’s palace in Riyadh .
… King Abdullah , who is the main architect of the Arab peace initiative , held talks with Arab League Secretary - General Amr Moussa before meeting Mitchell .
During the meeting Abdullah and Moussa discussed “ the Arab League ’s efforts to tackle Arab issues , most importantly the Palestinian issue , ” the SPA said .
Several years on , the Arab League is still waiting a formal response from Israel to the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative .
This point was reiterated at Davos by Amr Moussa .
It is likely that Bibi will continue to ignore the initiative , which guarantees recognition of Israel by Arab states in return for the establishment of a Palestinian state and and an Israeli withdrawal on the Syrian front .

The Liberal Democrats have called for a police inquiry into allegations that four Labour peers were prepared to accept money to change proposed laws .
Home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said if the claims , made in the Sunday Times newspaper , were true a criminal offence would have been committed .
The four are said to have offered to amend laws in return for up to £ 120,000 - claims that they all deny .
The Leader of the House of Lords has promised a full investigation .
Lady Royall said she had spoken to the men concerned and would be " pursuing the matter with utmost vigour " , while a Lords committee is expected to undertake an inquiry soon .
Unlike MPs , members of the House of Lords who breach the rules on acceptable conduct cannot be suspended , although they can be " named and shamed " on the floor of Parliament .
The law must apply to everybody regardless of whether they are in the political system or outside it
Chris Huhne Mr Huhne said the Lords must " toughen up " its own procedures to make sure allegations such as these did not surface again .
A precedent was set for police to investigate cases of alleged misconduct in Parliament by a ruling in the 1990s , he added .
" The law must apply to everybody regardless of whether they are in the political system or outside it , " he told the BBC .
" We need clean politics and we need to be sure politics is seen to be clean . "
The BBC has spoken to two of the peers named by the newspaper while a third has also given his reaction to the allegations .
The former energy minister Lord Truscott did admit to having had " discussions " with the reporter , but told the BBC that " to suggest I would offer to put down amendments for money is a lie " .
Lord Moonie , a former defence minister , told the BBC that he had been suspicious of the people who had approached him .
There are no grey areas - paid advocacy is banned and should remain so
Lord Strathclyde
Shadow leader of the Lords
Q&A : Peers cash claims Profiles of peers
He acknowledged discussing a fee of £ 30,000 with the undercover reporters but said : " I am not aware of having offered to do anything for these people that was outside the rules . "
He went on to say that any arrangement would have been based on a written contract and would have involved advising them on how to get amendments to legislation - but he would have been acting strictly as an adviser and consultant .
A third peer , Lord Taylor of Blackburn , told Sky News that he had done nothing wrong .
" I have never , never in my career in the Lords or in local government , done anything that I am ashamed of in any way , " he said .
Former Labour whip Lord Snape indicated he could help amend a bill for a fee of up to £ 24,000 a year , the newspaper said .
The paper said Lord Snape issued a statement " saying that he had made it clear to the reporters that he was unable to ' initiate or amend any legislation on behalf of an individual or a company ' .
" However , he said he did think the reporters ' proposed exemption might be ' beneficial ' and undertook to ' investigate ' further , " the paper said .
' Grim picture ' A spokesman for the Committee on Lords ' Interests said an investigation would be launched if a complaint was received , which is expected on Monday .
It would be the first major inquiry by the committee since it was set up a few months ago .
Lady Royall told BBC
News that she would also continue to pursue her own inquiries by speaking to the four peers concerned more fully .
Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show , Lady Royall said she did not feel " comfortable " reading about the allegations , and if they were true , it would be a " very grim picture " .
Lord Truscott has denied offering to put down amendments for cash " Clearly , it looks very serious but I 'm concerned everybody 's side of the story should be heard .
We do n't have trial by media in this country , " she said .
Shadow business secretary Ken Clarke said the Commissioner for Standards had to carry out an independent inquiry .
" If the allegations are true , I 'm afraid this one is very serious - to take money to try to alter legislation for the benefit of the people paying you a fee ...
I think some people would call that corruption , " he told Andrew Marr .
Lord Strathclyde , the shadow leader of the Lords , said there should be " a swift investigation " .
" The rules are clear , " he said .
" There are no grey areas .
Paid advocacy is banned and should remain so . "
BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said trying to influence Parliamentary legislation was outside the House of Lords code of conduct , but peers not paid a salary can offer general advice to private firms as consultants .
" That may be where there 's a bit of a grey area , where people can quite honestly say ' I have n't broken any rules ' , " he said .
The Sunday Times said its reporters had posed as lobbyists acting for a foreign client .
This firm was said to be setting up a chain of shops in the UK and wanting an exemption from the Business Rates Supplements Bill .

Eric Holder Says Pardons for FALN Terrorists Were Reasonable
I am not sure what you have to do wrong if you are a Barack Obama cabinet nominee to have your appointment denied .
Timothy Geithner is going to be confirmed as Treasury Secretary even though he was a known tax evader who was reimbursed by the company he worked for for the taxes he never paid , he is now going to be in charge of the IRS along with fellow tax cheat Charlie Rangel .
And now we have Eric Holder , Obama choice for Attorney General , when questioned on his recommendation to President Clinton that 16 unrepentent FALN terrorist be pardoned claimed that that decision was “ reasonable ” .
These terrorists were linked to over 130 bombings and other violent crimes , here is what Erik Holder had to say about the pardons :
These were criminals , these were terrorists , these were bad people , ” Holder said .
“ The president ’s determination was they did not commit any acts themselves .
Given the length of the sentences , 16 - to - 19 years , given the lengthy sentences , it was his determination that the clemency requests were appropriate .
Given all that I ’ve described , what the president did was reasonable
They did n’t commit the crimes themselves , so while they are criminals who were involved in murders , bombing , robbery , and the like it is reasonable that they should be pardoned .
That ’s good to know , by this logic a person can hire a hitman to kill somebody and because he did n’t commit the crime himself it would be reasonable to pardon him .
It is not surprising when you read the quote from Holder above that Barack Obama chose him for the job , after all Barack Obama has an affinity for “ palling around with ” unrepentant terrorists and he wants to close GITMO and give enemy combatants full rights to a trial guaranteed in the UNITED STATES constitution ( for Americans ) .
Eric Holder should fit right in .

People with “ body integrity identity disorder ” often feel the urge to amputate limbs ( Image : Image Source / Rex )
It ’s a bizarre and rare disorder , but its consequences can be horrific .
One man with body integrity identity disorder ( BIID ) dumped his lower leg in dry ice for several hours until doctors were forced to amputate .
Others have resorted to wood chippers and gunshots to do away with healthy limbs they never wanted .
Now a study of four men with BIID suggest their condition is linked to reduced activity in a brain area involved in forming a mental body map .
“ They can feel the body being touched , but it does not integrate into their sense of body image , ” says Paul McGeoch , a neuroscientist at the University of California , San Diego , who presented the study at a recent conference on the condition in Frankfurt - am - Main , Germany .

“ They know the limb is part of their body , but it ’s ‘ more ’ than it should be .
It should be gone , ” he adds .
Sexual oddity
The disorder , also known as apotemnophilia , was first described in 1977 by the American sexologist John Money .
He classified it as an intense sexual desire to have an amputation , hence its original name , which is Greek for love of amputation .
Most patients , however , do n’t describe their desire to be amputees as sexual , says Michael First , a psychiatrist at Columbia University in New York who has conducted extensive interviews with dozens of patients .
“ It ’s very , very rare , ” First says of all forms of the disorder .
“ I ’ve been working on this condition now , researching it for 8 years , and I almost never get calls from therapists saying ‘ I have somebody with this .
I need your advice . ’ “
Brain malfunction
Explanations for how BIID develops have run the gamut , from a cry for attention to early childhood exposure to an amputee , McGeoch notes .
Those explanations “ seemed absolute nonsense to us ” , he says .
Instead , he and co-author David Brang theorise that the disorder is caused by a malfunction in a brain area called the right parietal lobe .
Other studies have linked this region to people ’s representation of their own body : stroke patients who suffer damage to this area sometimes fail to recognise a limb as their own .
“ We suggest that perhaps apotemnophillia , or BIID or whatever you want to call it , is a cognitive variation on this – there ’s something cognitively wrong with their right parietal lobe , ” McGeoch says .
To test this hypothesis , McGoech ’s team recruited four men with BIID via internet support groups .
Though precise numbers are hard to come by , the disorder is about 10 times more common in men than in women .
Scanning evidence
The team tested subjects using a non-invasive brain imaging technology called magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) , which measures the tiny magnetic fields created when neurons fire .
When researchers touched the limb that BIID subjects perceived as normal , their right parietal lobe kicked into action .
When they touched the limb subjects wanted gone , activity in the right parietal lobe did n’t change .
One patient who wanted both his legs amputated registered no increased activity at all , McGeoch ’s team found .
Meanwhile , four volunteers with no desire to hack off a limb cranked up their right parietal lobes when researchers touched either leg .
“ The fact that they ’re able to scan anybody is amazing , ” given the rarity of BIID , says First .
He guesses that no more than a few thousand people worldwide have the disorder .
Warped body image
He is , however , not yet convinced that a deficit in the right parietal lobe causes BIID .
It ’s also possible that a strong desire to amputate a limb could transform neural circuitry in a brain region responsible for body image , he says .
“ There ’s a chicken - and - egg problem here . ”
The limb that patients want amputated can change throughout their lifetime , First notes .
“ That ca n’t be explained by a cognitive mismapping [ of the limb ] . ”
Deeper insight into the causes of BIID could offer insight into how to treat the condition .
Drugs that alleviate symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorders are one possibility worth testing , First says .
Yet many patients see an actual amputation as the best treatment possible .
“ I have never heard of them regretting it , ” McGeoch says .
“ They ’re always delighted . ”

Several churches were built in Morocco during the colonial era
Morocco has expelled five European missionaries for attempting to convert local Muslims to Christianity .
The five women have been put on a ferry and sent to Spain - the home country of four of the five .
The other is German .
Morocco prides itself on its religious tolerance , but it has also cracked down on Shia Muslims in recent weeks .
It is against the law to try to convert Muslims in Morocco and the interior ministry spokesman said the five had been caught " red- handed " .
A number of video cassettes in Arabic were apparently found when police broke up the meeting , described as Evangelical .
In recent years a number of converted Christians have been convicted for holding illegal religious gatherings and similar offences in neighbouring Algeria .
But BBC Rabat correspondent James Copnall says Morocco has always prided itself on its religious tolerance .
But human rights groups have protested at the recent series of events targeting those apparently promoting the Shia form of Islam .
Morocco is almost entirely Sunni .
The kingdom cut off diplomatic relations with Iran at the beginning of this month , and accused the Iranian embassy of trying to convert Moroccans into Shias .
A school has been closed , and there have been reports of Shia books and CDs being seized .
The Moroccan authorities are adamant there is no link between this and the expulsion of the five Christians , but our correspondent says this is unlikely to convince everybody .
During President Obama 's fiscal summit , he graciously called on John McCain first and gave him a really nice introduction .
In response , McCain acted like a spiteful loser who showed no class , only disdain at not standing where Obama was .
He attacks President Obama over the cost of a fleet of helicopters :
" I 'm going to start with John McCain , because , ... you know , he and I had some good debates about these issues , " President Obama said in the final session of the Fiscal Responsibility Summit .
" But -- and I mean what I say here -- I think John has also been extraordinarily consistent and sincere about these issues .
And I want to see if you 've -- John , you 've got some thoughts about where we need to go and some priority areas .
I know you were in procurement , for example , which is an area I know we would like to work on together with you . "
" Well , thank you , Mr. President .
And thank you for doing this ... Just one area that I wanted to mention that I think consumed a lot of our conversation on procurement , it was the issue of cost overruns in the Defense Department .
We all know how large the defense budget is . "
And , McCain noted , " your helicopter is now going to cost as much as Air Force One .
I do n't think that there 's any more graphic demonstration of how good ideas have -- have cost taxpayers an enormous amount of money . "
Obama said the helicopter he has now seems adequate , adding that he never had a helicopter before and " maybe I 've been deprived and I did n't know it . "
President Obama 's humorous answer made McCain look foolish for asking about the helicopter fleet .
This is Obama at his most appealing .
He makes a gracious introduction of his rival , who in turn tries to stick in the knife by painting him as wasting taxpayer dollars on needless luxuries .
Obama , rather than sniping back , turns around and agrees with McCain while making the point that he 's hardly accustomed to extravagence .
The man is just a very , very skilled politician .
I was watching MSNBC at the time and Chris Matthews was on this morning and said that he thought McCain sandbagged President Obama with the question .
In their next block , Andrea Mitchell was just amazed at how well McCain was doing to be re-integrated back into the Senate .
And Eric Cantor , the new Newt Gingrich of the konservatives , the guy who is trying to become the new face of Republican obstructionism , looked star - struck when he was picked by President Obama to ask a question .

News that American Idol 8 ‘ s top 13 presents a unique problem with the voting phone numbers –the next number in the sequence , 1 - 866 - IDOLS - 13 , is actually a phone sex line –has just reached host Ryan Seacrest .
Ryan discovered this a half - hour ago , tweeting , “ crap , were gonna have a problem on Idol tonight – just dialed 1 - 866 - IDOLS - 13 and its not quite SFW . ”
A few minutes ago , he posted an update on Twitter , writing , “ oh man…1 - 866 - IDOLS -00 is dirty too , lol .
Just talked to one of the Idol producers and they have a plan… * crossing fingers * ”
His comments do n’t make it clear if the producers knew before MJ ’s Big Blog and Dial Idol broke the news , but having “ a plan ” does n’t sound to me like they planned far enough in advance to change all of the phone numbers for all of the contestants .
Buses carrying the slogans are operating around the UK A Christian bus driver has refused to drive a bus with an atheist slogan proclaiming " There 's probably no God " .
Ron Heather , from Southampton , Hampshire , responded with " shock " and " horror " at the message and walked out of his shift on Saturday in protest .
First Bus said it would do everything in its power to ensure Mr Heather does not have to drive the buses .
Buses across Britain started displaying atheist messages in an advertising campaign launched earlier this month .
Mr Heather told BBC Radio Solent : " I was just about to board and there it was staring me in the face , my first reaction was shock horror .
" I felt that I could not drive that bus , I told my managers and they said they have n't got another one and I thought I better go home , so I did .
Mr Heather said he was shocked at the " starkness " of the advert " I think it was the starkness of this advert which implied there was no God . "
When he returned to work on Monday he was called into a meeting with managers and agreed to go back to work with the promise he would only have to drive the buses if there were no others available .
First Bus said in a statement : " As a company we understand Mr Heather 's views regarding the atheist bus advert and we are doing what we can to accommodate his request not to drive the buses concerned . "
It added : " As an organisation we do n't endorse any of the products or sentiments advertised on our buses .
" The content of this advert has been approved by the Advertising Standards Agency and therefore it is capable of being posted on static sites or anywhere else . "
The advertising campaign is backed by the British Humanist Association and prominent atheist Professor Richard Dawkins .
Hanne Stinson , chief executive of the British Humanist Association , said : " I have difficulty understanding why people with particular religious beliefs find the expression of a different sort of beliefs to be offensive .
" I can't understand why some people seem to have a different attitude when it comes to atheists . "
Pressure group Christian Voice has questioned the campaign 's effectiveness but the Methodist Church said it would be a " good thing if it gets people to engage with the deepest questions of life " and suggested it showed there was a " continued interest in God " .
The advertisements run on 200 bendy buses in London and 600 vehicles in England , Scotland and Wales .

Dear Mr. President , I read your New Era $ 3.6 Trillion Budget Proposal .
I also listened to your speech Tuesday night .
You made a great campaign speech .
However , the campaign is over .
You won .
And the reason you won is you offered hope as well as a promise of change .
With all due respect Mr. President , Tim Geithner and Ben Bernanke are offering the same policies as President Bush and Secretary Paulson .
Those policies are to bail out banks regardless of cost to taxpayers .
Mr. President , it 's hard enough to overlook Geithner 's tax indiscretions .
Mr. President , it is harder still .
if not impossible , to ignore the fact that neither Geithner nor Bernanke saw this coming .
Yet amazingly they are both cock sure of the solution .
Even more amazing is the fact that solution changes every day .
With all due respect Mr. President , Geithner and Bernanke are a huge part of the problem , and no part of the solution and the sooner you realize that the better off this nation will be .
With all due respect Mr. President , your budget proposal is the same big government spending as we saw under President Bush .
The only difference is you promised more spending and bigger government , while President Bush promised less government and less spending and failed to deliver on either count .
With all due respect Mr. President , it is impossible to spend one 's way out of a problem , when the problem is reckless spending .
With all due respect Mr. President , you and Congress want to force banks to lend when banks ( by not lending ) are acting responsibly for the first time in a decade .
Mr , President can you please tell us who banks are supposed to lend to ?
Do we need any more Home Depots ?
Pizza Huts ?
Strip malls ?
Nail salons ?
Auto dealerships ?
What Mr. President ?
What ?
And why should banks be lending when unemployment is rising and lending risks right along with it ?
With all due respect Mr. President , we were hoping your administration would not carry on the war mongering policies of your predecessor .
Instead we see amazingly that you Seek $ 75.5 Billion More for Wars in 2009 .
Mr. President , do we really need another $ 75 billion for wars ?
Was there nothing in the military budget that could be cut ?
With all due respect Mr. President ,
The United States spends more on its military budget than the next 45 highest spending countries in the world combined ;
The United States accounts for 48 percent of the world 's total military spending ;
The United States spends on its military 5.8 times more than China , 10.2 times more than Russia , and 98.6 times more than Iran .
Is n't that enough Mr. President ?
With all due respect Mr. President , the downfall of every great nation in history has been unsustainable military expansion .
Mr. President , the US can no longer afford to be the world 's policeman .
You act as if we can .
Mr. President , can you please tell us how we can afford this spending ?
With all due respect Mr. President , Fannie Mae Reported A Fourth Quarter Loss Of $ 25.2 Billion .
Can you please tell us where you draw the line on taxpayer bailouts of Fannie Mae ?
Freddie Mac ?
AIG ?
Mr. President is there a line anywhere , on anything ?
If there is , we would appreciate knowing where it is .
With all due respect Mr. President , how can you talk about reducing the budget deficit while proposing the biggest budget in history ?
With all due respect Mr. President , how is it possible to talk about reducing health care costs while proposing to increase the health care budget ?
With all due respect Mr. President , you have talked about " hard choices " .
Can you please tell us what hard choices you have made other than to throw money at every problem ?
Sure a few programs have changed but Bush orchestrated the biggest Medicaid / Medicare package in history and you upped it .
You upped military spending .
You criticized McCain for cutting programs that amount to peanuts , and all you can find to cut out of the budget is peanuts .
With all due respect Mr. President , your " Era of New Responsibility " is nothing more than a continuation of the Bush administration Era of Irresponsibility .
Mr. President , we hoped for more and deserved more .
Yet , behind the charade of campaign messages of hope and change , we essentially see the same fiscal irresponsibility and misguided policies as before .
Oh sure Mr. President , your budget priorities have shifted a bit , sadly the irresponsible spending did not .

Well , New Yorkers can rest a little easier .
The proposed soda tax has been shot down .
It ’s main proponent , Gov. David Paterson , is taking the defeat in stride :
New York Gov. David Paterson admitted Thursday one of his most talked - about tax proposals , an obesity tax on sugary drinks , is fizzling .
But he said it popped the right question .
In meeting with college students over his budget , Paterson told the young New Yorkers not worry about his soda tax because the Legislature wo n’t go for it .
But he said it has served its purpose of raising awareness of childhood obesity .

The Idea Behind Rails
Ruby on Rails was created by David Heinemeier Hansson as a kind of byproduct of Basecamp ’s development at 37signals in 2004 .
Basecamp was built in Ruby because Hansson found PHP and Java not powerful or flexible enough .
It was quite an obscure language back then , without the large eco-system available today .
To make development easier , Hansson rolled his own Web development framework , based on simple ideas that had proven successful elsewhere .
Rails is founded on pragmatism and established paradigms instead of exotic new ideas .
And that ’s what made it so successful .
Rails is based on the Model - View - Controller pattern that splits your application into three parts :
The Models are your business objects describing the structure and behavior of the problem your application is trying to solve .
These are usually backed by an Object - Relational - Mapping framework that persists your objects to a database in the background .

The Views are the templates that render data to the user and all the logic surrounding presentational aspects of your app .
are the templates that render data to the user and all the logic surrounding presentational aspects of your app .
The Controller sits at the heart of everything , processing requests from clients , initiating changes in the models and triggering the rendering of the templates .
Rails is “ opinionated software . ”
It does n’t want to be everything for everyone .
It focuses on one way of doing things and streamlines all its parts around that way .
That ’s not to say there ’s no possibility of doing things differently if you need to , but you ’ll definitely have it easier if you do things “ the Rails way . ”
And that way happened to be exactly the right one not only for Hansson but for a lot of other developers , too , another important reason for Rails ’ success .
Programmer productivity was the main goal during Rails ’ development , not performance .
This has led to a lot of controversy and claims that arise over and over about how Rails ca n’t scale .
This is Rails ’ own fault to a certain degree .
In its early days , it had the image of a Web development framework messiah of hope and wonder that would lead us all to the promised land were applications wrote themselves .
The Rails team did n’t do enough to keep expectations more realistic , and some people became disappointed .
While it ’s true that Ruby on Rails is slower than comparable stacks on PHP or Python , it certainly does scale , as hundreds of successful deployments are proving .
You ’ll just need to scale sooner and put some thought into it .
Remember also that Ruby ’s current default implementation is terribly inefficient , but alternatives are on the way .
There ’s nothing inherently slow about the language , though , as blazing - fast implementations of Smalltalk ( a language very similar to Ruby ) prove .
Ruby will only get faster .
As the saying goes , you do n’t have a performance problem until you have a performance problem , and all this talk should not scare you yet .
You have n’t even started . ;)
Now , before I introduce you to the framework , let ’s get started with Ruby .
A Gem From Japan
Ruby on Rails owes not only half its name but its entire feel and flexibility to “ Ruby , ” that neat little language from Japan .
Ruby came out in 1995 and was developed by Yukihiro Matsumoto , or “ Matz ” as he ’s called in the community .
Version 1.0 was released in 1999 and slowly gained recognition in the west from then on .
A key point in the spread of Ruby was the release of “ Programming Ruby , ” also called the “ Pickaxe ” ( a reference to its cover illustration ) , by the Pragmatic Programmers .
“ Programming Ruby ” was the first comprehensive English guide to the language and API .
Ruby was designed with simple principles in mind .
Matz took the most successful and powerful elements from his favorite programming languages – Perl , Smalltak and Lisp – and combined them into one language with easy syntax .
One goal was to make Ruby feel “ natural , not simple ” and to create a language “ that was more powerful than Perl , and more object - oriented than Python . ”
This results in Ruby ’s core principle : Everything is an object .
Objects
Let ’s stop here and examine this .
Really , everything is an object in Ruby .
True and false are objects , literals are objects , classes are objects .
You can call a method on a numeric literal :
>> 5.next => 6
Operators in Ruby are nothing but methods :
>> 5 * 10 => 50 >> 5 .*( 10 ) # times - operator called as a method ( dot- notation ) => 50 # with a parameter ( in parentheses )
Ruby is extremely flexible and open .
Almost everything about it can be changed or manipulated at runtime :
You can add and remove methods and variables to and from objects .
You can add and remove methods and variables to and from classes .
You can truly manipulate any class this way , even core classes like String and Integer !
Here ’s an example :
>> " hi " .repeat ( 4 ) NoMethodError : undefined method `repeat ' for " hi " : String >> class String #
Open the string class and add the method >> def repeat( i ) >> self * i >> end >> end => nil >> " hi " .repeat ( 4 ) # Call it again on a fresh String literal => " hihihihi " #
And there it is !
Here , I defined the method repeat on the String core class , and it was immediately available on a string literal .
And he who giveth , taketh away :
>> class String #
Open up the method again >> undef_method : repeat #
And remove the method >> end => String >> " hi " .repeat ( 4 ) #
Try to call it NoMethodError : undefined method `repeat ' for " hi" : String
I could have also done this with predefined methods .
They are no more “ special ” than the methods we have defined .
Let ’s review the definition of repeat in the above example for some more interesting tidbits .
Note that we ’re not saying return anywhere in the body .
That is because in Ruby , methods always implicitly return the value of their last expression .
You could of course always jump out of a method by using return before reaching the last statement , but you do n’t have to .
The expression we ’re returning is self * i .
Self is equal to this in Java and $ this in PHP and always refers to the current object .
The times - operator on a string repeats the string as often as told by the second operand / parameter , i in this case .
Loops
You rarely see manual iterations in Ruby , like for or while loops .
Instead , Collections come with their own iterators that you can pass blocks to , which are executed for every element in the collection :
a = " Hey " [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] . each do |num| puts a * num end # Outputs : # Hey # Hey Hey # Hey Hey Hey
What you see here is an array literal containing numbers .
On that array , the each method is called , an iterator that takes a block and calls the block for every element in the array .
The block starts with the do , followed by a list of its parameters enclosed in pipe symbols .
Here we have one parameter called num that will take on the value of the array element in each iteration .
Inside the block , we ’re simply outputting the result of a * num .
The definition of * on Strings is to repeat the string accordingly .
We could have put the String inside the Block , but I wanted to demonstrate that blocks have access to their surrounding scope .
Syntax
Ruby likes to keep the syntax clean and friendly .
You can see this in the above examples .
Although heavily influenced by Perl , Ruby does n’t have Perl ’s excessive use of special characters .
You can use semicolons to end lines , but you do n’t have to ( and no Ruby programmer does ) .
You do n’t need to surround method parameters with braces in unambiguous situations ( although it is recommended you do so if they enhance readability ) , and you especially do n’t need to provide empty braces around an empty parameter list .
That ’s what makes accessors look so much like native properties .
Blocks are framed by do and end .
You should only use equivalent curly braces if your blocks do n’t span several lines .
The only significant use of special characters is found at variable declaration .
Variables in Ruby are prefixed with special characters to indicate their scope .
Variables starting with a lowercase letter are local variables .
Variables starting with an uppercase letter are constants .
( This means that all classes are constants , too , since classes start with uppercase letters . )
Instance variables start with an @ .
Class variables that are shared among all instances of a class start with @@ .
Finally , global variables all start with a $ .
You ’ll often find methods ending in ? or ! .
These are not special characters .
It is merely conventional in Ruby to use question marks for methods that query an object for a Boolean condition , like Array#empty ? , or exclamation marks for methods that are destructible :
>> a = [ 5 , 1 , 9 , 2 , 7 ] # Create an array and store it in a => [ 5 , 1 , 9 , 2 , 7 ] >> a.sort # sort merely returns a new , sorted array => [ 1 , 2 , 5 , 7 , 9 ] >> a => [ 5 , 1 , 9 , 2 , 7 ] # a still is in its original order >> a.sort !
# sort !
instead sorts the original array => [ 1 , 2 , 5 , 7 , 9 ] >> a => [ 1 , 2 , 5 , 7 , 9 ] # a was changed
Conditionals
Conditionals in Ruby are very similar to other programming languages , with two notable exceptions .
First , it ’s possible to put a conditional after the statement it protects to make the code more readable :
execute_dangerous_operation ( ) if user.is_authorized ?
# is equal to if user.is_authorized ? execute_dangerous_operation ( )
end
Secondly , Ruby has not only an if but an unless .
This is a syntactic nicety for when you want to check for the absence of a condition in a more readable manner :
unless user.is_admin?
user . delete else raise " Ca n't delete admins " end
Symbols
Sometimes you ’ll see names starting with a : ( colon ) .
These are a very special feature of Ruby called symbols .
Symbols can be used to index hashes or mark states in a variable like you would with an ENUM in C .
They are very similar to Strings but also very different .
The point about symbols is that they do n’t really occupy space in memory , and the same symbol literal always resolves to the exact same symbol :
>> " a" .object_id # object_id returns Ruby 's internal identifier for an object => 3477510 >> " a" .object_id => 3475550 # a new object on the heap >> :a.object_id => 184178 >> :a.object_id => 184178 # the same literal refers to the exact same Symbol object
You ’ll find them very often as parameters to methods , where they indicate how a method should work ,
User.find ( : all ) # find all users User.find ( : first ) # find the first user
or as pointers to methods and variables ( see the undef_method example in the “ Objects ” paragraph above ) .
Classes and Modules
Ruby supports single inheritance only , but for added flexibility it supports a feature called Mixins .
In Ruby , it ’s possible to define Modules that contain Methods and constants and to include these modules in a class via the include method .
This way , you can extend the functionality of a class very easily .
Many of Ruby ’s core classes even use this mechanism .
Array and Hash , for example , both include the Enumerable module to provide a lot of convenience methods for iterating over their contents .
Often , Modules pose certain requirements to classes that include them .
The Enumerable Module , for example , requires classes to provide at least an each method and an implementation of < = > , too , if its sorting features are to be used .
Modules also serve other purposes .
Most importantly , they can be used to organize code into namespaces .
Because classes are constants ( which means you ca n’t assign another class to the same name ) , they can be stored in modules .
These modules can then be nested to form namespaces .
These paragraphs probably wo n’t enable you to write Ruby programs , but you should be able to understand the code samples in this article now .
If you want to explore Ruby a little , try the great interactive tutorial at Try Ruby , or take a peek at one of the books listed at the end of this article .
If you just want to see some more code samples , check out the Wikipedia page on Ruby .
In the second part of this tutorial we will get rolling with Ruby on Rails , install the engine , take a closer look at Rails ’ inner workings and discover main advantages of Ruby on Rails .

King Abdullah has a reputation as a reformer King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia has sacked two powerful religious officials in a wide ranging shake - up of the cabinet and other government posts .
One of the dismissed men was the head of the controversial religious police force .
The other was the country 's most senior judge .
The king also appointed the country 's first - ever female minister and replaced the head of the central bank .
Correspondents say such government reshuffles are rare in Saudi Arabia .
King Abdullah , who came to power in 2005 , has for a long time had the reputation of a reformer - and the latest appointments have the makings of one of the biggest shake - ups in Saudi public life for many years .
The BBC's Arab affairs analyst Bob Trevelyan says the pace of change has been slow in the four years of the king 's reign .
Despite the shake - up , our correspondent says the kingdom remains an absolute monarchy and real political change is not on the agenda .
Feared organisation
The sacked head judge , Sheikh Salih Ibn al - Luhaydan , caused controversy last September when he said it was permissible to kill the owners of satellite TV channels which broadcast immoral programmes .
Sheikh Salih Ibn al - Luhaydan said some " evil " entertainment programmes aired by the channels promoted debauchery .
Our correspondent says the sheikh may well be paying the price for airing his opinions .
The shake - up also affected the feared religious police organisation , known as the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice .
Sheikh Ibrahim al - Ghaith has lost his job as head of the commssion , which enforces Saudi Arabia 's conservative brand of Islam , Wahhabism .
The commission has wide powers to search for alcohol and drugs , to crack down on prostitution and ensure shops are closed during prayer times .
But our correspondent says the religious police have been widely criticised recently over allegations of brutality - the kind of comments that could never have been made publicly a few years ago .
Meanwhile , Norah al - Faiz now holds the most senior official position a woman has held in Saudi Arabia .
She has been appointed to the newly - created post of deputy education minister for women 's affairs .

How can your business participate in charitable works for the youth ?
Business plays a major role in influencing young people through active engagement throughout their own communities .
Every company has a role , big or small , in the greater community .
And it ’s important for leaders to consider new ways to foster a community connection for their company and employees as well .
Business can engage themselves in charitable works for the youth through the following ;
You can involve your business via funding Priorities .
Business should respond to needs in the community proactively and strategically by way of grants and financial support to create positive social change by providing funding to scale out and develop curriculum for non¬ - profit youth programs .
Providing for young people who are disconnected economically or socially excluded with opportunities to participate in decision making process to ensure their full involvement in society .
Your business can engage in helpful work for the youth by setting up a drop - in center that must carry out structured and focused activities that are clearly directed toward addressing or inhibiting specific evils facing youth and can be operated to prevent or address problems such as violent behavior of at - risk youth by helping them improve anger management skills and addressing drug addiction among youth by offering self - help and peer support programs .
For drop in - centers to illustrate that their activities are focused , structured , and evidently directed to addressing or averting specific problems facing young people , drop - in centers can use suitable qualification criteria and selection processes to choose individuals that will interact with youth .
Social and recreational activities .
This needs to be structured in a way that they provide benefit to the youth activities such as movie nights , concerts , and youth dances that are supervised by responsible and qualified individuals focused in dealing with issues that critically affect the youth .
This boosts the organization ’s reputation .
Advancement in education .
Your business can participate in charitable youth works by enabling the youth to advance in their education by providing information and training activities in a structured and organized manner that solely lies on improving the lives of individuals in the society by various ways such as teaching a job seeking and interview and job interview skills , second language and practical business training and experience .
Sports Activities .
Your business can engage in charitable work for youngsters by engaging in sports activities that must demonstrate that the activity is a structured and focused attempt to address an identified youth issues .
Practical proof of a causal linking between the activity and the delivery of the charitable benefit is needed .
An example is when involvement in sports activities is shown to be part of a planned program to prevent the youth at the risk .
Giving young people participation and influencing roles .
It is crucial to consider youth ’s value of manipulating and putting their weight behind an organization , especially in participation and influencing roles .
A company should create young people ’s advisory group that are valued as a board because the direction they give teams can often mean the variance between a piece of work succeeding and failing .
Your responsibility to contribute to the youth is not limited however to certain charity works .
Bookmark Website Builder , for example , contributes a portion of every sale to provide clean water to underprivileged nations .
Empowering the youth could be sparked with something as simple as clean water .
Wolfram Research has worked with the CBS / Paramount show NUMB3RS since its first season .
Now in the fifth season , it remains the most popular show of Friday nights .
“ The Math behind NUMB3RS ” gives a more in - depth look at some of the mathematics in each episode .
With season 5 , we ’ve added a math puzzle to go with each episode .
Fifteen episodes into season 5 , there are fifteen puzzles available .
For each puzzle we make a web page with an episode file that contains the puzzle itself , a hint section that discusses the related mathematics , a quote from the episode , and a detailed solution .
For example , in episode 509 , “ Conspiracy Theory , ” the puzzle is “ Nonrandom Matrix “ — a type of Latin square also known as a Sudoku puzzle .
In a Sudoku puzzle , you must fill in the matrix so that every row , column , and 3×3 box contains the digits 1 through 9 .
The puzzle for episode 504 is called “ Two Trains . ”
Two trains 100 km apart each travel towards each other at 10 km per hour .
A bumblebee starts flying back and forth between the two trains at 60 km per hour , until the two trains crash into each other .
How far does the bumblebee travel ?
As the site reveals , the two trains will collide in … well , try to solve it .
The set - up for the infinite series can be seen at MathWorld ‘s “ Two Trains Puzzle ” page .
The NUMB3RS puzzle page also offers another classic puzzle , a train - shunting one by Sam Loyd :
The puzzle for episode 510 , “ Last Person Standing , ” is based on the “ Truel World ” Demonstration .
In this truel ( a three - person duel ) , A is weakest , C is strongest .
A shoots first , then B , then C .
What is the best strategy for A , and what are the chances that A will win ?
To approximate this , a die is chosen , and each player must roll under a certain value to hit .
Odds of hitting are given in the first line of each circle .
Originally , I suggested that in the best strategy , A should deliberately miss , while the strongest trade shots .
When a player is eliminated , A should take aim at the survivor .
Some math geniuses at Berkeley let me know that I was wrong .
When players A B C have accuracies of a b c , player A should shoot at C when For example , if C always hits , and B hits a third of the time , there are two possible best strategies for A .
When A should shoot at C .
When A should deliberately miss at the start .
When it does n’t matter which strategy A picks .
The weakest player in a truel often has a nonintuitively high chance of winning .
For example , when everyone has exactly a one - third chance to win .
In this case , A should deliberately miss .
In a game where A shoots C , the simplest set of odds where everyone has exactly a one - third chance to win is the following :
a = 1780225612071980440487233690 / 42514698180175799467200302197
b = 890112806035990220243616845 / 12666774444361618608640463004
c = 326459223625633611840607911167657350 / 3023918895788355583589056125975619389
( a , b , c ) = ( 0.0418732 , 0.0702715 , 0.107959 )
If the die is a 6 - sided cube , and A hits on 1 and 2 , B hits on 1 - 4 , and C hits on 1 - 5 , here is a visualization of an intermediary stage .

California Attorney General Jerry Brown filed suit in federal court to block an " audacious attempt " by the Bush Administration to gut provisions in the Endangered Species
Act mandating scientific review of federal agency decisions that may threaten endangered species and their habitat .
" The Bush Administration is seeking to gut the Endangered Species Act on its way out the door , " Brown said .
" This is an audacious attempt to circumvent a time - tested statute that for 35 years has required scientific review of proposed federal agency decisions that affect wildlife . ” "
The new regulations , initially proposed by the departments of the Interior and Commerce in August 2008 and made final on Dec. 16 , largely eliminate a requirement in the Endangered Species
Act that mandates scientific review of the agency decisions that could affect endangered and threatened species and their habitats .
The changes allow federal agencies to undertake or permit mining , logging and other commercial activities on federal land and other areas without obtaining review or comment from federal wildlife biologists on the environmental effects of such activities .
" The new regulations are the most significant changes to the Endangered Species Act and its implementing regulations in 20 years , " Brown 's office said in a statement .
Now that the regulations have been adopted , many decisions on whether to permit commercial activities on protected land could be made at the discretion of federal agency project proponents , according to Brown 's office .
" These agencies generally lack adequate biological expertise and have incentives to conclude that their projects will not have adverse affects on endangered and threatened species and their habitat , " according to the statement .
The changes also eliminate the requirement to consider the effects of greenhouse gas emissions on species and ecosystems from proposed federal projects .
Federal agencies now no longer need to consider the possible adverse impacts on species like the polar bear from commercial projects that require federal approval or funding such as highway construction and coal - fired power plants .
The lawsuit , filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California , alleges that the Bush Administration :
Violated the Endangered Species
Act by adopting regulations that are inconsistent with that statute ;
Violated the National Environmental Policy
Act by failing to consider the environmental ramifications of the proposed new regulations ; and
Violated the Administrative Procedures
Act by not adequately considering public comments submitted by the Attorney General and numerous other organizations and concerned citizens .
The Attorney General 's lawsuit follows three similar lawsuits challenging the regulations filed earlier by environmental groups .
I.B.M.’s interest in acquiring the server computer maker Sun Microsystems for nearly $ 7 billion may seem at first to be a reversal of its recent efforts to move away from the hardware business .
But analysts say there is more to Sun than servers , which are used in corporate data centers .
They say its strengths in software , systems design and research make it an attractive target .
The price tag being discussed by the companies works out to nearly $ 10 a share , a person with knowledge of the negotiations said on Wednesday .
That is approximately twice Sun ’s closing price on Tuesday .
Shares of Sun surged nearly 79 percent Wednesday on news of the negotiations , to close at $ 8.89 .
I.B.M. has pared back its dependence on hardware , where profit gains have declined , while increasing its investment in higher - margin software and services businesses .
It sold off its personal computer business to Lenovo of China in 2005 , and its hard - disk drive unit to Hitachi of Japan in 2003 .
I 'm used to being mystified by the poor quality of Ad Agency websites .
Always quick to try and be trendier than the rest , most miss the actual point of a website - to engage and educate your audience .
This misconception leads most agencies to have all Flash sites that are nearly impossible to navigate ; it 's a constant topic of discussion in web designer and developer circles .
I thought as agencies moved more into the new media age and obtained a better grasp of online marketing that their sites would also improve .
However , today I discovered that two large , respected agencies recently launched new sites that are as bad as any out there , keeping the trend of terrible agency websites alive .
Exhibit A : Forsman & Bodenfors from Sweden .
A flash based site with non-sensical navigation and nerve - racking noises .
This " search - centric " ( which seems to be all the rage nowadays ) site hardly has any intelligible navigation and dares visitors to just continue clicking around until they find information relevant to them .
The details about the firm are buried in the colored tiles and are virtually indistinguishable from the links to work samples .
Should you somehow stumble into one of the interior pages , it does n't get much better .
There 's a flash scroll bar , which instantly locks onto your cursor , causing the page to bounce up and down until you realize what has happened .
The site flashes real - time statistics at the bottom , allowing for the visitor to get a sense of dynamism .
However , these stats paint a crystal clear picture of how impossible the site is to navigate ; the two most commonly searched terms are " clients " and " about . "
Visitors should n't have to labor to find out important information about your firm ... you 'd think an ad agency would understand that .
The Flash hinders the experience and optimization of the site , the navigation " structure " makes it nearly impossible to investigate the agency , and the overall experience is ruined through annoying noises and scrolling .
Exhibit B : North Carolina 's own McKinney .
Formerly , McKinney had a decent site ; it was n't super easy to navigate , but it was rather straightforward and allowed you easy access to their best work and firm details .
What made them change to the new site is lost on me .
Similar to F&B , McKinney 's site is a flash based , search - centric site .
They changed the model some by adding a 3 - D effect as you cruise through topics and questions .
However , this hinders the experience even further , as you 're typically " moving " too fast to click on your desired topic and there does n't seem to be an intuitive way to go backwards .
The amount of Flash on the site , causes it to move in a slow and choppy manner , even on good machines with quality Internet connections .
Once you get into interior pages , there is a Flash effect as you go from page to page , which also slows down the site and hinders the overall experience .
Once a visitor gets into the interior structure of the site , the navigation is not bad and it 's pretty intuitive to get around .
However , the constant Flash effects still make it cumbersome and annoying to navigate ; not exactly the words you want visitors to associate with your site .
It 's disappointing to see a firm that does such great work miss the mark by so far with their own site .
Overall , both firms show a pretty fundamental misunderstanding of the Web .
By burying information and loading up on Flash , both sites make it annoying for visitors to interact with the site and hard for search engines to index content .
Would you be caught investing your online marketing dollars with these firms ?
What are some other terrible agency sites out there that demonstrate big agencies still need to adjust to the timesand better understand the Internet ?

A junior Russian politician has admitted that a Russian government official might have played some part in the infamous cyberattacks against Estonia two years ago - sort of .
Comments by Sergei Markov , a State Duma deputy from the Putin's Unified Russia party , on a cybercrime panel may have been intended as a joke .
Nonetheless the remarks are likely to inflame tensions between Russia and its Baltic neighbour , heightened by subsequent internet attacks during the war between Georgia and Russia last year .
During a discussion on information warfare in the 21st century , moderated by US - based Russian journalist Nargiz Asadova , Markov unexpectedly went into a Boris Yeltsin - style rant , Radio Free Europe reports .
" About the cyberattack on Estonia ... do n't worry , that attack was carried out by my assistant .
I wo n't tell you his name , because then he might not be able to get visas , " he said .
Markov explained his assistant was in " one of the unrecognized republics " during the 2007 dispute with Estonia where he decided on his own initiative that " something bad had to be done to these fascists " before launching a cyberattack .
" Turns out it was purely a reaction from civil society and , incidentally , such things will happen more and more , " he added .
Civil unrest in Estonia over the relocation of Soviet - era WWII memorials in April 2007 was followed by sustained denial of service attacks against the Baltic nation ’s government , bank and media websites .
The attacks stemmed from botnet networks of compromised PCs .
Estonia makes heavy use of the internet so the attack caused a great deal of inconvenience , while acting as a wake - up about cyberwarfare .
Estonian ministers blamed Russian government for instigating the attacks , an accusation the Kremlin robustly denied at the time .
Only one person has ever been charged over the attack , a member of Estonia 's ethnic Russian minority .
Dmitri Galushkevich , of Tallinn , was fined 17,500 Estonian Krooni ( $ 1,641 ) after he was convicted of launching hacking attacks on the website of the Reform Party of Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip and government systems .
Despite Markov 's boast it seems likely that " patriotic hackers " , stirred up by Russia nationalist press , formed a cyber- militia that was the main participant of the attacks on Estonia .
The attacks were almost certainly carried out by a group rather than any one person , so Markov 's assertion ought to be taken with a pinch of vodka salt . ®
KINGLAKE , Australia ( CNN ) --
Police have arrested a man in connection with one of the myriad wildfires that have laid waste to parts of southeastern Australia and killed at least 181 people .
Porcelain dolls sit in front of a burnt house in the township of Phesant Creek , 100 km north of Melbourne .

Police say the man is suspected of lighting a fire on February 7 .
He was charged with arson causing death , intentionally or recklessly lighting a bush fire , and possessing child pornography , according to a statement by the Victoria state police .
The man , who was not named , is suspected of starting a blaze called the Churchill fire .
The development came as the blazes that have roared through the region for nearly a week were slowly coming under control .
The Country Fire Authority said the number of fires burning had dropped to 21 from about 35 on Thursday .
Watch a survivor tell his story »
While " the threat will remain for weeks to come , " a spokesman said no towns were under threat Friday morning and that good weather had allowed firefighters to build containment lines around the fires .
Meanwhile , more than 150 detectives were working on an arson investigation , authorities said .
Two men who were arrested for " suspicious behavior " on Thursday were released without charges .
" We are satisfied with their explanation and do n't expect to talk to them again , " Victoria state police inspector Peter Sheppard said .
Firefighters have battled blazes since Saturday -- including several new fires that broke out Tuesday night , which officials said almost certainly were the result of arson .

The official death toll from the fires has remained at 181 for the past two days .
But government officials say that number could reach as high as 300 based on the number of people missing and number of homes destroyed .

Sheppard said the tally is not being updated as frequently because it's become harder to verify fatalities from the fires -- which have destroyed more than 1,800 homes and displaced about 7,000 people .
" Initially it was a fairly straitforward process -- bodies were in cars , on sides of roads , " he said .
" Now , the search is through buildings .
Many have collapsed . "

He said that in the town of Marysville , which was hard - hit by the wildfires , bodies are believed to be in a hotel but firefighters cannot get access to it .

Switzerland , the world 's largest offshore financial centre , has agreed to accept concessions on bank secrecy .
However , while it will now abide by international rules on bank data sharing , it said it would only respond to " concrete and justified " requests .
The government added that it would still protect banking customers from " unjustified watching from abroad " .
Switzerland 's announcement comes after it had risked being added to a global blacklist of uncooperative tax havens .
It is estimated that Switzerland 's banks hold $ 2 trillion ( £ 1.4tn ) of global wealth held abroad .
OECD talks
The Swiss government has finally bowed to intense pressure from Washington and Brussels
BBC Geneva correspondent Imogen Foulkes Clock ticking for Swiss secrecy
It reached its agreement overnight with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) , which sets rules on the sharing of bank data to try and crack down on offshore tax evasion .
This is the first time it has agreed to sign up to the OECD rules , having previously stated that the rules would compromise its long - standing banking secrecy principles .
Andorra , Liechtenstein , Austria and Luxembourg have also just agreed to sign up to the OECD rules .
All had come under increasing pressure to reform their banking sectors .
Andorra and Liechtenstein , along with Monaco , are currently on the OECD blacklist of " uncooperative tax havens " .
Key global meeting
The agreements were announced ahead of a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the G20 group of industrialised nations , which is being held near London .
TAX EVASION v TAX FRAUD Switzerland is unusual is distinguishing between tax evasion and tax fraud Tax evasion is the deliberate concealing of assets
Tax fraud , in addition , involves lying on official documents
Both are criminal offences in most countries , but tax evasion is only a civil matter in Switzerland
The meeting is expected to focus on the need for tougher regulation of banks , and discuss increasing funding to tackle the crisis .
UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the changes were " the beginning of the end of tax havens " .
" Tax evasion , which costs the global economy billions of pounds each year , will become more difficult in future . "
The Swiss government said in a statement that any exchange of banking information with other countries would be done on a " case by case " basis .
Switzerland was " maintaining banking secrecy and resolutely refused all automatic transmission of information " , it said .
" The private sphere of clients is still protected from unjustified watching from abroad , " it added .
Tax evasion change
The Swiss government confirmed that in line with OECD rules , it would now respond to overseas requests for information in cases of suspected tax evasion , and not just tax fraud .
WHAT IS A TAX HAVEN ?
Low or no taxation Lack of transparency Refusal to provide information to foreign tax authorities Andorra , Liechtenstein , and Monaco classed as " uncooperative tax havens " Source : OECD
The main difference between tax evasion and tax fraud is that the former is the deliberate concealing of assets , while the later also involves lying on official documentation .
Unlike most countries , tax evasion is a civil offence in Switzerland .
Only tax fraud is a criminal matter .
Imogen Foulkes , the BBC's Geneva correspondent , said " the Swiss government has finally bowed to intense pressure from Washington and Brussels " .
" The decision is all about damage limitation - Swiss banks may well lose yet more wealthy international clients , but the government hopes its new willingness to cooperate in cases of tax evasion will lift the threat of the black list , " she said .
" It 's a small but very important change in Swiss banking regulations - and a little piece of Swiss tradition is now history . "
UBS row The Swiss government 's acceptance of OECD rules comes as UBS , the country 's largest bank , is in dispute with US authorities .
US officials are continuing to demand that UBS hands over the details of 52,000 American account holders it suspects of tax fraud .
While UBS has given the US details of 300 American account holders , it has so far rejected a request to hand over details of all 52,000 .
The Swiss government said on Friday that it was in the process of drafting a legal statement to clarify its position regarding a civil case brought by US authorities against UBS .
Switzerland said it would be drafting an " amicus curiae " or third - party statement to put forward its position in the matter .
It said it wished to give " added emphasis to Switzerland 's sovereign interests " .
It is estimated that the US government loses $ 100bn in revenues every year because of tax havens .

Prime Minister ( PM ) Sheikh Hasina yesterday said her government is going to introduce general rationing system so that all sections of people can cope with the prices of essentials like rice , pulses , oils and baby foods .
She disclosed the plan while addressing the members of Bangladesh Ansar and the Village Defence Party ( VDP ) at the Ansar - VDP Academy in Shafipur .
The prime minister also announced a package programme enhancing allowance for the Ansar members and assigning them to new roles in rural development and peacekeeping .
Announcing a number of facilities and benefits for the country 's 4.9 million Ansar and VDP members , the prime minister said daily allowance of the attached Ansar members will be fixed at minimum Tk 180 .
The prime minister also directed the authorities concerned to take steps to implement this decision “ immediately ” .
Elaborating the new universal rationing system , she said , “ We are considering providing ration for all .
Whatever the wage of a person , he will be entitled to purchase rice , pulses , oils and baby milk under the general rationing system . ”
She said all beneficiaries will have to follow a ' limit ' in getting the services under the government rationing system .
As she wanted to know about problems of Ansar and VDP , some senior officers demanded of the premier to give them “ self - commanding power ” , include them in the UN peacekeeping mission and give them authority of investigation like the police department for “ ensuring justice ” in the rural areas .
In reply , Hasina said the government is considering setting up a separate structure for investigation within the police department .
Ansar can be made a part of that separate investigation structure , she added .
She directed the home ministry to think what can be done to accommodate Ansar and VDP in the envisaged separate investigation mechanism .
About the demand regarding UN mission , she said though the choice of forces for sending in the peacekeeping missions totally depends on the UN authorities , she herself would look into the matter and try to take steps .
Hasina stressed the need for identifying fields of demands for human resources on the international market and sending abroad well - trained workforce .
She suggested the Ansar and VDP authorities to set up a Nursing Training Institute in the Ansar - VDP Academy Hospital as such initiative will help create employment opportunities for the Ansar - VDP women members .
The country could earn huge foreign currency by sending skill nurses to different countries as house - keeping jobs are now widely acclaimed and standard jobs abroad , she said .
The PM also inaugurated the newly installed operation theatre of Bangladesh Ansar Academy Hospital .
Sheikh Hasina noted that a new dimension in security paradigm has emerged in the present - day world and said Bangladesh would have to attain competence in military sector to fit in the new order .
Also , she said , the nation needs to be built as a well - organised one imbued with a strong spirit of patriotism .
She told the function that the government will reform and modernise the Ansar and VDP by providing professional training and infrastructural development , including removing vehicle problems and increasing budgetary allocation for the development of human resources .
Hasina said she has a personal thinking about creating a trained , conscious and patriotic citizenry in every village through the nation - building activity of the Ansar - VDP force .
“ From now , you ( Ansar , VDP ) will play the key role in implementing all development and service programmes in the villages as government representatives , ” she said .
She urged the Ansar commanders , VDP 's union and village team leaders to create anti-terrorism public opinion to establish the rule of law .
She asked them to help bring the “ derailed ” youths into the path of light .
“ You will be the pathfinders for the rural people who will attain qualities of a good citizen , establish the qualities in own families and spread these to other families of the village , ” she said .
By doing this , Ansar and VDP will create thousands of laborious , honest and sacrificing citizens across the country , she said , redefining their roles .
She urged the officers to take various innovative programmes to implement government 's aim of building a modern digital Bangladesh by the year 2021 .
Earlier , the prime minister addressed the 29th National Rally of Bangladesh Ansar and VDP at the parade ground of the Shafipur Ansar Academy .
On her arrival at the academy , Home Minister Advocate Sahara Khatun received the prime minister who inspected the parade of a smart contingent of Ansar and VDP members and took salute riding on an open car .
The prime minister was given a crest by the Ansar and VDP and she also gave the department a crest .
She distributed President Ansar and VDP medals to three members for their heroic role against various crimes .
The three members are Abdur Rahim and Abdus Sabur ( President Ansar Medal ) and Abdul Aziz ( President VDP Medal ) .
Sheikh Hasina said she wants the Ansar and VDP play a leading role in stopping repression on women , removing gender discrimination and ensuring children 's welfare .
Hasina said her government will make all - out effort to ensure economic growth of the country with the work of all irrespective of party and opinion .
She also watched colorful display and cultural programmes depicting the country 's glorious history and culture by the members of the Ansar , VDP and their children .

Amin , local parliament members and senior army , navy , air force officials , diplomats were also present .
TEHRAN -- Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki says that Iran is more inclined toward chess than American football .
“ We have no interest in American football .
Rather , we are interested in a fair chess match , which requires fortitude and patience because in chess an unnecessary or illogical move will lead to defeat , ” he told the Serbian daily Politika in an interview published on Sunday .
Mottaki made the remarks during his recent visit to Serbia .
He added , “ Since the Islamic Revolution , the United States has taken many measures against us .
Leading the eight - year Iran - Iraq war , organizing the sanctions ( against Iran ) , and allocating funds ( for measures ) against the Islamic Republic of Iran are only a small part of those efforts .
” Mottaki pointed out that no benefits will accrue to the U.S. if it continues its previous policies .
“ We have repeatedly announced that we are ready to help implement the change policy in the Middle East because we believe that this approach is to the benefit of the entire region and our national interests , ” he observed .
Commenting on U.S. President Barack Obama ’s change motto , the Iranian foreign minister said , “ We are closely pursuing all the current developments in Washington ’s policies .
However , we have seen no revolution as a result of Barack Obama ’s change motto . ” Mottaki also stated that the prospects for the establishment of relations between Iran and the U.S. will not be bright until the U.S. changes its approach
State Department To Blackwater : You 're Fired , Leave Iraq by May $ 1.2 billion contract not renewed following Iraqi refusal to license U.S. firm .
January 30 , 2009  -- Blackwater has been fired by the State Department from its job protecting U.S. diplomats in Iraq .
Executives of the controversial U.S. security company were notified today by the State Department that its five - year , $ 1.2 billion contract for services in Iraq will not be renewed in May , U.S. officials tell ABC News .
The contract provides yearly options for cancellations .
In a statement , company spokesperson Anne Tyrrell said , " The company has always said that the security services we provide in Iraq would be temporary . "
The move by the State Department follows the refusal of Iraqi officials to license Blackwater to operate in the country .
Officials cited " lingering outrage " over the Sept. 2007 shooting by Blackwater guards that left 17 civilians dead .
Five former Blackwater guards have pleaded not guilty to federal charges that include 14 counts of manslaughter and 20 counts of attempted manslaughter .
No charges were brought against the corporation .
The new U.S. - Iraq security agreement gives Iraq the authority to regulate private security companies operating in the country .
Blackwater president Gary Jackson told the Associated Press the company could pull its 1,000 security contractors and two dozen aircraft out of the country within 72 hours , if ordered to leave .
" We are honored to have provided this service for five years and proud of our success — while under out protection , no U.S. government official has been even seriously injured , " Blackwater 's spokesperson told ABCNews.com .
One of the company 's constant critics , Rep. Jan Schakowsky ( D - IL ) said in a statement Friday : " We finally have a State Department that will no longer ignore the gross misconduct of contracting companies , like Blackwater .
The State Department 's decision not to renew Blackwater 's contract in Iraq shows a dramatic departure from the previous administration .
Instead of overriding the Iraqi government 's decision to deny Blackwater a license to operate , the Obama Administration respected the sovereignty of the Iraqi government and did not renew Blackwater 's contract . "

Danny Boyle takes the Slumdog children out ... as film bosses pledge to buy poverty - stricken families new homes
Slumdog Millionaire director Danny Boyle has taken time out of his busy post - Oscar schedule to spend some quality time with the young stars of his hit film .
A paternal looking Boyle accompanied youngsters Rubina Ali and Azhruddin Mohammed to Santa Monica Pier for a seaside day out of fun and games .
Rubina
Ali clutched a handful of toys as she walked alongside a female chaperone .
And Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail was seen walking on the California beach .
Father Danny : A paternal looking Danny Boyle , director of hit film Slumdog Millionaire , enjoyed a day out at Santa Monica Pier with his young stars
Their trip comes the day after a fairytale visit to Disney World .
And after it was revealed that the poverty stricken child stars of are now set to be property tycoons .
The youngsters have now been promised new homes by the film ’s Oscar winning director Danny Boyle .
Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail feels the sand underneath his feet in Santa Monica
Boyle and producer Christian Colson told the Daily Mail that Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail and Rubina Ali and their families will be moved to apartments worth £ 20,000 each in the coming months .
And in an astonishing turn of events , officials from the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority - a Mumbai housing association - have now also said they want to gift the children a new flat each .
There was a public outcry after pictures emerged of the child stars still living in squalor , despite the fact the film had grossed £ 70 million worldwide .
One showed ten year - old Azharuddin sleeping on a rotting makeshift mat - a bed he shared with his parents - while another featured him crouched down by rubbish , washing in dirty water .
The shack that Rubina , who plays the young heroine Letika , calls home is just yards from an open sewer .
Colson and Boyle told the Daily Mail the children and their families are looking at new apartments on the edge of the area where they live .
Boyle told the Daily Mail : ‘ These are bricks and mortar flats .
They will have electricity , running water and good sanitation .
' They will still be close to their friends and extended family .
' Their community is very important to them , and they do n’t want to move too far away from them .
Boyle is now in the process of buying the families of his two young stars who live in slum dwellings new homes of their own
‘ They have looked at a number of places but like anyone choosing a home , it is taking some time for them to agree on a final one . ’
The film company has also agreed to pay for a rickshaw driver to take the children to and from school every day for the next eight years – to ensure they attend .
Last night , the MHADA said it too felt the child stars should be rewarded with a proper place to live .
The organisation ’s chairman , Amarjeet Singh Manhas , said : ' These children have made the country proud and have an equal hand in the film winning the Oscar .
These children are special and have won laurels for the country and we want to felicitate them . '
There was a public outcry after pictures emerged of the child stars still living in squalor , despite the £ 70 million success of the film
They were unable to give details on the size and location of the flats and critics accused the authority of offering the free flats as a political move ahead of the general election in April / May .
Colson said that the offer from Mumbai officials was a separate one to the proposals he and Boyle had drawn up .
Rubina ’s father Rafiq Qureshi said : ‘ It means so much for us to get a proper flat .
For three generations we have been living in this slum and we might finally get out of here .
It is not a proper place to live and it is always under threat from demolition . ’
Colson and Boyle have always denied any claim the children were exploited by Slumdog Millionaire .
After filming completed last year , they set up a raft of measures to safeguard their long - term future including a trust fund and sending them to a local school .
They now admit that the plans have not worked in the way they had hoped and more needs to be done to help the youngsters , who many feel are the real stars of Oscar - winning film .
Azharuddin , who plays the young version of the lead character ’s brother Salim , and his parents live in flimsy structure made of tarpaulins and blankets in the overcrowded Behrampada shanty area .
Living it up :
After their big night at the Oscars the young stars of Slumdog Millionaire met Mickey Mouse in Disneyland ( Rubina and Azharuddin are front )
The family is worse off now than when Slumdog Millionaire was being filmed because the illegal hut they were living in has been demolished by the local council .
Colson told the Daily Mail : ‘ The way Azharuddin is living now is substandard .
We were told his home was razed a few months ago , and wired money over immediately .
‘ The family gave that money to a broker , who promised to find them a new place to live , but has simply disappeared with the cash . ’
‘ We realized just sending money is not the answer and have evolved our plans over the past few weeks .
The families are not equipped to cope with that sort of money . ’
Producers will instead put the properties in a trust and ownership will only be released to the parents when the children turn 18 .
‘ We ca n’t buy the properties outright and give them to them , because in all honesty they will sell them , ’ he said .
‘ What we are doing is to acquire the flats for them , near the community where they fit in .
‘ They will be held in trusts and ownership will only be released to the parents when the kids turn 18 and have completed their education , ’ said Colson .
Azharuddin and Rubina pose with Slumdog director Danny Boyle at the Oscars
The children ’s parents had complained the children had not been paid enough considering the success of the Slumdog Millionaire .
Azharuddin ’s mother Shameem Ismail is blind in one eye , while his father Mohammed suffers from tuberculosis , leaving the family a limited income .
Rubina ’s father has not worked for months after breaking his leg in an accident .
Producers said they would work with an NGO to find a suitable social worker to liaise with the families to ensure the children ’s wellbeing over the next few years .
Boyle said :
‘ It is not about throwing cash at the problem – that does n’t work .
It is about investing in the long term .
The key thing is to make sure they stay in school .
‘ We want the kids to have more than wealth , we want them to have the skills that will set them up for life . ’
Azharuddin's family are now worse off than they were when Slumdog was filmed following the demolition of their shack
Azharuddin and Rubina attend Aseema , a non-profit English language school for underprivileged children .
It is oversubscribed but many who attend need substantial help and guidance for even the most basic life skills .
Boyle added that he and the film ’s investors and distributors were also setting up a fund for the slum and street children of Mumbai .
So far £ 500,000 has been set aside as an initial figure but this is expected to rise .
● Slumdog Millionaire follows the story of a boy born in the slums who answers all the questions on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire ?
correctly because of his life experiences .
It has become the unexpected hit of the year and scooped 8 Oscars including Best Motion Picture and a Best Director Oscar for Boyle .
Note : I 'm not going to bury the lede :
If you have $ 5 and want a non-DRM PDF copy of Sunken Treasure , you can buy it here and have it in just a few minutes .
Now , here 's the story behind my decision to offer this format ...
I took some time on Saturday afternoon to answer a bunch of e-mail , including a brief interview about my experience with Lulu and the release of Sunken Treasure ( short version : it 's been awesome .
Longer version coming later this week . )
While I did this , I had Twitteriffic open , and was doing my silly Twitter thing , which , as many of you know , was the style at the time .
At 1:38 pm , I sent the following message to Twitter : " Hey Twitterverse : how would you feel about a digital version of Sunken Treasure for about $ 5 ? "
I expected that a dozen or so people would be interested , but I hoped for more .
Within ten minutes , over 100 different people said they were not only interested , but wanted it RIGHT NOW PLZ KTHX .
" Wow , " I thought .
" That was a more positive and emphatic response than I was expecting ! "
I told Twitter : " Wow , so it appears that quite a lot of you want PDF versions of this book for $ 5 .
I did n't think it would be so many , honestly .
Hmmm ... "
Responses continued to pour in .
I started making hash marks on a note pad .
A lot of people were asking about Kindle versions , Sony eReader versions , and other versions .
I made a lot more hash marks on my note pad , and noticed that the page was almost filled .
I looked around the Lulu publishing options and told Twitter : " Many questions about other formats for digital versions of my books .
Short answer : all I can do at the moment on my own is PDF .
Still want ? "
Short answer : Yes .
A whole lot of people wanted it , even if it was in a PDF format .
I 've always wanted to do digital versions of my books , but I 've never had a way to do it that does n't involve me manually accepting payments and sending out links or something equally complicated .
My POD experience with Lulu has completely changed that .
I logged into my Lulu account , clicked a couple of buttons , filled in one box with $ 5.00 , and I was done .
I took a deep breath and told Twitter : " Okay , Twitterverse !
You asked for it , so here it is .
Sunken Treasure in DRM - free PDF for $ 5 : http://tinyurl.com/sunkenpdf "
I admit that I had a brief flash of doubt .
" Did I just screw myself ?
Did I just sell one and end up giving away a hundred ? "
" No , " I reminded myself .
" People who will steal from me were never going to support my work , anyway .
You 're doing the right thing .
You 're making it available to people at a really fair price , in a super portable format .
And maybe people will like it and want a paper copy for themselves or to give as gifts . "
I hoped that PDF sales would be solid ... well , they were solid , for about ten minutes , and then they exploded .
In less than an hour , the total PDFs sold exceed 1/5 of the total print copies sold .
People were e-mailing positive feedback , people were Twittering positive feedback , and people were starting to talk about it on their blogs .
" Okay , this is awesome , " I thought .
" I definitely did the right thing . "
Over the next 24 hours , I checked sales every hour or so ( hey , can you blame me ? ) and I watched total PDF sales close the gap with print sales , but something really awesome was also happening : the print sales , which had slowed to about 2 a day a month after release , suddenly picked up !
It was n't a ton , and I 'm still not getting rich off of this effort , but it was still pretty remarkable .
Feedback from buyers suggested that a lot of people read the PDF , liked it , and wanted a physical copy of their own as a result .
Any doubts I had about the demand for this format , or the wisdom of trusting my instincts and releasing a DRM - free PDF at a reasonable price point vanished .
I started thinking about other work of mine , and how cool it would be to offer digital versions in a similar manner .
I noticed that , coincidentally , Just A Geek had become available on O'Reilly 's Safari Bookshelf .
I also noticed that Just A Geek and Dancing Barefoot 's sales rankings on Amazon had climbed by several thousand points in just a day .
Also a coincidence ?
I 'm not sure , but I 'd like to believe it was n't .
I just checked , and as of 10:00 this morning , not quite 48 hours after I announced it , PDF sales of Sunken Treasure have nearly caught 4 weeks of print sales ( PDF is 17 sales short of overtaking print sales , so if you get it now , you could be part of , um , history ! )
Print sales in the last 48 hours have been better than print sales in the last 5 days .
I 'm not getting rich off of this , but it 's certainly answered any questions I had about publishing this way .
The best part of all of this ( well , other than the surprisingly enthusiastic response ) is how easy it was for me to do it .
Because I already had the PDF uploaded for printing , making the PDF itself available was simply a matter of making a choice and investing about 40 seconds of effort to throw the switch .
Let me close by answering a few FAQs ( which I 'm going to update throughout the day , so check back if I do n't answer you in comments ) :
Q : I have all your other stuff already because I 'm awesome like that .
Is there enough new stuff in this to justify the purchase ?
A : Dude , thank you for supporting my work !
That is totally awesome , and so are you .
Now , someone who is not me is probably more qualified to answer this , but here 's what I think : there are some small excerpts from Just a Geek and Dancing Barefoot , but that only makes up a tiny portion of the book .
It 's mostly outtakes from Happiest Days ( that may or may not make it into the Subterranean Press edition ) , various things that I 've written in my blog , and an unreleased sketch that I wrote for a show at ACME .
I also reformatted and rewrote my Criminal Minds production diary .
If I paid five bucks for this , and I 'd already read Just a Geek and Dancing Barefoot , I do n't think I 'd be unhappy about it , but I 'm not as objective as I 'd like to be .
Hopefully , someone will address this in comments , and I can link to it .
Q : I see there 's a World and a US edition .
What 's the difference ?
A : The World edition is a slightly larger format , due to legacy printing issues .
There is no difference in content .
Q : So why did you make two different digital editions available ?
A : So people who use direct links instead of visiting the storefront would see that there 's a $ 5 PDF available .
Q : Oh , that 's nice of you .
A : That was n't a question , but thanks .
Q : Can I even read it on my iPhone ?
A : Yeah , it 's a regular old PDF file , so it will totally work on your iPhone .
Q: How will it look on my iPhone , though ?
A : I do n't own an iPhone , so I can't say from firsthand experience , but I 've heard from a lot of people who have read it on their iPhones , and they were very happy with the experience .
Q : What about other formats ?
A : I 'm looking into it .
I know lots of people want it for [ DEVICE THEY OWN ] and I 'm working on making those formats available .
I can't tell for sure if Lulu makes it possible for me to sell a digital version in a non-PDF format , though , so that may be a non-starter .
Q : Why not just sell it through Amazon for the Kindle ?
A : I may eventually do that , but right now I do n't know if I can sell enough copies to make up for the massive cut of revenue I 'd have to give Amazon .
I 'm happy as hell to be selling in the hundreds , but if I went that way , I 'd have to either increase the price significantly , or hope to sell in the thousands .
I 'm not sure that there are thousands of people who a ) want to read this and b ) also own Kindles .
Q : If I buy this , can I convert it to a different format ?
A : Sure .
You can use calibre to convert it to a ton of different formats .
Calibre is free ( speech and beer ) by the way .
Incidentally , if you 're one of the Kindle owners , you can use calibre to convert the PDF to a Kindle format .
I 've seen screenshots from some people who have done that , and it looks cool .
Q : I already bought the print version .
Can I get a copy of the digital version ?
A : Sure you can .
It 's just five bucks .
Q : I see what you did there .
A : Again , not a question , but thanks .
Q : Can I give this to my friend / husband / wife / mom / girl or boy I 'm trying to impress ?
A : Once you have it , I can't stop you from doing whatever you want with it , and I certainly would n't expect you to treat it any differently than you would a paper book .
However , I hope that we all understand the difference between sharing with our friends / spouses / famies and " sharing " with an entire forum , or hundreds of people simultaneously .
I 'm not trying to be a dick about this , and I 'd rather people read it than not , but it 's only $ 5 , you know ?
Q : If I buy this , can I make my own print copy ?
A : As long as you do n't sell it , absolutely .
If a print shop does n't want to print it for you , show them this : I give you permission to make a print copy of this book for personal , non-commercial use .
Q : If I make my own print copy and bring it to a con , will you sign it for me ?
A : Hells yes I will .
That 'd be pretty cool , actually .
Q : So , this is awesome and I want it now , but I 'm not interested in scrolling back to the top of this entry .
How do I get it again ?
A : I 'm so glad you asked .
If you have $ 5 and want a non-DRM PDF copy of Sunken Treasure , you can buy it here and have it in just a few minutes .

New CBS News VP tied to Jack Abramoff scheme Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday February 25 , 2009
Print This Email This
When it was announced last week that CBS News had hired Jeff Ballabon as a senior vice president for communications , with responsibility for " all media relations and public affairs , " there were scattered complaints about Ballabon 's extreme conservatism and apparent bias against Democrats .
One blogger at Huffington Post , Ira Forman , recalled that when he debated Ballabon a decade ago , " Ballabon claimed that , after his most recent job in Washington , he became convinced that Democrats are inherently bad people and Republicans are fundamentally good people . "
However , what has not been widely noted is that Ballabon formerly had a close relationship with lobbyist and convicted felon Jack Abramoff , first as a client and then seemingly as a friend .
Ballabon was an executive vice president with Channel One in 1998 when it came under fire from Senator Richard Shelby ( R - AL ) .
Channel
One had developed a comfortable niche providing free educational programming to public schools in exchange for running commercials during the programs , many of them for soda , candy , and other junk food .
Responding to complaints from conservative constituents , Shelby expressed concern and called for Congressional hearings .
Channel
One quickly hired the lobbying firm of Preston , Gates to head off this threat to its profits , ultimately paying them over a million dollars .
Preston , Gates assigned the still - obscure lobbyist Jack Abramoff to the account .
Emails released by the Senate Finance Committee show that Abramoff was hard at work by January 1999 .
Over the next several months , he would recruit all his most reliable allies to speak on Channel One 's behalf : Grover Norquist 's Americans for Tax Reform , Citizens Against Government Waste , the Traditional Values Coalition , Rabbi Daniel Lapin 's Toward Tradition .
and two groups which had sponsored Abramoff 's overseas junkets -- the National Security Council Foundation and the National Center for Public Policy Research ( NCPPR ) .
As described by Raw Story in a series of articles in 2006 , all these groups were accustomed to provide articles or testimony favorable to Abramoff 's clients -- such as the Marianas Islands or Stoli Vodka -- without revealing their relationship to the lobbyist .
John Byrne and Ron Brynaert wrote specifically of the support expressed for Channel One in May 1999 by NCPPR 's Amy Ridenour :
" Ridenour defended Channel Ones use of commercials after Ralph Naders Commercial Alert urged Congress to investigate the practice .
Ridenour said Naders charge was spurious .
' Commercial Alert turns benefits of Channel One on its head , ' she wrote in an editorial .
' Instead of seeing the free 10 - minute current events program and 250 hours of educational programming and tens of thousands of dollars worth of equipment and servicing as a benefit received by the schools in exchange for one to two minutes of commercials , Commercial Alert sees the schools as exploited and those who benefit from Channel One 's services as " forced " to watch ads . ' "
Ballabon was fully aware of these subsidized efforts on Channel One 's behalf .
On May 19 , Abramoff emailed him , " When we are through the hearing , we have to discuss getting Amy a contribution as we discussed .
She was going to do 5 pieces for $ 10 K .
We can chat on this next week . "
Ballabon responded , " yup - - i have not forgotten ( was it $ 10 ? -- I wrote it down -- whatever it was , she 'll get it . ) "
However , the most interesting of the emails relating to Ballabon may be one which has been largely overlooked , perhaps because it is not part of the Senate Finance Committee file but was released separately , by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform .
Ralph Reed , who had been friends with Abramoff since their College Republican days in the early 80's , also participated in the Channel One lobbying effort .
On February 3 , 1999 , just as the campaign was getting underway , he sent Abramoff an email with the subject heading , " Karl Rove . "
" Did you and Karl chat ? "
Reed asked .
" I am planning to get Ballabon down to meet with the Governor in the next month or two and I 'd like to do the same with you . "
It would be interesting to know whether Ballabon actually did meet in Texas with then - Governor George W. Bush , and if so what was said about Channel One 's lobbying campaign , but no emails appear to have been released which could shed light on this matter .
However , it does appear that Abramoff and Ballabon remained close , because in December 2001 , Abramoff tried to get an invitation for Ballabon to a White House Chanukah party .
In a December 5 , 2001 email released by the Government Reform Committee , he asked the favor of his former aide , Susan Ralson , who by then was working for Rove in the White House .
" I understand that they are doing a ceremony for Chanukah on Monday night , " Abramoff wrote .
" I was wondering if you could possibly arrange for xxxx , the kids and me in to that ?
The last time we were able to go to that was during Bush 41 .
Jeff Ballabon also wants to come ( solo ) if that is not too much to ask . "

CANTERBURY , England , Feb. 23 ( UPI ) --
A pair of police officers in Canterbury , England , said they were on their early morning patrol when they came across a giant white rabbit .
Officers Matt Jackson and Yasmin Mossadegh said they spotted the dog - sized bunny at about 2:20 a.m. Sunday and immediately attempted a capture , The Sun reported Monday .

" After several failed attempts trying to grab the rabbit , we removed our coats to try and cover it with a bullfighting technique .
Again this failed , " Jackson said .
" Pet - loving members of the public who were passing by saw us struggling and rushed to our assistance .
Now , with 10 pairs of hands at the ready , the rabbit 's time on the run was coming to an end . "
The officers said they took the rabbit , which they nicknamed Tiny , to a local animal hospital .
They said they do not know where the animal came from .
The March Madness Search For Cinderella
Total Pro Sports –
As a society we love underdogs .
We love it when odds are overcome .
We love it when David slays Goliath .
We love it when David Tyree uses his head to catch an Eli Manning pass to propel his New York Giants to a Super Bowl .
We love it when teams like the Tampa Bay Rays , perennial doormats , make World Series runs .
We love it when a skinny kid name Stephen Curry takes his school with only 1,700 undergraduates to make an improbable tournament run .
This is why we love March Madness .
We love it for the Bucknells , George Masons , and Princetons of the world .
Sure we love seeing top dogs face off .
But not like seeing Bryce Drew ’s shot to carry Valparaiso over Mississippi .
We do love upsets , but most of all we love getting them right .
Showing your friends that you had that 13 over a 4 , or that 11 seed into the Elite 8 .
The search for Cinderella can be agonizing so here to help is an overview of those who could wear the glass slipper , from the 16 seeds to the 11 seeds .
Those armed with the smallest of pebbles , and those with multiple stones to chuck at Goliath .
16 seeds ( Morehead State , Chattanooga , East Tennessee State , Radford )
I know it has never happened .
But it could happen …. right ?
It would probably take a team that was under seeded to take down the most Goliath of Goliaths .
The best shot this year ?
East Tennessee State .
They have outscored their opponents by nearly 9 points a game and have three guys that can score .
I am not recommending you pencil any of these teams in but if you have some infallible compulsion to do so take the Bucs .
Best Shot : None this year .
One day …….
15 Seeds ( Morgan State , Cal State Northridge , Binghamton , Robert Morris )
A 15 seed has only beat a 2 seed 4 times .
Most recently 8 years ago when Hampton took down Iowa State , 58 - 57 .
This year the best bet is either Morgan State vs Oklahoma or Binghamton against Duke .
Both come in winning 11 of their last 12 games .
Binghamton would need Duke to be cold from the field and Morgan State would need Blake Griffin to play like Peter Griffin , but at least they have some history on their side .
Best Shot : None .
14 Seeds ( North Dakota State , Cornell , Stephen F. Austin , American )
The number of upsets more than triples in the match up of 14s vs 3s .
The 14 over 3 upset has happened 15 times , most recently with Northwestern State over Iowa in 2006 and Bucknell over Kansas .
So how about this year ?
Cornell – No Ivy league team has won in 10 years , sorry .
Stephen F. Austin –
Its impressive that one guy could make it this far but Syracuse looks too good for Mr. Austin .
American –
They could make some noise but it does n’t help that their foe , Villanova , is playing basically a home game in Philadelphia .
They start all seniors and could keep it close with ‘ Nova .
Best Shot : North Dakota State–
Sure it is their first year ever in Division I .
Sure they are facing the defending champs .
The Bison do n’t care .
They start 4 seniors and are lights outs from beyond the arc .
Ben Woodside is their go to guy and is capable of carrying the Bison past a Kansas squad that has a history of losing to 14 seeds .
13 Seeds ( Akron , Mississippi State , Cleveland State , Portland State )
There have been 20 upsets of these match ups , including two last year .
With the mediocrity this year of the power conferences I would n’t be surprised if that happens again .
Akron is the longest shot of the group with no notable wins , but the other three pack some punch .
Mississippi State –
They came out of nowhere to take the SEC Tournament .
Uber shot blocker Jarvis Varnado leads the Bulldogs , who have beat Tennessee and LSU .
They take on a talented but inexperienced Washington team and plan to continue streaking from their conference tourney .
Portland State – Remember when the shocked Gonzaga earlier in the season ?
They could do it again against Xaiver , a team that has struggled of late .
Best Shot : Cleveland State–
The Vikings have wins at Syracuse and Butler and face a young Wake Forest team that could get rattled .
Coming off a horizon tournament championship Cleveland State takes on a Demon Deacon team that lost to Maryland in the first round .
Cleveland State ’s depth and solid point guard play by Cedric Jackson could take them into the 2nd round .
12 seeds ( Northern Iowa , Arizona , Wisconsin , Western Kentucky )
To clarify Arizona is n’t an upset .
The last team in is actually a one point favorite against their 5 seed opponent Utah .
So they ca n’t play the part as David .
Wisconsin –
It feels awkward having them be the underdog .
Bo Ryan ’s team could try to bog a game down and win with defense , but Florida State and Toney Douglas might be too much for the Badgers .
Northern Iowa – Northern Iowa is on a 5 game winning streak coming into the tournament but they are facing a Purdue team that is finally living up to expectations .
No dice here .
Best Shot : Western Kentucky - The Hilltoppers , winners of 10 of their last 11 , surge into the tournament and face a wounded Illinois team .
The Illini are without one half of their back court in Chester Frazier .
WKU is balanced with 4 starters in double figures , not to mention they have been tested in the tourney before .
11 seeds ( Virginia Commonwealth , Utah State , Temple , Dayton )
The last seed that can pull of a true upset are the 11 seeds .
This years crop could do some damage .
Dayton –
They have been up and down all year .
The Flyers have wins against Marquette and Xavier on their resume , but they are facing a strong West Virginia team .
I am not on this bandwagon .
Virginia Commonwealth – I am on the VCU bandwagon .
Eric Maynor and crew are back in the tournament and ready to take down some giants ( beat Duke 2 years ago ) .
UCLA is an average team and while they are offensively efficient VCU will be a tough out .
Temple – If the Owls beat Arizona State it will be because of Dionte Christmas .
The senior guard is averaging nearly 20 points a game and could take down a mediocre Sun Devils team .
Best Shot : Utah State – The Aggies won 30 games in the regular season and are wanting more .
Somewhat slighted with an 11 seed Utah State is facing a Marquette team that is reeling after the loss of Dominic James .
Utah State is fundamentally sound and will be a tough out for anybody .
Davids will slay Goliaths , undoubtedly a Cinderella will make a run and Gus Johnson will freak out .
These are the things that make March Madness great .

It seems that not only the German tuners prefer the new BMW M3 ; the Japanese from IdingPower is offering a tuning package for the German coupe .
From an aesthetic creation Japan shine on the outside in particular by giant aileron .
Also , exterior modifications include an extension to spoiler and front wheels on 19 inch BBS .
Of course , those who want more than that can opt for a high performance braking system , a new suspension and exhaust system .

In recounting the twists and turns of his career , Falk critiques N.B.A. owners , other agents , former clients and even his mentor , Donald Dell , who gave Falk his start at ProServ in 1974 .
Nothing is as striking , however , as his bleak assessment of the N.B.A. ’s economic system .
Falk ’s view matters more than most .
Throughout the 1980s and ’90s , he was the N.B.A. ’s top power broker , as the adviser to Jordan , Ewing , Alonzo Mourning , Dikembe Mutombo and a host of other stars .
He sold his agency , FAME , for $ 100 million in 1998 , but he reopened it in 2007 as a boutique agency .
Falk despairs over the current state of the agent industry , saying “ there ’s rampant cheating going on ” and “ the quality of the representation is low . ”
He blames the union , which certifies agents but provides almost no oversight .
A union spokesman declined to comment .
While Falk is no longer the most active agent , he remains highly influential .
He is still close to Jordan  now a minority owner of the Charlotte Bobcats  and represents a handful of stars , including Mutombo , Elton Brand and Mike Bibby .
( His client list also includes Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski and the former Georgetown coach John Thompson . )
Sometimes a foe of Stern , Falk is also an unabashed admirer , calling him “ the greatest commissioner in the history of professional sports . ”
Falk does not seem nearly as impressed with Billy Hunter , the executive director of the National Basketball Players Association .
The two have had a tense relationship .
Falk foresees a rout in the next round of negotiations .
In a joint appearance during All - Star weekend , Stern and Hunter acknowledged the dire state of the economy and its effect on the N.B.A .
Stern said publicly for the first time that the salary cap  which is tied to league revenue  would probably decline next season .
Privately , league officials are bracing for a major decline in the cap in the 2010 - 11 season .
Stern and Hunter said they had begun preliminary talks for a new labor deal .
Their conciliatory tone sounded promising , but Falk seemed skeptical .
In his view , the union botched negotiations in 1998 , which led to the three - month lockout , the only labor stoppage in league history .
The union tried to stave off a luxury tax and maximum player salaries but ultimately had to accept both in order to strike a deal in January 1999 and save the season .

Craigslist has seen a " spectacular " drop in Erotic Services listings since it began implementing various verification methods in 2008 , the company said this week .
In five major cities across the US — Chicago , New York , Atlanta , Seattle , and Los Angeles — the drop has ranged between 90 and 95 percent over the last 12 months , and the remaining ads are " much improved " in their compliance with both Craigslist Terms of Use and local laws .
According to a post made on the official Craigslist blog , the company continues to work closely with law enforcement across the country to arrest those engaged in " the horrific crimes of human trafficking and exploitation of minors . "
Additionally , the revenue generated from Erotic Services listings is earmarked for donation to charity , which Craigslist says will begin " soon . "
The news comes less than a week after the Cook County Sheriff 's Department in Chicago sued Craigslist for facilitating prostitution .
Sheriff Thomas
Dart said in a news conference that his department had been making arrest after arrest due to Craigslist , leading to his lawsuit seeking the closure of the Erotic Services section of the site , as well as a reimbursement of $ 100,000 for the costs involved in pursuing Craigslist - related prostitution cases over the past year .
Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster said he was " mystified " by the lawsuit .
He said that Craigslist had met in 2007 with the Cook County Sheriff 's Department to discuss the purposes of the Erotic Services section , and that " inexplicably , Sheriff Dart apparently bypassed the Illinois Attorney General ’s office , and filed this complaint through a private law firm . "
Buckmaster said that he planned to vigorously defend Craigslist against the lawsuit .
This suit was filed despite Craigslist 's efforts to clean up its act , including a November 2008 agreement with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children ( NCMEC ) and the Attorneys General of 40 states to implement a number of protective measures .
In addition to a new phone verification system launched in March 2008 , Craigslist began requiring credit card verification for each listing in the Erotic Services section .
These two measures were meant to make posters more accountable for their listings , as Craigslist could blacklist phone numbers or credit cards that had posted " inappropriate " ads in the past .
As a result , the company has apparently seen a dramatic drop in Erotic Services listings , which , of course , was the goal .
Clearly , a drop of 90 to 95 percent in major US cities is a positive development , but it 's not enough for those who want Erotic Services closed altogether .
Those people seem to believe that if that section of the site is gone , prostitution listings on Craigslist will cease to exist — a faulty assumption , as the reason it exists in the first place is to pull those listings out of other , less - regulated parts of the site .
Craigslist is trying to make it clear to the public that it 's working hard to reduce illegal activity as much as possible , though Buckmaster noted that the company can't be held liable for content posted by its users .
This much is true : section 230 of the Communications Decency Act has protected Craigslist in the past when it came to discriminatory housing ads , and would likely protect it again over prostitution listings .
Drogba and Anelka have rarely played together this season , ex-manager Scolari preferred to play only with one striker upfront .
More than that Drogba failed to make Chelsea ‘s starting line - up too many times this season Scolari preferring Anelka as lone striker .
Drogba was never at his best under Scolari , mainly due to injuries , managing to score only once , not the way we all expected .
The appointment of Hiddink was well received by Drogba and his colleagues .
The Ivorian international could get the chance to shine again under his new manager .
Chelsea is having a bad time right now and the manager change would probably not be enough to make things work again .
The system 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 seems to not fit anymore Chelsea as Malouda or Kalou are simply not good enough for Chelsea ‘s standards .
The system worked perfectly under Mourinho but since then a lot of things have changed .
Duff and Robben left the club , Essien is injured , Joe Cole is out of form as well as Deco , Quaresma or Mikel their potential replacement .
A good solution for Hiddink would be to change the system to a 4 - 4 - 2 classic formation with only 2 central midfielder and with Drogba and Anelka upfront .
Also Anelka , the Premier League top scorer would be delighted to play alongside Drogba as he declared some weeks ago :
“ It is not secret that I play better alongside another striker , particularly with Didier Drogba in a 4 - 4 - 2 .
Hopefully I ’ll have some more chances do so . ”
If the system will not work then Chelsea should search for some good wingers in the summer , Robinho , Young , Silva or Di Maria could be ideal targets in this case .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- President Obama on Tuesday signed the $ 787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act into law .
But he 's far from being able to declare " mission accomplished . "
" Today does not mark the end of our economic troubles , " Obama said before signing the bill at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science .
" But it does mark the beginning of the end - the beginning of what we need to do to create jobs for Americans scrambling in the wake of layoffs ; to provide relief for families worried they wo n't be able to pay next month 's bills ; and to set our economy on a firmer foundation . "
Indeed , even though debate over the legislation was fraught with partisan fighting and what some characterize as strategic missteps by the nascent administration , getting the law passed was the easy part .
Far more difficult will be gauging whether the legislation 's trademark initiatives - which include improving physical infrastructure , investing in energy projects and providing financial relief for families by way of tax cuts and increased government benefits -- are really doing the trick .
The first step is to stem the recession in the near term .
In the longer term it will be to put the economy on a path to sustained growth and greater efficiencies in energy production , health care and other areas .
So how will we know if it 's working ?
What will be the signs ?
The president and economists say the biggest marker will be an improvement in the jobs picture .
" That 's bottom - line number one , because if people are working , then they 've got enough confidence to make purchases , to make investments , " Obama said last week before the bill 's passage .
" Businesses start seeing that consumers are out there with a little more confidence , and they start making investments , which means they start hiring workers .
So step number one , job creation . "
The official benchmark estimates from the White House : 3.5 million jobs will be created or saved over the next two years , and over 90 % of them will be in the private sector .
( See the White House 's state - by - state estimates of how many jobs could be created or saved in the map at right . )
But measuring the numbers of jobs saved as a result of the economic recovery package promises to be an elusive task .
" It will be difficult to gauge the economic benefit of stimulus since we wo n't know ... how the economy would have performed without stimulus .
Indeed I expect the economy to lose another 3 million jobs with stimulus but over 4 million without it , " said Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody 's Economy.com , whose research was relied upon by lawmakers to make the case for the economic recovery package .
As for gauging how many jobs are created , economists say they will keep an eye on a number of measures .
Lakshman Achuthan , managing director the Economic Cycle Research Institute , said starting later this year he will look to what his group calls its Leading Employment Index as one gauge of stimulus effectiveness .
The index is a composite of factors , including the number of initial jobless claims and hours in the average work week , as well as how many industries are adding jobs .
As of January , the index was still falling , Achuthan said .
Another question Zandi said he will look at is to see whether job losses have begun to lessen by October or November .
" A key benchmark will be this fall .
If stimulus is working as expected then monthly job losses should be closer to 250,000 per month , down from over 500,000 currently , " Zandi said .
The ability to create or save jobs will depend in great part on business confidence .
That 's why , in addition to employment measures , Rich Yamarone , director of economic research at Argus Research , will keep an eye on small business confidence measures such as those put out by the National Federation of Independent Business .
Another sign of whether the rescue is working : Discretionary spending for activities like casino gambling and dining out , Yamarone said .
" When consumers start to feel better about their personal situation and employment prospects , they pick up the pace of spending - that usually extends to the discretionary items as well , " Yamarone said .
Ultimately , even if every indicator of success for stimulus was tangible and could be measured with flawless precision , it will still be hard to issue a final verdict on whether the package has worked because its success is dependent on the success of other recovery efforts , such as the program for stemming foreclosures that Obama is expected to lay out on Wednesday .
" Stimulus by itself will not work well , " Zandi said .
" A financial stability plan and a foreclosure mitigation plan must also be implemented . "

My history book is the latest victim of the Kremlin ’s attempts to rehabilitate the Soviet Union , says Orlando Figes
Yesterday , the Moscow publishing house Atticus Group ( Inostranka ) cancelled a contract to publish my latest book in Russia .
The reason given by the publisher is the economic situation , which may be part of the story , though I suspect ( as do my friends in Russia ) that the real reason is political .
The history in my book is inconvenient to the current regime in Russia .
The Whisperers : Private Life in Stalin ’s Russia draws on several hundred family archives and thousands of interviews with survivors of the Stalinist regime which I conducted with Memorial , a nationwide human rights and historical research centre which for twenty years has pioneered the research of Stalinist repressions in the Soviet Union .
Memorial has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize three times in the past three years .
On 4 December a group of masked men from the Investigative Committee of the Russian General Prosecutor¹s Office forced their way with police truncheons into the St Petersburg offices of Memorial .
After a search the men confiscated hard - drives containing the entire archive of Memorial in St Petersburg : databases with biographical information on victims of repression ; details about burial sites in the St Petersburg area ; family archives ; sound recordings and transcripts of interviews .
Among the confiscated items was the entire collection of materials in the Virtual Gulag Museum , a much - needed initiative to rescue precious artefacts , photographs and documents from more than a hundred small exhibits under threat across Russia ( a country where there is just one substantial museum of the Gulag , Perm - 36 , in the Urals ) .
All the materials I collected with Memorial in St Petersburg ( about one - third of the sources used in The Whisperers ) were also confiscated by the police .
Luckily , I have copies of the documents on my website ( www.orlandofiges.com).
But the rest of the confiscated items remain in the hands of the police .
The raid on Memorial is part of a broader ideological struggle over the control of history publications and teaching in Russia that may have influenced the decision of Atticus to cancel my contract .
The Kremlin has been actively campaigning for the rehabilitation of Stalin .
Its aim is not to deny Stalin ’s crimes but to emphasise his achievements as the builder of the country ’s ‘ glorious Soviet past . ’
It wants Russians to take pride in Soviet history and not to be burdened with a paralysing sense of guilt about the repressions of the Stalin period .
At a conference in June 2007 , Putin called on Russia ’s schoolteachers to portray the Stalin period in a more positive light .
It was Stalin who made Soviet Union great , who won the war against Hitler , and his ‘ mistakes ’ were no worse than the crimes of Western states , he said .
Textbooks dwelling on the Great Terror and the Gulag have been censored ; historians attacked as ‘ anti- patriotic ’ for highlighting Stalin ’s crimes .
The presidential administration has promoted its own textbook , The Modern History of Russia , 1945 - 2006 : A Teacher ’s Handbook .
According to one of its authors , the Kremlin propagandist Pavel Danilin , its aim is to present Russian history ‘ not as a depressing sequence of misfortunes and mistakes but as something to instill pride in one ’s country .
This is precisely how teachers much teach history and not smear the Motherland with mud . ’
Danilin is a close associate of Gleb Pavlovsky , a presidential adviser and the editor of the Russian Journal , which aims to create an intellectual base for Putin ’s pseudo - democracy .
A special December issue on the ‘ Politics of Memory ’ was published to coincide with the raid on Memorial .
It contained two articles viciously attacking the work of Memorial for playing into the hands foreign historians accused of setting out to blacken Soviet history by focusing on Stalin ’s crimes .
The Whisperers has been translated into 22 foreign languages , including all the European languages of the former Soviet Union – except Russian , it now seems .
Orlando Figes is professor of history at Birkbeck College , University of London
It is simply wrong for commentators to continue to focus on President Barack Obama 's high levels of popularity , and to conclude that these are indicative of high levels of public confidence in the work of his administration .
Indeed , a detailed look at recent survey data shows that the opposite is most likely true .
The American people are coming to express increasingly significant doubts about his initiatives , and most likely support a different agenda and different policies from those that the Obama administration has advanced .

If the Higgs boson , whatever that will turn out to be , is hiding , wherever it may be found continues to shrink .
The latest analysis of data from the CDF and DZero collider experiments at Fermilab has now excluded a significant fraction of the allowed Higgs mass range established by earlier measurements .
Those experiments predict that the Higgs particle should have a mass between 114 and 185 GeV / c2 .
Now the CDF and DZero results carve out a section in the middle of this range and establish that it cannot have a mass in between 160 and 170 GeV / c2 .
According to the Standard Model of particles and forces , the Higgs mechanism gives mass to elementary particles such as electrons and quarks .
Its discovery would answer one of the big questions in physics :
What is the origin of mass ?
Credit : FermiThe Higgs particle is a keystone in the theoretical framework known as the Standard Model of particles and their interactions .
According to the Standard Model , the Higgs boson explains why some elementary particles have mass and others do not .
So far , the Higgs particle has eluded direct detection .
Searches at the Large Electron Positron collider at the European laboratory CERN established that the Higgs boson must weigh more than 114 GeV / c2 .
Calculations of quantum effects involving the Higgs boson require its mass to be less than 185 GeV / c2.
Scientists from the CDF and DZero collaborations at DOE 's Fermilab have combined Tevatron data from their two experiments to increase the sensitivity for their search for the Higgs boson .
While no Higgs boson has been found yet , the results announced today exclude a mass for the Higgs between 160 and 170 GeV / c² with 95 percent probability .
A larger area is excluded at the 90 percent probability level .
Earlier experiments at the Large Electron - Positron Collider at CERN excluded a Higgs boson with a mass of less than 114 GeV / c² at 95 percent probability .
Calculations of quantum effects involving the Higgs boson require its mass to be less than 185 GeV / c² .
Credit : FermilabThe observation of the Higgs particle is also one of the goals of the Large Hadron Collider experiments at CERN , which plans to record its first collision data before the end of this year .
Fermilab , the U.S. Department of Energy 's Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory located near Chicago , operates the Tevatron , the world 's highest - energy particle collider .
CDF is an international experiment of 602 physicists from 63 institutions in 15 countries .
DZero is an international experiment conducted by 550 physicists from 90 institutions in 18 countries .
Funding for the CDF and DZero experiments comes from DOE 's Office of Science , the National Science Foundation and a number of international funding agencies .

Credit : FermilabThe success of probing the Higgs territory at the Tevatron has been possible thanks to the excellent performance of the accelerator and the continuing improvements that the experimenters incorporate into the analysis of the collider data .
"
The outstanding performance of the Tevatron and CDF and DZero together have produced this important result , " said Dennis Kovar , Associate Director of the Office of Science for High Energy Physics at the U.S. Department of Energy .
" We 're looking forward to further Tevatron constraints on the Higgs mass . " " Fermilab 's Tevatron collider typically produces about ten million collisions per second , " said DZero co-spokesperson Darien Wood , of Northeastern University .
" The Standard Model predicts how many times a year we should expect to see the Higgs boson in our detector , and how often we should see particle signals that can mimic a Higgs .
By refining our analysis techniques and by collecting more and more data , the true Higgs signal , if it exists , will sooner or later emerge .
" Listen to DZero physicist Michael Kirby , Northwestern University , as he explains in this 2 - minute video how DZero collects and analyses collision data to find signs of the Higgs particle .
Kirby is one of about 550 physicists from 90 institutions in 18 countries who work on the DZero experiment at Fermilab .
Credit : FermilabTo increase their chances of finding the Higgs boson , the CDF and DZero scientists combine the results from their separate analyses , effectively doubling the data available .
" A particle collision at the Tevatron collider can produce a Higgs boson in many different ways , and the Higgs particle can then decay into various particles , " said CDF co-spokesperson Rob Roser , of Fermilab .
" Each experiment examines more and more possibilities .
Combining all of them , we hope to see a first hint of the Higgs particle .
" So far , CDF and DZero each have analyzed about three inverse femtobarns of collision data -- the scientific unit that scientists use to count the number of collisions .
Each experiment expects to receive a total of about 10 inverse femtobarns by the end of 2010 , thanks to the superb performance of the Tevatron .
The collider continues to set numerous performance records , increasing the number of proton - antiproton collisions it produces .
The Higgs search result is among approximately 70 results that the CDF and DZero collaborations presented at the annual conference on Electroweak Physics and Unified Theories known as the Rencontres de Moriond , held March 7 - 14 .
In the past year , the two experiments have produced nearly 100 publications and about 50 Ph.D.s that have advanced particle physics at the energy frontier .
Many of the largest United States corporations , including big banks now receiving federal bailout money , operate scores of subsidiaries in offshore tax havens that may let them evade or defer their tax bills , according to a government study released Friday .
The study , by the Government Accountability Office , singled out Citigroup as having 427 subsidiaries in offshore havens like the Cayman Islands , British Virgin Islands and Switzerland .
Bank of America has 115 subsidiaries in offshore havens , while Morgan Stanley has 273 , the report said .
Bank of America received an additional $ 20 billion in government aid on Friday , on top of a previous $ 25 billion , and a federal promise to absorb nearly $ 98 billion in soured mortgage - related securities .
Citigroup is expected to get $ 50 billion .
The 63 - page report drew unusually revealing criticism from the Treasury Department .
Michael F. Mundaca , the deputy assistant secretary for international tax affairs , wrote in a letter included in the report that because there was no universal definition for an offshore tax haven , any list of havens “ is likely to be regarded as a blacklist and may be used as the basis for the imposition of sanctions or other negative measures ” that would “ inappropriately negatively affect our economic and other relations with listed countries . ”

Progressives around the country can breathe a little easier today : James Adkisson has been sentenced to life behind bars for the deaths of Greg McKendry and Linda Kraeger , the Unitarian Universalist martyrs who died during his assault on their church in Knoxville , TN last July .
Many of us intuited at the time that Adkisson 's rampage was exactly the kind of rancid fruit that would inevitably take root in an American countryside thickly composted with two decades of hate radio bullshit , freshly turned and watered with growing middle - class frustration over the failing economy .
That suspicion that was verified in the days that followed , when police searched Adkisson 's apartment and found it filled with books and newsletters penned by Bill O'Reilly , Sean Hannity , and other right - wing hate talkers .
But Monday , Adkisson told us himself -- in his own words -- just how central right - wing eliminationism was in driving him to his shooting spree .
Shortly after he was sentenced Monday , he released a four - page handwritten " manifesto " -- which he'd intended to be his suicide note -- to the Knoxville News ( the full .pdf can be downloaded here ) .
In it , he unleashes the full measure of his hatred for liberals -- and encourages other would - be right - wing warriors to take up arms and follow him into battle .
Some choice excerpts :
" Know this if nothing else : This was a hate crime .
I hate the damn left - wing liberals .
There is a vast left - wing conspiracy in this country & these liberals are working together to attack every decent & honorable institution in the nation , trying to turn this country into a communist state .
Shame on them ....
" This was a symbolic killing .
Who I wanted to kill was every Democrat in the Senate & House , the 100 people in Bernard Goldberg 's book .
I 'd like to kill everyone in the mainstream media .
But I know those people were inaccessible to me .
I could n't get to the generals & high ranking officers of the Marxist movement so I went after the foot soldiers , the chickenshit liberals that vote in these traitorous people .
Someone had to get the ball rolling .
I volunteered .
I hope others do the same .
It 's the only way we can rid America of this cancerous pestilence . "
" I thought I 'd do something good for this Country Kill Democrats til the cops kill me .... Liberals are a pest like termites .
Millions of them Each little bite contributes to the downfall of this great nation .
The only way we can rid ourselves of this evil is to kill them in the streets .
Kill them where they gather .
I 'd like to encourage other like minded people to do what I 've done .
If life aint worth living anymore do n't just kill yourself .
do something for your Country before you go .
Go Kill Liberals .
No doubt this manifesto is being blogged , mailed , twittered , and otherwise littered across the far - right infosphere today , and Adkisson will likely emerge from this as a new hero of the extreme right wing .
( He 's obviously articulate and literate , which means we may expect more of these bilious rants coming out of his cell in the years ahead . )
It also seems likely that , probably sooner rather than later , other victims of our curdled economy will accept his charge , pick up their guns , and attempt to follow him into battle .
Nicely done , Messrs .
Hannity , Goldberg , Limbaugh , Savage and O'Reilly -- and all your lesser brethren who keep the hate speech spewing 24/7/365 across every field and into every shop in the country .
There is no more debate to be had , no more doubt about it :
What you did in the name of " entertainment , " and for the sake of the almighty ratings , raised and animated a monster like Jim Adkisson , gave him a list of targets ( " the 100 people in Bernard Goldberg 's book " ) , and was directly responsible for the deaths of two brave and decent people .
Adkisson was clearly angry and crazy -- but his " manifesto " draws the clearest , brightest line possible between the media he consumed and his actions that terrible Sunday morning .
Progressives should take three lessons away from Knoxville :
One : we are no longer safe , not even in our own houses of worship .
It 's ironic that progressives -- the subgroup of Americans who were most determined not to abandon reason and succumb to overblown fears of Islamic terrorism in the wake of 9/11 -- now have good , serious reasons to fear real domestic terrorism against themselves .
Two :
A significant part of this country 's media infrastructure is thoroughly devoted to inciting people to commit horrific acts of violence against us -- and now , we know for a fact that people are acting on those incitements .
It 's time to start taking this far more seriously .
What goes out across our airwaves these days is n't all that different from what went out over Radio Rwanda a decade ago , spurring that country to genocide .
At this point , it 's only a difference of degree .
Three :
The right wing has , as usual , grossly underestimated our courage and our commitment .
The members of Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist quickly and effectively disarmed and captured this man within seconds after he opened fire .
Adkisson expected fear ; what we got was determined resistance .
It 's why he 's still alive today , and why more UUs are n't dead by his hand .
The TVUUA congregation should be our enduring example of liberal grace under fire .
Adkisson's " manifesto " should end any doubts we ever had about how virulent and dangerous hate talk is , or whether or not that talk will eventually translate into action .
Update : My friend
Ogre pointed out something that gave me a " D'oh ! " moment .
Among Adkisson 's ranting was a clear statement : " This was an act of political protest . "
Which means that it was , by definition and his own admission , an act of domestic terrorism .
Our radio hate talkers incited a man to commit an act of terrorism .
Just sit a minute and take that in .
And the next time you hear them foaming on about how liberals are " soft on terrorism , " reflect on the fact that they 'd better hope to hell we do n't get any more serious about it -- because if we do , their asses are going to be the first ones in the dockets .
[ Closing note from Dave : My forthcoming book -- The Eliminationists : How Hate Talk Radicalized the American Right -- discusses this wellsprings of this phenomenon in depth .
It 's due out in May . ]
Hacker News and Reddit have reopened the old debate between using tables or CSS for layout .
It has been frustrating to see the one - sided nature of the discussion .
Having worked directly with this issue for several years now , launched hundreds of websites and dozens of email campaigns , I 'd like to address the issue with even - handedness .
Here are the central points of debate against using CSS for layout .
1. CSS does n't completely separate content from presentation
A central point of Ron Garret 's " Why CSS should not be used for layout " is that CSS is flawed because you cannot rearrange the elements of an html document and maintain a consistent presentation .
This is true , but it misses the point :
CSS is for styling documents .
The order in which elements appear on a page has meaning in a document , to rearrange them changes the very nature of the document .
CSS was not designed to work independently of the linear ordering of HTML elements .
It makes sense that you would need to alter your CSS when you alter the flow of your document .
When a document structure has been decided , CSS can display it in any fashion .
CSS Zen Garden is proof enough of this .
Since IE 5 has fallen out of use , it is no struggle for an experienced designer to put a properly marked - up document into any layout .
The concession to be made here is CSS does n't completely separate content from presentation .
However , it is a logical fallacy to extend that concession to the notion that Tables are better than CSS or even that they are no worse .
At present , the HTML and CSS duo is the solution with the least degree of coupling between a hypertext document 's data and its presentation .
This loose coupling enables flexibility .
2 . There are no benefits to using CSS for layout
Without question the benefits of CSS have been overstated .
That being said , there are a couple of well known benefits of CSS that are worth mentioning :
Context - sensitive Presentation – Using media types it is easy to apply different style sheets for screen , print and mobile devices .
This multi-medium support is possible because of the loose coupling between HTML and CSS .
Maintainability -
It is easier to make changes when your layout is described in CSS .
Your html is cleaner when using CSS for layouts and generally your elements are well labeled .
( Better Accessibility -
While it only helps a small audience , organizing your document based on its content rather than presentation helps those with screen readers .
The most complex designs are easier with CSS - As soon as a design requires multiple levels of nested tables , it becomes much easier to lay out the design using CSS .
3. CSS has a terrible learning curve
This is without question , the fairest knock against CSS .
All reasonable layouts require the use of floats , clears and other magic that just are n't as easy to grasp as tables .
The slow browser adoption of display : table ; is the only reason this discussion really has legs .
When CSS based layouts are as easy as Tables there will be no reason not to use it exclusively .
Instead , the decision must be made with some calculus .
Scenarios where the advantages of CSS based layouts are less clear :
You 're not creating a document , you 're creating an application .
CSS was designed for documents .
There are few , if any , semantic or accessibility reasons to do layout with CSS when the page is being built by Javascript .
You have a proper server - side HTML templates layer .
When it is easy to maintain HTML site - wide , it is somewhat easier to manage a table based layout .
Maintainability is not a high priority .
If you know a project will have a limited lifespan or will not need to be updated frequently , there is little benefit to using CSS .
It is important to note that once you 've cleared the learning curve on CSS , you 'll rarely find a reason to use tables for layout .
While it is a challenge to learn the idioms of CSS layout , it is not a harder process inherently .
Conclusion
It is worth understanding the advantages that CSS gives for layout .
In many situations they are very minor .
A reasonable non-professional web designer that does not know CSS can safely choose to use tables to avoid a lot of headaches .
This does n't mean professional web designers who know CSS and demand it be used are zealots .
If you are in the business of laying out web pages , you should be doing it in CSS .
There are enough proven advantages to doing so .
Below is an excerpt from CNN commentator Jack Cafferty 's new book , " Now or Never . "
Jack appears daily in " The Situation Room " on CNN from 4 to 7 p.m. ET .
In his new book , " Now or Never , " Jack Cafferty says parenting might be on the decline more than schools are .
I never presumed to have any more answers about being a parent than anybody else .
There are no perfect parents , perfect kids , perfect families -- only degrees of dysfunction .
You get up in the morning and do the best you can .
At the end of the day you say , " Okay , that was n't so bad , let 's try it again tomorrow . "
Some of my instincts were pretty good and some of them were awful .
I did stay engaged and did n't say to hell with being a father when my first marriage ended .
With the younger girls , I eventually made the choice to clean up my alcoholism before I pushed things to the point of no return .
But most of the credit does to my second wife Carol ; to the girls ; and to God Almighty .
Ultimately , I 've just been very fortunate .
I do n't know the status of parenting in America .
But I know a little about the status of education in America .
Parents ' growing inability to impose manners and limits on their kids when the kids are in school is reflected in record dropout rates , as well as teen drug and alcohol abuse , teen sex , and unwed pregnancies .
Maybe it 's parenting that 's on the decline , more than the schools .

Exhibit A : My wife and I have just been seated for dinner when the maitre d' walks over and seats a young family at the table next to us and the kids start carrying on like orangutans on a leash .
The parents are going , " Timmy , that 's not nice , do n't throw your food , stop stuffing your mashed potatoes up your nose . "
Are mom and dad having fun yet , picking food up off the floor , apologizing to people like us , and wiping food flung across the table off their faces ?
Some parents still have this attitude that their kids are too special to be burdened by discipline .
And the rest of us are supposed to put up with their little mutants .
That attitude really pisses me off .
I hate to break it to them , but the kids are n't special , and I do n't have to put up with their behavior .
If you can't control your obnoxious little brats , leave them home .
They do n't belong out in public annoying other people , period .
I do n't remember a generation of kids ever so indulged and enabled to behave so badly .
What 's going on ?
I remember as a kid I was expected to behave myself out in public or suffer the wrath of one very angry father .
And of all the things that used to piss him off , those expectations did n't seem unreasonable .
Something 's gone terribly wrong here .
My guess is it has to do with the breakdown of authority , the collapse of strong family structure , and the abdication of parental responsibility , dictated in part by the necessity that both parents work .
Plus , we have a whole generation of Baby Boomers who are too busy feeling entitled to prolong their own self - indulgent , self - absorbed adolescences to rein in their own kids .
Just a theory .
The New Scientist recently posted a nightmare scenario for the destruction of the electric grid .
Apparently , a solar incident no worse than something actually observed in 1859 -- the " Carrington event " -- could destroy all the transformers in the US .
Or in the world .
We do n't have close to sufficient spares sitting around .
Humankind would be without most of its electricity for a year or two at best .
Those of us who depend on manufactured or transported medicine and food in the usual manner would be dead quickly .
Depending on how comprehensive the destruction was , life might or might not be knocked back to the level of , say , The Postman , but things would be definitely uncool .
Key steps for preventing such a scenario include :
Beef up space - based early warning ( if you shut the system down fast enough it does n't get destroyed )
Increase the speed at which the system can be shut down ( current best - case is around 15 minutes , and these plasma bombardments can happen faster than that -- oops ! )
Design the ( new ) grid to be less vulnerable to cascading failures ( obviously tough , since we 're adding complexity going forward )
Have lots and lots of standby transformers sitting around ( nice use of stimulus money , but will they be wasted as we redesign the grid ? )
Less dramatically , CNN reminded us some days ago of the obvious point that the new smart grid could be eminently hackable .
( Network World offers more detail here and perhaps also here -- and makes it sound like the problems will NOT be fixed . )
In principle , this could cause overloads with consequences as drastic as in the first scenario .
Of course , that 's extremely far - fetched .
The hackers would both have to understand the dependencies of the network better than the network 's builders and defenders do , and also find a way to actually exploit them .
Or else they'd have to be amazingly lucky .
But hey -- to this day , nobody ( even whacked - out conspiracy theorists ) offers a really clear picture of how and why the World Trade Center towers completely collapsed .
こんにちは 、SICPが好きな高橋です。って、どんだけ好きかはこの辺を読んでいただければ（ちなみに「このときの様子がなんとなく目に浮かんでいるのではないか」というのは控えめな表現で、100%かんぺきな再現力だと思います。私は爆笑してしまいました）。
さてさて、またま たSICPが話題になっていたようですね。しかもちょっとネガティブな意味でも。まあ、確かに新版の翻訳はちょっと読みにくいのもありますし、万人におすすめ、というわけではないのもわかりますが。
だがしかし 。

じゃあ、SICPはどういう本か。
LISP を使って仮想マシンを作って、LISPコンパイラを作って実行させて、プログラムがどのように動くかを勉強する本だ。
えええええ。いやいやまさか、そういう本じゃないはず、ですよね？
とは言うものの。でも、こちらのように、
をおぼえるための本、と思ってる人もいるのかなあと思うと、ちょっと残念になってきました。SICPって、そんなつまんない本じゃないですよ。
では、SICPとはどのような本なのでしょうか。
いや、もちろんそんなのは読み手によって変わってくるもので、私のそれも勝手な受け取り方、解釈の一つでしかないのですが、それを前提に言わせていただくと。少なくとも私にとってSICPとは、「プログラム」そして「プログラミング」という営為の見方を変えるもの、もっと言うと世界に対する見方、すなわち「世界観」を与えてくれるものなのです。
その世界観とは何か。ずばりまとめてみましょう。
これです。これ。プログラミング言語好きにはなんと都合のいい世界観でしょう。でも、わりとそういう読み方を素直に許してくれるような本だと思うんですよ。
1番目についてはあまり議論の余地はないでしょう。本書の第４章にも、こう書いてあります。
この点を認めるのはプログラマとしてのわれわれ自身の見方を変えることである。われわれは他人の設計した言語の利用者であるよりは、言語の設計者として自分を見るようになる。
つまり、プログラマ、プログラムを作る人とは、「新たな言語を作る人」、なのです。
なんで本書の第４章では言語処理系を作るのでしょうか。それは単に知的好奇心、あるいはペダンチックな感情を満足させるためのものでもなければ、単なる教養のためでもないのです。あらゆるプログラムは、本質として言語処理系なのです。であれば、よいプログラムを書くためには、言語処理系を書くための技術が役に立つはずです。ふつうに作る様々なプログラムを良いものにするために、言語処理系の実装を学ぶのです。
しかし、それは第４章で突然始まったものではありません。第３章で出てくるオブジェクト指向はもちろん、計算の環境モデル、遅延評価、これらはプログラミング言語の処理系を理解する上で重要な概念でもありますが、それはすなわち言語処理系としてのプログラムを作る上でも重要なわけです。そしてもちろん、そのためには、第１章での処理の抽象化、第２章でのデータの抽象化も学ばなければならないのです。
さらに、本書で取り上げているサンプルにも注目してほしいところです。デジタル回路や銀行口座、プログラミング言語、レジスタ計算機……基本的に、シミュレーションのようなものが多いことに気づくはずです。これらはすなわち、プログラムを単に何かのツールとなるものと考えるのではなく、世界を映し出す一つのモデルとして、その記述形態として、プログラムというものをとらえているのです。
この２つが合わされば。この世界のさまざまな振る舞いが、CやJavaやRubyやErlangといったようなプログラミング言語……とはだいぶ違っているけど……のような、一種のプログラミング言語処理系のそれに近いように思えてくるはずなのです。強引だけど。でもそう見えません？
そしてそう見えると、はっとしませんか？
ああ、世界は、言語処理系なんだ！ そうだったのか！！ とか。
それは、とてもたのしい経験だと思うんです。得られる知識によってたのしい、というのではなく、その驚きが、興奮が、それを感じることが、とてもたのしい経験なんじゃないかと。それはきっと、プログラムというものを知っている人ならではの、プログラマならではのたのしみです。プログラミングをおぼえて、プログラマになってよかった、そう思える経験なんじゃないかと。
プログラミング言語の入門書や、プログラミングの入門書や、言語処理系の入門書はたくさんありますが、こういうたのしみを得られるような本はあんまりないと思うのです。だからこそ、プログラマな人なら、SICPはぜひ一度読んでいただきたいなあ、と思うのでした。
Australian captain Ricky Ponting and vice - captain Michael Clarke have tied for the Allan Border Medal .
The medal , which recognises performances in Tests and one - day internationals over the past 12 months , has never been shared before in its 10 - year history .
Ponting now has four Allan Border Medals , while it was the second win for his deputy .
Ponting and Clarke both finished on 41 votes with Michael Hussey next with 38 .
Pre-ceremony favourite Mitchell Johnson ended up in fourth on 30 votes , equal with opening batsman Simon Katich .
" Obviously I 'm very honoured to receive the Allan Border Medal and even more honoured to be standing beside my captain , " Clarke said in accepting the award .
Ponting looked very surprised he was even in the contention for the award .
The Australian skipper has endured a rough year , with many criticising his performance as captain .
But Ponting said his side was on the brink of regaining its place at the top of world cricket .
" This is an amazing shock to me ... ( I was ) just waiting for either ' Pup ' or Mitch to get up here tonight and accept the award , " he said .
" As we all know it 's been an up - and - down year for the team and everybody right at the moment is writing us off .
" But I know deep down in my heart that we 're not very far away at all and I think our results would even prove that over the last couple of months .
" It 's been am amazing time with some of our greats leaving the team , some obviously very exciting and young players coming into the team .
" It 's an amazing challenge for me and certainly Michael to keep leading this team in the right direction . "
Earlier in the night , Clarke was named Test player of the year and fast bowler Nathan Bracken claimed the one - day player of the year award .
Young New South Wales opener and Test hopeful Phillip Hughes took out the Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year award
South Australia 's Michael Klinger , who recently passed 1,000 domestic runs for the season , won the state player of the year title .
Australian international Shelley Nitschke was recognised as women 's player of the year .
How come office workers are prone to be overweight ?
It turns out , that the reason for this is more complicated that mere lack of movements .
Glucose is the energy source for our brain cells .
Blood glucose levels drop more significantly under heavy brainwork than under physical work .
We feel hunger when we are short in glucose , as this way the organism tries to replenish glucose levels .
Thus , when we spend a lot of time in front of our computer we tend to spend less calories , but eat more food , therefore we consume more than we spend .
This is the main reason why mental work results in excess weight .
How Office Workers Can Stay Fit
However , there is a solution – we need to carefully control our food consumption ( considering the false hunger described above ) and never forget about physical activities .
Here are some interesting exercises .
Those can be easily done at the office , regardless of what you wear , be it a skirt , dress or pants .
The exercises concentrate on leg and buttocks muscles , make you work with your back , abs , and chest .
Exercise for Abs and Back
Stand next to a wall or a closet such that your back is leaned against it .
Squat and stay in this position as long as you can .
Do not lean forward .
Keep your back straight by using your abs and back muscles .
In a couple seconds you will feel your leg muscles at work .
Relax and do another couple of sets of the same exercise .
Take mini - walks from time to time , move while on the phone , climb stairs and park further and walk to add some physical activity to your office day .
Wall Push-ups
Next , turn around such that you are facing the same wall and lean on the wall with your hands .
You will be doing push - ups and work on your upper body .
Your feet need to be as far from the wall such that when you bend you arms and lower yourself to the wall there should be a 45 degree angle between your body and the wall .
Wall push - ups is the simplest version of push - ups , thus you need to increase the number of repetitions to 50 .
If you feel like making the exercise a little bit more complicated , then you can do push - ups on one hand keeping the other one behind your back .
Snack Tip for a Better Result
This small workout will make your office day less monotone and will boost your mood as well .
Furthermore , make sure to take an apple , pear , yogurt , or juice instead of cookies and coffee for your snack .
Have a great day at work !
( CNN ) --
Her bid for the vice presidency ended more than two months ago , but Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin appears determined not to become a mere afterthought .
Gov. Sarah Palin may be positioning herself for a 2012 run for the White House , analysts say .
Departing from a historical trend of failed vice presidential candidates who descend into relative obscurity after Election Day , Palin continues to command the intense media coverage that befits a national office seeker .
It 's an astonishing development , given that she has no role in national domestic policy and is a first - term governor of a state almost 4,500 miles from Washington .
Palin empathizers say the Alaska governor is merely trying to recover her good name after months of damage by the mainstream media , liberal bloggers and even high - level members of the McCain campaign who grew publicly dissatisfied with their VP nominee as Election Day neared .
But some political observers suggest that Palin 's ongoing -- and predominantly adversarial -- relationship with the national media is all part of a savvy effort to retain her popularity with the legions of rank - and - file conservatives who stood so strongly behind her during the campaign .
Watch what Palin has to say about the media »
Should Palin eye a presidential bid herself in 2012 , continued loyalty from grass - roots Republicans will be crucial in determining whether she is the early favorite in a race sure to feature a crowded field of high - profile GOP contenders .
" All of that media bashing plays to the base , " said David Brody , a senior national correspondent for the Christian Broadcasting Network .
" And at least within the Republican primary , that works well . "
Palin 's latest newsmaking interview came late last week with Esquire magazine , excerpts of which were released Tuesday .
In the interview , Palin bashed coverage by her home - state newspaper and lashed out at " bored , anonymous , pathetic bloggers who lie . "
That interview followed similarly heated comments last week to conservative John Ziegler , in which Palin targeted comedian Tina Fey and CBS News anchor Katie Couric for " exploiting " her during the presidential campaign .
In the same interview , Palin charged that the national media continue to feed inaccurate rumors surrounding the birth of her 8 - month - old son , Trigg .
She also said news organizations have unduly criticized the upcoming marriage of her 18 - year - old daughter , Bristol , to Levi Johnston , a former electrical apprentice in the North Slope oil field .
Palin made a phone call to People magazine late last month to defend her daughter and Johnston after the publication had suggested that neither was working to finish high school : " You need to know that both Levi and Bristol are working their butts off , " Palin told the magazine in an animated voice - mail message .
The mainstream media have long served as a punching bag for conservatives , even more so in 2008 , when the McCain campaign itself publicly declared that many news organizations were " in the tank " for Barack Obama .
" If Palin wants to run for the Republican nomination in 2012 , she has an issue that could rally conservatives : her treatment by the media , " CNN Senior Political Analyst Bill Schneider said .
But besides harnessing conservative anger at the mainstream media , it 's also likely Palin is wielding her ongoing fame to dispel lingering impressions she is a policy lightweight or , worse , incompetent .
" The problem for Sarah Palin is that she may have a little Dan Quayle syndrome here in the sense that once [ former Vice President ]
Dan Quayle misspelled ' potato , ' that was the end of it , " Brody said .
" He had the public perception problem , and here comes Sarah Palin in 2012 , and she may have exactly the same problem . "
To be sure , in several recent interviews , Palin has sharply criticized how the McCain campaign handled her , particularly when it came to her dealings with the media .
In her interview with Ziegler , the Alaska governor directly indicted senior McCain advisers over a series of disastrous interviews with Couric , saying further sit - downs with the CBS anchor should not have been granted after the first one went badly .
In the Esquire interview , Palin said she wished she had stood up to McCain strategists and had n't assumed " that they know you well enough to make all your decisions for ya . "
" She perhaps felt muzzled " during the campaign , said Ryan D'Agostino , the Esquire reporter who interviewed Palin .
" You could really feel and sense the frustration coming through as she was answering my pretty simple questions .
It was a little bit like she was exhaling and it , maybe , it felt good . "
Still , some Republicans are questioning Palin 's full - court media press , suggesting that the former vice presidential candidate should instead work to beef up her résumé while assuming a lower profile .
After all , if Palin wants to be a serious presidential contender , she will need broader support than just the rank - and - file conservatives who respond so energetically to media - bashing .
" She needs a little time in the desert .
She needs to retire , " said Alex Castellanos , a Republican strategist and CNN contributor .
" She needs to demonstrate growth as a politician , as a political leader .
You can't do that if you keep staying in front of us day after day after day as the same person . "

Testing Web Applications with Python and Twill
by Michele Simionato
February 24 , 2009
Summary
I am republishing an old article I wrote in 2005 for O' Reilly ( see http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2005/11/03/twill.html).
The article is slightly outdated , but not much , and I am republishing it since nowadays to criticize excessive unit testing has become fashionable .

Introduction
You have just finished your beautiful Web application , with lots of pages , links , forms and buttons ; you have spent weeks making sure that everything works fine , that the special cases are handled correctly , that the user cannot crash your system whatever she does .
Now you are happy and you are ready to ship .
But at the last minute the customer ask for a change : you have the time to apply the change , but not the time - nor the will - to pass trough another testing ordalia .
So you ship anyway , hoping that your last little fix did not break some other part of the application .
The result is that the hidden bug shows up at the first day of usage .
If you recognized yourself in this situation then this paper is for you , keep reading .
If not , well , keep reading anyway , I am sure you will find something interesting , among the following topics : how to separate unit tests from functional tests ;
how to test web applications ( written in any language ) using standard Python libraries ;
how to use twill , a nice and easy to learn web testing tool .
To test or not to test , that is the question Let me begin with a brief personal recollection of how I became interested in testing methodologies , and of what I have learned in the last couple of years .
I have been aware of the importance of testing from the beginning , and I have heard about automatic testing for years .
However , having heard about automatic testing is not the same as doing automatic testing , and not the same as doing automatic testing well .
It takes some time and experience to get into the testing mood , as well as the ability to challenge some widespread misconceptions .
For instance , when I began studying test driven methodologies , I had gathered two wrong ideas : that testing was all about unit testing ;
that the more you test , the better .
After some experience I quickly realized myself that unit tests were not the only tool , nor the best tool to effectively test my application .
But to overcome the second misconception , I needed some help .
The help come from an XP seminar I attended last year , were I actually asked the question " how do I test the user interface of a Web application , i.e. that when the user click on a given page she gets the expected result ? " .
The answer was : " You do n't .
Why do you want to test that your browser is working ? "
The case for not testing everything
The answer made me rethink many things .
Obviously I was well aware from the beginning that full test coverage is a myth , still I thought one programmer should try to test as much as he can .
But this is not the right approach .
Instead , it is important to discriminate about the infinite amount of things that could be tested , and focus on the things that are of your responsability .
If your customer wants functionality X , you must be sure functionality X is there .
But if in order to get functionality X you need to rely on functionalities X1 , X2 , ... XN , you do n't need to test for all of them .
You test only the functionality you are payed to implement .
You do n't test that the browser is working , it is not your job .
For instance , in the case of a Web application , you can interact with it indirectly , via the HTTP protocol , or directly , via the internal API .
If you check that when the user clicks on button B method M is called and the result R is displayed , you are testing both your application and the correctness of the HTTP protocol implementation both in the browser and in the server .
This is way too much .
You may rely on the HTTP protocol and just test the API , i.e just test that if method M is called the right result R is returned .
Of course , a similar viewpoint is applicable to GUIs .
In the same vein , you must test that the interface to the DB you wrote is working , but you do n't need to test that the database itself is working , this is not your responsability .
The basic point is to separate the indirect testing of the user interface - via the HTTP protocol - from the testing of the inner API .
To this aim , it is important to write your application in such a way that you can test the logic independently from the user interface .
Working in this way you also have the additional bonus that you can change the user interface later , without having to change a single tests for the logic part .
The problem is that typically the customer will give his specifications in terms of the user interface .
He will tell you " There must be a page where the user will enter her order , then she will enter her credit card number , then the system must send a confirmation email , ... "
This kind of specification is a kind of very high level test - a functional test - which has to be converted into a low - level test : for instance you may have unit testing telling you that the ordered item has been registered in the database , that the send_confirmation_email method has been called etc .
The conversion requires some thinking and practice and it an art more than a science .
Actually I think that the art of testing is not in how to test , but in what to test .
The best advice and best answer to somebody asking about " how do I test a Web application ? " is probably " make a priority lists of the things you would like to test and test as little as possible " .
For instance , one should never tests the details of the implementation .
If you make this mistake ( as I did at the beginning ) your tests will get in your way at refactoring time , i.e. they will have exactly the opposite of the intended effect .
Generally speaking , good advices are : do n't spend time testing third party software , do n't waste time testing code which API is likely to change , split the UI testing from the application logic testing .
Ideally you should be able to determine what is the minimal set of tests needed to make your customer happy , and restrict yourself to those tests .
The case for testing everything
The previous advice is nice and reasonable , especially in an ideal world where third party software is bug free and everything is configured correctly .
Unfortunately , the real world is a bit different .
For instance you must be aware that your application does not work on some buggy browser , or that it cannot work in specific circumstances with some database .
Also , you may have a nice and comprehensive test suite which runs flawlessly on your development machine , but still that the application may not work correctly when installed on a different machine , because the database could be installed improperly , or the mail server settings could be incorrect , or the Internet connection could be down , etc .
In the same vein , if you want to really be sure that if the user - using a specifing browser in a specific environment - clicks on that button she gets that result , you have to emulate exactly that situation .
It looks like we are back to square one , i.e. the need of testing everything .
But we have learned something in the process : whereas in principle you would like to test everything , in practice you can effectively prioritize your tests , focusing on some more than on others , and splitting them in separate categories to be run separately at different times .
You definitely need to test that the application is working as intended when deployed on a different machine : and from the failures to these installation tests you may also infer what is wrong and correct the problem .
These installation tests - tests of the environment where your software is running - must be kept decoupled from the unit tests checking the application logic .
If you are sure that the logic is right , then you are sure also sure that the problems are in the environment , and you can focus your debugging skills in the right direction .
In any case , you need to have both high level ( functional , integration , installation ) tests and low level tests ( unit tests , doctests ) .
High level tests include tests of the user interface .
In particular , you need a test to make sure that if an user click X he gets Y , so you are sure that the Internet connection , the web server , the database , the mail server , your application , the browser , all work nicely together .
But you should not focus on these global kind of tests .
You do n't need to write a thousands of these high level tests , if you already have many specific low - level tests checking that the logic and the various components of your application are working .
How to test the user interface Having structured your application properly , you will need a smaller number of user interface tests , but still you will need at least a few .
How do you write these tests then ?
There are two possibilities : the hard way and the easy way .
The hard way is just doing everything by hand , by using your favorite programming language Web libraries to perform GET and POST requests and to verify the results .
The easy way is to leverage on tools built by others .
Of course , internally these tools work just by calling the low level libraries , so it is convenient to say a couple of words on the hard way , just to understand what is going on , in case the high level tool give you some problem .
Moreover , there is always the possibility than you need something more customized , and knowledge of the low level libraries can be precious .
The interaction between the user and a Web application passes through the HTTP protocol , so it is perfectly possible to simulate the action of an user clicking on a browser just by sending to the server an equivalent HTTP request ( let me ignore the existence of Javascript for the moment ) .
Any modern programming language has libraries to interact with the HTTP protocol , but here I will give my examples in Python , since Python is both a common language for Web programming and a readable one .
In Python the interaction with the Web is managed via the urllib libraries .
You have two of them : urllib , which can be used in absence of authentication , and urllib2 which can also manage cookie - based authentication .
A complete discussion of these two libraries would take a long time , but explaining the basics is pretty simple .
I will just give a couple of recipes based on urllib2 , the newest and most powerful library .
I will notice here that the support for cookies in Python 2.4 has improved ( essentially by including the third party ClientCookie library ) so you may not be aware of the trick I am going to explain , even if have used the urllib libraries in the past .
So , do n't skip the next two sections ;)
Recipe 1 : how to send GET and POST requests Suppose you want to access a site which does not require authentication .
Then making a GET request is pretty easy , just type at the intepreter prompt >>> from urllib2 import urlopen >>> page = urlopen ( " http://www.example.com " )
Now you have a file like - object which contains the HTML code of the page http://www.example.com: >>> for line in page : print line , < HTML > < HEAD > < TITLE >Example Web Page</ TITLE > </HEAD > < body > < p >
You have reached this web page by typing " example.com " , " example.net " , or " example.org " into your web browser .
</p> < p

See < a href= " http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2606.txt ">RFC
2606</a> , Section 3 .</p> </ BODY > </ HTML >
If you try to access a non-existent page , or if your Internet connection is down , you will get an urllib2.URLError instead .
Incidentally , this is why the urllib2.urlopen function is better than the older urllib.urlopen , which would just silently retrieve a page containing the error message .
You can easily imagine how to use urlopen to check your Web application : for instance , you could retrieve a page , extract all the links and check that they refer to existing pages ; or you can verify that the retrieved page contains the right information , for instance by matching it with a regular expression .
In practice , urlopen ( possibly coupled with a third party HTML parsing tool , such as BeautifulSoup ) gives you all the fine granted control you may wish for .
Moreover , urlopen gives you the possibility to make a POST : just pass the query string as second argument to urlopen .
As an example , I will make a POST to http://issola.caltech.edu/~t/qwsgi/qwsgi-demo.cgi/widgets, which is a page containing the example form coming with Quixote , a nice small Pythonic Web Framework . >>> page = urlopen ( " http://issola.caltech.edu/~t/qwsgi/qwsgi-demo.cgi/widgets " , ... " name=MICHELE&password=SECRET&time=1118766328.56 " ) >>> print page.read ( ) < html > < head >< title > Quixote Widget Demo</ title ></head > < body > < h2 > You entered the following values :</ h2 > < table > < tr > < th align = " left " > name</th><td>MICHELE</td></tr> < tr>< th align = " left " > password </th><td> SECRET</td></tr> < tr>< th align = " left " >confirmation</th>< td> False</td></tr> < tr > < th align = " left " > eye colour </ th>< td>< i> nothing </i></td></tr> < tr > < th align = " left " > pizza size </ th>< td>< i> nothing </i></td></tr> < tr > < th align = " left " > pizza toppings </th><td><i>nothing </i></td></tr> </ table > < p
>
It took you 163.0 sec to fill out and submit the form </ p> </ body > </html >
Now page will contain the result of your POST .
Notice that I had to pass explicitly a value for time , which is an hidden widget in the form .
That was easy , is n't it ?
If the site requires authentication , things are slightly more complicated , but not much , at least if you have Python 2.4 installed .
Recipe 2 : managing authentication
In order to manage cookie - based authentication procedures , you need to import a few utilities from urllib2 : >>> from urllib2 import build_opener , HTTPCookieProcessor , Request Notice that HTTPCookieProcessor is new in Python 2.4 : if you have an older version of Python you need third party libraries such as ClientCookie .
build_opener and HTTPCookieProcessor are used to create an opener object that can manage the cookies sent by the Web server : >>> opener = build_opener ( HTTPCookieProcessor )
The opener object has an open method that can be used to retrieve the Web page corresponding to a given request .
The request itself is encapsulated in a Request object , which is built from the URL address , the query string , and some HTTP headers information .
In order togenerate the query string , it is pretty convenient to use the urlencode function defined in urllib ( not in urllib2 ) : >>> from urllib import urlencode urlencode generates the query string from a dictionary or a list of pairs , taking care of the quoting and escaping rules required by the HTTP protocol .
For instance >>> urlencode ( dict( user= " MICHELE " , password = " SECRET " ) ) ' password=SECRET&user=MICHELE
'
Notice that the order is not preserved when you use a dictionary ( quite obviously ) , but this is usually not an issue .
Now , let me define a helper function : >>> def urlopen2 ( url , data=None , user_agent='urlopen2 ' ) : ... " " " Can be used to retrieve cookie - enabled Web pages ( when ' data ' is ... None ) and to post Web forms ( when ' data ' is a list , tuple or dictionary ... containing the parameters of the form ) . ... " " " ... if hasattr ( data , " __iter__ " ) : ... data = urllib.urlencode( data ) ... headers = {' User - Agent ' : user_agent} ... return opener.open(urllib2.Request ( url , data , headers ) )
With urlopen2 , you can POST your form in just one line .
On the other hand , if the page you are posting to does not contain a form , you will get an HTTPError : >>> urlopen2 ( " http://www.example.com " , dict ( user= " MICHELE " , password = " SECRET " ) )
Traceback ( most recent call last ) : ... HTTPError : HTTP Error 405 : Method Not Allowed
If you just need to perform a GET , simply forget about the second argument to urlopen2 , or use an empty dictionary or tuple .
You can even fake a browser by passing a convenient user agent string , such as " Mozilla " , " Internet Explorer " , etc .
This is pretty useful if you want to make sure that your application works with different browsers .
Using these two recipes it is not that difficilt to write your own web testing framework .
But you may be better off by leveraging the work of somebody else
Testing web applications the easy way : twill I am a big fan of mini languages , i.e. small languages written to perform a specific task ( see for instance my O'Reilly article on the graph - generation language " dot " ) .
I was very happy when I discovered that there a nice little language expressely designed to test Web applications .
Actually there are two implementations of it : Titus Brown 's twill and Cory Dodt 's Python Browser Poseur , PBP .
PBP came first , but twill seems to be developing faster .
At the time of this writing , twill is still pretty young ( I am using version 0.7.1 ) , but it already works pretty well in most situations .
Both PBP and twill are based on tools by John J. Lee , i.e. mechanize ( inspired by Perl ) , ClientForm and ClientCookie , that you may find at http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net .
twill also use Paul McGuire 's PyParsing .
However , you do n't need to install these libraries : twill includes them as zipped libraries ( leveraging on the new Python 2.3 zipimport module ) .
As a consequence twill installation is absolutely obvious and painless ( nothing more than the usual python setup.py install ) .
The simplest way to use twill is interactively from the command line .
Let me show a simple session example : $ twill - sh -= Welcome to twill ! =- current page : * empty page * >> go http://www.example.com == > at http://www.example.com >> show < HTML > < HEAD > < TITLE >Example Web Page</ TITLE > </HEAD > < body > < p >
You have reached this web page by typing " example.com " , " example.net " , or " example.org " into your web browser .
</p> < p
> These domain names are reserved for use in documentation and are not available for registration .
See < a href= " http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2606.txt ">RFC
2606</a> , Section 3 .</ p> </ BODY > </ HTML > twill recognizes a few intuitive commands , such as go , show , find , notfind , echo , code , back , reload , agent , follow and few others .
The example shows how you can access a particular HTML page and display its content .
The find command matches the page against a regular expression : thus >> find ( " Example Web Page " ) is a test asserting that the current page contains what we expect .
Similarly , the notfind command asserts that the current page does not match the given regular expression .
The other twill commands are pretty obvious : echo < message > prints a message on standard output , code < http_error_code > checks that you are getting the right HTTP error code ( 200 if everything is alright ) , back allows you to go back to the previously visited page , reload reloads the current page , agent < user - agent > allows you to change the current user agent , thus faking different browsers , follow < regex > finds the first matching link on the page and visit it .
The full lists of the commands can be obtained by giving help at the prompt ; EOF of CTRL - D allows you to exit .
Once you have tested your application interactively , it is pretty easy to cut & paste your twill session and convert it in a twill script .
Then , you can run your twill script in a batch process : $ twill - sh mytests .
twill
As you may imagine , you can put more than one script in the command line and test many of them at the same time .
Since twill is written in Python , you can control it from Python entirely , and you can even extends its command set just by adding new commands in the commands .
py module .
At the moment , twill is pretty young and it does not have the capability to convert scripts in unit tests automatically , so that you can easily run entire suites of regression tests .
However , it is not that difficult to implement that capability yourself , and it is not unlikely that twill will gain good integration with unittest and doctest in the future .
Retrieving and submitting web forms twill is especially good at retrieving and submitting web forms .
The form - related functionality is implemented with the following commands : showforms
formvalue < form_id > < name > < value >
submit < button_id >
formclear < form_id >
Explaining the commands is pretty straightforward .
showforms shows the forms contained in a web page .
For instance , try the following : >> go http://issola.caltech.edu/~t/qwsgi/qwsgi-demo.cgi/widgets >> showforms Form # 1 ## __Name______ __Type___ __ID________ __Value__________________ name text ( None ) password password ( None ) confirm checkbox ( None ) [ ] of [ ' yes ' ] colour radio ( None ) [ ] of [ ' green ' , ' blue ' , ' brown ' , 'ot ... size select ( None ) [ ' Medium ( 10 " ) ' ] of [ ' Tiny ( 4 " ) ' , ' S ... toppings select ( None ) [ ' cheese ' ] of [ ' cheese ' , ' pepperoni ' ... time hidden ( None ) 1118768019.17 1 submit ( None ) Submit current page : http://issola.caltech.edu/~t/qwsgi/qwsgi-demo.cgi/widgets
Notice that twill makes a good job at emulating a browser , so it fills the hidden time widget automatically , whereas we had to fill it explicitely with urlopen .
Unnamed forms get an ordinal number to be used as form id in the formvalue command , which fill a field of the specified form with a given value .
You can give many formvalue commands in succession ; if you are a lazy typist you can also use fv as an alias for formvalue : >> fv 1 name MICHELES current page : http://issola.caltech.edu/~t/qwsgi/qwsgi-demo.cgi/widgets >> fv 1 password SECRET current page : http://issola.caltech.edu/~t/qwsgi/qwsgi-demo.cgi/widgets formclear reset all the fields in a form and submit allows you to press a submit botton , thus submitting the form : >> submit 1 current page : http://issola.caltech.edu/~t/qwsgi/qwsgi-demo.cgi/widgets
A simple show will convince you that the forms has been submitted .
The best way to understand how does it work is just experimenting on your own .
The base distribution contains a few examples you may play with .
Enlarging the horizon
In this article I have shown two easy ways to test your web application : by hand , using urllib , or with a simple tool such as twill .
There is more under the sun .
Much more .
There are many sophisticated Web testing frameworks out there , including enterprise - oriented ones , with lots of functionalities and a steep learning curve .
Here , on purpose , I have decided to start from the small , and to discuss the topic from a do - it - yourself attitude , since sometimes the simplest things works best : or because you do n't need the sophistication , or because your preferred testing framework lacks the functionality you wish for , or because it is just buggy .
If you need something more sophisticated , a great source for everything testing - related is Grig Gheorghiu 's blog : http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/2005/02/articles-and-tutorials.html
A new framework which is especially interesting is Selenium , which is also used to test Plone applications .
Selenium is really spectacular , since it is Javascript based and it really tests your browser , clicking on links , submitting forms , opening popup windows , all in real time .
It completely emulates the user experience , at highest possible level .
It also gives you all kind of bells and whistles , eye candies and colored HTML output ( which you may like or not , but that surely will impress your customer if you are going to demonstrate him that the application is conform to the specifications ) .
I cannot render justice to Selenium in a few lines and maybe I should write a whole new paper on it , when I find the time .
For the moment , however I make no promises and I refer you to the available documentation .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Obama administration issued a scathing response on Monday to criticism from former Vice President Dick Cheney , calling him part of a “ Republican cabal ” and saying his economic advice should be ignored .

White House spokesman Robert Gibbs used his daily briefing to ridicule Cheney , who said in a CNN interview that President Barack Obama ’s revamped policies on terrorism suspects would make the United States more vulnerable to attack .
“ I guess Rush Limbaugh was busy so they trotted out the next most popular member of the Republican cabal , ” Gibbs said in a sarcastic tone , referring to the conservative radio talk - show host whom Obama ’s fellow Democrats have depicted as the new leader of the Republicans .
Soon after taking office on January 20 , Obama started rolling back some of Republican predecessor George W. Bush ’s most divisive national security policies .
He ordered the closing within a year of the internationally condemned Guantanamo Bay military prison in Cuba and an end to harsh interrogation of terrorism suspects held there .
“ The president has made quite clear that keeping the American people safe and secure is the most serious job that he has each and every day , ” Gibbs said in defending Obama ’s decisions .
Cheney , who under Bush became one of the most powerful vice presidents , had championed tough interrogation methods implemented after the September 11 attacks of 2001 , and was also an architect of the 2003 U.S. - led invasion of Iraq .
“ He is making some choices that , in my mind , will , in fact , raise the risk to the American people of another attack , ” Cheney , in Sunday ’s interview , said of Obama .
Gibbs pushed back hard on that point .
“ For seven - plus years , the very perpetrators that the vice president says he ’s concerned about were n’t brought to justice , ” he said .
“ The president in the very first week of his administration chose to change that , to take ... these that had committed terrorist acts , and to finally bring about , instituting a process to bring about swift and certain justice , ” he added .
Asked about Cheney ’s suggestion that the White House was trying to take advantage of the economic crisis to expand government , Gibbs said , “ I think not taking economic advice from Dick Cheney would be maybe the best possible outcome of yesterday ’s interview . ”
Asked whether his caustic tone in responding to Cheney was proper , Gibbs said , “ Sometimes I ask forgiveness rather than for permission ... I hope my sarcasm did n’t mask the seriousness of the answer . ”

Richard Arnold participates in the mission ’s first scheduled spacewalk .
Astronauts on board of the International Space Station have been called into action to dodge yet another piece of space junk .
The Shuttle Discovery ’s crew were ordered to fire the ship ’s thrusters to reorient it so it was in front of the orbiter for three hours .
This resulted in a natural drag of about a foot per second , moving the Station out of the path of a chunk of Chinese rocket about 4 inches in diameter .
Though small , such debris could kill a space - walking astronaut instantly .
Even tiny flecks of paint are travelling fast enough – tens of thousands of miles an hour – to dent the Station ’s surface or even crack a window .
Debris is a growing problem for the station .
Earlier this month , the three station crew had to race into their emergency getaway capsule because another piece of space junk came uncomfortably close .
And just before Discovery ’s arrival last week , Nasa considered moving the station again before judging that debris from an old Soviet satellite would not threaten the craft .
‘ Space debris is becoming an ever - increasing challenge , ’ flight director Kwatsi Alibaruho said .
‘ It ’s a big deal .
It ’s very tiring .
Sometimes it ’s exhausting .’
The latest episode occurred as Nasa scrambled to put together a spacewalking repair plan for a jammed equipment platform at the space station .
Astronauts will complete the third and final spacewalk today .
They plan to return to an equipment storage shelf that jammed and could not be deployed on Saturday after the spacewalkers accidentally inserted a pin upside down .
Monday ’s spacewalkers – former schoolteachers Joseph Acaba and Richard Arnold II – will use all their strength this time to get the shelf properly deployed .
They will have pry bars and hammers , just in case .
If nothing works , the jammed platform will simply be tied down with sturdier tethers .
The storage platform – located on the long space station framework that holds all the solar wings – is meant to secure big spare parts that do n’t fit inside the space station but will be needed once Nasa ’s shuttles stop flying .
Despite the recent incidents , Discovery ’s astronauts said they do n’t worry about space junk when they ’re outside .
‘ We have enough other risks and worries to take on as we go outside , ’ said Steven Swanson , who took part in the first two spacewalks .

Kellogg drops
Phelps ; AP admits Phelps did n't admit smoking pot Ron Brynaert
Published : Friday February 6 , 2009
Print This Email This Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps never admitted smoking marijuana , but that has n't stopped the media from reporting he did almost twenty - four seven for the last week .
After the notorious photo of the world - famous Phelps smoking a bong rocketed across the media and internet , he posted the following statement on his Facebook site : " I engaged in behavior which was regrettable and demonstrated bad judgment .
I 'm 23 years old , and despite the successes I have had in the pool , I acted in a youthful and inappropriate way , not in a manner that people have come to expect from me .
For this , I am sorry .
I promise my fans and the public - it will not happen again . "
Although it would perhaps be far - fetched to believe that there was nothing but tobacco in the bong , nowhere in the statement did Phelps expressly confess to smoking marijuana .
In fact , he did n't even mention the bong at all , just that he " engaged in behavior which was regrettable and demonstrated bad judgment . "
But papers like The New York Post plastered that he did cop to toking on their front pages .
An Associated Press story initially reported Thursday , " Cereal and snack maker Kellogg Co. says it will not renew its sponsorhip contract with Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps because he has acknowledged smoking marijuana last fall . "
Then a kill notice was later issued by the wire service regarding the story which stated , " Phelps has not acknowledged smoking marijuana or inhaling from a marijuana pipe . "
" Cereal and snack maker Kellogg Co. said it wo n't renew its sponsorship contract with Olympic swimming star Michael Phelps because of a photo that showed him inhaling from a marijuana pipe , " the resurrected AP article now reads .
" The Battle Creek , Mich . - based company said Thursday that Phelps 's behavior  caught on camera and published Sunday in the British tabloid News of the World  is ' not consistent with the image of Kellogg . ' "
Last August Phelps was criticized by nutritionists for signing the Kellogg deal to promote Tony the Tiger 's cereal .
" I would not consider Frosted Flakes the food of an Olympian , " said nutritionist Rebecca Solomon of Mount Sinai Medical Center told the New York Daily News .
" I would rather see him promoting Fiber One .
I would rather see him promoting oatmeal .
I would even rather see him promoting Cheerios . "
A previous RAW STORY article on Phelps received over 2,700 votes on Digg , most probably because it differed from most media accounts and talked about how the photo has united pot smokers .
The AP also reports that " Phelps ' return to competition for the first time since the Beijing Olympics is on hold .
The swimming superstar has been suspended for three months and had his training stipend revoked by USA Swimming . "
" Gold medalist Ryan Lochte , one of Phelps ' teammates and main rivals in Beijing , said : ' It really is kind of harsh , ' " the AP adds .
" ' It 's just a picture . ' "

IN A reversal of Bush - era policy , a US federal judge has ordered that the morning - after pill , Plan B , be made available to 17 - year - old girls without a prescription .
Plan B must be taken within 72 hours of sex – the earlier , the better – but getting a prescription takes time .
So in 2003 scientific advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration recommended making Plan B prescription - free .
The FDA finally did this in 2006 , but only for those over 18 years old .
In the interim , the Center for Reproductive Rights in Washington DC sued the FDA for not following the scientific advice .

MEXICO CITY , Mexico ( CNN ) -- Ciudad Juarez was converted into a fortress as members of President Felipe Calderon 's security cabinet met Wednesday in the border town to devise a strategy to combat narcotraffickers .
Mexican police carry a body after a clash with gangs that left 21 dead in the state of Chihuahua on February 10 .
Ciudad Juarez , across the U.S. border from El Paso , Texas , is one of the most violent cities in Mexico , with the vast majority of the violence tied to drug trafficking .
The secretary of the interior , Fernando Gomez Mont , who attended the meeting , said the city remains under government control and promised greater cooperation between federal and local authorities .
" Not a centimeter of the plaza will be ceded to them , and we are going to expel them from Juarez , " he vowed , referring to the narcotraffickers .
" That is the gist of our promise and in that we put our word . "
But last week , the chief of police was obliged to quit , after threats from organized crime to kill a policeman every day that he remained on the job .
A day later , the mayor was threatened with death .
Leo Zuckerman , a security expert who visited Juarez on Friday , disagreed with Gomez 's view .
" I can assure you that what we are seeing is the loss of control of the state on the society , " he said .
" It is organized crime that is governing Ciudad Juarez ; they had the ability to force out the chief of police . "
Watch how the violence is affecting the United States »
Some opposition legislators and even the mayor have asked Mexican federal authorities for more help .
The violence generated by the war of the drug cartels for control of drug routes translated last year into some 6,000 killings .
More than 1,200 of them occurred in Ciudad Juarez alone .
During the meeting of the security cabinet , soldiers discovered an explosive at the airport , authorities said .

We tend to think of our supermodels as being able to walk , fill out an outfit , and not much else , but Heidi Klum -- otherwise known as the favorite daughter of the North Rhine - Westphalian metropolis , Bergisch Gladbach -- is an honest - to - goodness mogul and renaissance woman , having parlayed her lingerie - wearing ability into careers in acting , producing , designing , singing , and more .
If it were n't for the whole marrying Seal thing , she'd be damn near perfect .
After getting her start in the pages of Sports Illustrated 's swimsuit issue and the Victoria 's Secret catalog , Klum quickly expanded her mass - media grasp , appearing on television shows -- including " Spin City " and " Sex and the City " -- movies such as " Blow Dry " and " Ella Enchanted , " and even the occasional videogame or music video .
What she 's arguably best - known for now , of course , is her involvement in the creation of the Bravo reality series " Project Runway , " which she hosted and judged beginning in 2004 , with an Emmy nomination to show for it .
In addition , she has designed shoes , swimsuits , clothes for adults and infants , and has produced a pair of fragrances , modestly named " Heidi Klum " and " Me . "
Still not impressed ?
Heidi's also a painter and a singer ; her debut single , " Wonderland , " was released in the fall of 2006 , with the proceeds going to a children 's charity in her hometown .
All this , and looks to spare -- if " A Kiss from a Rose " was n't reason enough to hate Seal , here 's one more .

Lily Allen is drinking again , fighting again , and generally just going back to her old ways .
I do n’t know what to do with her .
I used to like her a lot , I used to think she was really funny and cool .
Now I ’m not so sure .
After the Winehouse - esque drunken fights , the repeated public nudity , and the Britney - esque pink wig… I want to believe in her .
Lily Allen was performing for the first time in a while , and she needed some liquid courage to sing her songs .
Interesting sidenote : for her encore , Lily performed a cover of Britney ’s “ Womanizer ” .
Britain ’s The Sun had details , and an exclusive interview with Lily :
Raising a pint of wine to the crowd , Lily Allen giggles : “ I ’ve not had a drink for a while but if you expect me to get on stage and be funny , then I ’ll need this , ” and takes a gulp .
The swarm of fans at the O2 Academy in Oxford explode into cheers and screams .
Lily has been off the booze for a while but she feels now is the right time to slip off the wagon .
And why not ?
Tonight is the second of Lily ’s warm - up shows to perform tracks from her new album .
She says : “ Yep , I am drinking again .
Last night I had my first drink .
There ’s no way I can get on stage without a drink .
I think I ’m funnier when I ’ve had a few .
I did n’t find it difficult to stop drinking , I did n’t even think about it .
I have n’t really needed a drink but now I ’m on tour , it ’s fun drinking sometimes .
But some things have changed .
I ’m not drinking any cheap stuff now – only expensive wine will do this time .
I ’ve gone upmarket . ”
From The Sun
Oh , and the fights .
Lily Allen ’s longest , most protracted battle has been with Perez Hilton .
I do n’t read Perez , but I ’ve read some of the coverage of the spat .
Perez sounds like a nasty piece of work who deserves everything Lily dishes out .
… Blunt and honest , she has had public spats with Cheryl Cole , Katy Perry and celebrity blogger Perez Hilton .
For her second album , Lily wants to be taken seriously .
And she is .
Her first single , “ The Fear ” , is ahead of Lady GaGa in the midweek charts and is heading for No1 .
She says : “ All those rows , it ’s just me sticking up for myself .
With the internet you can fight back .
If someone has written something unjust , wrong or has offended me , or offended a friend , then that ’s it . ”
“ The other day Perez Hilton wrote that I was a lazy ar*e and I should give up on my record .
Today , my single is No1 in the midweeks and I am on tour , working really , really hard .
And his job is sitting at a computer all day .
How can he call me lazy ? ! ”
“ I am working so hard because this album is all I care about .
I ’m so happy with how it ’s worked out and that ’s why I took my time with it .
At first I was a bit scared of what people might think .
Because of how famous I have become , I feel very judged .
But it ’s been great so far .
I ’ve even been in tears about some of the nice things written about this album .
Crying like a baby ! ” “ But I write my music for me and I like it and if other people like it then great . ”
From The Sun
The Sun piece is really long .
If you like Lily Allen , it ’s an interesting read and I would recommend it .
She talks a lot more about her new album and her latest musical influences , a new producer , all of that stuff .
She does seem to have grown up quite a bit the last few years , though I still expect her to act crazy when it suits her .
Even the part of the interview where she talks about Perez is n’t really bad – she ’s just defending herself .
See ?
I do like her after all .
We 've finally found something we want more than an Audi R8 FSI , and it gives us hope that we might one day ride something similar to an Imperial speeder bike .
The Audi Shark concept is 26 - year - old Kazim Doku 's winning entry into a design competition ( .pdf ) co-sponsored by Audi and Milan 's Domus Academy .
And while the Shark may wear the four ring Audi badge , it 's not a car but a hovercraft .
Still , you can see some familiar elements of Walter de'Silva 's signauture style , something Doku told us he tried to emulate when designing the Shark .
" Reflecting Audi 's clean and perfect lines , I designed a super sport automobile , " Doku told Wired.com .
Indeed .
Looking at the Shark , it 's easy to catch glimpses of the R8 , TT and S5 but with an ultra-modern twist .
Doku says the driving position is similar to a motorcycle " but with a car 's security . "
LED lights come straight out of the S5 parts bin , but the rear - hinged glass cockpit and air foils come straight out of the future .
We also appreciate the side view mirrors , a must when gliding over roadways at breakneck speed .
The young Turk ( really - he lives in Izmir , Turkey ) already has won three other prizes for automotive design , which is remarkable considering the dearth of an automotive industry in his home country .
Doku credits his success to a lifelong love of car design and " watching the automotive industry [ and ] carrying the designs to the computer screen . "
His previous prize - winning concepts include the fabric - skinned Peugeot Ustuminki , which was a finalist in the 2007 Peugeot Design Competition , and first prize in Turkey 's Ototrend contest for a no - doored concept called KA - Design .
Although first prize in the Audi design competition was a 70 percent scholarship to the Domus Academy , Doku says he can't afford the balance and has withdrawn his application for the Master 's in Automotive Design program .
That 's a shame , because this Shark has some bite .
Maybe Audi can give him a job .

Commons Speaker Michael Martin has said he regrets that police were allowed to search Tory MP Damian Green 's office with no warrant during a leak inquiry .
He said he regretted a parliamentary aide had allowed the raid - by signing a consent form without consulting him .
The Speaker agreed to a debate on the issue but pressure on him is growing .
Asked if she had confidence in the Speaker , Commons Leader Harriet Harman said : " I am not saying I have got full confidence in anything or anybody . "
In an interview with the BBC's Newsnight programme , Ms Harman said it was her responsibility to support the Speaker and his officials , and to uphold key principles such as protecting the rights of MPs to conduct their business without unwarranted interference .
But asked whether the Speaker had her full confidence , she replied : " I am not saying I have got full confidence in anything or anybody . "
She later denied she had said she had no confidence in Mr Martin , adding " It 's not a question , there is no vote of confidence in the Speaker . "
My responsibility Mr Martin told MPs he knew in advance about the search of Mr Green 's office but was not told that the police did not have a warrant .
He has referred this issue to be investigated by a committee of senior MPs and promised that , in future , a warrant would be required before searches were carried out on Commons property .
" Every case must be referred for my personal decision , as it is my responsibility , " he added .
But one Conservative MP said the Speaker should resign , given that he had " failed in his fundamental duty to protect Parliament " .
" I have no confidence in the Speaker 's willingness or ability to defend Parliament or me as an MP , so that I can defend the interests of my constituents , " Richard Bacon said .
" He has to go .
It is that simple . "
The BBC's Political Editor Nick Robinson said confidence in the Speaker 's authority in the Commons had taken a " very severe knock " .
Conservative home affairs spokesman Dominic Grieve told Newsnight he had " confidence in the Speaker 's good intentions " but described the current situation as a " fiasco " .
But he said the Speaker should be not be forced out , saying the focus should be on " putting right what has been done wrong " and reasserting the rights of Parliament .
Items including computer files were confiscated during raids on all Mr Green 's homes and offices last Thursday .
After the news broke last week that four addresses had been raided , Scotland Yard said it had had warrants for all of them .
You cannot pick and choose whether you support the operational independence of the police
Prime Minister Gordon Brown
Profile : Michael Martin
In quotes : Speaker 's statement Nick Robinson on the day 's events But , shortly before the Speaker 's statement , acting Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson revised the detail , saying just three warrants had been issued , while the Commons search had been " consensual " .
When asked about this , a Scotland Yard spokesman said there had been " no deliberate attempt to mislead " .
A separate police source added that if the official who signed the consent form for the raid - Serjeant at Arms Jill Pay - had not known police could be refused permission to enter , it would be " surprising " .
Mr Green , shadow immigration minister , was arrested and held for nine hours last Thursday as part of a police inquiry into Home Office leaks .
' Bad day for democracy ' Many MPs have expressed outrage , saying that their independence has been compromised .
Raising a point of order after the Speaker 's statement , Mr Green told the Commons it would be a " bad day for democracy in this country " if MPs could not expose information that ministers preferred to keep hidden .
He added : " Those who have the real power in this country - ministers , senior civil servants and the police - are also not beyond the law and beyond scrutiny .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" An MP endangering national security would be a disgrace .
An MP exposing embarrassing facts about Home Office policy which ministers are hiding is doing a job in the public interest . "
Mr Green was held on suspicion of conspiring to commit misconduct in public office and on suspicion of aiding and abetting misconduct in public office .
It has been alleged that , during his police interview , Mr Green was accused of " grooming " his Home Office source , rather than simply receiving leaks .
The MP denies any wrongdoing .
Phone call
In his statement , the Speaker said the Metropolitan Police had told the Serjeant at Arms last Wednesday that they were contemplating arresting an MP but had not given his identity .
Mr Martin said she had told him in the strictest confidence that an MP might be held and charged but no further details had been given .
At 7 am on Thursday , the police called the Serjeant at Arms again , explained the background to the case and named Mr Green .
People want to know whether our democracy , our right to know and our right to expose are safe with this prime minister
David Cameron , Conservative leader
She then informed the Speaker of this and said a search of the MP's Commons office might take place .
Mr Green was arrested that afternoon .
But Mr Martin said : " I was not told that the police did not have a warrant [ for the Commons search ] . "
He added that the police had not explained , as they should have done , that the Serjeant at Arms was not obliged to consent to the search - or that a warrant should have been insisted upon .
" I regret that a consent form was then signed by the Serjeant at Arms without consulting the clerk of the House , " Mr Martin said .
" I must make it clear to the House that I was not asked the question of whether consent should be given or whether a warrant should have been insisted on , " he said .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith , who has said she had no prior knowledge of Mr Green 's arrest , is due to give a full statement on the affair on Thursday .
' No good '
Ms Smith , and Prime Minister Gordon Brown , have said it would be improper for ministers to become involved in police investigations .
In the Commons , Conservative leader David Cameron said : " It 's no good for the prime minister to hide behind ' I was only supporting the independence of the police ' .
" People want to know whether our democracy , our right to know and our right to expose are safe with this prime minister . "
Mr Brown said : " You can not pick and choose whether you support the operational independence of the police .
You either support it or you do not support it . "

Flip the right genetic switches in a chicken embryo and you just might hatch a baby dino .
Paleontologist Jack Horner intends to do it .
He explains his scheme to rewind evolution in a new book , How to Build a Dinosaur : Extinction Does n't Have to Be Forever .
We asked him if there is anything — anything at all — that could possibly go wrong .
Wired : Dinochicken — walk me through the concept .
Jack Horner : Birds are descendants of dinosaurs .
They carry their DNA .
So in its early stages , a chicken embryo will develop dinosaur traits like a long tail , teeth , and three - fingered hands .
If you can find the genes that cancel the tail and fuse the fingers to build a wing — and turn those genes off — you can grow animals with dinosaur characteristics .
Wired :
It 's a romantic idea , that dinosaurs can live on in bird form .
Horner : Dinosaurs are not extinct ; they 're still with us in this sense .
Birds look different , but it 's all cosmetic .
By tweaking some genes , we can bring out the underlying similarities .
Yes , it 's a wild plan , but I like to think about things backwards .
Wired : You were a consultant on Jurassic Park ...
Should we be worried here ?
Horner : Look , it 's not like dinochicken will overrun the world .
If he mates with a chicken , you still get a chicken .
Eventually we might make animals that look more like dinosaurs , but we wo n't have velociraptors on the loose .
Wired : Thorny ethical issues ?
Horner :
If you think we 're playing God , maybe .
But we 're already modifying plants and mice .
I do n't see a lot of people jumping up and down complaining about better tomatoes .
Wired :
Are you getting flak from other researchers ?
Horner : Scientists who play by someone else 's rules do n't have much chance of making discoveries .
Wired :
The initial funding came out of your own pocket .
Is money an issue ?
Horner :
It should n't cost more than a couple million dollars .
That is n't a heck of a lot of money when it comes to big science .
Wired :
What 's the upside ?
What do you hope to gain from this ?
Horner : Ultimately , we hope it can lead to a cure for genetic defects .
Once we understand just how to control genes , we have the potential for spinal cord regeneration , bone regeneration , and so on .
It might also give us plumper chickens .
Wired :
It would certainly prove the creationists dead wrong .
Horner : Religion is about faith , not evidence .
Comparing science and religion is n't like comparing apples and oranges — it 's more like apples and sewing machines .
Wired :
In your book , you envision getting dinochicken a spot on Oprah .
Why ?
Horner :
The creature would be its own sound bite .
It 'll go a long way toward convincing people that we can learn a lot from this sort of experimentation — about biology , development , evolution .
Otherwise we 're just a bunch of wild scientists building monsters in our laboratories .

Video ( 02:32 ) : Watch the Minnesota State Patrol video and judge for yourself on who was wrong or right .
More than a month after Sam Salter wound up in the Ramsey County jail for two nights , the 40 - year - old adjunct college instructor from Hudson , Wis. , is still fuming .
" You feel totally helpless , " he said .
At the end of a New Year 's Eve traffic stop on Interstate 94 in St. Paul , State Patrol Sgt. Carrie Rindal rammed Salter 's 2001 Toyota Sienna van , causing $ 1,500 damage to his vehicle , and arrested him at gunpoint while his three children , ages 2 , 3 and 6 , sat in the van .
His wife had to pick up the kids as he was taken to jail .
Rindal said Salter was attempting to flee .
He said he was merely looking for a safe place to pull over .
The Ramsey County attorney 's office declined to charge Salter after reviewing the evidence , including a video of the stop .
" It was our belief there was insufficient evidence to prove that the suspect was knowingly fleeing police , and that is what he had been arrested for , " said Paul Gustafson , a county attorney spokesman .
In late January , the State Patrol mailed Salter a ticket for making an illegal lane change .
He faces no other charges .
The squad car 's video shows that Rindal first noticed Salter about 11:40 p.m. Dec. 31 .
She said in a report that she had witnessed him weaving within a lane , changing lanes without signaling and going 70 miles per hour in a 55 - mph zone on I - 94 .
She turned on her lights to pull him over , and the video shows what followed : A one - mile pursuit that ended on a side street off I - 94 , where Salter said he had turned to look for a safe place to pull over .
It was never a high - speed chase .
After Rindal rammed Salter 's car -- a police tactic sometimes used for stopping fleeing vehicles -- he stopped abruptly and emerged from the van questioning why she had hit his vehicle .
Rindal emerged from her squad car and , with gun drawn , forced him against the side of his vehicle and arrested him .
Salter registered zero in a preliminary alcohol - breath test .
The incident raised questions among police experts who reviewed it : Should Salter have stopped on the I - 94 shoulder no matter whether he considered it safe ?
And was Rindal right to conclude Salter was fleeing and ram his vehicle ?
What the video shows
The video of the incident captured a lively debate between Rindal and Salter on those very points as he sat handcuffed on the back seat of her squad car .
" I was obviously slowing down and pulling over , " Salter told the officer .
" You hit me when I was next to the curb , so I do n't know where you thought I was going . "
Said Rindal , " When you see red lights and sirens , you do n't keep on driving and driving and driving [ so ] you decide where you are going to stop .
We decide that . "
Mark Robbins , a professor of law enforcement at the University of Minnesota , Mankato , said the video does not indicate Salter was fleeing .
He said the ramming was unnecessary .
" If that was me , I would have cited him for failure to yield to an emergency vehicle and sent him on his way . "
However , former Minneapolis Police Chief Tony Bouza , after hearing details of the case , said Rindal had reason to believe Salter was evading her .
He said she was right to ram him .
" My sympathies are with her , not with him , " he said .
Lt. Mark Peterson of the State Patrol said Rindal would have no comment .
And he said the patrol would not comment on the details of the case while it is conducting its own investigation , which takes place whenever there is a pursuit and an officer uses such a ramming maneuver in a traffic stop .
If Salter has a complaint , he can file one with the State Patrol 's internal affairs division , Peterson said .
An attorney for the state Department of Public Safety would conduct the investigation , he said .
Safety : Salter 's defense Salter , who teaches oral and interpersonal communications at Wisconsin Indianhead Technical College in New Richmond , said he had had two beers during a six - hour period that day and was driving home from a family party , headed east on I - 94 on the east side of St. Paul .
His three children were strapped into the back seats .
Traveling in the left lane , he saw Rindal 's flashing patrol car lights in his rear - view mirror and thought the patrol car was trying to pass .
He moved right one lane , but the patrol car moved behind him , so he concluded she wanted to stop him .
He shifted three lanes to the right to get to the shoulder .
" The shoulder had a big icy snowbank that did not allow me to get all the way off the freeway , " Salter said .
Fearful of getting hit by traffic if he stopped , Salter said he took the U.S. Hwy.
61 exit .
But he did not stop there .
" It 's a real blind corner , " he said , " so I did n't feel comfortable stopping on that .
I am not sure the people behind would have time to react if they were in the right lane . "
Ahead on Hwy. 61 was the Burns Avenue cross street , and Salter signaled right .
He said he was pulling to the side and estimated he was going 5 mph when Rindal used a " pursuit intervention technique , " or P.I.T. maneuver , designed to knock a fleeing vehicle sideways so the driver loses control and stops .
The van traveled a few more feet and stopped .
Salter got out of his van and recalls yelling , " What are you doing ?
I have three kids in the car . "
Rindal pointed her gun at Salter , arrested him , and let him call his wife , Megan Laney , to come get their children .
Salter was taken to jail and booked for fleeing police .
He spent most of the next 37 hours in a jail cell before being released .
Bouza , the ex-chief , said it was proper for Rindal to ram Salter 's van , draw her gun and arrest him for fleeing .
" She was chasing him , " said Bouza .
" He was ignoring her . "
Bouza said it was also right for Rindal to arrest Salter for fleeing after hearing his side .
" Explanations are cheap .
Actions matter , " he said .
But Robbins , a professor who is a former police watch commander , said the report Rindal filed describes actions that do not constitute fleeing based on Minnesota law .
He said there is no indication Salter increased his speed after Rindal turned on her lights and siren , nor did he turn off his headlights or attempt evasive maneuvers .
He was " simply taking more time than I would like to pull over . "

Marcel Allain and Pierre Souvestre : Fantômas ( 1911 )
Few characters from lowbrow popular fiction were greeted with the same enthusiasm by the highbrow avant garde as this French villain : Magritte incorporated the character into his paintings , Robert Desnos wrote a poem about him and James Joyce simply declared the novel " enfantomastic " .
Fantômas spreads terror for sheer pleasure : he slashes old ladies ' throats , stuffs strangled British socialites into trunks , robs Russian princesses in their hotel rooms , pushes witnesses off speeding trains and even rips the skin off their fingers to fake fingerprints .

Eric Ambler : The Mask of Dimitrios ( 1939 )
Ambler has never received the credit he deserves as a pioneer of thrillers for the thinking reader .
The Mask of Dimitrios captured the British population 's dark anxieties about the inevitable drift towards the second world war , on the eve of which it was published .
Generally considered the best of Ambler 's works , it was filmed by Jean Negulesco in 1944 .
Both book and film have an intricate flashback structure , as the novelist Cornelius Leyden reconstructs , piece by piece , the elusive character of the dead Dimitrios Makropoulos — murderer , assassin , spy , drug trafficker — in his murky career from Smyrna to Paris .
His corpse speaks volumes .

Paul Auster : The New York Trilogy ( 1985 - 86 )

Mary E Braddon : Lady Audley 's Secret ( 1862 )
Braddon was one of those indefatigable Victorian women who , plagued by a useless father and needy husband , took to writing to earn a crust .
This , one of the earliest and certainly the most successful of Victorian detective stories , was the sensational bestseller of the age .
Could a woman be evil ?
The truth about the beautiful Lady Audley , the twists and turns of the discovery of murder and the unravelling of family secrets scandalised and obsessed the public .
A brilliant thriller , witty and exciting — Dickens , Tennyson , Thackeray and Robert Louis Stevenson could not put it down .

Peter Carey : True History of the Kelly Gang ( 2000 )
Although Alfred Knopf billed this book as a great American novel ( apparently because Carey lives in New York ) , it is more correctly a great Australian novel .
Being the purported autobiography of Ned Kelly , Australia 's Robin Hood , this Booker winner is full of derring - do — but read it for its voice , which is based , partly , on a real piece of writing by Kelly , the Jerilderie Letter .
Read it for the pungent presence of the Australian landscape ; for its sense of innocence betrayed ; for its humour , for its tenderness ; for its wild , minimally punctuated music .

Carr is the grandaddy of the locked - room mystery , and he took his craft very seriously , creating some of the most ingenious solutions in fiction without lying to the reader .

Later , a man is seen to be shot in the back , at close range , in a deserted street .

Joseph Conrad : Under Western Eyes ( 1911 )
Conrad 's exploration of the morality of revolution bears such close resemblance to Soviet Russia that it 's surprising this book was written six years before 1917 .
The experience of Razumov — who finds himself unwillingly involved in counter - revolutionary espionage after betraying a political assassin — is miserable .
His failure to find absolution after confessing his wrongs is a powerful riposte to Dostoevsky 's Crime and Punishment , and the anger that Conrad poured into the work gave him a nervous breakdown .
Small surprise , then , that this is one of his most forceful , gripping novels .

Fyodor Dostoevsky : Crime and Punishment ( 1866 )
Orphaned by murder , jailed as a revolutionary , reborn into Christianity , Dostoevsky was inevitably preoccupied with violence and justice , as well as the battle between good and evil .
The struggle between Russia 's irreligious radicals and anti-democratic establishment filled him with both fascination and horror .
This novel swills those concerns together into the story of Raskolnikov , an impoverished St Petersburg student stricken by remorse after murdering a pawnbroker .
All the staples of Victorian melodrama are here , from the tart - with - a - heart to the saintly sister and lecherous suitor ; what distinguishes Crime and Punishment is the intensity of the moral conflict .

José Maria de Eça de Queiroz : The Crime of Father Amaro ( 1875 )
Amaro , a young priest in small - town 19th - century Portugal , is having an affair with the teenage daughter of his hostess .
Rather than condemning his actions , the clergy covers up his mistakes .
Eça de Queiroz admired Dickens , and the two writers shared a gift for comic dialogue and a desire to chart society 's ills .
Portugese naturalism , though , can be bleaker stuff than anything Britain produced during the Industrial Revolution : Eça de Queiroz explores a world where the innocent are condemned and the guilty prosper .
In 2002 , Carlos Carrera 's adaptation saw Catholic groups protesting outside cinemas .

Umberto Eco : The Name of the Rose ( 1980 )
The year is 1327 .
Brother William of Baskerville travels to a Benedictine monastery to investigate a mysterious death and finds himself caught in a spate of killings apparently modelled on the Book of Revelation .
William 's rational , deductive response to these events pits him against the monastery 's more traditional elements , who refuse to entertain the possibility that the deaths are the result of anything other than demonic possession , and view any dissent as heresy .
Eco swells a gripping historical whodunnit with discourses on semiotics , faith and truth and a persuasive portrait of 14th - century Italy .

Bret Easton Ellis : American Psycho ( 1991 )
This yuppie slasher - gothic tale enraged feminists even before its publication , when a proof copy was leaked .
Particularly revolting was a scene in which the hero 's former girlfriend has her hands nailed to the floor , her tongue cut out , and is then forced to fellate her tormentor before being killed — all narrated in a cool , Holden Caulfield - like sub-ironic style .
The hero , Patrick Bateman , a young , drugged - up , obsessively stylish Wall Street broker , also axes a gay man he encounters on the street and casually eviscerates the man 's dog .
Or does he ?
The whole novel may be a Hitchcockian fantasy and a satire on 1980s materialism .

• Go to 1000 novels everyone must read : Crime ( part two )
• This article was amended on Sunday 25 January 2009 .
Erskine Childers , author of The Riddle of the Sands , resigned from his post as a clerk in the House of Commons in 1910 to work for Irish independence , not as an MP .
This has been corrected .
According to Forbes :
Momentum grew on Saturday behind a proposed common European bond to help bolster fragile member states during the global economic crisis as the International Monetary Fund threw its weight behind the idea .
At this point in time it is n’t entirely clear who issued this particular “ call ” , but still , we ’re up and running , and this one is gaining traction by the day .
It would be nice to be able to say that all this started on a blog ( see here ) but in fairness Wolfgang Munchau was first off the block with the public call ( followed perhaps by the Italian finance minister ) .
“ We have a big player which is the European Union and there is no reason why it should n’t have its own way of financing and to issue bonds is a good idea , ” IMF Managing - Director Dominique Strauss - Kahn told a news conference in Rome .
“ I really support this initiative , ” he said .
“ It really depends on the European Commission and the EU authorities but I see no reason why the EU can not do this . ”
and of course Italy ’s Giulio Tremonti is still pushing , but then as someone once said , he would would n’t he , since Italy ’s debt to GDP is 105 % and rising .
There were some photos of dirty appartments on Internet lately .
But this one for sure will beat them all .
That was for sure the dirtiest appartment in the world ever .
According to the original Russian story behind those pics , there was an old man living in this flat .
He had a weird passion to collect different garbage whenever he traveled and bring it home .
So as time passed , he got as much garbage that he had to clean up his way thru the flat when he wanted to go from one room to another or to the entrance door .
And then one day the pipe was broke , and he had to call the plumbers .
When the plumbers arrived ( on photos ) they were shocked .
They had to waste hours to take just a part of the garbage out so that to enter the flat with their equipment and the garbage from the flat occupied all the loby and area behind the lobby .
Back in the old business , in a new way

US Rep. Loretta Sanchez ( D - CA ) suggested Thursday that the time may be right for a " pilot program " of marijuana regulation .
The congresswoman 's comments came as she was interviewed live on CNN to discuss a congressional hearing on the prohibition - related violence taking place in Mexico .
Sanchez is chair of the House Homeland Security Committee Subcommittee on Border , Maritime , and Global Counterterrorism .
Loretta Sanchez
Citing a recent Zogby poll commissioned by NORML that found majority support for taxed and regulated marijuana use and sales on the West Coast , Sanchez was responding to her host 's question about the whole notion of drug legalization .
California 's receptiveness toward less restrictive marijuana laws would make it a good place to experiment , she said .
" Well , certainly , I have seen in my own state of California people over and over voting a big majority the whole issue of marijuana and possession of that , " Sanchez said .
" So maybe it would be a good pilot program to see how that regulation of marijuana might happen in California since the populace , the majority of Californians believe maybe that should happen . "
Sanchez compared marijuana prohibition to the prohibition of alcohol in the 1920s .
" Well , certainly there is one drug -- it 's called alcohol -- that we prohibited in the United States and had such a problem with as far as underground economy and cartels of that sort that we ended up actually regulating it and taxing it , " she said .
" And so there has always been this thought that maybe if we do that with drugs , it would lower the profits in it and make some of this go away . "
Sanchez 's comments came two weeks after California state Assemblyman Tom Ammiano ( D - San Francisco ) introduced the first marijuana legalization bill in state history and one week after the Obama administration announced it would no longer persecute medical marijuana providers in the state .
With staunch Republican anti-prohibitionist Rep. Ron Paul and liberal Democrat and federal decriminalization bill author Rep. Barney Frank as possible strange bedfellow allies , the question now becomes :
Is it time for a marijuana legalization caucus in the House of Representatives ?
A man who robbed a convenience store with a knife is being praised for his integrity after he gave back ¥ 5,000 , having asked for ¥ 10,000 and received instead ¥ 15,000 .
The robber ( 20 ) entered the store and menaced the man at the counter with a knife , demanding ¥ 5,000 .
The luckless store employee complied , handing over a ¥ 5,000 note .
Deciding that this was not enough , the robber then demanded an additional ¥ 5,000 .
This time , the employee handed over a ¥ 10,000 note , leaving the robber with ¥ 15,000 .
This being more than he demanded , the robber politely returned ¥ 5,000 , and then made good his escape .
As he had been filmed by security cameras the whole time and had only one hour before asked directions of a nearby police officer , he was soon tracked down and charged with robbery .
He admits the charge , saying simply “ I wanted money . ”
Police are candid : “ For only ¥ 10,000 , what an idiot . ”
He has been called an “ honest thief ” , but police are none too kind in response : “ It ’s theft so there ’s no way it ’s honest .
He was a queer one alright .
And he was a right fool for getting caught like this . ”

Walt Disney is going green .
Fantasy world ?
You might think so , what with headlines declaring " Disney no Dumbo when it comes to the environment " and sober - minded business journalists reporting their ambitions to be " as green as Jiminy Cricket " .
Anyhow , the company with an unerring ability to persuade people to cross oceans to visit its theme park is now taking the well - worn path to corporate environmentalism .
Its journey is being charted by Conservation International , one of the world 's largest and most business - friendly environmental organisations .
Last week , Disney put out a new corporate sustainability report declaring its intention to reduce water use , cut waste , protect nature , head for zero - carbon emissions at its offices and parks and try to buy green electricity in future .
Some eye - catching features include the train at Disneyland in California , which now runs on biodiesel made with used cooking oil from the resort 's restaurants .
In case anyone thought this do - goodery would damage the bottom line , CEO Robert Iger promised that the wider purpose was to " make our brands and products more attractive , strengthen our bonds with consumers , make the company a more desirable place to work , and build goodwill in the communities we operate .
All of this contributes to shareholder value . "
I am not cynical about such motives .
Climate change will only be solved when corporations like Disney see that cutting emissions is good for the bottom line .
My problem is that Disney 's business model is unchanged .
It remains tied to global promotion of trips to its resorts – just about the most environmentally damaging leisure activity you can imagine .
Disney 's announcement says action on climate change is " urgent " and requires " fundamental changes in the way society , including businesses , use natural resources , and Disney is no exception . "
Disney are greening some of their activities , but they are not greening their business model .
This is greenwash .
Let me admit that I have never felt the slightest desire to cross the Atlantic to go and see Mickey Mouse , Donald Duck or any of Walt Disney 's colourful characters .
( I was always a Popeye man myself . )
But many people have been persuaded that they are .
Of the 23 million people who visit Disney 's Florida parks , around four million are non-Americans , mostly from Europe .
Around 1.2 million Brits alone visit Florida on holiday each year , the great majority go to Disney .
According to the carbon offsetting company Climate Care , the emissions for one person flying from London to Orlando are 1.96 tonnes of carbon dioxide .
Multiply that by a million and we are at more or less 2 m tonnes of CO2 for British visitors and up to 8 m tonnes for Europeans .
So that 's about the same as the annual emissions of the 83 million people of Ethiopia – just to get Europeans to a Disney dream holiday .
Many Americans also fly to Disney .
Sadly , Disney does not calculate the emissions from people visiting its operations , so this is a guess .
But I 'd say that in all it could reach 15 m tonnes .
Disney 's other large parks must have big carbon footprints , too .
Ten of the world 's top 25 theme parks bear the Disney name , including all of the top eight , with 104 million visitors a year , according to the Parkworld web site .
Disneyland in California attracts 15 million visitors a year , and its two theme parks in Tokyo a combined total of 26 million .
Paris Disneyland takes more than 12 million , including two million Brits , probably half of whom fly .
A typical flight from the UK ( say , Birmingham ) to Paris emits 0.13 tonnes of CO2 .
A lot better than crossing the Atlantic , but still 130,000 tonnes for a million people .
You might say this is nothing to do with Disney .
It can not be held responsible for whether and how people visit its hugely popular resorts .
But the trouble is that Disney more or less invented the idea of marketing theme parks as international attractions – seducing kids and parents alike into the frankly nonsensical notion that you might travel halfway round the world to shake hands with Mickey Mouse and ride a rollercoaster or two .
As a symbol of unsustainability , it takes some beating .
• How many more green scams , cons and generous slices of wishful thinking are out there ?

JERUSALEM ( CNN ) -- Benjamin Netanyahu , the head of the conservative Likud Party , has been chosen to form Israel 's next government , Israeli President Shimon Peres announced Friday .
Netanyahu ( left ) shakes hands with Peres , who has asked him to form the next Israeli government .
more photos »
At a joint news conference with Peres , Netanyahu said he accepted the task and he is willing to work with the moderate parties of Labor , led by Ehud Barak , and Kadima , headed by Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni .
" We have different approaches in different areas , but we are all together in our desire to act for the good of the state , " Netanyahu said .
" We will be able to find the common ground to lead the state toward security , prosperity and peace . "
He said Israeli leaders need to unite as the country faces " great challenges , " particularly from Iran , which he said " is developing nuclear weapons and poses the biggest threat to Israel since the war of independence . "
A U.N. report released this week found that Iran has enough uranium for a single nuclear weapon , but the uranium has not been enriched to make it weapons - grade .
Iran consistently has denied the weapons allegations , calling them " baseless , " and said that data that indicated otherwise was " fabricated . "
To become Israel 's next prime minister , Netanyahu must form a coalition within six weeks , or the process will start all over .
The decision comes after Avigdor Lieberman , head of the right - wing Yisrael Beytenu party , said he would recommend Netanyahu for the post , but only if he promises to form a " broad - based " coalition government .
In last week 's parliamentary elections , no single party won the minimum 61 seats needed to form a government .
That means a government of two or more parties -- or coalition government -- is inevitable .
Watch election analysis from CNN's Bill Schneider »
The ruling Kadima Party won the most seats in the Knesset , Israel 's parliament .
But Kadima received just one more seat than Netanyahu 's Likud Party .
The strong showing of other right - wing parties -- including Yisrael Beytenu and the Orthodox Shas movement -- could give Netanyahu a better chance of forming a coalition government .
Speaking to fellow Likud members Monday , Netanyahu expressed confidence that he has enough support to emerge as Israel 's next prime minister .
" I plan to form a government as soon as possible with our natural partners , " the former Israeli prime minister said .
" We have a government in our hands , but we want a broader one . "
He added that he will negotiate with other parties , including Kadima , " to form a broad national unity government . "
Livni took over as Kadima leader after Prime Minister Ehud Olmert stepped down from the post amid corruption investigations .
Livni's failure to assemble a ruling coalition at that time triggered last week 's elections .
Netanyahu , 59 , is a former Israeli soldier who served in the elite commando unit Sayeret Matkal .
He was one of a dozen Israeli commandos who stormed a Belgian aircraft hijacked by Palestinian terrorists in 1972 and helped rescue 140 hostages .
After his stint as prime minister from 1996 to 1999 , he served in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon , then Likud Party leader , but resigned in 2005 , saying he disagreed with Sharon 's plan to remove Israeli troops and settlements from Gaza .
Sharon left Likud and formed Kadima as a more centrist party .
Netanyahu has supported the expansion of Israeli settlements on the West Bank and has opposed making further territorial concessions in hope of ending the decades - old Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
He has been reminding the public that he warned that Palestinian militants in Gaza could launch rockets at Israeli cities such as Ashkelon and Ashdod -- which has happened and led to Israel 's recent military operation in Gaza .
His Likud Party had a strong showing in last week 's election , more than doubling the number of seats it holds in the Knesset .
Netanhayu said that showing proves that voters have rejected Kadima 's leadership , and he predicted right - leaning parties will be able to form a majority .
" With God 's help , I shall head the coming government , " he said .
" I am sure that I can manage to put together a good , broad - based and stable government that will be able to deal with the security crisis and the economic crisis . "
CNN 's Michal Zippori contributed to this report .

The moment a diver grappled with a 12ft tiger shark to save a friend
Plunging a knife in again and again , diver Craig Clasen grapples with a 12ft tiger shark to protect a friend .
For two hours he wrestled with the giant , spearing it seven times , even drowning the beast before eventually finishing it off with a knife .
Mr Clasen was hunting yellow fin tuna with fellow fisherman Cameron Kirkconnell , photographer D.J Struntz and film maker Ryan McInnis in the Gulf of Mexico when the encounter took place .
Scroll down for more
Free diver Craig Clasen was forced to fight head - on with a 12 - foot tiger shark when the predator turned on his friend during a spearfishing trip
The group were about to leave the deep waters south of the Mississippi River 's mouth , when Mr McInnis found himself alone in the company of a tiger shark .
With no time to lose , Mr Clasen grabbed his speargun and swam to his stranded friend , who was being circled by the giant predator .
' I positioned myself between Ryan and the shark and I tried to watch it for a second , hoping it would pass us by , ' explained 32 - year - old Mr Clasen .
' I noticed that the shark was getting tighter and tighter and just kept trying to get a back angle on us and behaving in an aggressive manner .
' The shark made a roll and looked like it was going to charge us so I just went ahead and took the conservative route and put a shaft through its gills .
' Cameron and I have been around sharks for years and we all have a lot of experience with them but this encounter had a different feel to it .
' Down in my core I really felt the shark was there to feed .
I did n't want it to come to that .'
Mr Clasen spent nearly two hours wrestling with the giant 12ft shark , spearing it seven times and even attempting to drown the beast before eventually finishing it off with a long blade knife .
The experienced spearfisherman spent nearly two hours wrestling with the shark , spearing it seven times
' Once I shot it in the gills I felt a moral obligation to finish the job , ' says Mr Clasen .
' I did n't want it to go on any longer than it had to .
I shot the fish like I would do any other fish and worked it up closer and did my best to kill it as humanely as possible .
' I speared it in the gills which I knew would kill it and from that I tried to put a shaft into its brain as quickly as possible .
' I shot it six times in the head with a spear and I was n't having much luck - it was a slow drawn out process .
' Sharks are so resilient and so tough from millions of years of evolution they are just survivors .
' The best way and quickest way to finish the job and kill the shark and recover it was to get a rope around its tail , drag it from the back of the boat and attempt to drown it .
' In the end we had put a knife its skull once I got lose enough to it and use a long blade knife even after trying to drown it . '
Mr Clasen , who usually sees 50 - 100 sharks on such dives , said that such an attack was rare
Mr Clasen has been free diving and fishing since an early age .
Hailing from Mississippi , he was brought up in a fishing family , and is an expert in all fishing disciplines .
Despite his experience , Mr Clasen took no pleasure in disposing of the giant shark .
' This was one of the most remorseful moments I have ever had in all of my years in hunting , gathering and fishing , ' explains Mr Clasen .
' Personally I never shoot anything or kill anything that I am not going to eat .
' We saved the tail and the head , cut a giant chunk out of it and ate a piece .
' I was n't there to hunt the shark , it was a defensive move for me and I would do it again .
Unfortunately it had to be done and its not something I was proud of .
It was a situation that presented itself to us .
This was one of those rare instances where we had to protect ourselves .
' I have so much respect for sharks in general .
With the amount of time that we spend out there we are exposed to so many potential risks . '
The divers had been hunting with spear guns for yellow fin tuna when the tiger shark attacked
Spearfishing is a form of fishing that has been popular throughout the world for centuries .
Considered to be the most selective way of fishing , the amount of fish taken by spearfishermen accounts for just 0.1 per cent of fishing globally .
Today spearfishermen use effective elastic - or pneumatic - powered spearguns and slings to strike the hunted fish using free - diving , snorkelling or scuba - diving techniques .
Regarded by many as two of the world 's best free diving spearfishermen , Mr Clasen and Cameron Kirkconnell have come into contact with thousands of sharks .
Watching from the boat , Mr Kirkconnell is sure Mr Clasen the right decision .
' We had been in the water all day and had caught lots of tuna , ' he explained .
' But every dive we do is a shark dive and at certain times of the year , especially in Louisiana , we expect to see between 50 - 100 sharks from 7 - 12 ft .
' This encounter was so rare though .
This shark might have been part of a feeding frenzy and still fired up and thought this was an easy kill .
' Tiger sharks have no problem eating whole sea turtles , 150 lb tuna and even dolphins .
It was n't a split second decision on a whim , Mr Clasen has had hundreds of hours of experience .

Oetzi's discoverer went missing while hiking in the mountains
A hunter found his remains in a stream just as rescuers were planning to suspend their search eight days after he went missing while on a hike .
The body of the 67 - year - old was found on a peak called Gaiskarkogel , near a resort town south of Salzburg , Austria .
Simon and his wife Erika found the mummy of the prehistoric man in 1991 .
Rescuers said Simon was probably hiking along an unmarked path when he plunged 100 m to his death .
He is believed to have died instantly .
The 5,300 - year - old mummy known as Oetzi , which is the star attraction at the museum in Bolzano , northern Italy , draws some 300,000 visitors each year .
But when the Simons found it , they initially thought they had discovered a mountaineer who had had an accident .
In recent years , the couple had been embroiled in a row with the northern Italian authorities over whether they should be considered the official finders of the mummy .
They won this battle in 2003 , but a new row then developed over what sum of money the finders should be paid for the discovery .
Barney Frank : Retention bonuses are ' extortion ' and ' bribes ' David Edwards and Rachel Oswald

Though retention bonuses are a long - standing business practice on Wall Street , the AIG scandal has turned new attention to them , with some , including Rep. Barney Frank , going so far as to call them a form of extortion .
Speaking on CBSs Face the Nation on Sunday , Frank ( D - MA ) , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , said of the executives receiving bonuses ,  If you look at their actual performance , I think there was an element frankly with some of almost extortion , where they said we know what all you need to know and well quit if you dont bribe us . 
He added later ,  It is people saying  Ive got the combination to the safe and if you dont bribe me , I m going to leave and youll never be able to open the safe ,  Frank said .
Frank told CBS  Harry Smith that he was urging the executive branch to assert the rights of the federal government as the primary shareholder of the company to sue AIG .
 I think one of the things we should be doing is suing as a shareholder , saying look these are people who were paid bonuses that they werent entitled to ,  Frank said .
Kenneth Lewis , CEO of Bank America , has been quoted objecting to the clampdown on executive bonuses as having  the potential to damage the ability of the government to engineer a financial recovery . 
Said Smith of the outlook by Lewis and others ,  Folks in this world say  the people inside that are getting these bonuses are the only people who can entangle this mess .
But Frank objected to this claim , saying ,  I think it is wrong and lets point out what a lot of talented people have lost their jobs in this financial crisis .
It s not that they wouldnt be able to hire good people to do this , so I really resent the extortion element of this .
That s one of the things we have to deal with , not only with AIG , but going forward to restrict that . 
Anger over the retention bonus is spreading throughout the country in the wake of the AIG bonus scandal .
 It 's basically a bribe , so your employees do n't bolt and take their clients with them , " said Chuck Collins , a senior scholar at the Institute for Policy Studies and an executive compensation expert , in an interview with The Salt Lake Tribune .
"
It 's part of this Marie Antoinette syndrome of Wall Street .
They 're completely in a bubble , and they do n't understand how these payments are perceived . "
Reported The Tribune ,  In a December survey of 264 companies across a variety of industries , business consultant Watson Wyatt Worldwide found that 9 percent of companies had added , or expected to add , a special retention bonus .
An additional 21 percent were considering doing so .
Morgan Stanley , which has received $ 10 billion in bailout funds , has plans to pay up to $ 3 billion in retention bonuses to 6,500 brokers , according to The Tribune .
Frank said that while he voted for the bill that overwhelmingly passed the House on Thursday and would tax by 90 percent some of the executive bonuses , he was not a major advocate of it . 
Also speaking on Face the Nation , Sen. Chuck Grassley ( R - IO ) said he believed Congress  best leverage to deal with the bonuses was through new taxes .
He said he hoped that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid would be putting the Houses bill on the docket for Senate consideration on Monday .
 We ought to hear some apology [ from the AIG executives ] ,  Grassley said .
 We ought to hear remorse .
We ought to hear contrition .
I havent heard any of that , not only with AIG , but any corporation that s got bailed out . 

Although Intel ’s wildly popular Atom processor was originally conceived for mobile Internet devices with an eye toward eventually trickling into smartphones , it quickly caught on with netbooks and has since carved out a sizable chunk of the mobile landscape .
The concept of cheap , fast - enough computing soon migrated from portables to the desktop , where it spawned a new class of delightfully small nettop systems .
With Atom now available with two physical cores and an economic downturn causing many to tighten their budgets , the nettop looks to have a promising future , especially in cheap , media - centric PCs .
was originally conceived for mobile Internet devices with an eye toward eventually trickling into smartphones , it quickly caught on with netbooks and has since carved out a sizable chunk of the mobile landscape .
The concept of cheap , fast - enough computing soon migrated from portables to the desktop , where it spawned a new class of delightfully small nettop systems .
With Atom now available with two physical cores and an economic downturn causing many to tighten their budgets , the nettop looks to have a promising future , especially in cheap , media - centric PCs .
Except for one problem : while the Atom has just enough horsepower to deal with common , everyday tasks , the platform it ’s available on is an outdated throwback .
Intel pairs
Atom with its 945G - series chipsets , which first saw life way back in 2005 .
The 945 series is n’t horribly lacking in the peripherals department , and its performance is acceptable given the Atom ’s modest aspirations on that front .
But the chipset ’s Graphics Media Accelerator 950 is several generations behind the curve .
The GMA 950 ’s game compatibility is flaky , and its performance dismal .
Even worse , it ’s unable to accelerate high - definition video playback .
That might not be the sort of thing you need in a netbook with a limited 1024×600 display resolution , but a desktop or home theater PC plugged into a real monitor or high - definition TV is an entirely different story .
The Atom ’s antiquated chipset is clearly limiting the processor ’s appeal for some devices , but help has arrived from Nvidia in the form of the Ion reference design .
More a new application than fresh silicon , the Ion platform pairs the Atom with the very same GeForce 9400 integrated graphics chipset you ’ll find on motherboards designed for Core 2 processors except instead of arriving on a Micro ATX or Mini-ITX form factor , the Ion reference platform is about the size of a deck of cards .
On its specifications alone , the Ion platform looks to be capable of significantly broadening the Atom ’s horizons .
But there are limitations to what this graphics and core logic package can do given the processor ’s inherent limitations .
Read on to see how Nvidia ’s first Ion design pans out in the real world .
Atom gets a brand new ride
If you are n’t already familiar with Nvidia ’s GeForce 9400 chipset , I suggest looking over our detailed review of the GeForce 9300 .
The 9300 was launched last fall on motherboards with LGA775 sockets , and it ’s essentially the same chip that you ’ll find in the Ion platform .
In fact , the GeForce 9400 really is the platform .
To understand the Ion reference design , then , we must first explore its GeForce .
As far as motherboard GPUs go , the GeForce 9400 is Nvidia ’s newest and its best .
On the desktop , where it runs with Core 2 processors , the 9400 easily trounces Intel ’s latest G45 Express integrated graphics chipset .
With an Atom onboard , however , the GeForce only has to compete with the lowly 945G chipset series designs whose roots are four years old .
In the world of over - used tech site car metaphors , that ’s like lining up the latest BMW 1 - series against a four - year - old Toyota Echo .
Not that we ’d stoop to such lazy and repetitive clichés .
As its name implies , the GeForce ’s integrated graphics core really is the star of the chipset .
This is an honest - to - goodness GeForce 9 - series GPU , complete with full support for DirectX 10 , Shader Model 4.0 , and of course , the slow trickle of CUDA - aware applications that leverage GPU power for general - purpose processing .
The GeForce 9400 has 16 shader CUDA processors running at 1.1GHz , and they ’re paired with four ROPs and a 450MHz graphics core .
Those clock speeds are comparable to those of the GeForce 9300 for LGA775 processors , which also runs its core at 450MHz but clocks its shaders at 1.2GHz .
Do n’t ask me why a lower shader clock earns the Ion platform ’s GeForce an extra hundred points .
On the desktop , the GeForce 9300 does n’t have the grunt to match the performance of even a $ 50 discrete graphics card , so it ’s not the best gaming value around .
But Intel does n’t let its partners build Atom platforms with PCI Express x16 slots , so discrete graphics upgrades are out of the question .
That pits the GeForce 9400 solely against the antiquated GMA 950 .
And , as we ’ve noted , the GMA 950 cannot accelerate high - definition video decoding .
The Atom does n’t have the horsepower to handle HD decoding on its own , not even with a second core .
However , the GeForce 9400 is equipped with a PureVideo HD decode engine that offloads large portions of the decode process for H.264 , MPEG2 , and VC - 1 content .
PureVideo
HD leaves the number crunching associated with copy protection up to the CPU , but Nvidia claims the Atom is up to the task and that even a single - core Ion system should be able to play back Blu-ray movies smoothly .
Blu-ray playback may have limited utility for netbooks that typically do n’t come with optical drives or run enough pixels to display even 720 p content at full resolution , but it ’s a must - have feature for a modern home theater PC .
So is support for HDMI output , which the GeForce 9400 provides alongside VGA , DVI , and even Display Port video outs .
And for those of you with fancy home theater receivers , the 9400 is also capable of passing multi-channel , uncompressed LPCM audio over HDMI .
The GeForce 9400 ’s gravy train of goodness does n’t end at graphics , either .
As one might expect from Nvidia ’s most recent motherboard GPU , the 9400 also has all the trappings of a cutting - edge core logic chipset .
Take the memory controller , for example ; it ’s a dual - channel design that works with either DDR2 or DDR3 memory .
The Atom is hardly hungry for memory bandwidth , but Nvidia still has n’t held back any of the chipset ’s capabilities .
That ’s why you ’ll find a whopping 20 second - generation PCI Express lanes lurking under the hood .
Perhaps more important than its ability to hook into PCI Express graphics cards and peripherals is the GeForce 9400 ’s generous array of integrated peripherals .
The chipset serves up six Serial ATA RAID ports , 12 USB ports , and even a Gigabit Ethernet port .
That ’s probably more ports than most folks are going to need in a netbook or pint - sized desktop , but it certainly gives system designers plenty of options .
At they wo n’t have to farm out Gigabit Ethernet to a third - party peripheral chip .
Of course , the GeForce 9400 itself is not a small chip .
You could fit several Atom cores within the confines of its die area .
However , it ’s not as power - hungry as one might expect .
Nvidia says the 9400 ’s idle power consumption is just three wattsonly one more than the 945GM / ICH7 chipset combo found in most Atom - based systems .
The Ion reference platform
While it does n’t take a great leap of imagination to picture what the GeForce 9400 might look like in an Atom - based system , Nvidia has come up with an Ion reference platform that demonstrates the concept .
Behold :
Although not an actual or even proposed retail product , the Ion demo box makes the most of what the platform has to offer .
The system is enclosed in a small , metal box measuring 5.6 ″ wide , 4.3 ″ deep , and 1.5 ″ tall ( 142 x 110 x 39 mm ) .
So yeah , it ’s tiny .
And the remarkable thing is that most of the space is taken up by an expansion port array generous enough to make some desktop motherboards jealous .
At one end of the Ion reference box are six USB ports , dual eSATA ports , six analog audio jacks , and a TOS - Link S / PDIF audio output .
The case ’s venting is n’t that extensive , either , suggesting that the GeForce 9400 does n’t require aggressive cooling even in such a small form factor .
Around the other side of the box are VGA , DVI , and HDMI video outputs alongside single Ethernet and USB ports .
Here we also find the power plug , which hooks up to the same sort of diminutive AC adapter you ’ll find shipping with most Atom - based systems .
Flipping the Ion box over provides access to a 2.5 ″ hard drive bay .
Removing the hard drive also lets you get at the system ’s single DDR3 SO - DIMM slot .
Despite the chipset ’s support for dual memory channels , Nvidia stuck with a single channel for this reference platform .
There ’s nothing stopping system designers from pairing the GeForce 9400 with dual banks of memory , though .
Lifting the Ion platform ’s skirt reveals not one , but two motherboards lurking beneath its stark white exterior .
From here , we also get a good look at the system ’s sole cooling element a largish heatsink cooled by a tiny and very quiet fan .
Given the Atom ’s modest power draw and the fact that we ’ve already seen the GeForce 9400 deployed with only passive cooling on desktop motherboards , I suspect it would n’t be difficult to build an Ion - based system that relies entirely on passive cooling , especially if the case were used to provide additional surface area .
With the excess stripped away , we get a better look at the Ion system ’s two component parts : the Ion motherboard and its I /O daughterboard .
The Ion board measures a scant 2.95 ″ x 3.93 ″ ( 75 mm x 100 mm ) , which is about the footprint of a deck of cards and not - so - coincidentally also the measurements of the Pico - ITX form factor .
This board houses a dual - core Atom 330 processor running at 1.6GHz , a GeForce 9400 motherboard GPU , and a limited port payload that includes USB , SATA , DVI , HDMI , and Ethernet jacks all the essentials .
For those who hunger for more connectivity , the I/O daughterboard fills out the rest of the port cluster and includes a Realtek audio codec to handle analog output not piped through HDMI .
Turning the Ion stack on its head gives us a good look at the bottom of this mother / daughter duo .
There is n’t much to see here apart from the SO - DIMM slot mounted under the motherboard .
The underside of the motherboard also plays host to another small PCB that houses a VGA output .
The RAMDAC for this analog video output is actually located on the Ion motherboard , but there apparently was n’t room for the port itself .
Life on Ion Even with only a single core , the Atom is largely fast enough for basic everyday tasks like word processing , web browsing , instant messaging , and the like .
However , video playback is challenging and 3D games are a complete write - off .
The Ion platform should have a big impact on both fronts , but is it enough to really expand the Atom ’s capabilities ?
We ’ll start with video playback , where the GeForce 9400 ’s video decode engine should make up for the Atom ’s lack of processing horsepower .
Since most Atom - based netbooks and even nettops only come with single - core processors , we disabled one of the Ion platform ’s cores for these tests .
First , the easy stuff .
Even standard - definition content pegs my Atom - based Eee PC ’s processor utilization above 60 % , but on the Ion rig , the very same clip pegs the CPU at about 30 % .
Although I ’ve yet to encounter a video that did n’t play back smoothly on my Eee PC , I have heard that some SD clips are too demanding for an Atom at stock speeds .
Those videos should n’t be a problem for the Ion platform .
Of course , the real challenge with video these days is decoding high - definition content .
An Ion - based system needs to be able to play back HD video smoothly , including Blu-ray discs , with little fuss if it ’s to be suitable for pint - sized home theater PCs .
And it can , for the most part .
We tested HD and Blu-ray playback with PowerDVD running at 1920 ×1080 over HDMI , and we found that most content played back smoothly with between 25 and 80 % CPU utilization on our simulated single - core Atom .
The 1080 p trailer for The Dark Knight was buttery smooth , as were high - bitrate Blu-ray titles 28 Days Later and Click .
These two movies did consume more CPU cycles than the Batman trailer , but that ’s to be expected given the additional processing necessary to handle Blu-ray DRM , which is n’t crunched by the PureVideo decode engine .
28 Days Later and Click are encoded with H.264 and MPEG2 codecs , respectively , so what about Blu-ray ’s third format , VC - 1 ?
We use Nature ’s Journey to test VC - 1 performance , and on the Ion platform , playback was surprisingly choppy , pegging our single - core Atom config ’s CPU utilization at 100 % .
Nvidia says it optimized PureVideo HD for 1080 p content , and that Nature ’s Journey playback is choppy because it ’s actually a 1080i moviea format the company claims is a shrinking niche .
According to Nvidia , the problem here is n’t processing horsepower , but memory bandwidth .
A dual - channel Ion setup , the company says , should play back Nature ’s Journey smoothly .
We ’ve seen Nature ’s Journey exhibit comparatively higher CPU utilization than other Blu-ray movies on a Core 2 - equipeed GeForce 9300 system , so the title clearly presents a considerable challenge .
Enabling the Ion rig ’s second Atom core did lower CPU utilization considerably , and while playback was smoother , it was n’t as silky as the other movies .
Gaming is another area where the Ion platform ’s GeForce graphics can vault it ahead of Intel ’s GMA competition , but here our expectations were measured from the beginning .
We recently reviewed an Atom - based netbook from Asus that sports a discrete GeForce 9300 M graphics processor that ’s quite similar to the GeForce 9400 , and we found that the system ’s processor was largely the limiting factor when it came to games .
The Ion platform , as it turns out , is no different .
Nvidia is quick to point out that the GeForce 9400 was n’t designed for hard - core gamers , which of course makes sense .
But I would consider myself more of a casual gamer these days , and I still want to be able to play relatively recent titles .
Half - Life 2 , Quake Wars , and Call of Duty 4 are hardly new games , but none ran acceptably with the Ion platform configured with a single - core Atom CPU .
I had to drop down to low resolutions and in - game detail settings just to get the games to run smoothly , and they did n’t for long .
Half - Life 2 and Call of Duty in particular would oscillate between smoothness and stutter depending on how much was going on in a given scene .
Quake Wars , on the other hand , was pretty choppy throughout .
Switching our Atom over to dual - core mode smoothed out Call of Duty just enough for the game to be playable , but it did n’t improve performance in Half - Life 2 or Quake Wars to the point where I ’d consider either tolerable .
Now before anyone chimes in that those games are far too hard - core for mainstream audiences , keep in mind that Fallout 3 , Left 4 Dead , Call of Duty : World at War , and all sorts of World of Warcraft derivatives filled out much of the best - selling PC games list last week .
Spore and The Sims also made the list , and those will likely run better on an Ion box than your average first - person shooter .
The problem is that those games will also run much better on a full - blown PC with a proper processor .
I suppose we should keep in mind that the GeForce 9400 only has to go up against a GMA 950 that wo n’t even load most of the aforementioned games .
In that respect , the Ion platform is far and away the most competent gaming solution available for the Atom processor .
You ’ll just have to dig through the bargain bin for years - old titles or stick with simple games that do n’t demand too much from the CPU .
There ’s only so much the Ion platform can do to make up for an over - matched Atom processor in games , but its GeForce graphics chip can shoulder some of the load associated with more general - purpose computing tasks through CUDA and OpenCL .
Apps that make use of the GPU for general - purpose computing are few and far between at the moment , but given the Atom ’s relative weakness , there ’s more room for improvement than you ’ll find on a standard desktop PC .
Do n’t expect miracles , though .
While the GeForce ’s CUDA processors can currently accelerate Folding@home , a few Photoshop features , and some video encoding tasks , they do n’t turn the Ion platform into a high - performance system .
As much as I love being able to grow facial hair and how my new work attire involves flip - flops , I would go back to cubicle world in a second if it meant I was selling paper products at Dunder Mifflin .
Unfortunately , Jenn is more of a McDreamy girl then crazy for Dwight Schrute .
She apparently thinks PowerPoint is awesome and hates beets .
On Thursday nights , this puts us in quite a predicament as the power of the remote hangs in the balance .
The way we work this out is through a thumb - wrestling match where the loser gets relegated to the bedroom while the other relaxes in the living room to watch their show on the big screen .
Tonight I won the battle so I begin to settle in to enjoy a new episode of The Office .
While trying to come up with a catchy Facebook status , I get this strange feeling that I am not alone anymore .
I can hear the gentle chainsaw snoring of Maddie and the rustling of Paige in her bed so I know it is not the girls .
The likelihood of Jenn being awake is slim , but even if she is , Grey ’s is a 2 Hour Event Spectacular so she is n’t budging .
This exhausts all my options so I begin to freak out a bit .
My Macbook almost gets chucked in self defense when I realize not one , but four individuals are in the living room : a 500 pound gorilla , an elephant , blind man and an Emperor in his new clothes .
Judging by their disapproving gaze , they do not appear to be a happy bunch .
All at once they begin to lay in on me .
It must have been 4 ½ years of pent up frustration because each one informs me this is how long they ’ve been hanging out waiting for me to acknowledge their presence .
The 500 - pound gorilla starts swinging his arms and blurts out , “ Call me curious , but how did you not notice us after all of this time ?
Do you want to know what drives me absolutely bananas ?
After a long day where you barely saw each other , Jenn and you are glued to the television screen in different rooms . ”
The Elephant in the room raises his trunk and says , “ Listen Dumbo !
When was the last time you two spent a night just talking about something other than the girls ?
Your lack of conversation is just plain nuts ! ”
The blind man shakes his cane in my direction and shouts , “ If I can see you ’ve put the kids above your relationship with Jenn , you know you are trouble .
It ’s crystal clear to me that you have some work to do . ”
The Emperor in his new clothes says , “ Let ’s strip away the façade and be transparent .
You miss Jenn . ”
Knowing what they are saying is true I get defensive and blurt out , “ First off Emperor if anyone is not in touch with reality it is you .
You do realize you do not have any clothes on , right ?
And for goodness sake put a towel down or something if you are going to sit on my couch . ”
After showing them the door , I sit back down to deal with what they just said .
I miss more than Jenn .
I miss us .
While we were dating we could spend hours upon hours talking .
This continued through our engagement and first few years of marriage .
However , something changed when we added mommy and daddy to our titles of husband and wife .
Now , from the moment the kids coming running into our room at the crack of dawn until the time they try to squeeze one more bedtime story out of us , the kids are our main focus .
If we are fortunate enough to find a few fleeting seconds of our own , it is spent cleaning the mass chaos Maddie and Paige created .
There always seems to be laundry , diapers , spills and dirty dishes demanding our attention .
The girls normally wave the white flag in surrender around 8 pm , which means we only have an hour or two until Jenn is out for good .
If we are not doing chores , we can be found in a zombie like trance in front of the television or trying to get to .500 on Facebook Wrestler ( okay , this is more my problem then Jenn ’s ) .
There are other times when complete exhaustion wins out and we head straight to bed .
Regardless , neither of these options lends themselves too much conversation .
On the random occurrences when we take out a loan to go out on a date , our conversation normally centers on potty training , discipline issues or temper tantrums either from the girls or something work related .
The times we actually “ talk ” are few and far between .
Our older friends try to provide comfort by reassuring us that this is only a phase .
In their own way , they are saying this to shall past .
I know most married couples in our stage of life are dealing with the same issues of communication and intimacy .
Jenn and I are in it for the long haul and love each other a great deal .
We know neither one of us is going anywhere .
Yet , this line of thinking is dangerous because you can easily get lazy .
Other issues , some positive like raising children , gain priority while the marriage relationship gets largely ignored .
You justify it by saying she ’ll always be around and after all , there is always tomorrow .
But , tomorrow comes and you find yourself running from a dance recital to a work meeting and finish it off with a 4 year old ’s birthday party .
Part of me is terrified that once the kids get up and running on their own , I wo n’t know the person sitting next to me on the couch .
The US somehow getting lost when we focused on the THEM .
So , tonight I bid you farewell .
I am going to go reconnect with my best friend .
We are going to talk about nothing , but each other .
Right after I toss the couch cushion the Emperor was sitting on in the wash .
David Keith Martz Will Now Have To Meet Strippers
In Car
The odd , perverse saga of a California helicopter pilot has entered its latest chapter , with the news the FAA issued an emergency revocation of David Keith Martz 's license this week .
As ANN reported , Martz drew the FAA 's attention last month , after a video went public showing Martz operating a helicopter over southern California while engaged in a sexual tryst with porn star Puma Swede .
The video was made in 2007 ... but came to light on Hollywood gossip site TMZ.com after a helicopter flown by Martz was forced to land at Van Nuys February 1 after allegedly flying too close to a Los Angeles Police Department helicopter .
" These actions showed a careless and reckless disregard for safety and showed that he lacks the care , judgment and responsibility to hold a commercial pilot certificate , " FAA spokesman Ian Gregor told the San Diego Union - Tribune .
Martz has run afoul of the FAA several times before .
In 1986 , his license was revoked for flying with a forged medical certificate .
In 2002 , he received a 30 - day suspension for doing aerobatics below 1,500 feet and over a populated area .
In 2003 Martz again lost his license , this time for landing too close to personnel on the ground at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar .
Finally , the FAA suspended him for 230 days in 2005 for flying passengers in a helicopter he knew was damaged .
Martz is appealing the latest revocation , Gregor added .
An administrative hearing will likely occur within the next 30 days .

Step 1 : Placement of Planets
Create a new document that is 1200 x 1600 px with a black background .
Then , place the image of a planet ( use NASA images ) in your document and move it to where you want it located .
Because the colors of the planet are a little dull , let ’s modify a little .
Duplicate your planet layer by right clicking it and selecting Duplicate Layer .
Set the new layer ’s Blending Mode to Overlay .
Go back to your original planet layer and grab your Burn Tool .
Set the brush size to 300 px and make sure the Range is Midtones and the Exposure is 50 % .
Burn the lower left half of the planet , making sure you follow the curve of the planet as you do so .
Place the image of a meteorite in the upper - right area of the planet .
Like we did with the planet , duplicate the meteorite and set the layer to Overlay .
Step 2 : Creating the Environment
Before creating an environment for our space scene , you may want to look at some resources and art work done by others to get some inspiration and knowledge .
PSDTUTS has a great post with some amazing artwork done by talented artists .
Make sure all of these layers are located beneath the planet layer .
You may also want to put them in a group .
Creating the Coloration
Create a new layer and fill it with White .
Grab a 300 px soft brush with 75 % opacity and turn Scattering on .
Erase across your layer so that there are random areas of white and gray .
Then set the layer opacity to 25 % .
Create a new layer .
Make sure your foreground and background colors are black and white , and go to Filter > Render >
Clouds to fill your document with some black and white “ clouds . ”
Then apply Filter > Render >
Difference Clouds about three or four times .
Set the blending mode to Overlay , the Fill to 75 % and apply the following Gradient Overlay .
Create two new layers .
On each of them , render some clouds and apply difference clouds on only one of them .
Set both of them to Overlay .
Creating the Stars
Make a new layer and fill it with black .
Go to Filter > Noise > Add Noise .
Set the Amount to 10 % , Distribution to Gaussian , and make sure Monochromatic is checked .
However , this adds way too many stars to our document .
To fix this , go to Image > Adjustments >
Levels .
Set the left slider to 50 and the right slider to 100 .
This will keep only the larger stars and a few medium ones in the image .
Then , set the blending mode to Screen so that only the stars show up and that the black areas of the layer are hidden .
You may want to create multiple layers with this technique and lower the Opacity to create more depth .
Create a new layer and grab a white 5 px soft brush .
Then change the brush settings to the following :
Brush areas of the new layer to add some larger stars .
Do n’t add too many , and try to put them in places that make them pleasing to the eye .
Then add a white Outer Glow , with the blending mode set to normal .
More Coloration
Create a new layer and fill it with a dark blue color , such as # 1b1464 .
Grab a large 300 px soft eraser brush with 75 % opacity .
Turn the Scattering on and erase areas of the layer so that only certain parts are colorized .
Try to leave more in the upper - right area of the layer , because this is the focal point of the graphic .
Set the layer to Screen , and lower the opacity to 40 % .
Repeat this process again with a different color , such as with a green , # 20410a .
Set this layer to 50 % opacity .
Create a new layer and grab a large soft black brush , between 300 px and 800 px .
Brush once or twice behind the upper - right corner of the planet .
Lower the opacity to 40 % , and then apply Outer Glow of the white , set to Overlay .
Color Balance
Now for the fun part .
This next step brings the background environment together !
Go to Layer > New Adjustment Layer > Color Balance .
Shadows :
Cyan / Red : +20
Magenta / Green : -3
Yellow / Blue : +20
Midtones :
Cyan / Red : -1
Magenta / Green : +23
Yellow / Blue : +31
Highlights :
Cyan / Red : +52
Magenta / Green : - 17
Yellow / Blue : - 76
Light Bursts
Create a new layer .
Grab a 300 px soft white brush , set to Dissolve , and brush once on the layer in the upper right .
Then go to Filter > Blur > Radial Blur .
Set the amount to 75 , Zoom , and Best .
Set the layer to Overlay .
Repeat the process using a larger brush and apply it further down .
Empty Space
On a new layer , grab a 500 px black brush and brush around the outer edges to create some nice black space .
Make sure the bottom - left corner has more because we want that area to be dark .
Step 3 : Planet Effects
Make sure the following layers are all placed beneath the moon layer , so that they only apply to the planet .
You may also want to put them in a group .
Darkening Areas
Duplicate your planet layer .
On the bottom planet layer , apply a Filter > Blur > Gaussian Blur of 3 px .
Then apply an Outer Glow of white , set to Overlay .
Create a new layer above your planet .
Then , select your planet by Ctrl + clicking on the layer thumbnail of the planet .
Fill the selection with black , and set the layer to Overlay .
Then lower the opacity of the layer to 40 % .
Create another new layer , and once again select your planet .
Grab a 500 px soft black brush and brush around the outer edge of the planet , but leave the upper right untouched , because we want this to be the bright side of our planet .
Creating an Inner Glow
Create a new layer , and select your planet .
Grab a 300 px soft blue ( # 00 aeef ) brush , and brush around the outer edge of the selection , making sure you get more blue on the upper right of the planet because this is where our bright side is .
Create a new layer and select your planet .
Fill the selection with white .
Drag the selection diagonally down and to the left , and delete most of the white .
Then apply a Gaussian Blur of 5 px .
Then give the layer an Outer Glow of white , set to Overlay .
Color Balance
Once again , select your planet .
Then go to Layer > New Adjustment Layer > Color Balance .
You ’ll notice that the color balance layer now has a mask applied to it of the selection we made .
Shadows :
Cyan / Red : +6
Magenta / Green : -1
Yellow / Blue : - 3
Midtones :
Cyan / Red : - 78
Magenta / Green : 0
Yellow / Blue : +29
Highlights :
Cyan / Red : +47
Magenta / Green : -8
Yellow / Blue : - 33
Glow Effects
Once again , create a new layer and select your planet .
Grab a 300 px white soft brush and brush around the bottom ¾ of the planet .
Try to make the brushes fit the curvature of the planet .
Then set the layer to Overlay , and lower the opacity to 50 % .
Create another new layer and select your planet .
Using a 300 px white soft brush , brush inside the upper - right side of the planet .
Then set the layer opacity to 20 % .
Create another layer , similar to the last one , except create more white space on this layer .
Also , change the layer to Overlay and the opacity to 50 % .
Create another new layer .
This time , grab a 300 px brush and a nice red- orange color ( # e6602 b ) .
Select your planet and then brush an orange area underneath the moon .
Change the brush color to a yellow ( #fdfc92 ) and brush a smaller area underneath the moon .
Lower the layer opacity to 50 % .
On a new layer , select a 200 px black brush and then brush around the bottom ¾ of the planet .
Do n’t restrict the selection to the planet this time .
Let some of the brush overlap the background .
Intermission !
I would like to take this moment to congratulate you if you ’ve made it this far .
This is quite a long tutorial and requires a lot of dedication from you to follow .
Do n’t be frustrated , either , if your example does n’t look like mine .
It takes years to develop your skills in Photoshop .
Keep experimenting , and find some great inspiration and resources to keep you moving along .
When working on a document of this complexity , make sure you keep all of your layers organized and labeled .
Below you can see how I currently have my groups and layers organized and labeled , so that I can easily recognize them when I look back at them later .
Ignore the hidden layers , those will come later .
Step 4 : Moon Effects and Explosion
Make sure all of the following are located above the moon layer .
You may also want to put them in a group .
Glow Effects
Remember when we used a red brush and a yellow brush to create a glow in the upper right of the planet ?
We are going to do the same thing to the lower edge of the moon .
Grab a 200 px red-orange ( # e6602b ) brush , and brush around the outer edge , ¾ of the way around the moon .
Repeat the same process with a 100 px yellow ( # fdfc92 ) brush .
Then lower the opacity of the layer to 20 % .
Remember how we created the white glow in the upper - right area of the earth ?
Repeat the same process for the moon .
Select the moon on a new layer , fill it with white , move the selection down some and then delete most of the white .
Apply a Gaussian Blur of 1 to 2 px .
Then give it an Outer Glow of white set to normal .
Explosion
Create a new layer and grab a 65 px white soft brush .
Then brush a small area where the moon meets the planet .
This layer will add to the effect that the next two layers create .
Create another new layer and keep your 65 px white brush .
Brush a larger area underneath the moon .
Make sure you follow the curvature of the moon as it meets the planet .
Then , grab a small 3 px brush and turn Scattering to 1000 % and Size Jitter to 75 % .
Brush some white particles around the area that you just brushed white .
While still on this layer , apply an Outer Glow with the color # ffa800 , set to Overlay .
Create a new layer and fill it with black .
Then go to Filter > Render > Lens Flare .
Set the Brightness to 100 % and the Type to 50 to 300 mm Zoom .
Move the flare so that it is positioned towards the bottom left , and then press “ Okay . ”
Erase most of the layer , only leaving a small area around the main part of the flare .
Then position the center of the flare over the moon .
Then set the layer to Linear Dodge .
Create a new layer .
Use a number of soft brushes with a nice red color ( #ed1e26 ) to create a red hotness above the moon .
Then lower the opacity of the layer to around 10 to 15 % .
Step 5 : Creating the Asteroids
To create our asteroids , we are going to add another stock image to our document .
There ’s a great picture of a huge rock over at stock.xchng , so we ’ll use that !
Normally , you would use the pen tool to cut the rock out yourself , but I ’ve done it for you to speed up the process .
Open the image , and select the white background using the Magic Wand Tool .
Then go to Select >
Inverse to invert your selection , so that the rock is selected .
Copy and paste it into your document .
Then position it over the planet , rotate it so that the light part is facing the explosion , and finally resize it to a nicer size .
Then duplicate it , and set the new one to Overlay .
Press Ctrl +
E to merge the two layers together so your asteroid is one layer again .
Duplicate your asteroid multiple times , resize it and rotate it .
Do this until you have a nice little cluster of asteroids .
If any of the asteroids gets blurry , go to Filter > Sharpen >
Sharpen to sharpen it up a bit .
If you have any asteroids above other asteroids , they need to cast a shadow .
Select the asteroid that has a shadow cast on it .
Then , on a new layer above that asteroid , use a small soft black brush to brush a shadow in .
As before , use a nice orange ( # e6602 b ) and yellow ( #fdfc92 ) color to color the edges of the asteroids .
Do this by Ctrl + clicking on the layer thumbnails and then using a large soft brush to brush the edges on a new layer .
Set the layer mode to Multiply and the opacity to 50 % .
Repeat the process multiple times for the other asteroids .
Try to find other pictures of rocks to get some different sizes and shapes .
Step 6 : Final Touches
These next steps are for really going in and chiseling out the look we want .
This stage usually involves a lot of experimentation and patience to get the look you want .
Create a new layer on the top level of your document .
Go to Image > Apply Image and press “ Okay ” to paste a merged copy of your document onto the layer .
Go to Image > Adjustments >
Desaturate to make the image grayscale .
Then go to Filter > Blur > Gaussian Blur and apply a blur of 2 px .
Set the layer to Overlay and lower the opacity to 50 % .
What we just did was make our dark colors darker and our light colors lighter , and also add a small blur between them to give it a glow .
Final Step : Pat Yourself on the Back
There we have it : our Space Explosion is complete !
I do n’t know about you , readers , but I ’m exhausted .
Normally , pieces like this take days or weeks to put together , and now that you know how to do it you can create some original pieces of your own .
Below , you will find some links to works that inspired this tutorial and others that are for inspiration .

Mozilla has announced the availability of the third beta release of Firefox 3.1 .
This beta irons out some bugs and moves the browser a step closer towards the final release .
Firefox 3.1 was originally intended to be an incremental update targeted for release in late 2008 .
Plans changed , however , and the feature set grew significantly .
As a result of the delays and the large number of noteworthy improvements that are now included in the code base , the developers are presently working on changing the version number from 3.1 to 3.5 .
The 3.1 release will bring a lot of very impressive changes , including performance enhancements and new features for users and developers .
It includes Firefox 's new high - performance TraceMonkey JavaScript runtime which significantly boosts the speed of script execution .
In addition to faster performance , the JavaScript engine has also gained support for background processing with the new worker threads feature .
Native JSON parsing support will also increase performance for certain kinds of dynamic Web applications .
Firefox 3.1 delivers richer multimedia with support for the new HTML5 video element which is powered by a built - in Ogg codec .
There are also some new rendering effects like support for using SVG filters on HTML .
New CSS3 features implemented in 3.1 include shadows and border images .
Many of these features were demonstrated during an impressive presentation by Chris Blizzard at the Southern California Linux Expo .
The most impressive demo , which was created by Mozilla 's Paul Rouget , showed how JavaScript can be used to detect motion in HTML5 video content .
You can try this demo yourself with the new beta release .
Rouget 's latest demo shows how JavaScript can be used to render subtitles on a video .
The subtitles , which are in srt format and are included in three languages , are retrieved with XMLHttpRequest and are then parsed in JavaScript and displayed correctly at the proper times .
Firefox 3.1 beta 3 can be downloaded from the Mozilla website .
It 's not quite ready for mainstream adoption yet , but it 's definitely robust enough at this stage to be used on a day - to - day basis by developers and testers who do n't mind the occasional glitch .
I 've been using the nightly builds on my main desktop computer .
If you plan on testing it out and then switching back to Firefox 3 , you should be sure to create a separate profile .
Mozilla 's quality assurance team is planning a special test day tomorrow and is looking for volunteers to help out by participating in the effort .
For more details about the beta , check out the official release notes .
( CNN ) --
The Senate is taking up a controversial bill that would impose a hefty tax on bonuses paid out by companies propped up by taxpayer money .
Lawmakers are taking up a bill that would heavily tax bonuses from bailed - out companies like AIG .
But , as outrageous as the bonuses may seem , critics of the bill say the tax code should never be used as punishment .
Lawmakers cried foul after it was revealed earlier this week that ailing insurance giant American International Group doled out $ 165 million in retention bonuses , after claiming more than $ 170 billion in bailout funds .
The House of Representatives on Thursday passed a measure that would tax individuals on any bonuses received in 2009 from companies getting $ 5 billion or more in money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP .
Bonuses for people with incomes over $ 250,000 would be taxed at a 90 percent rate .
Most Democrats supported the bill , while Republicans were sharply divided .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - California , said the bill was necessitated by the poor judgment shown by firms receiving bailout money .
" We must stabilize the financial system in order to strengthen our economy and create jobs , " she said .
" We must also protect the American taxpayer from executives who would use their companies ' second chances as opportunities for private gain . "
Texas Republican Rep. Ron Paul , who voted against the legislation , said Friday that Congress has a habit of reacting " minute - to - minute . "
Watch Paul explain his view of the bill »
" They react in emotional ways , so when the banking crisis hit , instead of dealing with it over the last decade -- which I 've been begging and pleading for them to do -- they wait and , ' Oh , there 's a financial crisis , ' " he said .
Paul said that while the bonuses are bad , the original government bailout is the root of the problem .
Congress last year approved TARP , a $ 700 billion bailout of financial institutions .
" People are concentrating on these bonuses right now , but they 're missing the point .
The point is that we should n't be in the business of bailing out all these companies , " Paul said .
President Obama on Thursday commended the House for passing the measure .
" Today 's vote rightly reflects the outrage that so many feel over the lavish bonuses that AIG provided its employees at the expense of the taxpayers who have kept this failed company afloat , " he said .
" I look forward to receiving a final product that will serve as a strong signal to the executives who run these firms that such compensation will not be tolerated . "
David Lifson , president of the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants , said that in his view , the House tax bill is n't really tax policy .
CNNMoney : Bonus tax feels good , but is it ?
" When the government rescued AIG for the sake of the financial system , it inadvertently rescued all the contracts AIG entered into with executives , " he said .
Critics of the bill say lawmakers can't use the tax code to reclaim bonuses included in contracts .
Republican Whip Jon Kyl on Thursday blocked the Senate 's attempt to pass by unanimous consent a similar bonus - tax bill .
Unlike the House bill , the Senate bill would impose a tax both on the company giving the bonus and on the individual receiving it .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , blasted Republicans for holding up the legislation , saying , " The American people deserve swift action to right this wrong , but unfortunately , the Republican objection prevents us from doing so . "
But Kyl wants " to understand the root and cause of what happened here before we haphazardly rush and approve what we think is the remedy , " said his spokesman , Ryan Patmintra .
Sen . Judd Gregg , R - New Hampshire , said Friday that 's it wrong to " propose to use the taxing authority of the government in a manner that is arbitrary , punitive , and targeted on a single group of people who they have deemed as having acted improperly . "
Calling the ability to tax one of the most " powerful and important " roles of the government , he said that power " should not be used in a way that undermines its credibility and creates precedents that could lead to significant abuse . "
Gregg called the AIG bonus fiasco " despicable " but said that much of the problem evolved from the administration 's lack of oversight on the funds given to AIG .
" Using the tax code to exact retribution or divert public attention from the government 's own errors is unjustifiable , " he said .

Anti-tax movement holds ' Tea Party ' to protest Obama policies Muriel Kane
Published : Friday February 27 , 2009
Print This Email This Describing themselves as the spark of a " new conservative counterculture , " several thousand anti-tax protesters took to the streets in over thirty cities on Friday to object to President Obama 's plans to counter the growing economic crisis with government spending .
The extensive media coverage of the event was perhaps disproportionate to the actual size of the protests , which drew around 200 to 300 participants in most locations .
The greatest turnout may have been in St. Louis , Missouri , where some 1000 people showed up .
The protest was inspired by a rant against Obama 's housing bailout plan delivered last week from the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade by CNBC 's Rick Santelli , who denounced struggling homeowners as " losers . "
Planning moved ahead quickly , thanks to the use of YouTube , Facebook , Flickr , and especially Twitter .
The protesters identify themselves with the revolutionaries who dumped tea in Boston Harbor in 1773 .
Some wore 18th century garb to the protests , while others were described as wearing tea bags .
Organizers have sworn to deposit tens of thousands of teabags on the floor of the US Congress .
Conservative columnist Michelle Malkin calls the protesters " a fledgling grassroots movement . "
However , sociologist Eugenia Deerman , a student of conservative social movements , told the Christian Science Monitor , " Im suspicious only because ... the conservative movement has repeatedly used this tactic of creating an appearance of grassroots activism when they re actually very well orchestrated . "
Many progressives are also skeptical of the grassroots claim .
For example , blogger Jeffrey Feldman points out that the Washington , DC sponsors of the events include such old - line anti-tax groups as Americans for Prosperity , Grover Norquist 's Americans for Tax Reform , the National Taxpayers Union , and FreedomWorks .

Angels on Horseback , is the more poetic name for Oysters en Brochette , or skewered Oysters wrapped in bacon , how could you possibly go wrong with Oysters and Bacon ?
I tossed the Oysters in a quick little marinade while I par - cooked the Bacon , partially cooked bacon is the key to keeping your Oysters from overcooking .
You can make these little beauties under your broiler , I made mine on the grill ; whichever you choose , just wrap the Rosemary leaves in a little aluminum foil to keep them from burning .
A lot of the classic versions of this dish are battered and deep fried , I skipped that step because I just like them straight off of the grill .
Traditionally these are served with toast points , but if you forget to buy bread like I did , a small salad will work out just fine .
Angels On Horseback or Oysters en Brochette Recipe
1 Dozen shucked Oysters
1 Dozen
Thick sliced bacon , or 6 slices cut in half , if your Oysters are small
4 Rosemary stems , trimmed of leaves except for one inch at the top
1 Clove garlic chopped
3 Tbsp Lemon Juice
1 pinch Cayenne
1 tsp chopped Parsley
Kosher salt & Black pepper
Cook off the bacon until just slightly browned .
In the meantime , marinate the Oysters in the garlic , lemon juice , cayenne , and parsley , 10 - 15 minutes should do the trick .
If you have small Oysters , cut the bacon slices in half crosswise .
I had huge Oysters yesterday , so I used a whole slice for each one .
Wrap the bacon around the Oysters , then thread on to the Rosemary skewers , 3 or more to a skewer , keeping the Oysters tightly together .
Season with a little Kosher salt and a lot of freshly ground black pepper .
To grill or broil :
Wrap the rosemary leaves in aluminum foil to keep them from burning and place the brochettes on a hot grill , or under a broiler .
Cook until the bacon is crisp and the edges of the Oysters are curled .
Serve with toast points or a small salad .
I made a Baby Spinach salad with Creole Mustard Vinaigrette .
These also go well served with a Beurre Blanc .
Serves 2 as an appetizer .

Do You Want to do This ?
Salvia divinorum ( 5x Extract )
Citation : Shaken .
" Do You Want to do This ? : An Experience with Salvia divinorum ( 5x Extract ) ( exp55466 ) " .
Erowid.org .
Mar 5 , 2009 .
erowid.org/exp/55466
DOSE :
4 hits smoked Salvia divinorum ( extract - 5 x )
BODY WEIGHT : 150 lb
My first impression is that if you are comfortable in this reality , do NOT TRY SALVIA .
If you cannot understand what I mean by this , that is exactly my point .
I feel like I should not be even writing this for fear that somebody may misunderstand me and want to try salvia .
If what I have just written makes you curious , please read the rest of this before you decide whether you want to try it .
The experience was jarring , incredibly bizarre , and I feel that this could change my life if I let it , but I am only going to allow it to change my life a little .
Understand that it has that power .
That the experience I had with a strong dose of Salvia made me consider reality in an entirely different way and destroyed any certainy I thought I had about it .
Could you live your life the same way you do now with that knowledge ?
I am entirely serious .
Either there is truly a reality beyond the one that we are born into , or there is a plant that is able to fuck my mind up enough for me to think that there is .
You should realize that it does n't matter which is right , because either way you believe it , and unless that is something you want to deal with right now , I do not recommend salvia .
It was like climbing out of Plato 's cave and it freaked the fuck out of me , and I wanted to pretend that I never did it in the first place .
Fuck truth .
I 've got a lot going on in this little cave of mine and it's not worth losing , not at this point .
Right now I am back to my comfortable reality , and I am trying the best I can to forget what I just expereinced , just so I can live my life the way I used to .
It seems that I 'm able to ignore what I just saw because it fades quickly like a dream .
But it is the most utterly real thing I have ever experienced and I 'm not dealing with it particularly well .
Thats my rant about thoughts on the experience .
Now
Here is what I experienced , as I was compelled to write down just as I was coming down so that I would not for get it , and added to later .
I took 4 big puffs , trying to finish the small bowl .
It cherried everytime extraordinarily well , unlike weed ever does , so I could see the bowl getting closer and closer to being entirely burned every puff .
I was trying to finish the bowl .
Then a terrifying thought hit me .
Wait a minute I said to myself , this is n't weed .
This is Salvia .
This is n't a joke .
And it was n't .
All of a sudden the reality that I had been in before I had smoked was removed from me .
It was like salvia had responded , saying , thats right this is n't a joke you idiot , and pulled me away from everything I thought I knew was real .
Reality itself began to bend in a spiral pattern , there was my computer screen that I had been facing and then another and another to infinity each representing an alternate reality , identical to the one I had been in but different in the fact that THAT THEY COULD NOT BE IDENTICAL TO MY REALITY BECAUSE THERE THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE OF THEM .
I got up , not able to believe what was happening .
I Heard a voice , and I use that term as in the sense I had an impulse that seemed to come from outside of myself .
I did n't want to listen to the voice .
I felt that it had utter authority over me , like a parent or teacher has over a small child .
It said that I had to leave this reality and was shown this that it was just one of a million , billion , infinite number of realities .
I had gotten up , walked halfway down the stairs , feeling the force and authority of this voice pulling me away from this reality .
I stood on the steps of the stairs , saying to whoever was watching me what ?.... wait ?
no no no looking around more .
realizing it was true .
No. what ?
Like some one who understood exactly what they had been told and could not accept it .
Because I was .
I stood there on the steps , just waiting for the voice to enforce what it had just told me and remove me from this insignificant reality to another .
At this point I saw my roommates pulling up in the driveway , and realizing they were also just part of this false reality that I had been living in .
And that I would never see them again , because I was leaving the reality to which they belonged .
I went back to my room not ready to leave but feeling that I had to , like dying , saying good bye to not only every single person I knew , but everything I knew .
In fact , thinking about it , that is exactly what I think dying is like .
But I never had to leave .
That was it .
That part on the stairs was the most intense part of the trip .
When I came back to my bed I tried to grapple with what had just happened , I realized that it was over .
Nothing was going to pull me away .
But nothing could ever be the same .
I had seen past something .
Something no one is supposed to see past , at least not in our culture .
My roommates came home and I pretended to be asleep so I would not be forced to try to explain to them what I had just seen .
Where I go from here , I m not sure .
I think I m safe here now , and I m not going back , not for now , this is quite real enough for me .
I can not call this a bad trip .
It 's like a nightmare , that I believed to be true and then I woke up and I realized that thank god , it was n't true .
Except that with this I KNOW that it was real .
I can forget it , just like a bad dream , but somewhere in my head I know that it was n't just that .
That is deeper shit than I ever thought I could , or wanted to be able to find at my local head shop .
This stuff is no joke .
I cannot tell you to try it or not to try it because I beleive that I got a glimpse of a reality more real than the one we are in now , and that I do not feel personally ready to face .
If you feel that you are , good luck , but realize that beyond a certain point , there is no going back .

Footage shot by police shows how their officers monitored campaigners and the media at last August 's climate camp demonstration in Kent guardian.co.uk / Jason N. Parkinson
Kent police accepted last night they should not have placed journalists under surveillance after a Guardian investigation revealed members of the press were monitored and followed at last year 's climate camp demonstration .
Secret footage shot by two police surveillance officers during the protest , obtained by the Guardian and broadcast online over the weekend , confirmed officers have been monitoring journalists at protests .
Senior officers had previously denied journalists had become the target of surveillance units .
The footage showed that while officers had been asked to monitor protesters against the Kingsnorth coal - fired power station , they showed particular interest in journalists .
An ITV news crew , a Sky News cameraman and several photographers were among members of the press placed under surveillance as they left the camp in August .
Later in the day journalists were followed by another surveillance unit to a McDonald 's restaurant where police filmed them .
Allyn Thomas , Kent 's assistant chief constable who oversaw the operation , said the force " fully accept the right to protest as part of our democracy " , but the force had received information that protesters intended to shut down the power station .
" As part of our operation overt filming of protesters was carried out as a means of identifying anyone who subsequently attempted to break into the power station .
The situation on the ground was complex with more than 1,000 protesters , together with journalists and camera crews , in a confined area .
We accept that police should not have filmed legitimate journalists or camera crews , however it was a difficult task in these circumstances to clearly identify them . "
All the journalists followed by the surveillance unit were carrying camera equipment and had produced press cards , the official identification of bona fide journalists .
But Thomas said there was " an issue " with officers who had failed to understand press cards , which are endorsed by national police bodies as the official identification for news gatherers .
" We acted on this and have incorporated training about this issue in our guidance for future operations , " he said .
In a separate development it also emerged last night that the Metropolitan police have been asked to clarify evidence they submitted to the court of appeal about the use of the tactic , following the Guardian 's disclosures .
Lawyers at the human rights watchdog Liberty representing Andrew Wood , a former press officer for the Campaign Against Arms Trade , who is challenging the legality of the Met surveillance in a judicial review , have asked the force to clarify its submissions to the courts .
In its evidence the Met said surveillance images of protesters were placed on CD - Roms and stored in a warehouse .
Images are usually kept only for the use by officers of the public order branch , it said .
But the force appears not to have disclosed that - when officers deem it justified - surveillance material about protesters is transfered to Crimint , the general database used daily by all police staff to catalogue criminal intelligence .
Lawyers believe the transfer makes it more likely the technique is in violation of article 8 of the Human Rights Act .
Wood , from Oxford , was targeted by a Met surveillance unit as he emerged from London 's Millennium Hotel in April 2005 , where he had attended the annual general meeting of a company that ran a trade fair for the arms industry .
He had gained access to the meeting by lawfully purchasing a share in the company .
Expecting a demonstration and possible unlawful activity by campaigners , the Met deployed three surveillance teams .
Wood was photographed with other campaigners as he emerged from the meeting and then followed by police to a tube station .
His claim that the police 's taking of the photograph - after he lawfully attended a meeting - breached his rights under the European convention on human rights was dismissed by the high court last year .
A judgment by the court of appeal is expected soon , but may be delayed while the Met clarifies its position .
Shami Chakrabarti , director of Liberty , said : " The police need to distinguish between crime and democratic dissent or they will find themselves on the receiving end of the law . "
A growing tactic
Overt surveillance was first used by police to monitor football hooligans and animal rights activists in the late 1990s .
Pioneered by the Metropolitan police , the tactic has been expanded to cover all forms of political demonstrations and meetings , with surveillance units regularly deployed across the country .
Those photographing or filming protesters are specially trained civilians or police officers , and are used to monitor movements to help the deployment of resources , or as gatherers of potential evidence .
Indications suggest such surveillance is to increase .
The Association of Chief Police Officers has commissioned the National Police Improvements Agency to establish a national standard for the technique .

Petitioners have been flooding the court of Maulana Ehsan - ur - Rahman ( far left )
By Syed Shoaib Hasan
BBC News , Mingora , Swat
" I am not going to change the decision as it is valid according to Sharia , " says Maulana Ehsan - ur - Rahman softly but adamantly .
Maulana Rahman is a qazi , or judge , in one of the newly appointed Islamic Sharia courts in Pakistan 's troubled district of Swat .
He is addressing about a dozen people standing in front of the bench in the circuit courthouse of Mingora , Swat 's main town .
They are led by a tall , fierce - looking man who adamantly demands an explanation for the court 's decision .
He is a commander in the Swat Taleban who fought Pakistan 's army to a recent standstill .
The Taleban had demanded the implementation of Islamic Sharia law here .
The government acceded and these courts are the first step in that direction .
The members of the Taleban present refused to accept the verdict and said they would take up the matter with senior Taleban commanders
Court eyewitness
The move led to an outcry across Pakistan and in the international community .
Human rights activists are horrified at the possibility of punishments such as the amputation of limbs , whipping and stoning to death being implemented .
Moreover , legal experts are worried over the challenges posed by setting up a parallel legal system .
But the common people in Swat have welcomed the establishment of the courts and have thronged to them .
" We believe we will get quick and impartial justice from the Sharia courts , " says Umar Hayat , a local man waiting to file his petition .
" In the past , cases used to drag on for years , but now they are settled in days .
More importantly , everybody is equal in front of the law . "
Farmer 's win The " Taleban case " before the court vividly illustrates this .
It pertains to the creation of a dirt track through the fields of a local farmer at the behest of the Taleban .
Maulana Rahman says he has heard 100 cases since 18 February
The farmer filed a case in the Sharia courts and the matter was adjudicated by Maulana Rahman .
The ruling was in the farmer 's favour .
" But the members of the Taleban present refused to accept the verdict and said they would take up the matter with senior Taleban commanders , " an eyewitness says .
" They also twisted the judge 's words and brought in the commander after telling him that Maulana Rahman had said that he did not care if Maulana Fazlullah himself had demanded a repeal . "
Maulana Fazlullah is head of the Taleban in the Swat region .
His power is said to be absolute .
The clearly incensed Taleban commander demanded an explanation from Maulana Rahman .
The qazi made it clear he had not made any such comments .
But he also reiterated the fact that the ruling was final .
SHARIA IN SWAT The Nizam - e - Adl ( Order of Justice ) ordinance implements Sharia in Swat retrospectively from 15 March Cases are decided according to the sect of the person (s ) filing
There are two major sects : Sunni ( 80 % ) and Shia ( 20 % ) but they divide into many subsects The Taleban follow the Wahhabist / Deoband Sunni subsects and want their own form of Sharia Most Pakistanis follow the Barelvi Sunni subsect For several minutes , the Taleban commander and his henchmen continued to argue .
But Maulana Rahman refused to budge , and fellow qazis waded into the argument in his support .
Finally , they managed to convince the Taleban after quoting examples supporting the decision from the Koran .
They also said they would personally come and investigate the matter if the ruling was not followed .
At this , the Taleban agreed to the decision and beat a hasty retreat .
" This a system that works for us , " says Qari Fazal Maula , a petitioner at the court .
He had just received a ruling in his favour over a dispute involving the ownership of his rickshaw taxi .
" I could n't get a decision despite having filed two years ago in a local court , " he says .
" It was a waste of money with all the lawyers ' fees and other costs .
Here I had to spend 20 rupees ( 25 US cents ) on a piece of official stamp paper . "
Most of the other petitioners at the crowded court voiced similar sentiments .
But there are dissenting voices .
" The courts are not admitting our cases , " says Farooq Ahmed .
He is waiting to file a petition regarding a property dispute dating back 40 years .
" Cases that were filed before the implementation of the original Sharia draft in 1999 will not be accepted , " a judge explains .
" This had to be done otherwise there would be a huge backlog of cases and this would again start the delay in justice . "
According to Maulana Rahman , he has so far heard 100 cases since the courts were started on 18 February .
" I have given a decision in 20 of the cases , " he says .
" The decisions are on the basis of Sharia and consensus . "
There is already a minor backlog because of the available number of judges - just seven for the entire district .
Ordinance
The newly implemented Sharia system for the Malakand division is three - tiered .
There is the Ilaqa ( local area ) court , which comes under the zila ( district ) court , all of which are presided over by the Darul Darul qaza court for the entire division .
This acts as the supreme court .
The region needs at least 20 judges to make the system workable and efficient .
Not everyone is happy .
Farooq
Ahmed 's case is too old
But that is just a problem of resources which can be addressed quite quickly if need be .
The real issue remains the validity of the implementation of Sharia law itself .
A declaration was made for it to take effect from 15 March but the actual ordinance has still to be signed .
" When the ordinance is signed by the president , the relevant code will have retrospective effect , " insists a local TNSM leader .
The TNSM organisation , led by former militant leader Sufi Mohammad , brokered the peace agreement between the Taleban and the government .
But that peace may not hold .
Under previous Sharia regulations , courts came to their decisions by taking both the law and consensus into account .
Most analysts believe this is unlikely to change and that it may lead to trouble from the Taleban .
" The Taleban have always said they want the implementation of their version of Sharia law here , " explains a local legal expert .
But the Nizam - e - Adl , or Order of Justice , for Swat talks of interpreting Sharia according to the demands of the relevant sects involved .
" This is a sure recipe for disaster , " the legal expert says .

So , you 've got $ 500 bucks burning a hole in your pocket , and you 've got your heart set on a computer ( and maybe 20 fast food meals ) .
A small , cheap computer might be just the thing for you .
Miniature computers are just about the hottest thing to hit the PC market since probably the last time something cheap came out when everyone was broke .
Darn near every computer maker has a very special model of miniature computer nowadays , be it ultra-portable , Netbookⓒ , sub-notebook , handheld , mini-notebook , ultrathin notebook , ULCPC - and the list goes on .
It 's sort of confusing at first - but the important thing to remember is that each of these categories are completely different and you should feel extremely bad if you do n't know the terminology .
And so , we give you a list of the Most Frequently Asked Miniature Computer Questions .
Actually , it 's just one question .
Q : What the fuck is the difference between an ultra-portable and an ultra - thin notebook ?
The biggest hurdle to the layman is that most of these categories are new and sometimes not well defined .
How big can a subnotebook be before it 's considered an ultra-portable ?
Does an optical disk make a Netbookⓒ an ultrathin ?
Why can't I get a date ?
These are all very important questions .
Knowing a computer 's specs is nice — but that 's job # 2 next to categorization .
Categorization separates us from the animals .
And keep in mind : each computer maker insists on coming up with a new term for their machine for every minute change they make .
PC vendors certainly know the category is important .
Witness Psion Teklogix and Intel suing each other over the name " netbook . "
Think about that .
Americans may soon be violating copyright law by using netbook as a generic term .
We at El Reg may have resisted the name at first .
But you know what ?
We 're going to miss the little guy if it goes away .
Do you know one out of five people mislabel their small , cheap computer ?
No , seriously , if you know that , email me because it 's a slow news day and that sounds like a great scoop .
Anyway , if you 're still confused about miniature computers we 've developed a handy flowchart you can print out and pin to your jacket when you go to the computer store .
Careful now , pins are sharp !
And that settles it .
No more arguments . ®
It 's always interesting to spend time poking through the application bundle for newly released Mac OS X software .
Inside the bundle are all sorts of files and resources that can sometimes give you insight as to what is going on with development .
Today ,
Ars had a chance to dive into Safari 4 and explore some features that were hidden away from surface inspection .
To look inside any Macintosh application bundle , select it in the Applications folder , right click and choose Show Package Contents from the pop-up .
A new Finder browser window will open , revealing the bundle contents .
Choose View > as Columns ( Command - 3 ) for the easiest browsing experience .
Inside the bundle are three intriguing items , all new to Safari 4 : a code signature folder , a Safari webpage preview fetcher , and a WebApplicationCore bundle .
Of these items , the signature folder and the bundle are not remarkable in any real way other than showing the growth of the Safari application .
Contents of the Safari 4 Application Bundle
According to Apple 's Safari features page , Safari 4 offers support for many next - generation Internet standards including offline databases for standalone Web applications .
The new WebApplicationCore bundle appears to provide the core support for these Web applications .
Strings in the bundle suggest little more functionality than loading the application , running it , linking to other Web apps , and quitting .
The _CodeSignature folder is one of the first any of us at Ars has noticed for an application shipped directly from Apple .
Application signing has been around a long time and is used widely by third - party developers .
We 've seen Apple sign frameworks before .
We 've seen Apple sign executables before .
But this is the first time we 've seen Apple signing general application material .
This kind of signing assures the integrity of the application bundle , including images , property lists , and so forth .
( Test for yourself .
Issue ls / Applications /*/ Contents / _CodeSignature or locate _ CodeSignature from the CLI . )
What came as a small surprise to us was the third and last item : the Safari Webpage Preview Fetcher .
It 's a standalone utility that is called from Safari whenever users enter the Top Pages browser .
We were able to track the calls to this utility by running dtrace .
Sure enough , the preview fetcher was tied to Top Pages and was called as often as not when the Top Pages browser was activated .
Catching preview calls through dtrace
A little investigation showed us that the utility updates a preview cache located in / var / folders .
The exact location will likely vary .
Issue cd /var / folders/*/*/-Caches-/com.apple.safari from the command line to locate the Safari cache folder , which will own a Webpage Previews subfolder .
The actual call to the fetcher looks something like this :
3011 ??
0:00.02 / Applications / Safari 3.app/Contents/Safari Webpage Preview Fetcher /var / folders/Xo/XoLxWUlSFtSplCoUpBV7DE+++TI/-Caches-/com.apple.Safari/Webpage
Previews / Incoming
When run , the utility grabs high ( PNG ) and low ( JPG ) previews of the webpage and adds them to the cache folder .
So why does Safari do this ?
Why call an embedded utility ?
This question led to a lively behind - the - scenes discussion at the Orbiting HQ .
In this , as in many things , John Siracusa provided the greatest insight .
Perhaps , he suggested , this is a vote of no confidence in Mac OS X's concurrency frameworks , particularly when used in conjunction with a big library like WebKit .
Some developers complain about NSOperationQueue and threading in general , as Apple 's concurrency libraries are not really where they should be just yet .
( Rogue Amoeba , greatly disappointed with Apple 's class , offers an open - source replacement for NSOperationQueue . )
Alternatively , he offered that maybe this part of Safari just had to be done in a hurry and will be integrated into the main application some time in the future .
Nothing we found today really shook our world or indicated an unexpected new direction for Apple .
At the same time , it 's always intriguing to see what is new , what has changed , and where each application release takes us .
If you find anything new in Safari that we 've missed , please share with us in the comments .
MOSCOW , Russia ( CNN ) --
Two satellites , one Russian and one American , have collided some 800 kilometers ( 500 miles ) above Siberia , the Russian and U.S. space agencies , said Thursday .
Debris from the collision poses no threat to the International Space Station .
The collision on Tuesday produced two large debris clouds , NASA said .
The satellites collided at 10 kilometers ( 6 miles ) per second , producing 500 - 600 new pieces of space debris , the U.S. Strategic Command said .
That debris is not believed to pose a threat to the International Space Station as long as the clouds continue moving in a lower orbit , according to NASA and the Russian federal space agency , Roscosmos .
" There is some elevated risk , but it is considered to be very small to the ISS and to the other satellites that NASA has in orbit , " NASA spokeswoman Beth Dickey told CNN .
She said experts were still assessing the effects of the debris .
Mikhail Martirosov , from Russian mission control center , told Interfax news agency that the real threat from the debris will become obvious next week , once experts can calculate the trajectory of the fragments ' descent .
" We have not received a warning of the possible danger to the ISS .
The fragments may descend to the ISS orbit in several years , although I do not rule out that some fragments may go down within several days , " Martirosov said .
The Russian satellite was launched in 1993 and had been out of service at the time of the collision , Roscosmos said .
The U.S. satellite was part of the Iridium global mobile communications system and is owned by a consortium headed by Motorola , the space agency said .
It was launched in 1997 .
Iridium said in a statement Wednesday it " expects to implement a network solution by Friday , " and will " move one of its in - orbit spare satellites into the network constellation to permanently replace the lost satellite " within the next 30 days .
CNN is " one of the larger non-government users " of Iridium , said Arnie Christianson , operations manager for CNN Satellites and Transmission .
" We do rely on it for communication in high - risk areas like Iraq , Afghanistan , and other remote locations , " he said .
" Because of this collision , there may be a slightly longer hole in the coverage from one satellite to the next , but only in a very small area and for a very small amount of time .
This is a collision , not an internal failure of the satellite or the system . "
The satellite crash may result in " brief , occasional outages " that may slightly disrupt service , Iridium said in the statement , adding " this event is not the result of a failure on the part of Iridium or its technology . "
Christianson questioned how U.S. government , which tracks all space junk larger than a football , did n't see this coming .
But he said the system will continue to work without any noticeable problems .
A representative of Iridium could not immediately be reached for comment .
NASA 's Dickey said a collision like this one is very rare .
" This is the first impact between two intact satellites traveling at hypervelocity , " she said .
" There have been some other occasions when things have accidentally collided in space , but they have been parts of rockets or parts of satellites and ( produced ) a very small cloud . "
Major Regina Winchester , of the U.S. Strategic Command , said : " Space is getting pretty crowded .
The fact that this has n't happened before -- maybe we were getting a little bit lucky . "
Winchester said Strategic Command tracks more than 18,000 pieces of manmade objects in space every day .
" Any time there 's an event that creates more debris , it 's a concern , " she said .
" All countries who have assets in space are going to be concerned simply because when there 's more debris , there 's a higher chance it 's going to hit something . "

Aussie beaches a ' disaster zone ' after toxic spill Agence France - Presse
Published : Friday March 13 , 2009
Print This Email This
SYDNEY ( AFP ) --
Dozens of popular tourist beaches on Australia 's northeast coast were on Friday declared a disaster zone , with their once - pristine sands fouled by a massive oil and chemical slick .
Queensland state 's marine safety authority said up to 100 tonnes of fuel were now believed to have spilled from the Hong Kong - flagged ship Pacific Adventurer amid cyclonic conditions early on Wednesday .
Moreton and Bribie Islands , and parts of the popular Sunshine Coast , were declared disaster zones .
" This may well be the worst environmental disaster we have seen in southeast Queensland , " the state 's leader , Anna Bligh , said .
Initial estimates put the spill at 30 tonnes but authority spokesman John Watkinson said up to 100,000 litres could be washing up along a 60 - kilometre ( 40 - mile ) stretch of the region 's beaches , sickening local wildlife .
The ship 's owners , Swire Shipping , said they had sent a diver to inspect the hull late on Friday .
" This shows that the damage suffered as a result of Cyclone Hamish is greater than initially understood and it is likely that substantially more oil has spilled than the earlier estimate of 42.5 cubic metres , " Swire said in a statement .
Swire faces 1.5 million dollars ( 977,000 US dollars ) in fines if found guilty of environmental or maritime breaches .
" The company very much regrets the environmental impact caused as a consequence of the vessel being caught in Cyclone Hamish , " it said .
" The company and its insurers will meet all their responsibilities . "
Swire had to launch a separate clean - up effort on Friday afternoon after leaking more oil into the river which runs through Brisbane , the state 's capital city .
The " small " spill , contained by barriers surrounding the ship , took place during testing to determine how much oil was lost in the first leak , Swire said .
Describing it as a " potential environmental tragedy " , Prime Minister Kevin Rudd pledged full government support for the clean - up effort , which could cost millions of dollars .
Officials warned the situation was likely to worsen , with sludge expected to wash ashore for weeks .
A team of 130 specialists was on Friday mopping up the mess and attempting to prevent it from spreading into nearby mangrove swamps and waterways .
The oil flooded Moreton Bay after wild seas whipped up by Cyclone Hamish toppled 31 containers of ammonium nitrate fertiliser from the ship 's deck .
As they fell , the containers punctured the hull , before taking 620 tonnes of the explosive chemical to the ocean floor .
Experts fear the fertiliser , a nutrient - rich chemical , could cause harmful algal blooms , suffocate fish and kill natural habitats .
Moreton Bay , a marine sanctuary , is home to a range of sea birds and other creatures , including turtles , dolphins and pelicans .
A dozen sickened animals had been discovered , but the environmental protection authority said that was likely to rise .
" The flow - on effects of oil spills can be substantive , " an authority spokesman said .
" The longer - term impacts are yet to be realised . "

Wed Feb 18 , 2009 12:08 pm Quote : THE TAOISEACH has still not received a formal invitation to the White House for St Patricks Day with just a month to go to the national holiday .
Brian Cowen told Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny the Irish Embassy in Washington was in contact with the White House as is normal at this time of year .
Mr Kenny referred to the Taoiseachs plan to visit Washington and New York next month .
 Have you received an official invitation to the White House to meet President Obama ?  he asked .
 Are the officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs working with their counterparts in the US to make this a reality given its importance in terms of the relationship between Ireland and the United States and the circumstances in which we find ourselves at present ?
The Taoiseach said that final arrangements have not been agreed .

Obama would be kind of a shit not to do the Patrick 's Day thing , even in a slimmed down format like Bush .

Wed Feb 18 , 2009 8:26 pm Annual personal access to the American administration is an important thing which very few States of comparable size have managed to achieve .
It is something worthy of comment and , even as someone who is not a FG supporter , I have noticed Kenny seems quite capable of attacking the Government on its possible links to dodgy deals in Anglo at the same time as raising this issue .

Well thanks be to God for that , I thought he was just trying to use a titbit of information to embarrass Cowen .
You might have noticed that while he was asking about links to dodgy deals , he did n't specify what those links might be , it 's known as throw enough muck and hope some of it sticks , a not unknown tactic in FG politics .

As opposed to current FF policy which seems to consist of blindfolding themselves and running across motorways hoping that they wo n't get hit by any traffic in the world of international finance ... or opposed to giving tax incentives for their friends and funders to build things that we did n't need .

The first part is your opinion , you 're welcome to it .
For the second part you 'll have to supply some details , if you have any .

Firstly , let 's not pretend it is above Fianna Fail to sling mud .
Secondly , Fianna Fail should focus on who 's fault it is : John Bruton .
But seriously , Cowen 's from North Offaly , Obama 's people are from South Offaly .
Sure that feud is worse than the bloods and crypts .

Wed Feb 18 , 2009 8:59 pm Section 23 developments empty all over Tallaght and vast parts of Meath and West Meath .
Section 50 developments empty surrounding Universities such as Galway and Limerick .
I see one of the Student Accommodations built in Limerick under Section 50 is now open to anyone to rent a room in .
Tax relief for unnecessary hotels ...
I believe there are now six large hotels in Tallaght .
Two have gone bust so far this year , expect more to follow .
Most of these hotels should never have got planning permission ... lucky ( or unlucky now ) for the developers they managed to get planning permission for designs which were more conjusive to apartment blocks than they were to hotels thus readily convertible when the hotel goes bust .
The latter situation is one which local authorities should have been concerned with , but the tax breaks were Government ones .
Of course all of this to the backdrop of the cosy relationship between Fianna Fáil and major developers .
A simple Google search of " Fianna Fáil Tent " will provide you with a link to a story ( one of many ) in the Sunday Business Post from August 2003 mentioning several major developers rubbing shoulders at the Fianna Fáil fundraiser .
It is incumbent upon a Government to engage in proper planning .
This Government did not , they created tax breaks to speed up and feed unnecessary developments up and down this country in order to keep the bubble inflating all the time hoping they would get out before it burst .
These were bad policies tonys and history will judge them so .

FF do n't as a rule do mudslinging , they do go after you and tear you to bits for next to nothing while pretending whatever it is matters or if it does actually matter , they pretend you should have been able to do something about it before it happened .

All very relevant I 'm sure , apart from one detail , it was n't FF who introduced tax incentives for builders / building , on the other hand it was FF who brought them to an end , in 2004 I believe .
A simple search should uncover who did introduce the building tax incentives .

There are still reliefs on nursing homes , hospitals and clinics , including sports injuries clinics .
Town and rural reliefs I think ended one or two years ago .
When tax incentives were introduced they kickstarted development in derelict areas .
Fianna Fail continued to pump money into these schemes when the construction industry was already at boiling point .
One of the worst aspects of the whole thing was the lack of planning .
Holiday homes all over the coastline and unwanted houses in quiet rural counties , with no sewerage and no roads .
Standing empty most of the year now .
It pushed building costs up too .
If people had paid their taxes instead we might all have had better infrastructure and services .

[ Haskell - cafe ]
Announce : language - python
Language - python provides a parser ( and lexer ) for Python written in Haskell .
Currently it only supports version 3 of Python ( the most recent version ) , but it will support version 2 in the future .
The parser is implemented using Happy , and the lexer is implemented using Alex .
Web page : http://projects.haskell.org/language-python/
Hackage : http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/language-python
Darcs : darcs get http://code.haskell.org/language-python/
Example : $ ghci Prelude > :m Language .Python.Version3.Parser Prelude Language.Python.Version3.Parser > parseModule " def inc( x ) : return x + 1
" []
Right ( Module [ Fun {fun_name = Ident " inc " , fun_args = [ Param { param_name = Ident " x " , param_annotation = Nothing , param_default = Nothing} ] , fun_result_annotation = Nothing , fun_body = [ Return {return_expr = Just ( Binary Op {operator = Plus , left_op_arg = Var ( Ident " x " ) , right_op_arg = Int 1} ) } ] } ] )

" []
Right ( Def ( Sloc { sloc_filename = " " , sloc_row = 1 , sloc_column = 1} ) , " inc( x ) : return x + 1
" ) This is the first release of the package ( version 0.1.1 ) and there is still much to be improved , in particular : - Unicode support is incomplete .
- Source locations are sub-optimal , and will eventually become source spans .
-
The pretty printer needs polish . -
The parser only supports version 3 of Python .
Support for Version 2 is a major goal , and should be straightforward .
-
Only minimal performance tuning and correctness testing has been performed .
Version 0.1.1 is not intended for production use .

Disabled people have no right to choose their NHS - funded carers despite complaints that current rules are robbing thousands of claimants of their " dignity and autonomy " , the High Court ruled yesterday .
A case brought by a paralysed former soldier and a woman suffering from a progressive muscular disease who wanted the NHS to provide a direct grant allowing them to live independently by employing their own care staff was dismissed after a judge found that legislation prevented any such payments .
Steven Harrison , 41 , who broke his neck in a diving accident in 1998 , and Valerie Garnham , 60 , who has suffered her condition since birth , were told in October last year that the NHS primary care trusts funding their care at home would no longer be able to do so because of an edict from the Department of Health ( DoH ) .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The court ruling was greeted with anger by organisations representing the disabled , who warned that handicapped people were being discriminated against for " bureaucratic convenience " and pointed out that legislation allowing the payments is already before Parliament .
An estimated 150,000 disabled people in Britain receive direct social care grants from their local authorities to pay for trained staff of their own choosing .
But if an individual 's health worsens , meaning they need so - called " continuing care " at home funded by the NHS , then they are no longer allowed direct control of the funds and must accept whatever provision is made by their primary care trust .
Campaigners say the result is that disabled people such as Mrs Garnham , who have employed their own carers for years , must dismiss them – and are often left with unfamiliar staff from care or nursing agencies whose timetable is not decided by the patient .
Mr Harrison , from Wakefield , West Yorkshire , and Mrs Garnham , from Holloway , north London , claimed their human rights were breached by the denial of direct payments and that the legislation governing the health service meant that such funding could already be given legally .
Mrs Garnham said : " I do n't look at myself as a useless cabbage that sits at home and gets withered and wizened .
Is my life worth living if I 'm going to stay in bed and wait for a local authority nurse to turn up ?
We were very proud that we actually employed five people . "
Islington Primary Care Trust in north London , which pays for Mrs Garnham 's care , is expected to pay up to three times the amount it paid her in the form of a direct grant to cover the cost of employing a nursing agency to do the same work .
But Mr Justice Silber , ruling in favour of the DoH , said there were no powers under the NHS Act 2006 for direct payments to patients .
Lawyers for Mrs Garnham said they planned to appeal .
His resignation is the latest example of the government taking a hands - on role in making major decisions at companies it is bailing out .
The government has already pushed banks to make management changes and sharply reduce or eliminate their dividends , and it also is directing many of the decisions at the troubled insurance giant American International Group , which is nearly 80 percent owned by the government after its rescue .
In deciding to urge Mr. Wagoner to step down , the Obama administration seemed mindful of the public ’s growing outrage over bailouts of private companies , as well as the bonuses paid to employees of A.I.G .
Mr. Obama is well aware that he cannot afford to give the appearance of using tax dollars to reward executives who have done a poor job , and he began signaling as early as last week that he would take a tough stance with the automakers .

In a question and answer session at the White House on Thursday , the president said there had been “ a lot of mismanagement of the auto industry over the past several years , ” and declared that more government help would be contingent on the companies ’ “ willingness to make some pretty drastic changes . ”
The plan Mr. Obama is to announce on Monday will also include government backing of warranties for G.M. and Chrysler cars and trucks , to give consumers enough confidence to buy them , even if one or both are forced into bankruptcy .
In Detroit , the G.M. board said Monday in a statement that it “ has recognized for some time that the company ’s restructuring will likely cause a significant change in the stockholders of the company and create the need for new directors with additional skills and experience . ”
A man looking to collect on a debt broke into the house of 60 - year - old woman in Brazil 's Federal District , holding her hostage for ten hours on the business end of a Sega Light Phaser .

The Light Phaser , the light gun that shipped with the Sega Master System , must be fairly common in Brazil , considering how incredibly popular the 8 - bit console was in the country — it was one of Sega 's strongest markets .
Fortunately , the man released his hostage , unharmed , after negotiating with police ( and brandishing a pair of actual deadly knives ) .
" Unharmed " means we can all laugh about it now !
In fact , heroic tipster Gustavo even gave us a free joke : " Of course he would not be able to hurt his victim - we can see that the gun was NOT plugged into the console . "
ROFL !!

Any man can look fantastic with thousands of dollars in custom tailoring and wardrobe consulting .
But can a man on a budget pull it off ?
The simple answer is yes .
Looking stylish is not reserved for people with six - figure salaries .
You do n’t have to buy this season ’s latest from the top - name designers to look good .
But you do have to work a bit harder than someone who can just keep throwing money at the problem .
Rich people get it easy — what else is new ?
Do n’t worry too much about it .
You can do great for pennies on the dollar if you ’re willing to stick to the golden rules of affordable menswear shopping :
Develop Reasonable Expectations Widen Your Shopping Options Invest in a Quality “ Core ” Wardrobe
It wo n’t come overnight and it wo n’t come effortlessly .
But you can build a head - turning personal style from scratch without ever spending more than a few bucks on most items — as long as you ’re smart about it .
1. Develop Reasonable Expectations
Shopping on a budget is about the long haul .
You ’ve got to be willing to hold out for the one - in - a - hundred good pieces that are worthwhile additions to your wardrobe .
That can be tough when you ’re tired of your current options and looking to upgrade your style !
But you ’ll need to understand what you can — and ca n’t — have on a budget if you ’re going to stay within costs .
Selection and Styles
We ’ll discuss strategies for shopping on a budget in a minute , but here ’s the reality of all of them : the selection is n’t as good as it is when money ’s not an object .
That should n’t come as a huge surprise , and it is n’t a huge obstacle .
You just have to accept that you ’re not going to be able to constantly rotate through the latest hot trends when you ’re also trying to save money .
The latest thing always costs more than last year ’s thing , even if it ’s functionally identical .
So if you ca n’t expect to stay on top of the latest trends , what should your expectations for thrifty shopping be ?
You should expect — and hold out for — decently - made clothes in good enough shape to last you several years .
You should also expect clothes in a classic style that can be paired with pieces from many different styles , rather than a unified look .
Bargain shopping is all about putting disparate pieces together into a sharp - looking whole .
Do n’t count on finding something every time you go looking for clothes .
In fact , plan on coming home empty - handed more often than not .
But if you can hold back from purchasing anything but the best wardrobe additions , you can expect to eventually have a flexible , versatile wardrobe that can combine in dozens of different ways depending on your needs .
Fit and Adjustment
Affordable clothing , almost by definition , is not going to come tailored to your body .
You ’re mostly going to be relying on off - the - rack or second - hand items .
The fit ’s not going to be perfect .
Understand that , expect it , and plan on fixing it .
After all , fit is at the top of the style pyramid for a reason .
Buy only the clothes that can be adjusted to a personalized fit ( or that fit so well they do n’t need adjusting , and count yourself very lucky if you find anything that qualifies ) .
A few minor upgrades by a tailor can be a major upgrade for your wardrobe .
If you buy clothes that can be taken in for a perfect fit , you ’ll look much better than you would in pricier clothes that you left unaltered .
Be aware that there are some things a tailor can do easily and some things they ca n’t fix .
Easy alterations include :
minor shortening at the cuffs ( jackets , pants , or shirts )
very slight lengthening at the cuffs / hem ( jackets and pants , but only if there ’s extra material inside the sleeve / leg )
shortening at the bottom hem ( shorts and jackets )
adding / removing cuffs ( trousers )
taking in a trouser waist for a skinnier fit
fixing rips at seams or hemming a ragged edge
More challenging alterations that cost more money or just are n’t possible include :
widening or tightening the collar ( shirts )
tapering the waist to be narrower ( shirts and jackets )
altering the width of the shoulders
lengthening a shirt sleeve
patching holes in the middle of the fabric
Look for the clothes that can be easily adjusted to your body ( and that you like ) — those are the ones that will give you the best value .
You ca n’t expect to find something in both a style that you like and a size that ’s workably close to your own , so be patient in your shopping and reasonable in your expectations , and do n’t lower your standards on fit just because you like an item ’s look ( or vice versa ) .
Understanding the “ Build Your Own ” Look
One of the reasons expensive stores charge what they do is that they ’re not just selling individual pieces of clothing .
They ’re selling a “ look ” that a designer put together for consumers .
That means that the top stores have everything planned out — not just what sort of suits they ’re going to offer , but what shirts they ’re going to display with them , what necktie colors and patterns they ’re emphasizing that season , and so on .
A wardrobe built piece by piece over time from bargains and thrift stores is n’t going to have that kind of unified style .
You ’re not going to have a single “ look ” that comes ready to go straight out of the box .
And there ’s nothing wrong with that .
Most of the really stylish men in the world put their look together from different pieces .
That ’s how you get to look unique .
But you need to understand from the get - go that you ’re shopping for a mix - and - match sort of wardrobe .
Versatility is the most prized characteristic a piece of clothing can have .
The more things you can wear it with , the more value you ’re getting out of your purchase .
So shop with some strict expectations for interchangeability .
The best - looking shirt in the world does n’t do your wardrobe much good if you can only wear it with one of your pairs of trousers and none of your jackets .
Skip it , and buy a more neutral shirt that ’s less fun on its own but that can be worn with a wide variety of pants , jackets , and accessories instead .
2. Widen Your Shopping Options
Where are you doing most of your clothes shopping these days ?
Odds are you could expand your options , no matter what you answered .
There ’s more than one place to find great bargains .
Here are a few that you should keep your eye on as you build your affordable wardrobe :
Thrift Stores
Thrift stores , thrift stores , thrift stores .
These are your best friends for value .
You can get some incredible bargains at thrift stores .
Most of them have pretty hard maximum prices within their various categories — so , for example , a men ’s wool suit with no obvious damage might automatically be priced at $ 25 , regardless of whether it ’s a Gap suit that originally cost $ 75 or a Brooks Brothers that cost $ 600 .
The big disadvantage of thrift stores is , of course , the selection , which is why you need to approach them with reasonable expectations .
Be ready to make a lot of trips that do n’t turn up anything .
Remember , you need to find something that ’s both useful stylistically and in your size , or at least close enough that you can adjust it to your size .
You can often find the best pickings at thrift stores near the nicest neighborhoods and suburbs .
Do n’t just limit yourself to Goodwill — lots of private businesses run thrift stores , as well as various charities .
They ’re hit or miss , but when they hit , thrift stores are often the best value out there .
You can get full suits for a tenth of what they ’d sell for in a department store , often ready to wear after $ 10 of adjustments .
Online Shopping
Shopping online as opposed to in brick - and - mortar stores usually gets praised for its convenience , but it can also save you some money — if you ’re smart about it .
Most websites these days have online - only deals and prices , usually as short , limited - time offers designed to get you to spend money now as opposed to later .
A lot of them wo n’t be worth your while .
But every once in a while one will , making it worth a bookmark on your favorite brands ’ sites .
Glance through their sales 2 - 3 times per week , ignore 95 % of the offerings , and strike when you see the sale for something you really want .
Also consider subscribing to Dappered and Primer , sites which alert readers to good deals and sales going on ( in addition to providing general style tips and advice ) .
Be cautious , however , of the extra costs shopping online can bring .
Getting a $ 45 sweater for $ 30 and then paying $ 15 in shipping and handling has n’t actually saved you any money at all .
You ’ll want to keep an eye on the return policy as well — when you buy without trying on you often have to make exchanges , and if you ’re on the hook for all the return shipping it can start to add quite a bit of cost .
The Sale Rack
Not everything has to be second - hand or an online purchase .
Old fashioned shopping in retail stores can still turn up some real bargains .
You just have to be sensible about it .
At most stores , with the exception of aggressive cost - cutters like the “ big boxes ” ( Walmart , Target , etc. ) , full - price clothing is n’t going to qualify as “ bargain shopping . ”
In fact , even clothes that are supposedly on “ sale , ” may not be a bargain either .
Retail items these days come in and are immediately marked at a “ sale ” price , only seeing further reductions , and really being put on sale , if they are n’t moving .
In other words , something with a red tag ( or whatever the “ sale ” color price tag is ) may actually be selling for the original price the retailer planned to sell it as .
They can call anything they like a “ sale , ” whether it ’s cheap or not .
But true sales do happen , and real deals can be had , especially on anything that ’s marked for “ clearance . ”
Those are the items the store wants out the door and gone for good , usually last season ’s wares or older .
You can find some pretty good stuff in there for half its original price or less .
Do know , however , that clearance items often are n’t returnable ; when all sales are final , be extra sure you want what you buy .
“ Big Box ” and Other Cheap Stores
Generally speaking , you do n’t want to be building your wardrobe at somewhere like Target or Walmart .
While their prices are great , the quality at the “ big boxes ” tends to be terrible .
The clothes just do n’t last that long .
They also ca n’t help looking a little cheap — and , because each store has its own in - house brand with a uniform style , anyone who ’s been to a Target or Walmart regularly will recognize the source when you wear that clothing .
That said , you can take advantage of the ultra - low prices the big box stores offer for a few things : socks and underwear are one obvious place , since they do n’t get particularly close inspection and need regular replacement no matter how high - quality they are .
And you can always find the occasional T - shirt or sweater that works really well with your personal style as well .
It ’s probably worth picking up those sorts of items when you see them , especially if they ’re on sale .
Do n’t plan on being a Walmart shopper for all your clothing needs , but if you shop there anyway you might as well keep an eye out .
Family and Friends
Hand - me - downs from father to son or older brother to younger are the most obvious family clothing swaps .
It ’s worth reaching out further than that , though .
Put the word out that you ’re looking to expand your closet , and would n’t mind taking old clothes off the hands of any relatives about your size .
You may be surprised at what turns up from cousins , uncles , and even in - laws .
Do n’t discount your older relatives either .
Grandparents often have more stuff accumulated than anyone else in the family , and sometimes that stuff includes old suits or jackets that were put away with mothballs .
Give them a good airing , get the necessary adjustments , and you ’re good to go .
And anyone with some basic tailoring skills can help with repairs and adjustments , saving you some cash and a trip to the tailor when you need a seam stitched up or a button sewn back on to turn “ shabby second - hand ” into “ stylishly vintage . ”
Saying “ No ”
The most crucial skill to all these methods is passing things up .
It ’s not hard to find deals .
Sales are everywhere , some of them good and some of them not .
But even the good sales wo n’t necessarily be on the items that benefit you personally .
Be picky .
Refuse to compromise .
Only buy clothing that looks sturdy enough to last a while , that suits your personal style , and that can be adjusted to fit your body without looking odd .
If it does n’t meet all those qualifications , be willing to put even a real bargain back on the table .
If you can avoid settling for less than the best , your wardrobe will be , well , the best .
3. Invest in a Quality “ Core ” Wardrobe
Does all this seem to suck the fun out of shopping ?
Do n’t let it .
Bargain - hunting is all well and good to a point .
If you ’re really good at it ( and have a little luck ) , you can build a boardroom - appropriate business outfit for $ 50 .
But there are a few things worth a little extra investment in , and that ’s the “ core ” items — the things that the rest of your wardrobe is based around .
These are different from man to man , but for most of us it means a couple pairs of trousers and jeans , a couple decent shirts , and a few jackets or sweaters , plus a suit for business occasions .
If you invest in real quality on those core items , it becomes much easier to add accent pieces to them for a good look .
The Timeless Styles
Your style is a matter of both personal taste and professional necessity .
Every man ’s is different .
But there are a few looks that have always been good for men , and always will be , at a couple different levels of formality :
Suits for business and formal occasions .
The matched suit is the wellspring from which all modern menswear flows .
It ’s what you wear when you want to look your best , and you should have a good one for those occasions .
Do n’t know where to start ?
Use the suit ladder and gradually climb its rungs .

Jackets for visual framing .
While the number of situations where a man is required to wear a jacket is dwindling , a man still looks good in one almost everywhere .
If your wardrobe includes a selection of jackets and blazers you ’ll always be ready to throw something on over your shirt in a hurry and look “ dressy ” at a moment ’s notice .

Collared shirts .
The turn - down collar is part of the core look .
It ’s not mandatory , and there are lots of occasions where you ’ll want a T - shirt or some other option without a turndown collar .
But you should always have a few plain old collared work shirts and dress shirts ready to go as part of the core .

But you should always have a few plain old collared work shirts and dress shirts ready to go as part of the core .
Leather shoes .
These are a shortcut from “ ordinary ” to “ snappy . ”
Blue jeans and an old work shirt suddenly become a style statement when you wear them with fancy leather shoes .
Try to build a good wardrobe of these as part of your core .
Having those classic menswear elements ready to go puts you in a position where you can dress as conservatively and traditionally as needed on a moment ’s notice — and where you can deliberately break the old rules of style to create your own effect just as easily .
When to Spend Big
There are a few occasions where you ’ll want to bite the bullet and spend full price for a store item , rather than hunting through sale racks and thrift stores .
There are n’t many of these occasions , but when they do crop up , do n’t be shy about doing what you have to :
Short notice .
If you have a big presentation or interview next week and you do n’t own a decent suit , you ’re going to have to bite the bullet and go get one at whatever price is offered .
Do it sooner rather than later — alterations can take a couple days , and every suit needs alterations , unless it was custom - made in the first place .

Unique items .
Every once in a while a designer will put out something that is absolutely perfect for your personal style .
If it ’s something that looks like it ’s going to sell fast and is n’t likely to return , it ’s probably worth buying at full price .
Just save this judgment call for the most perfect and necessary of items — do n’t use it as justification for anything but the very best .

Long - term investments .
Things that are going to last not just for years but for decades can represent a pretty big return on investment when you calculate their “ cost per use . ”
Paying full price for a pair of $ 350 shoes might actually be worth it , if they ’re going to be worn multiple times a week and come from a quality shoemaker whose products last for decades .
Similarly , a $ 1,000 suit that lasts thirty years is a better buy than a $ 250 that wears out in five .
Try to make all your big expenses ones with a long lifespan .
Summary : Looking Great for Less
Here ’s a quick rundown on how to look like a million bucks for less than $ 50 :
1. Develop Reasonable Expectations
expect a limited selection of styles
plan on coming home empty - handed more often than not
know what alterations you can have done cheaply ( and what you can ’t )
build your own look , rather than relying on a designer ’s vision
2. Widen Your Shopping Options
get to know the thrift store , and always look for new ones
keep an eye on online deals from your favorite brands
learn to navigate the sales rack — but beware of expensive “ sales ”
consider cheap items from “ big box ” stores for minor pieces
say “ no ” to almost everything , and only buy the perfect items
3. Invest in a Quality “ Core ” Wardrobe
know what the timeless men ’s styles are — and own them
be willing to spend a little more on things that will last
bite the bullet and pay full price if you ’re in a hurry — but try not to often
If you can stick to these guidelines you ’ll be avoiding all the shopping traps that skilled retailers have set for you .
And pretty soon , you ’ll look like a million bucks — for a lot less than that .

As the Bush era comes to a close , the list of last minute pardon requests are growing .
Perhaps the loudest demand for pardon comes ( mostly ) from Conservatives who are angry that President Bush has not acted to pardon two Border Patrol Agents Ignacio Ramos and Jose Alonso Compean .
Those who demand the pardon claim that the agents were railroaded by an “ overzealous ” U.S. Attorney for “ just doing their jobs ” when the agents fired 15 shots , one of which hit a fleeing “ drug smuggling illegal immigrant ” Aldrete - Davila in the buttocks .
If you Google “ Ramos and Compean ” you will find an endless number of articles which make some variation of this argument .
If this were a case of two Border Patrol Agents “ just doing their jobs ” acting in self defense , then I too would be demanding a pardon for these men .
Inconvenient facts which are left out of almost all of these articles point to exactly why Ramos and Compean should NOT be pardoned .
A January 29 , 2007 article written by Andrew McCarthy for The National Review ( not what I would consider a left - leaning or open borders type publication ) offers a compelling counterpoint challenging the heroic and mythical image being bandied about of the two Border Patrol Agents :
The preponderance of the evidence established that Aldrete - Davila was unarmed .
Besides Compean and Ramos , there were several other agents on the scene .
None of them believed Aldrete - Davila posed a threat to their safety ; none , other than the two defendants drew their weapons ; and Compean and Ramos neither took cover nor alerted their fellow agents to do so .
More to the point , Compean admitted to investigators early on that the smuggler had raised his hands , palms open , in an attempt to surrender .
This jibed not only with Aldrete - Davila ’s account but with that of another Border Patrol agent .
Compean opted not to take surrender , not to place the smuggler under arrest so he could be prosecuted .
On that score , for those over - heatedly analogizing the border to a battlefield , it is worth noting that even under the law of war , quarter must be given when it is sought .
Compean , to the contrary , tried to strike Aldrete - Davila with the butt of his shotgun .
But it turns out the agent was as hapless as he was malevolent .
In the assault , he succeeded only in losing his own balance .
The smuggler , naturally , took off again , whereupon Compean unleashed an incompetent fuselage — missing Aldrete - Davila with all fourteen shots .
It was only after the surrender attempt that Ramos opened fire as the unarmed smuggler neared the border .
Defending his decision to bring the case , U.S. attorney Sutton later explained : “ Border Patrol training allows for the use of deadly force when an agent reasonably fears imminent bodily injury or death .
An agent is not permitted to shoot an unarmed suspect who is running away . ”
The fact that Aldrete - Davila was a drug - dealer — something the agents may have suspected but had not yet confirmed at the time they were shooting at him — did not justify the responsive use of potentially deadly force under standard law - enforcement rules of engagement .
Even Ramos and Compean ’s supporters acknowledge that the agents shot at a fleeing suspect rather than a suspect trying to cause injury or death .
Do they really want to make every law enforcement officer in the country judge , jury , and executioner and grant the right to use lethal force against a fleeing supect *?
After all , forcing law enforcement to obey the law makes their jobs “ more difficult ” !
McCarthy continues to perhaps the most damning part of Ramos and Compean ’s actions – the cover -up :
Once Aldrete - Davila was down from Ramos ’s shot to the backside , they decided , for a second time , not to grab him so he could face justice for his crimes .
As they well knew , an arrest at that point — after 15 shots at a fleeing , unarmed man who had tried to surrender — would have shone a spotlight on their performance .
So instead , they exacerbated the already shameful display .
Instead of arresting the wounded smuggler , they put their guns away and left him behind .
But not before trying to conceal the improper discharge of their firearms .
Compean picked up and hid his shell - casings rather than leaving the scene intact for investigators .
Both agents filed false reports , failing to record the firing of their weapons though they were well aware of regulations requiring that they do so .
Because the “ heroes ” put covering their tracks ahead of doing their duty , Aldrete - Davila was eventually able to limp off to a waiting car and escape into Mexico .
Whaaaat ?
But I thought this “ drug smuggling illegal immigrant ” was a threat to national security ?
If the agents ’ actions were justified , why would they not arrest the suspect and why would they feel the need to cover - up their actions ?
Were they afraid that the “ overzealous ” Sutton had an axe to grind against the Border Patrol ?
Toward the beginning of his article , McCarthy points out that Sutton had an impressive record of prosecuting coyotes and drug smugglers and supporting the efforts of the Border Patrol .
There have even been other cases on Sutton ’s watch where agents used lethal force which resulted in fatalities .
Because these agents responded appropriately in these cases – using deadly force when there were legitimate threats to the lives of others on the part of the suspects , Sutton ’s office did not pursue charges .
On January 17 , 2007 , Sutton published a press release on official U.S. Department of Justice Letterhead in an attempt to separate “ Myth vs. Reality ” regarding this case .
Within this document contains perhaps the best argument for why the president should not pardon these men :
These agents were found guilty by a unanimous jury in a United States District Court after a trial that lasted more than two and a half weeks .
The two agents were represented by experienced and aggressive trial attorneys , both of whom vigorously challenged the Government ’s evidence through cross examination .
Both agents told their stories from the witness stand and had full opportunities to explain their version of events and to offer their own evidence .
The jury heard everything including the defendants ’ claims of self defense .
The problem for Agents Compean and Ramos is that the jury did not believe their stories because they were not true .
Being government agents , Ramos and Compean probably received a better legal defense than the average criminal defendant .
They had their day in court and they lost .
Their legal team appealed the convictions and they lost again .
This is hardly the miscarriage of justice that the pro pardon people would have us believe ; this is an example of the system actually working the way it ’s supposed to !
Ramos and Compean ’s supporters do have at least a couple of somewhat legitimate gripes though .
One being the length of the sentences ( 11 and 12 years ) and the other being use of testimony on the part of a criminal who has something to gain ( in this case , Aldrete - Davila himself ) .
But these complaints should not be directed at Sutton or the trial judge .
The blame for the length of the sentence belongs properly to the mandatory minimum sentencing law passed by congress which requires a ten year sentence for unlawful discharge of a firearm while committing a crime ( this ten year sentence is in addition to whatever other crimes the defendant is convicted of ) .
While I believe that the sentences are appropriate in this case , I am opposed to mandatory minimum sentencing laws on principle .
Judges should have the discretion to decide the appropriate punishment not a one - size - fits - all penalty regardless of any unique circumstances in a unique event .
And allowing Aldrete - Dalvia to testify against Ramos and Compean with full immunity ?
This is standard operating procedure .
Prosecutors use informants who have a motive to testify against defendants every day in this country .
Why should we be surprised that Sutton would use Aldrete - Dalvia as his star witness ?
If this approach is appropriate for the average defendant then it is certainly appropriate when those sworn to serve and protect abuse the public ’s trust .
But do n’t expect Conservatives to start demanding a repeal of mandatory minimum sentencing laws nor expect them to consider criminal justice reform .
To them this case is not about two rogue law enforcement agents but about immigration and drug policy .
The facts do not matter because the guys with the badges are always the good guys and their judgment is better than due process of law .
Certainly there are many miscarriages of justice which could be rectified with a presidential pardon ( * cough * * cough * Cory Maye * cough * * cough * ) but the case of Ramos and Compean is not such a case … no matter where one stands on immigration and drug policy .
Hopefully neither President Bush nor President - Elect Barack Obama will give in to the mindless demands of this misguided and vocal mob .
*** CORRECTION ***
Quincy pointed out that the president cannot pardon individuals who have been convicted of crimes in violation of state or local laws but only federal laws .
Cory Maye was found guilty under Mississippi law , not federal law .
My understanding has always been that the president could pardon anyone for committing any crime in the U.S .
A careful reading of Article II , Section 2 of the Constitution , however ; seems to say otherwise :
[ The president ] shall have Power to Grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States , except in Cases of Impeachment .
I also decided to do some additional research on the topic of presidential pardons to determine if the phrase “ against the United States ” applied to state and local law .
HowStuffWorks ? has a very informative article which explains how presidential pardons work .
In chapter 5 “ What a Pardon Does Not Do ” I found my answer :
One limitation is that a pardon cannot be issued for a crime that has not yet been committed .
Pardons also do n’t affect civil cases , or state or local cases .
Pardons are meant to dismiss sentences stemming from affronts to the United States through the breaking of laws .
Unfortunately , this means that Quincy is right : the president could n’t pardon Cory Maye even if he wanted to .
* Think about it : if you surrendered to law enforcement and one of the officers try to hit you with the butt of a shotgun , do you think you might try to run away ?
Contrary to conventional wisdom about the health benefits of green tea , this beverage may harm cancer patients , researchers at the University of Southern California warn .
According to researchers , drinking green tea in combination with taking cancer drugs used to treat multiple myeloma ( bone marrow cancer ) and lymphoma ( cancer of the lymphatic system ) makes the treatment completely ineffective .
Laboratory experiments on mice showed that a component of green tea called EGCG destroys anticancer activity of the drug Velcade .
Microbiologists were surprised at EGCG blocking any therapeutic action of anticancer drugs .
Herbal remedies , including green tea , have become popular among cancer patients because most anticancer drugs and chemotherapy cause serious side effects .
However , according to researchers , natural elements in green tea may be harmful for patients because they are chemically incompatible with anticancer drugs .
The study showed that green tea molecules and the Velcade molecules formed chemical bonds but the drug molecules could no longer influence tumor cells .
Therefore , the Velcade is not able to fight cancer cells and there are no side effects , so the patient gets to feel better and conclude that green tea helped cope with the disease while in reality the drug was n’t involved at all .
Health experts strongly encourage cancer patients to avoid green tea .

BANGKOK —
The girls bunked three - deep in a run-down Best Value Inn room , each of them far from home and earning minimum wage at the McDonald ’s franchise inside Pittsburgh International Airport .
Jiratchaya Intarakhumwong and her friends — law , English and business students at some of Thailand ’s most elite universities — had adopted an immigrant ’s life .
Jiratchaya would wake before the first light , don her McDonald ’s uniform in cramped quarters and catch a shuttle bus to the airport .
The morning shift began at 6 a.m .
The days were long , the work was repetitive and customers sometimes grew impatient with her sparse English .
But after her tour was over , she arrived back in Bangkok with a highly sought after bullet point on her resume : foreign work experience .
This summer , thousands of young
Thais will replicate Jiratchaya ’s experience in America , piling into cheap hotels and apartments to work jobs often left to poor Americans and immigrants with few options .
The Thai students , however , will actually pay for the privilege of frying burgers and bagging fries .
This phenomenon is known as “ work trah - VUHL ” in Thai .
It ’s fueled by Bangkok ’s upper - middle class families , who pay work travel agencies upwards of $ 3,000 — a small fortune in Thai currency — to arrange fast food jobs in America .
And it ’s a testament to Thai employers ’ high regard for American work experience , even if that experience consists of ringing up Big Macs .
“ Most of us actually chose to work at McDonald ’s , ” said Jiratchaya , now a 22 - year - old service representative at the deluxe Sofitel Hotel .
“ Employers will at least see that I could make it in America … and that I ’ve got some language skills . ”
Most students take a financial loss and earn back only half — or less — of the cash they pay agencies .
Agents set up work visas , job placements and sometimes plane tickets , but rarely rent or expenses .
Still ,
Thai students often describe their fast food tours of duty in romantic terms , as a rite of passage and a rare opportunity to work and live among Americans .
Bookstores devote whole shelves to “ work travel ” guides , which explain visa procedures and present images of young , happy Thais posing in their McDonald ’s uniforms .
The Thai - language book " Go Work , Go Study , Go Vacation in America : Do n’t Think You Can’t " is part how - to guide , part memoir about a Bangkok college student ’s stints at McDonald ’s and Whattaburger franchises in the Florida panhandle .
The author , known only as “ Baeya , ” explains in detail the concept of a “ drive - thru , ” her no -nonsense manager named “ Diamond ” and the persistent customers who tried to woo her .
“ We were all very excited , ” she wrote of her first day at McDonald’s .
“ I tried to tell myself and all my friends that we do n’t have to worry .
Even if they scold us , we wo n’t understand anyway . ”
According to U.S. State Department figures , about 150,000 foreign students came to America in 2007 under J - 1 visas , the signature visa “ work travel ” agencies must secure for their student clients .
If foreign students can prove their enrollment in a university and a passable command of English , they ’re given four months to work in America .
McDonald ’s headquarters is n’t aware of the chain ’s popularity among Thai students , said Danya Proud , the company 's senior manager of U.S. media relations .
And the fast food behemoth does n’t keep stats on foreign students since independent franchises do the hiring .
In the highly competitive post - college job circuit , a stint abroad shows initiative .
Even former
Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra once worked at a Kentucky Fried Chicken in the U.S .
“ When I was interviewed for my current job , my boss saw that I ’m an active person , ” said Wiphawee Phansiriphat , who spent the summer of 2007 at a McDonald ’s in Mobile , Ala. , before graduating from Bangkok ’s Kasetsart University .
She now handles guest relations at Bangkok ’s four - star Amari Hotel .
But not all Thai work travelers arrive in the U.S. they imagined .
Many gravitate towards states offering the lower costs of living , far from the neon - lit America portrayed by Hollywood .
“ I chose Alabama because I heard it was cheap , ” said Wiphawee , who paid an agency more than $ 3,300 for her plane ticket and McDonald ’s placement .
“ But when I arrived , I saw Mobile and I thought , wow , maybe I was wrong about this . ”
Like Jiratchaya , she lived with three other roommates .
Each day , she would leave her apartment to walk more than a mile in the Alabama heat to her McDonald ’s branch .
There , she ran the drive - thru and often struggled to decipher deep - south accents .
( Their pronunciation of “ syrup ” was particularly daunting . )
“ At first , it was kind of exciting because I ’d never been around so many ‘ farangs , ’ ” she said , using the Thai word for white - skinned foreigners .
“ But there was nothing to do in Mobile .
Nowhere to go . ”
But neither Wiphawee nor Jiratchaya regret their work travel experience .
Nor do many of their peers , who regard the American fast food crucible as a badge of honor — and a means of setting themselves apart in the post - college job search .
“ Honestly ? ” Jiratchaya said .
“ If I had money , I ’d go back . ”

Texas Sen. Cornyn challenges Obama agenda

The conservative Republican , the new head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee , delayed Senate confirmation proceedings for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Attorney General - designate Eric Holder .
He challenged Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev .
And he orchestrated a GOP plan that blocked Democrat Al Franken — embroiled in a contested race with Sen. Norm Coleman of Minnesota — from taking a Senate seat .
“ I think he has decided that the only chance Republicans have is to be very aggressive , ” political scientist Larry Sabato said of the Texan , who come to Washington six years ago as a defender of President George W. Bush .
Cornyn said the campaign committee role makes him a key player in the Senate GOP leadership as well as the architect of the party ’s Senate campaign in 2010 .
“ It ’s a lot of work , ” he said , “ but I would n’t do it if I did n’t think it would help the people of Texas . ”
Rep. Pete Olson , R - Sugar Land , who served on Cornyn ’s Senate staff , said his former boss has no ulterior motives .
“ He ’s not the kind of guy to act in a very partisan manner just to advance partisan causes , ” Olson said .
But some critics have a different take .
Critics
New York Gov. David Paterson , who appointed Rep. Kirsten Gillibrand as Clinton ’s successor , called Cornyn ’s maneuvering “ grandstanding and self - promotion . ”
And some Republican Senate colleagues want less partisanship and more collaboration .
As Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz . , put it : “ The message that the American people are sending us now is that they want us to work together and get to work . ”
Cornyn said he won a commitment from Clinton that she “ would be open ” to an across - the - board donor disclosure requirement .
He then voted for her confirmation — with 93 other senators .
Cornyn said he put the “ hold ” on Holder ’s confirmation to win a commitment that he would not press prosecutions against anyone who used harsh interrogation techniques during the Bush administration .
And Cornyn pointedly challenged Reid about alleged ties to lobbyists .
A Reid spokesman dismissed the criticism by Cornyn as having “ everything to do with raising money . ”
Pleasing conservatives
Larry Hufford , a political scientist at St. Mary ’s University in San Antonio , said Cornyn ’s high - profile challenge to Clinton ’s confirmation will please many conservative Republican donors .
“ There is no better name than Clinton to go after , ” Hufford said .
Cornyn , a master fundraiser who spent at least $ 28.5 million on his two Senate races in Texas , stands to gain political IOUs from his colleagues and a network of donor contacts as he heads the campaign committee .
Sabato said Cornyn , who has declined to rule out a future run for the White House , might use the campaign post as a springboard in 2012 .
“ There ’s not exactly a stampede of candidates throwing their hats into the ring , ” Sabato said , “ but a 10 - gallon hat from someone like Cornyn would be a pretty big hat . ”

OpenSolaris 2008.11 , the second major release of Sun Microsystems ' freely - licensed , Solaris - based operating system , hit the Web late last year packed with feature enhancements that illustrate that Sun is n't about to cede the platform stage to Linux , as brothers - in - Unix such as IBM 's AIX and Hewlett - Packard 's HP - UX have done .
Taking a cue from popular Linux distributions , Sun's OpenSolaris improvements center around a bolstered software package management framework that includes both client - side tools for installing and updating applications , and back - end facilities for channeling community packaging efforts into the project .
In my tests , I found Sun 's package management framework , which is anchored by the still - young Image Packaging System , much improved from the facilities that shipped with Solaris 10 .
However , while Sun is on the right track here , I found the software tools less streamlined and the breadth of available software packages less broad than what I 've come to expect from Linux distributions such as Ubuntu .
The other key area in which OpenSolaris shows both improvement and the need for further improvement is in the repackaging of Sun 's industry - leading , server - focused technologies for use in more general - purpose scenarios .
One of the most eye - catching features of OpenSolaris 2008.11 is its new Time Slider tool , which wraps the snapshotting capabilities of Sun's ZFS file system in an elegant and useful tool for accessing previous versions of files and directories on one 's system .
For OpenSolaris to vie successfully for larger mind share among the Linux / Unix developer community at which it is aimed , Sun must expose more of Solaris ' unique functionality in the way that the company has done with Time Slider .
For instance , no matter how well Sun and the OpenSolaris community organize their software packaging efforts , there will be a significant amount of software that wo n't run on Solaris .
It 's possible to run Linux software from OpenSolaris using the platform 's branded containers feature , but this Linux - on - Solaris option , called BrandZ , requires a significant amount of fiddling to get up and running .
For those interested in learning more about Sun 's platform , OpenSolaris can serve well as a desktop or notebook workstation , provided that the system supports your hardware .
The distribution 's installer disk is a LiveCD that makes it easy to test whether OpenSolaris supports your gear with very little investment .
OpenSolaris includes most of the default desktop software that ships with a Linux distribution , including the Firefox 3 Web browser , OpenOffice.org 3 productivity suite , and the GNOME desktop environment , with its range of included applications .
As with the Linux - based distributions from which OpenSolaris takes its organizational cues , OpenSolaris can also be used as a server operating system , running applications downloaded through IPS , installed via the traditional Solaris SVR4 package system , or compiled directly on the machine .
OpenSolaris is freely downloadable from opensolaris.com , but for those who wish to deploy OpenSolaris in production settings , Sun offers commercial support for the distribution in two levels : essential support , which starts at $ 324 per system per year , and production support , which starts at $ 2,160 per system per year .
You can find the details of these support subscriptions here .
Scientists have bred a controversial featherless chicken which they say is faster growing .
The birds , created at the Hebrew University in Israel , will not need to be plucked , saving money in processing plants .
While the researcher behind the breed concedes that they would not be suitable for cooler countries , he says that in hot climates , the birds would fare better .
It 's a normal chicken except for the fact it has no feathers
Professor Avigdor Cahaner
However , opponents of the move say that the changes do not benefit the animals , and are in fact likely to make their lives worse .
Professor Avigdor Cahaner , who led the project , told the BBC : " This is not a genetically modified chicken - it comes from a natural breed whose characteristics have been known for 50 years .
" I am just transferring that to fast growing broiler chickens .
It 's a normal chicken except for the fact it has no feathers . "
He said that broiler chickens were fed intensively to achieve fast growth , which meant they also tended to produce a lot of body heat ; and this meant that particularly in hotter countries , they " suffer tremendously " .
The featherless birds would tend to be leaner , and perhaps grow faster , he said , which would improve the quality of the meat and save producers money .
Pollution claim
Removing the plucking process would also reduce pollution , he said .
The process , he claimed , produced large quantities of water contaminated with feathers and fat .
However , animal welfare groups warned that feathers were important to help protect the birds from parasites - and that the featherless chickens were likely to suffer sunburn .
In addition , male chickens might not be able to mate , they argued .
Mr. Hossini is an HNN intern .
Most Americans have heard in the media recently that we are “ printing money ” to finance our bailouts of the financial and auto sectors .
Are we ?
The answer to the question is not as simple as it appears .
When the Fed wants to raise money for the government it sells government bonds .
The more bonds it sells the more money it raises .
As long as there are buyers the government can raise as much money as it needs .
If the buyers grow skittish the government can raise the yield on the bonds to make them more attractive .
Most of the time the Treasury sells bonds either to private investors of governments like China .
But it can also sell them to the Federal Reserve .
When the Fed buys bonds it can pay for them simply by printing money .
Economist Bill Anderson , Associate Professor of Economics at Frostburg State University , points out that “ technically , the government can print money to pay debts , although one has to remember that in our financial system , new money comes through bank loans .
In that way , we are different from countries like Argentina , Zimbabwe , or Bolivia , all of which have large numbers of state - run enterprises with people paid directly with cash that comes from the printing press .
We do n't have that kind of direct printing - press - to - purchase situation . ”
Just how much money is the U.S. government printing to meet its debts ?
Steven Horwitz , professor at St. Lawrence University , and co-author of The Austrian Economists blog , explains that the amount of money printed in the past few months since the October economic crisis , has been absolutely unprecedented in U.S. history .
“ Since September , the ' monetary base , ' which is the measure of currency plus bank reserves , has doubled from about $ 850 billion to $ 1.7 trillion , about $ 600 billion of which is in the form of bank reserves , ” he says .
Increasing the money supply should theoretically increase liquidity , one of the goals of the government since the onset of the credit crunch .
But the effect of the increase has been less than you might expect , Horwitz observes .
Only about $ 300 billion has gotten into consumers ' hands .
While the Fed is selling bonds to raise money to cover government debts , it is also buying bonds to inject liquidity into the system .
The more bonds it buys the more cash goes into circulation .
Horwitz notes that the week ending January 7th 2009 , “ the Fed increased its holdings of Treasury bonds by about $ 10 billion , while since October 1st 2008 “ it 's been about $ 215 billion . ”
According to both Horwitz and Anderson , there is a great danger of inflation in the coming months due to the Federal Reserve ’s massive expansion of the money supply .
The most inflationary period in U.S. history , according to Horwitz , was the end of the 1970s when “ inflation rates were as high as 14 % , ” while the least inflationary was in 1929 - 1933 when massive deflation caused the Great Depression to be so long .
Anderson notes that the government of Weimar Germany printed money to meet its post - WWI debts , which led to massive hyperinflation .
The Federal Reserve has expanded the monetary base to avert a crisis , as it did in the wake of the stock market crash of 1987 , according to Horwitz .
Inflation dangers would be exacerbated if the Chinese stop buying bonds , warns Anderson .
" Will the Fed be purchasing bonds directly from Treasury ? " he asks .
" If that is so , then all bets are off , as there will be no limit to the Fed 's ability to inflate . ”
A few weeks back , the lovely Tartelette posted a delicious - looking recipe for these tartelettes .
How scrumptious !
But I did n’t plan on making them anytime soon … until I realized that I needed to put together some kind of apple tart to take with me to a dessert - tasting at the cafe I ’ll be baking for ( which is opening in TWO WEEKS !
Hurray ! ) .
And I needed it … for the next day .
Eek .
I pulled this one up and saw that I had everything I needed , so away I went !
Apple Frangipane Tartelettes
( recipe from Tartelette )
Serves 8 ( 3 ″ tarts ; makes 6 if you use 4 ″ tart pans , as I did )
Sable Dough :
1 stick ( 115 gr ) butter , at room temperature
3/4 cup ( 93 gr ) powdered sugar
1 large egg
1 1 /2 cups ( 188gr ) flour
2 tablespoons ( 20 gr ) cornstarch ( makes for a lighter crumb )
pinch of salt
In a mixer , cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy .
Add the egg and mix until combined .
Add the flour , cornstarch and salt and mix briefly to incorporate .
Dump the whole mixture onto a lightly floured board and gather the dough into a smooth ball .
Do not work the dough while in the mixer or it will toughen up .
Flatten the dough into a disk , wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for an hour .
When the dough is nice and cold , roll it out on a lightly floured board or in between the sheets of plastic .
You will need half the amount of dough to make the tartelettes .
The other half can be kept in the fridge for up to 5 days or frozen , well wrapped for up to 3 months .
Cut out rounds with a 3 inch pastry ring .
Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake at 350 F for 8 - 10 minutes .
Let cool .
[ Since I do n’t have 3 ″ tart rings , I put the dough circles into my paper tart liners and baked it in there .
It came out fine . ]
If For the Honey Roasted Apples :
4 medium apples
1/2 cup honey
Preheat the oven to 350 F .
Peel core and cut the apples in thin slices .
Lay them on a couple of parchment paper lined baking sheets and drizzle at will with the honey .
Bake for 10 - 15 minutes until golden .
Let cool .
[ Next time , I ’d add another apple .
I was running a little short on ‘ petals ’ by the time tart # 6 rolled around ]
For the Frangipane Cream :
1 stick ( 115 gr ) butter , softened
1/2 cup ( 100 gr ) granulated sugar
1 cup ( 100 gr ) ground almond
seeds from one vanilla bean or 2 teaspoons vanilla paste or extract
2 eggs
1/4 cup ( 60 gr ) heavy cream
Place the butter , sugar , almond powder , vanilla bean seeds and the eggs in a large bowl and whisk until smooth ( can also be done in a food processor ) .
Add the cream but stir in it instead of whisking not to emulsify it or it will rise while baking .
Refrigerate for 30 minutes .
Place 8 baked rounds of dough in 8 pastry rings , divide the cream evenly among the rings and bake 20 minutes at 350 F .
Let cool .
Once cooled , remove the tarts from the rings and arrange the apple slices decoratively on top .
Here ’s a picture of the tart before arranging apples on top :
And another shot of it all dolled up :
Verdict ?
These were moderately simple to make , and wonderfully tasty .
They were a hit with Jeff and his friend H , and most importantly , with the owner of the cafe !
I think these will be going into the case , for sure .
In the grand abstract terms of the enlightenment , the legitimacy of government derives from the consent of the governed , and therefore no government should have the right to hand over its authority to some external body which is not democratically accountable to its own people .
So when the framers of the EU arranged for the nations of Europe to do exactly that , they were repudiating the two centuries old political struggle for the rights and liberties of ordinary citizens , of government " of the people , by the people and for the people " .
It has always been my view that this was a quite conscious decision by the EU founders who , in the wake of two world wars , came to believe that the infamous national crimes of the 20th century could be traced directly to the democratic revolutions of the 18th century , and that the only long - term solution to this was to replace democracy with oligarchy .
The blond woman on the poster stares out at a beautiful blue sea , hat in her hand and the delicate sand of the Costa Brava between her toes .
Or that is what the latest advertising campaign by the tourist board claims .
However , it has now been discovered that the idyllic photograph promoting Spain 's north - east coast was actually taken in the Bahamas .
The unrepentant tourist board admitted the picture came from a series shot on a tropical beach halfway across the world , but denied this was cheating .
It even conceded that the picture , sold by Getty Images picture agency , was digitally altered to dull the shiny yellow sand and make it look more like one of the greyer beaches of the real Costa Brava .
But it refused to accept that the resulting advertisement , with its unintentionally ironic slogan , " Where does the Costa Brava start ? " , was a lie .
Dolors Batallé , the director of the Costa Brava Girona tourism board , said it had simply failed to find pictures " of sufficient quality " of the real Costa Brava , pictured above , in order to illustrate its " conceptual " campaign .
" Our intention is not to lie , nor to suggest that the Bahamas are really better than the Costa Brava , " she told local media .
She claimed that no one ought to feel cheated if they travelled to the Costa Brava and found it did not look like the place in the photograph .
It would be " a wicked interpretation " to suggest that the board was trying to hide the truth about the Costa Brava , she said .
The Costa Brava campaign contains a second mystery .
An accompanying ­photograph is meant to show a mountaineer tramping up through the brilliant white snow of the nearby Pyrenees .
Together , the blurb claims , the photographs show people enjoying the same pure water .
The " spray of the waves " and the " snow of the mountains " is meant to come from the same source .
But is the second photograph , which looks as though it could have been taken in Nepal , really of the Pyrenees ?
Locals have their doubts .
Batallé has admitted that she too is not sure .
By April 1st , most workers will see a reduction in taxes withheld due to the $ 787 billion economic stimulus package , but unfortunately , the extra $ 65 a month for a family of four is n’t going to go very far .[ social_buttons ]
It ’s certainly not going to make the payment on a new car or house , but tax breaks on those purchases are also being touted as an important part of the stimulus package .
And it ’s not going to keep your mortgage payment current .
Other tax breaks , for parents of college students , might help those who are eligible and willing to go to school , but based on the number of underemployed college graduates we have in the US right now , I find it hard to believe that these credits are going to have a lasting impact on most families or on the economy .
Besides , you still have to come up with tuition , books , room and board for those students .
How is that going to help , unless you sell text books or rent apartments to students ?
Perhaps the most effective part of the stimulus package tax credits for families will be for homeowners who add energy - efficient windows , furnaces , water heaters , and air conditioners .
They can get a tax credit to cover 30 percent of the costs incurred , up to a total of $ 1,500 .
Even with this credit , you have to come up with the other 70 % , and you do have to own the house .
Not much help for the renters …
The Stimulus Package numbers , straight from Recovery.gov :
$ 288 billion … Tax Relief *
$ 144 billion … State and Local Fiscal Relief *
$ 111 billion … Infrastructure and science
$ 81 billion … Protecting the Vulnerable
$ 59 billion … Health Care
$ 53 billion … Education and Training
$ 43 billion … Energy
$ 8 billion … Other [*
Where “ Tax Relief ” includes $ 15 billion for Infrastructure and Science , $ 61 billion for Protecting the Vulnerable , $ 25 billion for Education and Training and $ 22 billion for Energy , so total funds are $ 126 billion for Infrastructure and Science , $ 142 billion for Protecting the Vulnerable , $ 78 billion for Education and Training , and $ 65 billion for Energy .
* State and Local Fiscal Relief – Prevents state and local cuts to health and education programs and state and local tax increases . ]
For those families with children , the $ 1,000 child tax credit would apply to more low - income families that do n’t earn enough to pay income taxes , and low - income families with three or more children will be eligible for an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit .
My personal feeling on this is that the stimulus package will benefit private enterprise more than private citizen , and if you ’re lucky enough to replace your current or lost job with one working for the infrastructure projects , then it may benefit you .
I certainly do n’t think that building more roads is going to help ( unless you ’re a contractor ) , and as far as the new car tax credit goes ?
You gotta be kidding me .
As for me ?
I can benefit more by parking my car and not driving it , by making food instead of eating out , and in general , just saving my money instead of spending it .
So what I really want to know from you is :
Where are you going to spend your extra $ 65 a month ?

The program is a partial solution to a nagging problem for YouTube .
The site records 10 times the video views as any other video - sharing Web site in the United States , yet it has proven to be hard for Google to profit from , because a vast majority of the videos are posted by anonymous users who may or may not own the copyrights to the content they upload .
While YouTube has halted much of the illegal video sharing on the site , it remains wary of placing advertisements against content without explicit permission from the owners .
As a result , only about 3 percent of the videos on the site are supported by advertising .
Image Michael Buckley quit his day job in September .
He says his online show is silly ,  but it helped pay off credit - card debt .

But the company has high hopes for the partner program .
Executives liken it to Google AdSense , the technology that revolutionized advertising and made it possible for publishers to place text advertisements next to their content .
“ Some of these people are making videos in their spare time , ” said Chad Hurley , a co-founder of YouTube .
“ We felt that if we were able to provide them a true revenue source , they ’d be able to hone their skills and create better content . ”
In a time of media industry layoffs , the revenue source  and the prospect of a one - person media company  may be especially appealing to users .
But video producers like Lisa Donovan , who posts sketch comedy onto YouTube and attracted attention in the fall for parodies of Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska , do not make it sound easy .
“ For new users , it ’s a lot of work , ” Ms. Donovan said .
“ Everybody ’s fighting to be seen online ; you have to strategize and market yourself . ”
Mr. Buckley , who majored in psychology in college and lives with his husband and four dogs in Connecticut , films his show from home .
Each episode of “ What the Buck ? ” is viewed an average of 200,000 times , and the more popular ones have reached up to three million people .
He said that writing and recording five minutes ’ worth of jokes about Britney Spears ’s comeback tour and Miley Cyrus ’s dancing abilities is not as easy as it looks .
“ I ’ve really worked hard on honing my presentation and writing skills , ” he said .
As his traffic and revenues grew , Mr. Buckley had “ so many opportunities online that I could n’t work anymore . ”
He quit his job at Live Nation , the music promoter , to focus full - time on the Web show .
There is a symmetry to Mr. Buckley ’s story .
Some so - called Internet celebrities view YouTube as a stepping stone to television .
But Mr. Buckley started on TV and found fame on YouTube .
Three months ago , he signed a development deal with HBO , an opportunity that many media aspirants dream about .
Still , “ I feel YouTube is my home , ” he said .
“ I think the biggest mistake that any of us Internet personalities can make is establish ourselves on the Internet and then abandon it . ”
Let 's face it , without JavaScript the web would be a boring place .
Unless you roll your own , well you need to use a library of some sort , and in most cases you need more than just one library to achieve your intended user experience .
Performance optimizations aside , and even if you concatenate all your JS files into a single file , you still have to load the library into the browser after the request has been made , and you can't do anything with it until that has finished loading .
Would n't it be so great if the browser had a copy of YUI or jQuery or Dojo or Prototype or GWT in memory at all times ?
Then your library using decision would not be influenced by the size of the library but by its speed and performance , and perhaps features and functionality provided .
I mean you do n't go loading new fonts and new plugins every single time you go to a new page right ?
Then why do we have to download the same 5 or 6 JS libraries over and over all day long as we browse the web ?
And if this was an option how many companies would spend time rolling out their own rather than adopting one ?
I understand there would be tons of politics involved and it will probably never happen in a million years but it is worth a try .
Perhaps at least a FF only version could be done through an add - on that loads the latest major version of all these libraries and checks for updates on startup , similar to how other plugins get updated in FireFox today .
The browser would have to namespace the libraries to avoid confusion .
Developers would then just do a test to see if the browser has a required library in memory , and if not then make a server call for it as a fail safe .
It would take lots of collaboration and standardization .
JavaScript was the sleeping giant that was brought to center stage with the success of frameworks and libraries that have fueled its standardization and resulting wider adoption .
Why not give those libraries some credit and package them into your browsers ?
When it comes to electric vehicles , the Tesla Roadster and Chevrolet Volt get all the love .
But there are other EVs rolling around , and they ’re balancing on two wheels .
Since 2007 , when Vectrix of Middletown , R.I. , first rode onto the scene with its battery - powered Maxi Scooter , a growing number of U.S. start - ups have entered the plug - in two - wheeler market .
They ’ve invested millions of dollars in vehicles , many of which are poised for production within a year .
Led by pioneers with impressive resumes , these firms predict growth in spite of the down economy , and they ’re laying claim to niche markets with such boasts as “ first ” and “ fastest ” as they stake out territory in what many believe is the future of transportation .
“ It ’s amazing how inefficient the vehicles we ’re driving today really are , ” said Forrest North , founder and chief executive of Mission Motor Co. , a San Francisco company that unveiled the prototype for its 150 - mph , 150 - mile - range electric motorcycle at the Technology , Entertainment , Design conference in Long Beach last month .
“ Electricity is just so many orders of magnitude more efficient that it ’s the only way to go , ” said North , a former mechanical designer for Tesla and leader of Stanford University ’s solar car team in the mid-1990s .

Like many EV entrepreneurs , North , 33 , had looked into hydrogen and biodiesel as power sources but found them impractical .
Hydrogen is abundant , but turning it into fuel and developing a distribution infrastructure are costly .
Biodiesel can take more energy to produce than it generates .
With electricity , the infrastructure already exists : Electrical outlets are abundant .
Battery technology is also improving about 8 % each year , North said , allowing bikes to easily upgrade once the chemistry comes along .
Already , electric two - wheelers get the equivalent of about 300 to 500 miles per gallon .
As technologies improve , they ’ll be able to generate even more energy with less weight and cost .
Billed as “ the world ’s fastest production electric sport bike , ” Mission ’s debut product is called the Mission One .
It is scheduled to ship in early 2010 , at an estimated retail price of $ 68,000 -- most of which is attributable to a large lithium - ion battery pack designed to compete with a gas - powered , performance - oriented sport bike .
It ’s the power - to - weight ratio of existing batteries that is , in part , driving development of electric two - wheelers .
Weighing less than 25 % of a typical passenger car , two - wheeled scooters and motorcycles require fewer expensive batteries to bring them to speed .
They are also simpler machines ; they require fewer components and safety features and are n’t subject to the same stringent governmental requirements as passenger cars .
Advertisement
That makes two wheels a less complicated and less expensive entry point than cars for electric drivetrain entrepreneurs , which is why electric two - wheelers also are coming on the market much faster , and more affordably , than their four - wheeled brethren .
Most currently available production electric two - wheelers cost less than $ 10,000 .
Vectrix was the first company to manufacture a production electric two - wheeler .
Since introducing its $ 11,000 , 62 - mph Maxi Scooter in August 2007 , it has unveiled a second model and sold more than 1,500 vehicles globally .
Though that is n’t a lot compared with the millions of cars sold every year , it represents a 300 % increase in annual sales from 2007 to 2008 .
This year the company says it ’s on track for 150 % sales growth .
“ Any time you bring a new technology to market , when you can horizontally grow that product , it validates to the consumer that it ’s a real technology , ” Vectrix CEO Mike Boyle said .
This spring Vectrix will roll out a third scooter model , the $ 5,195 , 30 - mph VX - 2 .
Spring is also the target launch season for two other electric two - wheelers -- Zero Motorcycles ’ Zero S and Brammo Motorsports ’ Enertia .
Like Vectrix , the S and Enertia are oriented toward the commuter market .
Unlike Vectrix , they are motorcycles .

“ The market is definitely getting excited for an electric motorcycle , ” said Neal Saiki , 42 , founder of Zero Motorcycles in Santa Cruz .
“ It ’s going to grow really rapidly as people realize how practical and fun and fast these motorcycles are .
They can be environmental and have fun . ”
Zero was the second manufacturer , after Vectrix , to make a production electric two - wheeler .
Founded by Saiki , a former NASA engineer , and funded in part by former Sun Microsystems executive Gene Banman , who now serves as Zero ’s CEO , the company has sold 200 of its $ 7,500 Zero X models -- an off - road electric motorcycle with a 50 - mph maximum speed and 40 - mile range off a single charge .
This year it expects to sell at least twice as many bikes as it expands its model offerings with an S model -- a supermoto - style , street - legal bike with a top speed of 70 mph and a maximum range of 60 miles per charge .
Hundreds of bikes is n’t much of a return on the millions of dollars that have been invested so far in Zero , but Saiki sees a strong market .
By 2011 , he anticipates Zero will be in the black and doing $ 100 million in business .
Not to be outdone , Honda and Yamaha have said they ’ll be coming out with electric motorcycles in two years .

Though a rapidly deteriorating global economy and relatively low gasoline prices may not seem like ideal conditions for launching or ramping up a company in an unproven field , many of the two - wheeled - EV start - ups say they have benefited from it .
Craig Bramscher of Brammo Motorsports in Ashland , Ore. , says he raised $ 10 million in venture capital last year -- all of it after the financial system froze up in September .
And when the first of his planned 300 Enertia bikes rolls off the line in May , he ’s thinking his firm will be aided by the government ’s $ 787 - billion economic stimulus package .
The program includes a 10 % tax credit on the purchase price of two - and three - wheeled electric vehicles with batteries generating at least 2.5 kilowatt - hours of power .
“ It seems like the right place , right time , ” said Bramscher , 48 , former owner of Santa Monica software technology firm Dream Media .
“ A lot of people have n’t forgotten we ’ve got an oil problem . ”
Brammo’s Enertia claims a top speed of 50 mph , a 35 - to 45 - mile range on a single charge of its lithium - ion battery pack and a $ 8,995 - to - $ 14,995 price tag .
The cheapest version reflects a battery - lease program that reduces the bike ’s cost , bringing it more in line with similar , gas - propelled products .
Advertisement
“ If you buy an electric vehicle , it ’s like buying three years ’ worth of gas because the batteries are the lion ’s share of the propulsion cost , ” said Bramscher , who ’s experimenting with distribution as well .
In May he ’ll launch a pilot program at a handful of Best Buy stores , where the bike can be test ridden before purchase .
Although Bramscher is confident in his product and his business mode , he ’s hesitant to discuss sales projections .
“ If the people expressing interest in test rides is any indication , it could be tremendous , ” he said .
“ I do n’t want to say numbers , because it almost seems insane . ”

Most electronic voting systems can be hacked , CIA expert says John Byrne
Published : Wednesday March 25 , 2009

This CIA expert told panel he would n't divulge CIA 's interest in voting systems in a unclassified setting A top CIA cybersecurity expert told the US Election Assistance Commission last month that most electronic voting systems are insecure , according to transcripts obtained by McClatchy Newspapers .
The comments , by CIA expert Steve Stigall , are sure to fuel a new wave of anxiety over electronic voting .
Stigall said any voting machine connected to the Internet could be easily hacked , and that while numerous US states have banned voting machines from having wireless capability , some machines can have the cards installed without officials being aware .
" You heard the old adage ' follow the money , ' " Stigall said , according to the transcript .
" I follow the vote .
And wherever the vote becomes an electron and touches a computer , that 's an opportunity for a malicious actor potentially to . . . make bad things happen . "
" Computerized electoral systems can be manipulated at five stages , from altering voter registration lists to posting results , " a summary of his remarks said .
Moreover , Stigall said that the CIA believes Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez may have fixed a recent recount in his favor using such tactics .
Chavez , he said , controlled most of the voting machines used and may have provided the program that was used to " randomly " select machines for audit during a recount .
The voting machines Venezuela used were made by Smartmatic , a company that partnered with Chavez 's government which was owned by US - based Sequoia systems until 2007 .
Sequoia also provides voting machines for the District of Columbia and 16 US states .
The CIA expert was speaking before the US Election Assistance Commission , a " tiny " agency created by Congress to modernize voting practices , during a field hearing last month in Orlando .
" While Stigall said that he was n't speaking for the CIA and would n't address U.S. voting systems , his presentation appeared to undercut calls by some U.S. politicians to shift to Internet balloting , at least for military personnel and other American citizens living overseas , " McClatchy 's Greg Gordon wrote .
" Stigall said that most Web - based ballot systems had proved to be insecure . "
" The CIA got interested in electronic systems a few years ago , Stigall said , after concluding that foreigners might try to hack U.S. election systems , " Gordon added .
" He said he could n't elaborate ' in an open , unclassified forum , ' but that any concerns would be relayed to U.S. election officials . "
Paper receipts are n't a guarantor of electronic voting security , the CIA expert added , because the votes can be changed when or after they are transmitted to a master computer tabulating the votes or when they 're posted online .

Chavez arrives at the polling place on February 14 , 2009 .
The referendum on term limits was passed with a 54 % majority vote .
By Chris Kerr
Caracas , February 6 , 2009 --
“ The reform is aimed as a personal project .
This is neither revolution nor socialism , but personal ambition ” , argued Federico Black of the student organisation Furthering the Country to the virulently anti-Chavez Venezuelan daily El Universal .
Black was referring to an amendment to Venezuela ’s constitution that will be voted on in a referendum on February 15 to remove limits on the number of times an elected official can stand for election to a public office .
If passed , it would allow Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez to stand in the presidential elections in 2012 .
According to Black , “ We have been educating the public about why you should vote ’ no ’ .
The point at issue is to explain to ordinary people and the whole country that indefinite reelection is anti-democratic and a mere personal desire … ”
Thus goes the constant and repetitive theme of the corporate media ’s coverage of the referendum campaign , hammering the same line as the US - funded right - wing opposition .
President for life ?
It misleadingly characterises the proposed reform as “ indefinite re-election ” , implying that the vote is about whether or not to make “ Chavez president for life ” .
All the amendment would do is remove existing restrictions on standing for election , Chavez , or any other incumbent , would still be required to actually win the popular vote .
As well , Venezuela ’s constitution includes the profoundly democratic right to hold a referendum on whether or not to recall any elected official from halfway through their term if 20 % of their electors sign a petition calling for one .
The opposition called a recall referendum on Chavez in 2004 , which he won .
In response , the Bolivarian government has pointed out that many states throughout the world do not have term limits for their heads of state , without this being considered anti-democratic .
Chavez has repeatedly stressed that he does “ not have any plan to be president for life .
That would be a violation of the constitution [ and also ] the political system .
That would be the end of alternative governments . ”
The referendum has become the latest battle in Venezuela ’s intense class struggle .
The Bolivarian revolution led by Chavez , which has sought to implement policies to empower the poor that have resulted in poverty rates halving , has been met by powerful resistance from the old elite , backed by the US government , and much of the middle class .
The campaign around the referendum has involved large rallies by supporters of the revolution among the poor , with 100,000 grassroots committees established to campaign for a “ yes ” vote .
The “ no ” campaign has been marked by the violent protests and riots by middle - class students that have become a hallmark of the opposition .
According to polling companies linked to the opposition ( Datanalysis ) and to the government ( IVAD , GIS ) , despite differing statistics and conclusions , two distinct trends are evident in all polls .
The first is that the majority of Venezuelans support the amendment ( varying from 51 % - 55 % ) and the second is that the support for the amendment has grown significantly since the debate over it commenced late last year .
The actual result will most likely depend on the voter turnout .
However , the question still remains , not only among conservative commentators , but progressive as well :
Is the referendum about entrenching Chavez in power permanently ?
To answer this question , we need to place the question of term limits in Venezuela ’s current situation .
Venezuela is currently experiencing a revolutionary upheaval , as the poor majority and working people seek to overcome crippling poverty and underdevelopment imposed by a corrupt elite that allowed multinationals to drain the oil - rich nation of its wealth .
Popular power
Central to this struggle from its beginning has been , in the words of Chavez , the need for “ the sovereign people [ to ] transform itself into the object and the subject of power .
This option is not negotiable for revolutionaries . ”
The desperate actions of the Venezuelan oligarchy in response to the initial reforms implemented by the Chavez government , including a failed military coup and bosses lock - out in 2002 and 2003 , made it clear that a profound and far - reaching transformation of the entire society from the bottom up was required in order for the process of change to advance .
The actions of the poor and workers in mobilising on a massive scale to defeat the attempts of the elite to overthrow the Chavez government revealed that the motor - force of the process was the people themselves .
In this sense , the revolution has achieved much in the ten years since Chavez was first sworn in as president .
Millions of people have become involved in politics for the first time and are involved in running the social missions ( community run social programs ) and other organisations from the ground up .
In particular , thousands of communal councils , grassroots bodies run democratically by groups of up to 400 families , are emerging as the base of popular power .
These are promoted as potential building blocks for a new democratic and decentralised state — through which people learn to govern — as part of constructing a socialist system .
Also , the mass - based United Socialist Party of Venezuela ( PSUV ) , with 5.8 million aspiring members , has emerged as the political instrument that can unite the previously fragmented revolutionary movement .
But , inevitably , the Bolivarian revolution was born with defects inherited from the very society it is attempting to transform .
Populism , bureaucracy and corruption still pervade Venezuelan politics .
And while those fighting for justice in Venezuela are united in various organisational structures , these structures are still new and the unity is fragile .
It has been the personal leadership role of Chavez — with his unique connection to the impoverished majority and approval ratings far higher than any other Chavista figure and even the PSUV — that has been crucial to inspiring and mobilising millions .
Chavez ’s role has been essential to maintaining unity between the often fragmented forces for progressive change , while at the same time pushing for “ revolution within the revolution ” — that is , the overcoming of the revolution ’s internal problems such as corruption and bureaucracy .
Chavez has used his connection with the masses to constantly seek to educate and radicalise , turning his weekly Alo Presidente TV show into a “ socialist school ” .
International role
Chavez ’s role transcends Venezuela ’s borders , as he has sought both to promote pro-people integration in the region and used international forum ’s to give voice to the world ’s oppressed .
This has brought Chavez into confrontation with US imperialism , however such actions have given Chavez massive moral authority .
It is true that it can not be considered a strength of the revolutionary process that so much importance is attached to an individual leader , no matter what their personal qualities .
There is the need to develop a broad - based collective leadership .
However , this requires time to develop and is one of the key aims of the PSUV , which only formed properly last year .
The role of Chavez must be considered in the context of the urgent need to deepen the revolutionary process in Venezuela and Latin America , especially in the context of the global economic crisis .
At this point in time , Chavez ’s role in using his immense authority to promote radical solutions to the crisis and consciously mobilise millions to that end is indispensable .
US imperialism and its local agents in Venezuela are fully aware of this , as they are of the danger of allowing the process to develop in order to create a collective leadership with the authority currently invested in Chavez .
This explains the vehemence of the “ no ” campaign , not supposed concerns about democracy .
Such claims are laughable from an opposition that in 2002 overthrew the elected government and installed one of Venezuela ’s richest men as president — before a mass uprising restored Chavez .
The Venezuelan people have the right to determine their political system and decide for themselves who can or cannot stand for election — this right to self - determination is the most relevant democratic principle at stake in the referendum .

His property has been trespassed onto repeatedly , his home and outbuildings broken into by two men who 've been spotted running away , his virus and spyware stripped off his computer , his emails are being tampered with , and his property buzzed by 2 helicopters and a plane , resulting in the death of one of his sheep .
W hen Mr. Griepentrog reported the break - ins and trespass to his local sheriff , the sheriff would not record the information but instead urged Mr. Griepentrog that he should go ahead and sign onto Premises ID and NAIS and started telling him about animal diseases , clearly acting as an " agent " of the DATCP and failing in the most basic protective law enforcement responsibilities he was paid to carry out by citizens in his county , including Mr. Griepentrog .
In his behavior and his words , he associates the break - ins with NAIS and then pushes it himself on Mr. Griepentrog , while denying him as a citizen his right to police protection from criminal behavior .
NAIS was formulated by Monsanto , the big meat packers and the tag companies .
It is the one of the most massive , corrupt and Orwellian regulations in the history of this country .
The DATCP is is acting in a criminally conspiratorial way in pushing NAIS forward .
And it is most certainly betraying its primary purpose which is to serve the farmers i n the state of Wisconsin - not to harass and threaten and control them
into non-existence on behalf of corporations which are their competition .
NAIS is a regulation never voted on , beyond the means and capabilities
of small farmers and in its overwhelmingly bureaucratic , industrial non-fit
to farming , destructive in its essence .
The penalties alone are draconian
and clearly aimed to terrorize and then bankrupt and ruin small farmers .
Premises ID strips away full ownership rights to property , comes with
easements that devalue a farmer 's land immediately , allows for warrantless
access to their property by government agents and is a blatant " taking . "
The primary legal questions of who will have control of the land and what
Premises ID does to ownership of property have never been answered
much less addressed by the DATCP or the USDA , and yet farmers have
been lied to , coerced , forced , and even been signed on without their
knowledge and against their will onto a " contract " that steals from them .
And now the DATCP is trespassing on people 's property to intimidate
them with the threat of court and fines for not going against their own
constitution rights of ownership and their own fundamental instinct of
self - preservation .
The DATCP appears to be going after the Amish first because they are
pacifist people and do not use the media so they are easy to attack and
eliminate in silence , and that the DATCP is next threatening Mr. Griepentrog
because he was good enough to help Mr. Emmanuel Miller , an Amish
neighbor , and because he is a leader in the country against NAIS .
Wisconsin is blessed to have the Amish and such people as Mr. Griepentrog
in its state and has a duty of care and should have gratitude for the work
they do there and the benefits they deliver to its citizens and economy and
general well - being .
To treat these people as the DATCP is doing is
unconscionable and discriminatory and its criminal corruption will be
exposed .
Mr. Nilsestuen , I am sure you have heard of Rosa Parks and Alabama .
The person and the state became symbolic of racial discrimination and
set off the civil rights movement .
I am sure you are also aware of the
profound disgust with which Americans viewed George Wallace 's efforts
to deny constitutional rights to a class of citizens in his state .
You are
looking at the beginning of such a civil rights around farming and Mr .
Griepentrog is now becoming symbolic as a Rosa Parks figure , and
Wisconsin faces being held in the same national contempt as Alabama
was .
You and the DATCP are in the position of George Wallace , as the
agents who stand against constitutional rights of its own people as well
as against human decency itself .
You are in a difficult position , caught between powerful corporations that
are intent on taking over the food supply in this country by almost any
means ( and right now it is via USDA regulations they wrote themselves
which have never been voted on by any legislature ) , and the farmers in
your state who are the salt of the earth and your tax - payer - awaiting legal
responsibility to help those farmers not only survive but do well .
If you serve those corporations , Mr. Nilsestuen , I can assure you that
you will be written about as George Wallace was and Wisconsin will be
tarred as Alabama was because Mr. Griepentrog is becoming symbolic
nationally of farming itself .
Farmers who were once isolated and sitting ducks for such corporate
abuse , are now finding friends across the country and those friends are
now organizing on their behalf to expose what you and the DATCP and
the state of Wisconsin are doing to Mr. Griepentrog , the Amish , and all
your farmers , as a series of major constitutional violations of their civil
rights , and your agency 's actions as criminally corrupt .
I encourage you to look at one case being filed now in Canada that is an
indication of where things will be moving in this country .
_michael_schmidt_slams_criminal_charges.htm .
Americans are becoming aware of regulatory and police state attacks
against their farmers www.thecompletepatient.com/journal/2009/1/30/law-enforcement-gone-ballistic-ventura-county-sheriff-relent.html and at just the time when more than ever we all want local
farmers and an end to regulatory ( corporate influenced ) tyranny .
ppjg.wordpress.com/2009/01/22/the-usdaan-unelected-bureaucracy-gone wild / that is going to be directed toward Wisconsin and the DATCP for its I encourage you to look as well at the growing outrage

EULA , you know , those software End User License Agreements you click " yes " , saying you read and agree to the terms , but in truth you never read at all .
Nothing ever comes of it so why bother reading them anyway ?
Well nobody reads those things except hackers and people looking for another reason to badmouth Microsoft or some other evil corporate entity .

Americans used to move to where the jobs were .
But now home - ownership and health insurance freeze many of them to the spot
Corbis
NEELY WHITES bought a former crack house in New Orleans and fixed it up .
It was looking really nice when Hurricane Katrina struck .
In the storm 's aftermath the neighbourhood where she lived turned even rougher than before .
Weary of drive - by shootings , Ms Whites moved to Long Beach , Mississippi , and bought a house there in September 2006 .
It was not the best timing .
The property market promptly crashed .
After fleeing a city that was literally under water , Ms Whites is now stuck in a home that is figuratively so .
She would like to move closer to her new job as a financial consultant , cutting the daily commute from an hour each way to something less onerous .
But she can not sell her home .
A nearly identical one on her street has been on the market for ages at $ 125,000 and found no takers .
Ms Whites 's mortgage is over $ 160,000 .
To make matters worse , she is in the middle of a divorce .
Not being able to sell the house prolongs that painful process .
Mobility is part of the American dream .
In “ The Grapes of Wrath ” , when Tom Joad 's farm in Oklahoma was repossessed he packed up his family in a sputtering truck and set off for California .
Things did n't work out so well for John Steinbeck 's hero .
But throughout history , Americans have dealt with economic shocks by picking themselves up and moving on .
Their mobility underpins America 's flexible , dynamic labour market .
Now it faces two threats .
One is the housing bust .
House prices have collapsed by 27 % since their peak in 2006 .
By December last year a fifth of homeowners with mortgages owed more than their homes were worth .
Such people are only half as likely to move as those whose homes are above water , estimate Joseph Gyourko and Fernando Ferreira of the Wharton School of business .
Some can not sell their homes at all .
Others could , but do n't want to take a big loss on an investment they thought was safe as houses .
Either way , they are stuck .
If a good job comes up in another town , they can not take it .
This effect is partly offset by the impact of foreclosures .
Last month alone 291,000 homes received a foreclosure notice .
The newly evicted are not merely free but obliged to move .
This is unfortunate , but although jobs are in short supply nearly everywhere , being mobile at least increases the odds of finding one .
A decade ago Andrew Oswald of the University of Warwick in Britain argued that excessive home - ownership kills jobs .
He observed that , in Europe , nations with high rates of home - ownership , such as Spain , had much higher unemployment rates than those where more people rented , such as Switzerland .
He found this effect was stronger than tax rates or employment law .
If there are few homes to rent , he argued , jobless youngsters living with their parents find it harder to move out and get work .
Immobile workers become stuck in jobs for which they are ill - suited , which is inefficient : it raises prices , reduces incomes and makes some jobs uneconomic .
Areas with high home - ownership often have a strong “ not - in - my - backyard ” ethos , with residents objecting to new development .
Homeowners commute farther than renters , which causes congestion and makes getting to work more time - consuming and costly for everyone .
Mr Oswald urged governments to stop subsidising home - ownership .
Few listened .
America subsidises more than most .
Owner - occupiers typically pay no tax on capital gains and can deduct mortgage interest from their income - tax bills .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , two government - backed mortgage firms , have squandered a fortune promoting home - ownership among the uncreditworthy .
The other threat to mobility is health insurance .
A company can buy health insurance for its employees with pre-tax dollars ; an individual can buy it only with after - tax dollars .
So although soaring premiums are prompting many firms to drop or restrict coverage , most Americans still get their health insurance from their jobs .
This makes it hard for anyone with a sick child to quit and start a new firm .
It also makes it harder to switch jobs , despite a law helping employees to stay in company plans for 18 months after they leave .
Scott Adams of the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee found that married men with no alternative source of insurance were 22 % less likely to switch jobs than those who , for example , could get covered by their wife 's employer .
Tying health care to a job can tie people to jobs they hate .
Gerry Stover , who now runs a doctors ' group in West Virginia , recalls a time when his wife was pregnant and he could n't get health insurance at a private firm .
He became a prison guard .
As a public employee , his family was covered .
But the job was neither pleasant nor a good use of his talents .
“ You have a radio and you 're put in a room with 70 criminals and told : ‘ If they get you round the neck , press the [ panic ] button ' , ” he says .
Some people even get stuck in bad marriages because they need their spouse 's health insurance .
As Alain Enthoven of Stanford University puts it , this gives new meaning to the word “ wedlock ” .
The recession seems to have slowed internal migration .
Only 11.9 % of Americans moved house between 2007 and 2008 — the most sluggish pace since records began in the 1940s .
But not everyone has been immobilised .
The postal service helps employees move by buying their homes and selling them at a loss .
A postmaster in South Carolina recently sold his pad to his employer for $ 1.2 m .
“ No wonder stamps cost so much , ” grumbles a blogger .
Stocks fell sharply Wednesday as worries about more credit losses in the banking sector and the earnings season overall took a toll on stocks .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 248.42 , or 2.9 percent , to close at 8,200.14 , bringing its losing streak to six sessions and its loss in that time to a whopping 10 percent .
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq lost 3.3 percent and 3.7 percent , respectively , after posting gains in the prior session , as volatility and uncertainty remained .
Investors are worried about earnings , questions surrounding the status of Treasury Secretary nominee Timothy Geithner 's former housekeeper and the incoming Obama administration .
Indeed , the CBOE volatility index , or VIX , jumped about 14 percent , ending just shy of 50 .
Volume was light : About 1.42 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange , well below last year 's daily average of roughly 1.9 billion .
The Dow and the S&P are actually having their worst opening to a new year ever : The Dow is down 6.6 percent since the ball dropped ; the S&P is off 6.7 percent .
Financials led today 's decline amid worries about more fallout in the sector .
Citigroup shares fell 23 percent to close at $ 4.53 , well below $ 5 , a critical mark where some institutional investors may choose to dump the stock .
Analysts have speculated that the company 's decision to shed its Smith Barney brokerage unit was the precursor to a complete breakup of the company and that it 's going to need a lot more capital .
" You 'd think the news on banks is baked in , but there 's still a lot of headwinds , " Rich Parker , head of trading at Stanford Group , told Reuters .
Plus , Parker said , the write - downs are " starting to really scare people outside of the banking area as well . "
Meanwhile , Citigroup , like JPMorgan , bumped up its earnings and now plans to report on Friday .
JPMorgan reports
Thursday , a week ahead of schedule .
JPMorgan shed 1.7 percent .
Bank of America lost 4.2 percent after analyst Richard Bove of Ladenburg Thalman cut both his 2008 and 2009 forecasts for the bank , saying it faced large losses from higher net charge - offs , loan reserves and trading losses .

American depositary shares of HSBC dropped 8 percent amid worries that Europe 's biggest bank may have to raise $ 30 billion in capital .
For the year , the company said it expected to post a loss of 3.9 billion euros , or $ 5.14 billion .
And Deutsche Bank ADRs tumbled 9.2 percent after the bank said it expects to post a $ 6.4 billion quarterly loss because of weakness in its credit rating and other issues .
Crude oil dropped 50 cents to settle at $ 37.28 a barrel after a report showed crude inventories grew by 1.2 million barrels last week .
Chevron shed 3 percent , while ExxonMobil lost 3.6 percent .
Upscale jeweler Tiffany reported its same - store sales fell 24 percentthis holiday season and warned that the softness would take a toll on its fourth - quarter earnings .
The company also issued a full - year profit warning .
And , it 's official :
This was one of the worst holiday seasons on record for retailers .
The National Retail Federation estimated retail sales dropped 2.8 percent this holiday season , the first decline since the group started tracking sales in 1995 , while the official government number showed retail sales dropped by 2.7 percent in December , much larger than the 1.4 - percent decline expected .
The morning was also dotted with a trio of banruptcy filings : west coast department - store chain Gottschalks , family - apparel chain Goody 's and telephone - equipment maker Nortel Networks .
In other economic news : Import and export prices fell for a fifth straight monthin December as costs for oil and even many nonpetroleum products declined .
However , the decline was smaller than expected .
And business inventories shrunk more than expected in November , suggesting that businesses are liquidating supplies to better match demand , though falling prices have also dented the value of inventories .

Last night ’s United Nations Security Council vote calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip passed with universal support , except from the United States who abstained from voting .
The resolution was a watered - down version of two previous UN resolutions which would have demanded an immediate ceasefire , but which the United States vetoed .
The final vote came as a result of days of negotiations , and the United States threatened to veto the third bill if it was proposed by Libya , though it eventually decided that it might allow the bill to move forward if it was proposed , as the final one was , by Britain .
With Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice at the United Nations and the vote taking place , she received a final call from President Bush instructing her to allow the bill to go through , but not to vote for it .
Rice explained that while the United States supported the text , they could not vote for it because of their special relationship with Israel .
Not that the bill meant much .
Hours later Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert announced that Israel would not respect the call , saying he did not believe the “ murderous Palestinian organizations ” would do so .
Hamas said it was studying the bill , but since Israel is n’t going to follow through on it and there is no enforcement mechanism in the bill , the question of Hamas support is really moot .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Obama is planning to sign an executive order Monday to overturn Bush - era policy that limited federal tax dollars for embryonic stem cell research , according to administration officials familiar with the deliberations .
President Obama will overturn Bush policy on embryonic stem cell research , administration officials say .
Obama 's move will be hailed by advocates for those suffering from a host of afflictions , ranging from diabetes to Parkinson 's disease , who believe that an expansion of stem - cell research could boost medical progress toward eradicating the debilitating diseases .
But many conservatives object to the destruction of human embryos because they contend that it ends a human life .
The officials said the administration is planning a Monday event at the White House at which Obama will overturn the executive order signed by President George W. Bush in August 2001 .
It barred the National Institutes of Health from funding research on embryonic stem cells beyond using 60 cell lines that existed at that time .
Interactive : Unlocking the promise of stem cells »
Tony Perkins of the conservative Family Research Council accused the White House of leaking the details Friday night so that the move gets little attention , declaring that it is " a slap in the face to Americans who believe in the dignity of all human life . "
House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , said , " Advancements in science and research have moved faster than the debates among politicians in Washington , D.C. , and breakthroughs announced in recent years confirm the full potential of stem cell research can be realized without the destruction of living human embryos . "
In addition to signing the executive order , Bush twice vetoed legislation -- in July 2006 and June 2007 -- that would have expanded federally funded embryonic stem cell research .
At the time , Bush also argued that scientific advances allowed researchers to conduct groundbreaking research without destroying human embryos .
Bush 's moves led to Democratic charges that he had put politics over science .

India : Prosecutorial division is one of the most corrupt

No .

This has facilitated corruption .
The Federal Treasurer , Wayne Swan , has prohibited China Minmetals from buying the Prominent Hill copper and gold mine from OZ Minerals , in a move that is likely to scupper the Chinese company 's $ 2.6 billion bid for the company .
Mr Swan said this afternoon the Federal Government would not endorse the deal if the $ 1.15 billion copper and gold mine was included in the transaction , because of national security concerns .
The mine is located in the Woomera Prohibited Area in South Australia - a weapons testing range .
Mr Swan said the Government is willing to consider alternative proposals relating to OZ 's other assets and businesses .
But Prominent Hill is OZ 's most valuable asset and the Treasurer 's ruling that it is too sensitive to be owned by a Chinese state - owned company has left OZ 's board frantically searching for alternative options to avoid administration .

Update 18 March 2009 : Army Investigating How and Why Troops Were Sent Into Alabama Town After Murder Spree
Via : CNSNews :
The U.S. Army has launched an inquiry into how and why active duty troops from Fort Rucker , Ala. , came to be placed on the streets of Samson , Ala. , during last week ’s murder spree in that tiny South Alabama community .
The use of the troops was a possible violation of federal law .
“ On March 10 , after a report of an apparent mass murder in Samson , Ala. , 22 military police soldiers from Fort Rucker , Ala. , along with the provost marshal , were sent to the city of Samson , ” Harvey Perritt , spokesman for the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command ( TRADOC ) at Fort Monroe , Va. , told CNSNews.com on Monday .
“ The purpose for sending the military police , the authority for doing so , and what duties they performed is the subject of an ongoing commander ’s inquiry –directed by the commanding general of U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command , Gen. Martin Dempsey . ”
TRADOC is the headquarters command for Ft. Rucker .
“ In addition to determining the facts , this inquiry will also determine whether law , regulation and policy were followed , ” Perritt added .
“ Until those facts are determined , it would be inappropriate to speculate or comment further . ”
Jim Stromenger , a dispatcher at the Samson Police Department , confirmed the MP ’s presence in the town , telling CNSNews.com that the troops “ came in to help with traffic control and to secure the crime scene ” –and the department was glad for the help .
“ We ’ve been getting a lot of calls , ” Stromenger said .
“ They were n’t here to police , let me make that clear .
They were here to help with traffic and to control the crime scene–so people would n’t trample all over ( it ) . ”
Stromenger said the town needed help–calls had gone out to all police departments in the area .
“ We only have a five - man police department , ” he told CNSNews.com .
“ We had officers from all surrounding areas helping out .
There were a lot of streets to be blocked off and there had to be someone physically there to block them off .
That ’s what these MPs were doing .
I do n’t think they were even armed .
The troops helped keep nosy people away . ”
But Stromenger said it was n’t the Samson Police Department that called for the troops .
“ I do n’t know who called Fort Rucker .
But someone did .
They would n’t have been able to come if someone had n’t , ” he added .
Under Whose Authority ?
The troops were apparently not deployed by the request of Alabama Gov. Bob Riley — or by the request of President Obama , as required by law .
When contacted by CNSNews.com , the governor ’s office could not confirm that the governor had requested help from the Army , and Gov. Riley ’s spokesman , Todd Stacy , expressed surprise when he was told that troops had been sent to the town .
No request from President Obama , meanwhile , was issued by the White House–or the Defense Department .
Wrongful use of federal troops inside U.S. borders is a violation of several federal laws , including one known as the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 , Title 18 , Section 1385 of the U.S. Code .
“ Whoever , except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress , willfully uses any part of the Army or the Air Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years , or both , ” the law states .
David Rittgers , legal policy analyst at the Cato Institute , said there are other laws barring use of federal troops outside of federal property , as well .
“ Title 18 , Section 375 of the U.S. Code is a direct restriction on military personnel , and it basically precludes any member of the army in participating in a ‘ search , seizure , arrest or other similar activity , unless participation is otherwise authorized by law , ’ “ Rittgers told CNSNews.com .
“ The security of a crime scene is something I think that would roll up in the category of a ‘ search , seizure or other activity , ’ ” Rittgers added .
In addition , there is the Insurrection Act of 1808 , as amended in 2007 , ( Title 10 , Section 331 of the U.S. Code ) under which the president can authorize troops “ to restore order and enforce the laws of the United States ” in an insurrection .
“ Whenever there is an insurrection in any State against its government , the President may , upon the request of its legislature or of its governor if the legislature cannot be convened , call into federal service such of the militia of the other States , in the number requested by that State , and use such of the armed forces , as he considers necessary to suppress the insurrection , ” the law states .
In 2007 , Congress expanded the list to include “ natural disaster , epidemic , or other serious public health emergency , terrorist attack or incident , or other condition ” as situations for which the president can authorize troops , provided that “ domestic violence has occurred to such an extent that the constituted authorities of the state or possession are incapable of maintaining public order . ”
Congress has been clear that the use of U.S. troops for civilian police purposes is forbidden .
“ One of the statutes explicitly says that military brigs ca n’t even be used to detain domestic criminals , ” Rittgers said .
“ It really is supposed to be a black and white line . ”
The U.S. Department of Justice , meanwhile , would have prosecuting authority , if any violation is deemed to have occurred .
The Justice Department did not comment for this story .
Ft. Rucker , located in Southern Alabama , is the home of Army Aviation .

I was wondering if you could direct me to the law ( or other mechanism )
that authorizes the deployment of regular U.S. Army personnel along side
civilian law enforcement on non-federal property ?
This case does not
seem to fit any of the exceptions to the Posse Comitatus Act.
Perhaps I
am mistaken .
Please clarify this issue .
What were the Fort Rucker soldiers ordered to do with regard to this
shooting incident ?
The Fort Rucker soldiers appeared to be carrying sidearms .
Were they , in
fact , carrying sidearms ?
If so , what were the rules of engagement on
this mission on 10 March 2009 in Samson , Alabama ?
Thank you ,

Robert Holding was told his sentence was an " act of mercy " A milkman who supplied cannabis to customers to ease their aches and pains has walked free from court .
Robert Holding , 72 , of Fair View Road , Burnley , admitted possession and supply of cannabis and received a suspended prison sentence at Burnley Crown Court .
The court heard that his wife has Alzheimer 's disease and recently moved into a care home .
Judge Beverley Lunt told Holding the sentence was " an act of mercy " in light of his wife 's illness .
A previous hearing was told how Holding delivered the drug while doing his rounds to 17 customers he had built up through " word - of - mouth " .
He admitted at an earlier hearing to supplying cannabis resin between April and July 2008 , and possessing cannabis with intent to supply on 17 July last year .
Prosecutor Sarah Statham told the court that police found out about his activities and raided his property when his wife and daughter were at home .
' Extremely frank '
During the raid , Holding arrived home in the van he used for his milk round and officers found nearly 6 oz ( 167g ) of cannabis split into 15 separate packets in an egg crate in the vehicle .
Miss Statham said the smallest amount the packets contained was 0.1 oz ( 3g ) of the drug and the largest amount was 0.7oz ( 20g ) .
She said the cannabis had an estimated street value of £ 450 .
She added that Holding was " extremely frank " during the course of the police interview .
She said : " He said he sold the cannabis to existing customers because they were old and had aches and pains .
" He said he sold a 9 oz ( 255g ) bar about every three weeks and sold it for a relatively cheap value .
He misguidedly believed he was providing a public service
Judge Beverley Lunt " He said that customers left him notes saying , for example , ' Can I have an ounce this week or can I have an eighth ? ' . "
The court heard that Holding has been married for 53 years and has six children and 28 grandchildren .
Philip Holden , for the defence , said in mitigation that his client became tearful at the thought of being sent to prison and not being able to see his wife .
" He is very fearful that her mental health will deteriorate further if he 's unable to see her on a daily basis , " he said .
He said an unusual feature of the case was that Holding " was n't making much of a profit " and said he made more of a profit on his milk round .
He said his oldest client was 92 and added : " Word had got out that he was a man who could supply cannabis to those of a certain age with aches and pains and he misguidedly believed he was providing a public service . "
Mr Holden said Holding sold the drug far below its street value , selling one - eighth for £ 4.10 as opposed to the £ 10 it would normally fetch .
Judge Lunt said : " You were not some philanthropist helping out the elderly out of the good of your heart .
You dealt drugs for profit in a calculated way .
It was a business . "
She added : " You did n't consider what effect those drugs might have had on the people you were supplying . "
Holding received a 36 - week sentence for each count , suspended for one year .
He also received a one - year supervision order .

The crew of the International Space Station spent this morning taking cover in a Soyuz capsule , ready to evacuate in the event of a collision with fast - moving space debris spotted by a tracking system .
According to NASASpaceflight.com , a collision with the object was originally considered to be low risk , but a fresh set of calculations put the astronauts on red alert shortly before it passed them by .
Nancy Atkinson , a Writer for Universe Today , covered the tense evacuation from her twitter feed , " Some people are tracking debris on Google Earth , say it looks like a piece of Iridium satellite . "
Last month , two satellites collided in orbit , giving the world a wake - up call that space is becoming crowded with man-made objects .
In the summer before that accident , the International Space University released a report calling for better traffic control in space .
In the last decade , the ISS has had to make eight " collision avoidance maneuvers " to avoid being hit by large debris , according to a NASA paper on the space station and the orbital debris environment .

As humans , we have a fascination with speed .
There 's something hard wired into our brain to react to adrenaline , and we all know how much adrenaline is dumped into out system when we go fast .
Over the last 100 years , we 've gone from very slow , to very fast , and every few years it seems , a new King of the production fast cars comes along .
More recently there have been so many new " hyper- cars " that we often do n't realise its faster .
Take the Bugatti Veyron for example .
This is one fast fast car , and many believe it to be the worlds fastest production car .
That however is wrong .
Take a look through the list to see where your favourite Hyper-cars come .
This list does not currently feature the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport ( SS ) due to the fact that it is currently not in production .
When it goes into production in the 3rd or 4th quarter of 2011 the list will be updated but until then , it 's not a production car and therefore does n't make it on to the list .

FARGO , North Dakota ( CNN ) --
Some residents were breathing sighs of relief Monday as the Red River receded , but an early - spring snowstorm that swept into the area prompted officials to warn the flood dangers were n't over .
North Dakota National Guard members inspect a levee along the Red River near Fargo on Monday .

With winds of 25 to 40 mph expected and as a much as a foot of new snow possible in some areas , North Dakota officials were n't ready to let down their guard .
" It 's not over , " Fargo Deputy Mayor Tim Mahoney said during a televised meeting of officials .
" We 're still in a flood fight , so now you just have to be careful and watch things , and we 'll monitor as we go along , " Mahoney said .
Still , he said , it 's time to " start thinking about what we'd do if we were n't fighting a flood , " and that the city is " going to start talking to different people to see when we can start getting things back online and get going . "
The most intense portion of the snowstorm was expected to roll through southwest and south - central North Dakota , easing some concerns that it could cause more immediate flooding at the Red River to the east .
At 8:15 p.m. Monday ( 9:15 p.m. ET ) , the Red River at Fargo was at 38.71 feet , more than 2 feet below Saturday 's crest .
The river was forecast to be below 38 feet on Tuesday and approach the 18 - foot flood level by early next week .
But officials warned the storm 's wind would cause waves in the floodwater and put more pressure on the sandbag dikes along the river .
And the National Weather Service warned of another rise in the river level in mid-April as temperatures begin to warm and melt the snow .
Watch how the storm could bring new problems »
The city planned to halt its sandbagging operation Monday .
Bruce Grubb , Fargo 's enterprise director , said 3.5 million sandbags have been filled .
Officials emphasized the process could resume at any time , particularly in the face of the storm .
In the meantime , National Weather Service meteorologist Greg Gust said , " we are very confident now that [ the ] river is in a slow decline . "
Two deaths and 50 injuries have been reported in flood - related incidents .
The injuries included victims of car wrecks caused by flooded roads , epidemiologist Kirby Kruger said .
Other problems , including mental health issues , carbon monoxide poisoning and cardiac - related events , were reported , Kruger said .
Water seeped into two of five buildings at the Oak Grove Lutheran School primary and secondary complex after a flood barrier began to leak , officials said .
School officials said the two buildings had about 6 inches of water in the basement .
The school last flooded in 1997 .
See how a levee can fail »
" We knew this flood was going to be different , " said school spokeswoman Ann Marie Campbell .
" There was a lot of emotion this morning when we got the word we had a breach . "
A contingency dike contained the water , said Fargo Mayor Dennis Walaker , but three houses between the contingency and primary dikes also flooded .

Meanwhile , on the other side of the river , residents of Moorhead , Minnesota , were waiting to see if miles of levees and sandbags there would hold .
" We 're all in this together -- so far , so good , " said U.S. Rep.
Collin Peterson , D - Minnesota , at a Sunday news conference .
" Keep vigilant , keep checking the dikes . "

MUMBAI , India ( AP ) —
A laboratory technician who allegedly tried to make a quick buck by stealing samples from the Indian sperm bank where he worked has been arrested after a doctor tipped off police , authorities said Tuesday .
The employee allegedly stole the sperm from a sperm bank in the western city of Aurangabad , and tried to sell 101 vials of it to a doctor in Mumbai for about $ 625 , Aurangabad police chief Krishna Lal Bishnoi said .
The doctor declined and called police , who arrested the lab employee and a relative , Bishnoi told The Associated Press .
“ The doctor contacted police because they ( doctors ) usually refer patients to infertility clinics for treatment .
They are never approached with sperm vials on sale , ” Bishnoi said .

CHANTILLY , Va. , Jan. 31 ( UPI ) -- A Virginia jury has awarded $ 4.75 million to a family suffering from a mold - infested " sick house , " the state 's largest - ever mold award , observers said .
The Loudoun County , Va. , panel found Friday that the home 's builder , the Drees Co. , was negligent and violated the state 's consumer protection laws after the Meng family were afflicted by headaches , dizziness and nosebleeds , The Washington Post reported .

The company denied that " shoddy construction " led to the mold , contending it was not the mold made the family sick .
The Mengs testified that before moving into their new 5,900 - square - foot house in a tony Chantilly , Va. , subdivision in 2005 , they had requested that Drees fix leaky windows in the basement .
They said they had been assured the windows were fixed , but the basement still leaked .
The Post said the homeowners alleged they later learned the company had not allowed the house 's frame to dry before installing drywall , thus creating the perfect conditions for mold to thrive all over the house .
Homeowner Wendy Meng said she was hospitalized seven times and experienced memory loss , heart palpitations and difficulty breathing , the Post reported .
Several alert Marksmen and Wonder Women have sent me the link to this article about the rise of the beard :
These days , the hirsute pursuit has evolved into a full - blown , full - grown trend .
According to the marketing research company
The NPD Group , sales of electric shavers and men ’s facial trimmers have dipped 12 percent just in the last year while beard - related activities are , well , bristling . [ … ]
Why the sudden growth spurt ?
The blustery weather — and brutal job market — are certainly part of it .
But Paul Roof , assistant professor of sociology at Charleston Southern University in South Carolina , says there are other issues at play .
“ For some it ’s a trend , but for others it ’s a way of life and simply self - expression , ” he says .
“ At the heart of the revival , I think , is the ‘ reclaiming of masculinity . ’
Beards are a direct backlash against metrosexuality and the feminization of modern man .
But beards are also the only accessory route that men have — the only way men can change their looks . ”
Let me repeat that : “ The blustery weather — and brutal job market — are certainly part of it . ”
What ?
Are they trying to claim that people out - of - work no longer have to worry about looking respectable , so PPPFFTTT !
Out pops a beard ?
Or is it saying that beards are popular , at least in part , because people ca n’t afford razors ?
I know this is not a central point of the article , which is mainly about the growing prevalence of chin - down in the culture , but that ’s just the problem — it ’s taken as a foregone conclusion that the economy has something to do with it , probably because OMG THE SKY IS FALLING ALL WE CAN THINK ABOUT IS THE ECONOMY .
I take a different view .
I believe the problematic economy and the rise in beards are completely opposite phenomena .
The economy ’s in the pooper because too many people got too greedy for imaginary money .
It ’s an ignoble period in our history , brought on by dishonest and unscrupulous dealings — perhaps unavoidably , as it all stemmed from base human nature .
But the best beards are noble — for truly remarkable cultivation , they require boldness , persistence , and a willful indifference to the status quo .
Hipsters and bikers alike may grow beards as a form of subtle rebellion ; engineers may let their faces sprout through uncaring ( for conventional standards of grooming as well as for simple effort ) ; weirdos at comic - conventions may simply want to hide weak chins .
Beards are grown today for all these reasons and many others .
Yet one element links them all — they are grown in defiance of Big Razor ’s omnipresent control of the mainstream media .
The empire built by filthy - rich huckster King Gillette appeals constantly to our masculine instincts with commercials full of swooping fighter - jets and square - jawed , clean - shaven heroes .
Virtually no romantic protagonist in the media wears a beard today , from loving husbands who buy their wives gaudy diamonds and Lexuses to aspirational Axe Body Spray and Miller Lite dude - bro meatheads .
We must look now to the example of Joseph Palmer , of Fitchburg , Massachusetts .
Palmer has the distinction of being one of the only men in recent history , at least in the West , to be imprisoned for the crime of wearing a beard .
The story comes down to us in the 1915 book Bronson Alcott ’s Fruitlands , an account of an agrarian Utopian community of the same name .
You may read the whole account here — as it ’s quite long I wo n’t reproduce it in its entirety , but it ’s a fascinating read .
However , here ’s a summary as published in the 1965 book Fashions in Hair , by Richard Corson :
In 1830 , at the age of forty - two , a quiet unobtrusive , God-fearing man named Joseph Palmer moved to Fitchburg , Massachusetts .
Normally , such an event would have caused no great stir in the community , the newcomer would have settled down and been accepted , and life would have gone on as before .
Only one thing prevented matters working out that way — Joseph Palmer wore a beard .
And in 1830 beards were not worn in Fitchburg .
Had he been merely passing through or stopping off for a few days , he would undoubtedly have been merely an object of curiosity and perhaps some thoughtless finger - pointing .
But he had come to stay , to settle among these people , to become one of them ; and this was intolerable .
The unthinkable had happened — Fitchburg was harbouring a non-conformist .
Derision changed to outrage and outrage to anger .
Palmer ’s windows were repeatedly broken , and somehow the culprits were never found .
Women crossed the street to avoid him , and their sons threw stones at him .
Even the Reverend George Trask admonished him ; and eventually , all else failing , the Church refused him communion .
Shortly afterward , Palmer was set upon in the street by four men , who threw him down , injuring his back , and attempted to shave him .
Palmer managed to drive off the assailants with his pocket knife and was thereupon arrested , beard and all , for unprovoked assault .
When he refused to pay the fine , he was imprisoned for a year in Worcester .
But this was not the end of his story .
In prison he nourished his beard and wrote letters , which he managed , with the help of his son , to smuggle out .
The letters protested that he had really been imprisoned not for assault , but for wearing a beard .
They were published in various newspapers , the case was widely discussed , public opinion shifted to his side , and Joseph Palmer and his beard became a cause célèbre .
After a time , he became such an embarrassment to the local constabulary that they suggested he forget the whole thing and go home .
He refused as a matter of principle , saying that if they wanted him out , they ’d have to carry him out .
And that is what they finally had to do .
Before he died in 1875 , Joseph Palmer had the satisfaction of seeing practically the entire male population bearded , including the local clergy .
Another excellent summary of the story , by Jon Dyer , includes the following picture of Palmer ’s tombstone :
“ Persecuted for wearing the beard . ”
It ’s not a stretch to look at Palmer ’s adversaries — reactionary brutes intent on upholding conformist , truly arbitrary cultural standards who set upon a pacifist and locked him behind bars — and see reflected in their narrow minds today ’s bumbling Wall Street greed - mongers .
It is not because of the misery those shallow wretches have wrought that we grow our beards ; rather it is in defiance of their loud , glossy , waxy - cheeked corporate media ( ironically , the components of which are created for pay by no doubt largely - hirsute creative types ) that we proudly say :
“ I am man !
I grow hair !
And you do not get to tell me I cannot . ”

La posesión de títulos mexicanos entre foráneos cae 45.8 % en 7 meses
En siete meses , inversionistas extranjeros retiraron del mercado 13 mil 138 millones de dólares al deshacerse de bonos gubernamentales , de acuerdo con información del Banco de México .
Esto significa una caída de 45.79 % del total de la tenencia de títulos del gobierno en manos de extranjeros registrada en agosto .
Analistas aseguran que México ha perdido atractivo ante países como Brasil y China , debido a que ofrecen crecimiento económico y mejores tasas de interés .
En lo que va del año , inversionistas extranjeros retiraron capital por 2 mil 252 millones de dólares ; sin embargo , la mayor fuga se observó en el último cuatrimestre de 2008 .
La cifra de bonos gubernamentales en poder de extranjeros pasó de 28 mil 694 millones de dólares en agosto del año pasado a 15 mil 556 millones de dólares a finales de febrero .
En entrevista , expertos coincidieron en que los capitales , además de buscar un buen rendimiento , están interesados en que el país al que destinan sus recursos esté en proceso de crecimiento .
Desde esa perspectiva , Brasil ofrece actualmente altas tasas de interés a la inversión por 10.71 % , mientras en México , la tasa de los bonos a 10 años se ubica en 8.82 % .
En el segundo aspecto , señalaron que México está en desventaja ante naciones como China , cuyo gobierno pronostica un crecimiento económico de 8 % para este año , mientras en México se prevé una contracción de al menos 2 % .
Advirtieron también que ante la crisis económica mundial , los inversionistas deciden no ingresar a países con mayores perspectivas de riesgo .
" President Obama sort of pulled the rug out from all of us last week , " declared Open the Government director Patrice McDermott , opening a panel at American University 's conference on Information Policy in the New Administration .
" We 're very happy that he did , " she quickly added .
It 's a vertiginous moment for the government watchdogs and transparency advocates who gathered Thursday to discuss the prospects for broader access to information under the Obama administration .
After eight years of struggling to extract scraps of data from the executive branch , the new occupant of the Oval Office superseded many of their central talking points within the first few days of his term , issuing an executive order directing federal agencies to err on the side of disclosure , a stark reversal of longstanding policy that McDermott pithily summarized as " when in doubt , leave it out . "
That does n't mean they 're breaking out the champagne just yet , however , since as McDermott noted , " memos are wonderful ... but actually getting the agencies to do it and actually getting them implemented is another whole kettle of fish . "
Executive leadership is important , but it faces a culture of concealment in federal agencies that is as much a function of institutional incentives as formal directives .
For example , when a report from the Government Accountability Office was supposedly found in a cave in Tora Bora , it " frightened the hell out of the executive branch of the government ; they did n't want to be the one whose information was found in Al Qaeda 's hands . "
One way of beginning to change that tone , she suggested , would be to direct agency heads to review the " massive , massive amounts of information " pulled from government websites after the September 11th attacks to determine what was removed and how much can be restored .
Still more important , she argued , would be the promulgation of rules and standards for " controlled unclassified information " ( CUI ) .
Though guidelines and procedures for formal classification have been tweaked and developed over the decades , CUI designation remains far more discretionary , and according to McDermott , seldom gives much weight to the public interest — and , indeed , the potential security interest — in dissemination of information .
Challenges for transparency
Though heartened by the new administration 's enthusiasm for technology — and the decision to let the president keep his Blackberry , with electronic communications subject to the Presidential Records
Act — she noted that the " parlous " state of government technology more broadly would create challenges for transparency .
To be able to disclose information , after all , you need a database that 's well - maintained enough for people to be able to find that information .
Already , she said , the federal historical record is " potentially in shambles , but we really do n't know what the extent of the problem is . "
Openness will only exacerbate the problem , as agencies brace for an unprecedented influx of digital comments and communications from citizens .
Despite all this , McDermott said her colleagues were " walking around with big grins on their faces , " perhaps because of signals cited by David Sohn of the Center for Democracy and Technology that " this administration regards transparency as a meta - issue that needs to pervade all their other decisions . "
At least one of those signals , however , was somewhat dubious : Sohn joined a number of bloggers in hailing the newly Spartan " robots.txt " exclusion file at WhiteHouse.gov as evidence of a new commitment to transparency , though as Ars and others have pointed out , the previous list , while longer , was not especially nefarious .
Sohn did agree , however , with another argument we 've recently made : " The government policy on the use of cookies and other tracking technology on government websites goes back to about 2000 and is really very restrictive , " he noted .
" Being able to identify a repeat visitor to a site can also help yield some functionality gains and help make sites more usable and more user friendly . "
While he joined the general chorus of praise for Obama 's new Freedom of Information
Act directive , Sohn also hoped the government would continue its progress toward " affirmative disclosure " — putting information online automatically , without waiting for a FOIA request .
That , he noted , is a bigger task than it might appear , since it means every government employee who creates any sort of document would need to write with an eye toward future disclosure , which would entail ( for instance ) marking private or personal information that might be included in a strictly internal document , but should be redacted before public release .
Such affirmative disclosure would likely mean taking an architectural approach to transparency — that is to say , building government technology with disclosure in mind at the beginning rather than an add - on after the fact , in the same way that best practices would require incorporating privacy and security criteria at the design stage .
This will also , Sohn believes , require changes to the Privacy Act of 1974 , written " for a world where the government 's records on people were held in paper - file cabinets alphabetized by name or numerically by Social Security number . "
Cultures of secrecy
For Michael German , a former FBI agent who now hangs his hat at the American Civil Liberties Union , the need for transparency is greatest in the very place it 's least present : in the intelligence and law enforcement agencies .
Citing the ACLU 's transition recommendations on overclassification , German called for an end to the policy of reclassifying previously declassified documents , and ending the use of " control markings " as a substitute for formal classification .
Invoking a famous speech by John F. Kennedy condemning excessive secrecy at the height of the Cold War , German asked rhetorically whether the war on terror truly presented a greater existential threat , or a greater corresponding need for secrecy , than a nuclear - armed Soviet Union .
But German also stressed that the culture of secrecy could n't be blamed entirely on the Bush administration , reminding the audience that the 1997 Moynihan Commission had identified many of the same problems .
Thanks to the recent explosion of fusion centers , German argued , the federal penchant for secrecy is infecting state governments .
He pointed to a recent case in Virginia where state FOIA laws were watered down to exempt unclassified documents bearing " control markings " used to guide state officials in treating unclassified documents with care .
The purpose of these designations , German insisted , was to encourage the sharing of unclassified but sensitive information , not to force states to recognize them as a new form of de facto classification .
A lesser - known breakthrough
While the new administration 's FOIA directive has been widely discussed , Thomas Devine of the Government Accountability Project pointed to a lesser known " breakthrough in transparency through accountability , " lost in the shuffle of the stimulus bill making its way through Congress .
Tucked away in that massive legislation is a major overhaul of the Whistleblower Protection Act , the federal statute that protects government workers who come forward with evidence of official malfeasance .
The new rules , Devine enthused , would set a " global gold standard for freedom of speech for government employees — freedom of speech where it counts . "
The current law , he said , had been badly watered down by court ruling which had dramatically narrowed the class of employees protected by the law .
Currently , for example , the statute only protects the first person to draw attention to an alleged misdeed , so that " If you 're not the Christopher Columbus of your scandal , so much for whistleblower protections . "
The reform would also protect those who blow the whistle on the basis of a " reasonable belief " they 've discovered wrongdoing , rather than requiring ( in the court 's unusual choice of words ) " irrefragable " proof .
Ensuring that the Senate ratifies the House language was clearly Devine 's top priority .
A close second , however , was to " repatriate the exile whistleblowers who were purged " during the previous administration , which he said would be " the single best step the president can take to earn the confidence of cynical people whose professional lives have been ruined . "
Transparency within government
Where most panelists focused on government transparency to the public , Sharon Bradford Franklin of the Constitution Project argued that it was equally important to restore transparency within government , which she said had been eroded under the Bush administration 's expansive view of executive authority .
In particular , she cited the highly limited " Gang of Eight " briefings given to congressional leaders on the National Security Agency 's program of warrantless surveillance .
Such limited disclosure , she argued , is meant to be restricted to narrow and exceptional circumstances .
Similarly , when that program was finally placed under the aegis of the secret FISA court , the administration determined that only the House and Senate intelligence committees would be privy to the orders , usurping what Franklin said was Congress ' prerogative to determine its committee jurisdiction .
If the panelists themselves seemed a bit giddy , despite their best efforts to retain a measure of skepticism , their remarks highlighted just how difficult it will be to achieve genuine transparency , even assuming a high - level commitment to that end .
Aside from the problem of reforming entrenched institutional cultures not easily altered by presidential directive , the new administration 's own enthusiasm for new communications technologies presents novel problems of information management that will intrinsically present hurdles to openness , whether or not that 's the intent .
So take heed , watchdogs : a spiffy new website and a presidential smartphone are good signs , but they 're posted at the side of a very long road .
Obama institutes ethics rules , freezes salaries
President Barack Obama 's first public act in office Wednesday was to formalize strict new limits on lobbyists operating in his White House and peel back presidential decision - making to allow more public scrutiny .
Obama made several moves aimed at creating what he called " a new standard of openness " about the behind - the - scenes machinations of his White House — and those before it .
Chief among them was requiring that the White House consult with the attorney general and White House counsel " any time the American people want to know something that I or a former president want to withhold . "
" Information will not be withheld just because I say so , " Obama said while attending a ceremony in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building to swear in about two dozen of his most senior aides .
" It will be withheld because a separate authority believes my request is well grounded in the Constitution . "
Some of the Bush - era documents generating intense interest , for instance , deal with the highly secretive decision - making process on the CIA 's interrogation and detention programs for terrorism suspects .
Congress and civil rights and human rights organizations have been clamoring for the information .
Obama revoked an executive order issued by President George W. Bush less than two months after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks that allowed past presidents to exert executive privilege to keep some of their White House papers private .
The order was viewed as ushering in a new era of presidential secrecy .
Under the 1978 Presidential Records
Act , presidential records are the property of government , not ex-presidents , and are to be released after 12 years , except for those withheld for national security or certain personal reasons specified by law .
Obama also reinstituted a presumption of disclosure for Freedom of Information Act requests about the workings of government .
This , too , is a reversal of Bush actions .
Reporters and public - interest groups often make use of the law to explore how and why government decisions were made ; they are often stymied as agencies claim legal exemptions to the law .
But Obama said he was directing agencies that vet requests for information to err on the side of making information public — not to look for reasons to legally withhold it .
" For a long time now , there 's been too much secrecy in this city , " he said .
One of Obama 's new rules aimed at tamping down the influence - peddling game said that any lobbyists who get a job across his administration may not work on matters that they lobbied on and cannot even work in any agency they lobbied over the past years .
But William Corr , nominated for deputy secretary of the Health and Human Services Department , is listed in House and Senate records last year as having lobbied the agency , among other entities , on behalf of the Campaign for Tobacco - Free Kids .
And William J. Lynn III , Obama 's choice for the No. 2 at the Defense Department , was listed as a top lobbyist at the Pentagon for Raytheon Co. , a major defense contractor .
" Even the toughest rules require reasonable exceptions , " White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said .
" Our waiver provisions are designed to allow uniquely qualified individuals like Bill Corr and Bill Lynn to serve the public interest in these critical times . "
The new lobbying rules also bar any Obama aides from trying to influence his administration when they leave , prohibiting them from lobbying former colleagues for two years .
As a White House candidate , Obama vigorously campaigned against lobbyists ' influence and painted himself as an outsider .
Yet he allowed lobbyists to work on his transition team as long as they stopped their advocacy efforts , did n't work in the fields they lobbied for and pledged not to lobby on their transition areas for a year .
Obama said the steps " represent a clean break from business as usual . "
The watchdog group Democracy 21 said Obama called it " the toughest and most far - reaching revolving door provisions ever adopted . "
However , President Bill Clinton issued an executive order on his first day in office in 1993 that prohibited senior executive - branch employees from lobbying their former colleagues within five years of leaving their government jobs .
The " revolving door " ban remained in effect until Clinton left the White House in 2001 , when he lifted it .
Bush issued more general guidance early in his tenure , reminding top aides of the laws dealing with bribery and conflicts of interest .
That law permanently banned top executive branch officials from lobbying on matters in which they were personally and substantially involved while in government .
For matters over which they had responsibility but not personal involvement , the ban is for two years .
Obama on Wednesday also moved to freeze the salaries of high - paid aides in a mostly symbolic nod to the country 's economic turmoil .
The pay freeze would hold salaries at their current levels for the roughly 100 White House employees who make over $ 100,000 a year .
" Families are tightening their belts , and so should Washington , " said the new president , taking office amid startlingly bad economic times that many fear will grow worse .
Those affected by the freeze include the high - profile jobs of White House chief of staff , national security adviser and press secretary , as well as some who work in relative anonymity .
The White House said the move would help it stretch its budget , but it will have little practical effect .
White House employees are n't due for automatic raises , getting them only at the president 's discretion , and in any case the amount in question is small since it deals with only a small portion of the White House staff .

It might be small but this latest British invention will definitely help you park everywhere you wish to .
The car , dubbed Peel 50 , claims to be the smallest car in the world .
Besides being legally allowed in UK , it is also parked among the 800 exhibits found at Ripley 's Believe It Or Not !
Museum .
Today is the first time the museum presents the miniature vehicle that promises to take people for a ride into the world of bizarre .
The invention represents a three - wheeled micro car and is the smallest to go in mass production .
Initially Peel 50 was created in 1960 by the Manx Peel Engineering Company .
Back then there were 50 units launched into production , each unit being available for GBP200 .
The small car was developed as a city vehicle and was advertised as able to seat one adult person and a shopping bag .
Peel 5 has one door , found on the left side , one widescreen wiper and a single headlight .
The car measures a length of 134 and a width of 99 cm .
Its weight is just 59 kg and is expected to be a huge hit in the United Kingdom .
The last time a Pope of the Catholic Church defined an infallible dogma was in the year 1950 .
Pope Pius XII used this power reserved for the Vicar of Christ when speaking ex cathedra to define the Dogma of the Assumption of Mary .
It was an extraordinary event because a pope using the power of infallibly to define a dogma is done so rarely , and most popes have never used this power .
Before Pius XII , the last pope to invoke papal infallibly to define a dogma was Pius IX in 1854 , when he defined the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception .
Both of these dogmas referred to events that had occurred 19 centuries before , and that had been studied by the best minds of the Church for almost as long .
That ’s because when making an infallible statement – it goes without saying – it ca n’t contain any errors !
Fast forward to 2009 and Pope Benedict XVI has just defined a new dogma regarding a secular event that has nothing to do with the Faith .
Moreover , this ‘ dogmatic event ’ only occurred in the middle of the 20th Century - and no one is allowed to investigate to see if it contains any errors !
A dogma is an infallible teaching of the Catholic Church that must be believed by every Catholic or they ’re not in communion with the Church .
In the past , a dogma referred only to a matter of Christian faith , and Catholics could believe whatever they wanted about historical events .
But today ’s remarks from the Vatican make it clear that the Jewish version of the Holocaust , in which 6 million Jews were killed in gas chambers , must be believed by every Catholic or they ’re not in communion with the Church .
That makes the Holocaust an official ‘ dogma ’ of the Catholic Faith ( * sarcasm * ) .
Here ’s the news out of the Vatican .
On Jan. 28 , the pope said he felt “ full and indisputable solidarity ” with Jews , and warned against any denial of the full horror of the Nazi genocide .
Bishop Williamson , in order to be admitted to episcopal functions within the church , will have to take his distance , in an absolutely unequivocal and public fashion , from his position on the Shoah , which the Holy Father was not aware of when the excommunication was lifted , ” the statement said .
The Shoah is the Hebrew term for the Holocaust .
Jewish groups welcomed the Vatican statement , saying it satisfied their key demand .
“ This was the sign the Jewish world has been waiting for , ” said Ronald Lauder , president of the World Jewish Congress .
Yes , this is the sign the Jewish world has been waiting for , but what exactly does this “ sign ” really mean ?
It means that in the post - Vatican II Church , the “ Shoah ” has replaced the Crucifixion as the central event in history .
And do you notice the subtle switcheroo here ?
Now , instead of the central tenet of the Christian faith pertaining to the murder of the Christ by Jews , the new central tenet refers to the murder of Jews by Christians !
This should come as no surprise to those who understand what really lies at the heart of the problem .
At its core , this is a spiritual battle that ’s being waged above our heads .
It ’s Christ vs. anti-Christ , and each of us must choose a side .
Lucifer wanted to be equal to God and out of pride refused to accept being a servant .
When he uttered his famous “ non servium ” he took a third of the angels with him and set about waging war against God .
When God sent His Son to redeem the world , Lucifer tried to prevent it .
He took Jesus to the mountain top and tempted Him , saying “ if you just bow down and worship me , I will give you all these things . ”
Jesus told the devil to buzz off .
The Jews who rejected Jesus as the Messiah did so out of racial pride and ambition .
They wanted an earthly kingdom where they would always be the ‘ Chosen Ones ’ and did not want to share a kingdom with the gentiles .
But Jesus emphatically said that His kingdom was not of this world and to share the good news with the gentiles .
The Jews who accepted the Messiah became the first Christians , and those who rejected Him fell into spiritual blindness .
Satan takes advantage of Jewish hatred of Jesus and uses them to battle against the Church of Christ .
The Jews continue to wait for a worldly Messiah , but the Messiah they await is known to us as the anti-Christ .
Therefore , all Christians must love and pray for the Jewish people to accept Christ as the Messiah , thereby snatching them from the jaws of Satan , whom they do n’t realize they are serving .
This battle between Christ and anti-Christ is 2,000 years old and all popes throughout history have waged it ( at least until 1958 ) .
That ’s what makes the Church ’s post - Vatican II attitude toward the Jews so perplexing , since it enables them to continue in spiritual blindness and sets the stage for the coming of the anti-Christ .
Pope Leo XIII had a vision at the end of the 19th Century in which he forsaw that the devil had been given extra powers for 100 years to try to destroy the Church .
This seems to coincide with the shift in power that took place in the 20th Century when after two world wars , the Jews took Palestine and solidified their control over the West .
This was also the century in which the Jews unleashed their most deadly weapon , Communism , which caused the deaths of millions of people .
But these people ’s genocides go unnoticed and certainly have not been declared “ dogma ” by a pope of the Catholic Church .
Another clue that something is amiss inside the Church is that the Second Vatican Council refused to condemn Communism , but declared that anti-Semitism was a sin ( without defining what constitutes anti-Semitism ) .
Enter Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre , the Society of St. Pius X ( SSPX ) , and the man who ’s currently being crucified , Bishop Richard Williamson .
Archbishop Lefebvre himself had fought inside the Second Vatican Council to prevent the coup of the liberals .
He also stated that the mere fact that the Council refused to condemn Communism was enough to call the Council into question .
The Archbishop knew that something nefarious had happened inside the Church and sensed that he was waging a battle against powers and principalities .
In terms of his plans to restore Tradition , in the Biography of Marcel Lefebvre by Bishop Tissier de Mallerais , he quotes the Archbishop as saying ( pp. 500-501 ) :
The Council is a non-infallible act of the Magisterium and , therefore , it is open to being influenced by a bad spirit …
Therefore , we need to apply the criterion of Tradition to the various Council documents to see what we can keep , what needs clarifying , and what should be rejected .
And that ’s exactly the whole point of the negotiations between the SSPX and the Vatican that have been going on for almost 40 years .
After the release of the Latin Mass and the lifting of the excommunications , the next phase is doctrinal discussions .
But somebody does n’t want that to happen .
Archbishop Lefebvre founded the SSPX in 1970 in order to train priests in Tradition and not in the confusing , untraditional , Judeo - Masonic manner of the post - Conciliar era .
The greatest threat to Revolutionaries is those who are not afraid to resist them to the face , i.e. , the Counter - Revolutionaries .
That is why Pope John Paul II would not allow Archbishop Lefebvre to consecrecate bishops , something that is usually rubber - stamped for every other order .
John Paul II wanted the SSPX to go extinct after the death of its founder and put a stop to the Counter - Revolution .
And if the Council really was influenced by a “ bad spirit ” as the Archbishop said , then certainly any attempt to exorcise this bad spirit would be met with the fiercest resistance by those who work for the anti-Christ .
This is where the controversy over Bishop Williamson ’s remarks about the actual number of Jews killed in the Holocaust comes into the scenario .
If the Jews are ( wittingly or unwittingly ) working to bring about the reign of the anti-Christ , then part of their strategy has to be to neutralize the Church .
In their effort to overturn the crucifixion and replace it with the “ Shoah , ” they ’re trying to utilize the Church to bring this about .
And any force that appears to provide resistance to this switcheroo will be seen as the gravest possible threat .
Because truly , it would n’t have mattered if Bishop Williamson had not said a word about the Shoah , they would have found something else to try to impede the Church ’s return to Tradition .
Because Christ and anti-Christ cannot co-exist on equal terms – one must naturally dominate the other .
And the Church returning to Tradition and her normal role as the Church Militant is the one monkey wrench that could be thrown into the plans of the anti-Christ .
No other challenger intimidates them , absolutely no one else causes them to tremble .
But a fully traditional Church Militant with a billion souls in her army is the one thing that could defeat their plans .
And that ’s what this is really all about .
Bishop Williamson now finds himself in the center of a controvery that has been coming to a head for a very long time .
In perusing the Catholic blogosphere , it appears that most Catholics ( even trads ) wish that he had just kept his mouth shut .
But they would probably have said the same thing to Jesus , so as not to annoy the Pharisees .
But I ’m convinced Our Lord Jesus Christ knows what he is doing .
Because it is time to confront the truth , as the the hour glass of time winds down , and get ready for the final conflagration .
But it appears most Christians would rather retreat to the hills , than risk not being popular with the world .
Thankfully , for the sake of our salvation , Jesus Himself was not so pusillanimous .
And hopefully Bishop Williamson wo n’t be so pusillanimous either , since his founder , Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre , most assuredly was not .
The Archbishop personally chose Richard Williamson to carry on his work after his death , to be a successor to the apostles .
The only question that remains is : will he be like St. John or like the others who abandoned Jesus “ for fear of the Jews ’ ?
The Church and the Jews have been locked in this battle for 2,000 years , so this latest controversy is nothing to be surprised about .
Satan uses the poor , blinded Jews to attack the Lord ’s Church because he does n’t want us or them to be saved .
But at least in the past , it used to be clear which side the popes were on !
The Pope and SSPX bishops need all our prayers and support right now , because they are going through a trial by fire .
And , at least in this early stage , it appears Bishop Fellay is starting to get cold feet .
Every day for the past several days he has issued a denunciation of his colleague , Bishop Williamson , each one more hysterical than the last .
He even went so far as to refer to the Jews as our “ elder brothers in the faith , ” as though the Talmud has anything to do with our Faith .
When I said last week that I wished Bishop Fellay would one day be pope , I did n’t mean in the mold of John Paul II !
Let us pray especially for Pope Benedict XVI , the keeper of the keys to heaven , that he prove himself a worthy successor of St. Peter , and that he not imitate Peter in his denial of Jesus Christ .
Archbishop Lefebvre recognized that the day would come when the SSPX would be called on to save the Church .
And judging by the howls and screams from the satanic press , that day might be just around the corner .
Let us hope that we also have the courage to stand beside them , no matter how much the media attack and lambaste us .
It ’s for the Jews ’ own good after all , for they know not whom they are serving .
As the Archbishop wrote in 1966 ( ibid , pp. 382-83 ) :
When the Holy Father realizes that those whom he trusted are leading the Church to her ruin , he will find himself a group of bishops … who are ready to rebuild .
Unfortunately , the time has not yet come , because the Holy Father himself must change what he is doing , and that conversion will be painful .
Let us hope that the time has come and that Pope Benedict will accept the help of the SSPX .
It is time for the Holy Father to stop taking sides with the enemies of the Church and to stop defining secular events as “ dogma , ” especially ones so riddled through with holes .
May God save the Church through His servant , Pope Benedict , although the Pope ’s conversion will be painful .

EVEN DIEHARD REPUBLICANS
can't deny that Barack Obama is the more charismatic candidate for president this year .
He has shown unprecedented power to raise money and to draw crowds - from Oregon to Pennsylvania , tens of thousands have turned out to hear Obama speak .
Can one imagine John McCain trying to fill a football stadium for his nomination acceptance speech , as Obama plans to do in Denver next month ?
Obama 's crowds during the primary season were not only the biggest of all candidates , but the most enthusiastic , with the weepiest adults and the most children held aloft on shoulders .
Obama is not the first politician to have worldwide , rock - star appeal , as a January newspaper headline from Frankfurt reminds us : " Lincoln , Kennedy , Obama . "
Throughout history , certain people have seemed to possess an unusual , even inborn power to command attention .
The Greeks called it charisma , meaning " gift , " and that sums up perfectly the popular view of this trait : that it 's something mysterious , not earned but given , by God or by fortunate genetics .
Some people just seem to have it .
But some scholars think we can do better .
Charisma , they argue , can be analyzed , understood , and broken down into parts .
Some researchers are discovering that particular words or phrasings are perceived as charismatic , while others have scrutinized nonverbal cues , such as how the charismatic smile or hold their heads .
Trying to understand phenomena like Barack Obama - or , in recent years , Ronald Reagan or Bill Clinton - they are discovering some of the secrets of the gift .
In the process , it is becoming clear that while not everybody can be an Obama , there are aspects of charisma that even the least magnetic among us might learn .
For some , learning what goes into charisma might mean we 'll be better able to sell cars or copier toner , while for others it might help in a race for school committee .
For everyone , though , the new charisma studies offer a deeper understanding of how some famous people , whether politicians or rock stars , conjure such extraordinary appeal .
The most ambitious theory of charisma yet - a theory that helps explain all the other theories - was described last year in the book " It , " by Joseph Roach , professor of English and theater studies at Yale .
What people are responding to in charismatics , Roach writes , " is the power of apparently effortless embodiment of contradictory qualities simultaneously : strength and vulnerability , innocence and experience , and singularity and typicality among them . "
Among the people who have best embodied these contradictory qualities at the same time are King Charles II of England , Johnny Depp , Michael Jackson , and Princess Diana .
One way this embodiment of contradictions gives people charisma is when it makes them both grand and approachable .
" People need to resent their idols as well as to adore them , " Roach said in an interview , " tearing them down even as they build them up .
People seek out figures whose personalities broadcast contradiction because they make it easier for them instantly to gratify their own contradictory needs .
One of those needs is for ' public intimacy , ' the assurance that the person who 's not like anyone we 've ever met is just like one of us after all . "
Princess Diana , for example , was both royalty and a castoff from royalty , and being cast off aggravated an insecurity that made her need the people as the people needed her .
" On walking into a room - whether she was visiting a prison , a hospice , or a leprosarium - she saw right away which ones needed her most , and they felt uniquely valued because she needed them , " Roach writes .
Those who lack Diana 's contradictions , those who are as purely great or fortunate as , say , her mother - in - law , the queen , are far less charismatic .
Barack Obama embodies many contradictions .
He is both black ( his father ) and white ( his mother ) ; from an exotic locale ( by birth in Hawaii ) and from a big city ( by residence in Chicago ) ; and Christian ( by choice ) and non-Christian ( with two irreligious parents , one of them with Muslim ancestry ) .
And surely these contradictions lend him an air of vulnerability and approachability .
But Obama 's contradictions do n't quite make him a Diana figure .
Rather , Obama shows how charisma can reside in other people 's desire to figure one out .
" He seems so familiar , " Roach says .
" But what could be more definitive of strangeness than to be running for president of the United States in 2008 with the name Barack Hussein Obama ?
But he holds those together .
We 're fascinated by the ability to hold contradictions and make them seem harmonious . " . . .
Americans are not the first people to wonder about , and be stumped by , this elusive quality .
Societies throughout history have had words for the quality that Roach calls
It ; each word 's connotations were slightly different , but each approached the same idea .
For the Roman orator Quintilian , " It was ethos , the compellingly singular character of the great orator , " Roach writes .
" For Castiglione ,
It was sprezzatura , the courtly possessor of which turned every head when he , and he alone , suavely entered a room .
For many religious thinkers {hellip}
It was expressed by the word charisma , a special gift vouchsafed by God , a grace or favor , which sociologist Max Weber then condensed into a principal of powerfully inspirational leadership or authority . "
Americans today are " no closer to a satisfactory theory of It , " Roach believes , but they " have recourse to a well - stocked slang lexicon , including stuff , spunk , and moxie . "
Ever since Weber 's work in the 1920s , sociologists in the West have usually treated charisma in a circular fashion :
We know who has it by looking at who 's popular .
Studies have focused mainly on politicians and businessmen , with some scholars arguing , especially in the 1980s , that we know charismatic leaders because of their " transformational " style of leadership - they are the CEOs who do n't just steady a ship , but help it change course .
What 's most striking about charisma studies , however , is how few there are .
" Generally speaking , " writes Jennifer Merolla of Claremont Graduate University , with two coauthors , " political scientists have been hesitant to pursue , and a few have even argued against , the study of charisma . "
It 's just seen as too elusive to waste one 's time on .
Provisioned within the stimulus bill is a salary cap for executives of any bank that receives federal money through the TARP program .
Instead of taking home millions , the top brass will be limited to $ 500,000 in total annual pay .
Sounds like justice , does n’t it ?
It ’s not .
advertisement
advertisement
In fact , an outrageous loophole will allow bank executives to take home tens of millions of dollars thanks to taxpayer intervention .
You would n’t know it by listening to Capitol Hill .
Summoning all her populist rage , Senator Claire McCaskill , Democrat of Missouri , referred last week to Wall Street executives as a “ bunch of idiots … kicking sand in the face of the American taxpayer . ”
President Obama himself said on February 4th that “… in order to restore trust , we ’ve got to make certain that taxpayer funds are not subsidizing excessive compensation packages on Wall Street . ”
Then the President went on to describe the salary cap .
It will limit bank executives to “ a fraction ” of the huge salaries that had been reported recently , he said .
Then he added an interesting caveat : “ And if these executives receive any additional compensation , it will come in the form of stock that ca n’t be paid up until taxpayers are paid back for their assistance . ”
Whoa , whoa , whoa .
What does that mean , exactly ?
The possibility for additional compensation can come from “ deferred stock , ” that as the President explained , ca n’t be sold until the bank pays back its debt to the Treasury .
But deferred stock is n’t the same as restricted stock .
Here ’s how Simon Johnson , former chief economist for the IMF , explained the options to Bill Moyers on a PBS appearance on February 13th :
advertisement
… you can — sorry to get technical , but — reset the strike price … when your company goes down , and you have massive amounts of stock options that are n’t worth much anymore , because the stock price has gone down , you say , ‘ Oh , well , we ’re going to reset our option prices . ’
[ Emphasis mine . ]
When an employee gets a stock option plan , there ’s a variable on it called a “ strike price ” that lets him buy company stock at a discount price .
The strike price determines at what price those underlying assets can be bought .
This happens regardless of what the “ spot price , ” or market price , happens to be at the time the stock is sold .
In other words , let ’s say I ’m a bank CEO .
If I have stock options with my bank , and the strike price for my option is $ 1 , I can buy the company ’s stock for only $ 1 per share–even if the market price listed today on the NYSE is $ 2 a share .
Ideally , that puts in place an incentive for me to make the company do well , so the stock will go up .
That way , when I exercise my option and sell at market price , I make money .
The extent to which the difference between my strike price and the spot price is protifable is called “ moneyness . ”
If a stock can be sold on the market above its strike price , it ’s said to be “ in the money . ”
If a stock ’s spot price dips below the strike price , it ’s “ out of the money . ”
Obviously , bank stocks are in the bargain bin ; a lot of Wall Street CEOs have options plans , as Johnson notes , that would presently be “ out of the money . ”
Let ’s say I ’m one of those CEOs , back at Bank A again .
The strike price on my option is $ 1 , but the company ’s stock is in the toilet today at just $ 0.20 a share .
There ’s nothing in the current salary cap that says that my bank ca n’t reset its strike price to , say , $ 0.10 a share .
I can then buy shares half - price .
That means that as soon as my bank pays back the government , I can cash out my stock options and double my money .
advertisement
Of course , if the government had not interceded , my bank might have , say , become insolvent and been coopted by the FDIC , and then been broken up and sold off to private equity firms .
My stock options would be worth nil .
But thanks to Uncle Sam ’s loan , I ’ve just walked away with a huge 2:1 margin on my investment .
I ’m in the money .
Of course , there ’s nothing wrong with this –except that the whole point of the salary cap was to punish the executives who scuttled our economy in the first place .
Walking away with what Johnson predicts could be hundreds of millions of dollars is n’t exactly harsh retribution .
One alternative that might distract executives from exercising their stock options this way could be someting called a “ bonus bank , ” as described in BusinessWeek on February 16th .
A bonus bank is an escrow fund where 1/3 of an executive ’s annual bonus money would be automatically deposited .
For three years , the banker can draw from the account only if the bank meets predetermined performance targets .
If the bank does n’t perform , the banker loses his bonus .
The idea behind the bonus bank is that execs can see a substantial payout in under three years , which might not be possible with the options scheme laid out above ; it could take five or 10 years before a given bank that has received extreme assistance pays back the government in full .
Plus , the banker does n’t run any risk of buying stock that decreases in value .
Investors at E*Trade , Charles Schwab [ SCHW ] , and JPMorganChase [ JPM ] are all pushing for a bonus bank plan .
In practice it can be tricky , however ; if a bank fails to meet its goals , there ’s significant incentive for a banker to leave instead of ride out the storm .
If bankers do indeed exercise options with reset strike prices , there will be public outcry–and the President might be the one they blame .
Tamil refugees who fled from Sri Lankan military operation in Vanni
By Brian Senewiratne
January 23 , 2009 --
There is a humanitarian crisis in Sri Lanka , where the Tamil minority in the island ’s north and east are facing annihilation at the hands of the Sinhalese - dominated government .
This article will deal with the current crisis , with the more fundamental problem of the legacy left by colonial British rule ( 1796 - 1948 ) dealt with in later articles .
These colonial administrative structures will need to be reversed of there is ever to be peace or prosperity in Sri Lanka .
I am a Sinhalese , from the majority community , not from the brutalised Tamil minority .
I quit Sri Lanka in 1976 .
Who runs that country is of no concern to me , as long as it is run without serious violations of human rights .
Sri Lanka was tossed out of the UN Human Rights Council in May last year due to its human rights record , and the drift of a democracy to a fascist politico - military dictatorship , none of which have been publicised internationally .
Current problem
The ethno-religious mix of Sri Lanka , with 20 million people , consists of ethnic Sinhalese ( 74 % ) , Tamils ( 18 % ) in two groups ( ethnic Tamils , 12.5 % , and the plantation , or Indian , Tamils , 5.5 % ) and Moors ( 6.5 % ) .
The ethnic Sinhalese and the ethnic Tamils have been in the country for at least 2500 years — the Tamils for probably much longer , given the proximity of Sri Lanka to south India from where the ethnic Tamils came .
The plantation Tamils are descendants of indentured labourers brought to the country by the British in the mid-1850s to work in the tea plantations in the central hills .
The Moors are descendants of Arab traders from the 13th - 15th century .
The ethnic conflict is between the Sinhalese - dominated government and the ethnic Tamils .
The Sinhalese speak an Indoaryan language , Sinhalese , while the Tamils a Dravidian language , Tamil .
The Moors are mainly Tamil - speaking but many are bilingual .
To add a religious dimension to an already existing ethno- linguistic one , the Sinhalese are Buddhist ( 70 % ) and the Tamils are Hindus .
About 7 % of each group have been converted to Christianity by Westerners .
The Moors are mostly Muslims .
Sri Lanka is a multi-ethnic , multireligious , multilingual and multicultural country .
Despite this , the Sinhala - Buddhist majority claim that Sri Lanka is a Sinhala - Buddhist country .
The main proponents of this ethno- religious chauvinism are , firstly , the Buddhist monks who claim that Buddha on his death bed nominated Sri Lanka to be the custodian of his teaching , and secondly Sinhalese politicians across the entire political spectrum who have done so to gain the political support of the Sinhalese Buddhist majority to get into or remain in power .
The major Sinhalese political parties have competed with each other to discriminate against the Tamils in language , education and employment with the clear intention of getting the Sinhalese vote .
A third proponent is the Sinhalese - dominated Sri Lankan Armed Forces ( 99 % Sinhalese ) .
The head of the Sri Lankan army stated in an interview in September last year : “ I strongly believe that this country belongs to the Sinhalese … ”
The real danger is that while the ethno- religious bigots among the Buddhist clergy and the Sinhalese political opportunists are not in a position to deliver an exclusively Sinhala - Buddhist nation , the Sri Lankan army — equipped and supported by countries such as the US , China , India , Pakistan , Britain and Israel , for their own geopolitical / economic gains — do have that capacity .
If this means committing genocide against the Tamil people , the politico - military junta , which has the temerity to call itself the “ Government of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri lanka ” , is more than willing to do so .
Problem of ethnic cleansing
There are four options to achieve an exclusively Sinaha - Buddhist Sri Lanka .
1. Drive them out of the country .
Although 1.3 million have already been driven out , there are still 2 million left .
2 . Make them “ non-people ” , ie : internal refugees .
Currently , there are 500,000 Tamil civilians living in refugee camps in the Tamil north and east or have fled into the jungles in the north to escape Sri Lankan army bombing .
There are also 200,000 Tamil refugees in south India .
On November 19 , Amnesty International USA , in a publication titled Sri Lanka government must act now to protect 300,000 displaced persons , stated : “ In September 2008 , the Sri Lankan government ordered the United Nations ( UN ) and non-government aid - workers to leave the region ( the Tamil North ) .
The government then assumed total responsibility for ensuring the needs of the civilian population affected by the hostilities are met . ”
On December 23 , the US - based Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) came out with a 49 - page report entitled Besieged , Displaced , and Detained .
The Plight of Civilians in Sri Lanka ’s Vanni Region , which detailed the Sri Lankan government ’s responsibility for the plight of 230,000 to 300,000 displaced people in the Vanni ( northern ) conflict zone .
It documents that thousands of Tamils fleeing the fighting in the north are trapped by the government and are being denied basic provisions .
Brad Adams , HRW Asia Director , one of the people who wrote this report , said : “ To add insult to injury , people who manage to flee the fighting end up being held indefinitely in army - run prison camps . ”
He went on to make the situation abundantly clear : “ The government ’s ’ welfare centers ’ for civilians fleeing the Wanni are just badly disguised prisons . ”
3 . Make them “ disappear ” .
Today , Sri Lanka leads the world in “ involuntary disappearances ” .
On November 24 , HRW published report entitled Sri Lanka : Human Rights Situation Deteriorating in the East in which Adams stated : “ The Sri Lankan government says that the ‘ liberated ’
East is an example of democracy in action and a model for areas recaptured from the LTTE .
But killings and abductions are rife , and there is total impunity for horrific acts . ”
4. Kill them — i.e. commit genocide .
“ Genocide ” is defined by the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide as “ an act committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnic , racial or religious group ” .
Genocide has nothing to do with numbers killed , it is the intention and the act (s ) to achieve this intention that defines it .
Bombing , shelling and shooting are not the only ways to kill .
One could starve them , withhold essential medicines , prevent survival activity ( e.g. fishing and agriculture ) , destroy businesses , markets , homes , hospitals and schools .
Once the intention is there , the ways to achieve genocide are endless .
There are also different types of genocide .
I have called these , “ educational genocide ” , “ cultural genocide ” , “ economic genocide ” and “ religious genocide ” — defined as the intention , backed by the act , of destroying in whole or part the education , culture or economy and religion of an ethnic group .
The Sri Lankan government is guilty of all of these .
A war on Tamils
The “ war ” that is going on in Sri Lanka is a liberation struggle of the Tamil people for their right to self - determination , which would enable them to exist with equality , dignity and safety in the area of historical habitation of the Tamil people — the north and the east of Sri Lanka .
This war could not continue without foreign aid going to the Sri Lankan government .
Without this aid , Sri Lanka would be forced to the negotiating table .
Imperialism today takes the form of foreign aid .
No discussion of what is going on in Sri lanka is complete without a comment on the question of suicide bombings and child soldiers , issues used to demonise Tamil resistance to the Sri Lankan regime .
Suicide bombings have been a hallmark of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) in its decades - long armed struggle against the Sri Lankan state .
The latter has used and promoted extreme violence in its attempt to enforce Sinhalese ( the majority ethnic group ) domination on the island .
I will quote the Booker prize - winning Indian author Arundhati Roy in her book The Ordinary Persons Guide to Empire .
Substitute Sri Lanka for Israel and Tamil for Palestinian .
“ Young Palestinians who cannot contain their anger turn themselves into human bombs and haunt Israel ’s streets , blowing themselves up , killing ordinary people .
Suicide bombing is an act of individual despair , not a revolutionary tactic .
“ The world is called upon to condemn suicide bombers , but can we ignore the long road they have journeyed on before they arrived at their destination ? ”
The psychology of the suicide bomber is : “ You shot my father , raped and killed my mother , hanged my brother , tortured and killed my sister .
I have nothing left .
When I decide to leave this planet , I will take you with me . ”
Also , the LTTE has , for years , recruited children as fighters .
What is new is that there are several recent reports that the Sri Lankan army is doing the same thing .
Allan Rock is a Canadian diplomat working with the United Nations sent to Sri Lanka in 2006 , who issued a report that confirmed that the LTTE was recruiting child soldiers .
He also stated that Tamil paramilitary groups working with the Sri Lankan army were doing the same thing , conscripting child soldiers in the eastern province .
A December 2 report by the US - based Human Rights Watch stated that the leaders of the Tamil paramilitary groups working with the Sri Lankan regime , one of them recently appointed a member of parliament by President Mahinda Rajapaksa , “ have been implicated in serious human rights abuses …
The abuses included abducting large numbers of children and forcing them to serve as soldiers …
Escapees often must go into hiding to prevent being abducted again .
In some instances , their families have faced pressure to give a ’ replacement ’ child soldier to the group . ”
International interests
Violations of human rights can no longer be considered an “ internal affair ” of that country .
That is why the world got involved in the issue of apartheid in South Africa ( indisputably an “ internal affair ” of that country ) .
Sri Lanka cannot say it is not our business .
It is .
These “ internal affairs ” cause refugees that seek safe havens in other countries such as Australia .
Tamil civilians brutilised by the Sri Lankan regime contact “ people smugglers ” , are put into leaking boats that sink off the Australian coast , or arrive here to be locked up as criminals .
Rather than creating inhumane ways of dealing with these people , the source of the problem , the human rights violations in Sri Lanka , must be addressed .
What is more , all conflicts come to an end .
The conflict in East Timor did come to an end , as has the conflict in Ireland and so many others .
The Sri Lankan conflict will come to an end in five years , 10 , or longer .
It might do so with Sri Lanka reduced to a shell , as East Timor was .
The rebuilding of Sri Lanka when the conflict is over will fall on the “ international community ” ( as it did with East Timor ) .
To prevent this catastrophe , action must be taken .
It is not appreciated that there are two conflicts in Sri Lanka .
First , between the Sri Lankan regime and the Tamil people to force the Tamil people to accept Sri Lanka as a Sinhala - Buddhist nation .
Second , between the US , India and China for control of the Indian Ocean .
The Indian Ocean is not the largest ocean on this planet , but by far , the busiest .
Forty per cent of the world ’s population is in countries around the Indian Ocean .
Seventy percent of the world ’s oil shipments , and 50 % of the world ’s container cargo , travel across this ocean .
As US admiral Alfred Maher commented 100 years ago , “ Whoever controls the Indian Ocean , dominates Asia ” .
This international “ war ” is a peculiar one .
These interests compete with each other to control the Indian Ocean , and cooperate with each other to prevent a solution to the problem in Sri Lanka .
Just as oil is the problem in the Middle East , the geographical position of Sri Lanka , astride the Indian Ocean , is the problem in Sri Lanka .
The “ prize ” is Trincomalee , the fourth largest natural harbour in the world , in the Tamil north - east .
Trincomalee remaining in the hands of a corrupt Sinhalese regime in Colombo is a better option to it falling into the hands of an independent Tamil state .
To negotiate with a corrupt regime is a far easier task than negotiating with the much more disciplined Tamils .
China has a special interest in safeguarding its crucial oil supply from the Middle East , which passes just below Sri Lanka .
India has a special interest in preventing any other power from “ interfering ” ( even if this means solving a problem ) in its “ area of control ” .
For India to get a foothold in Sri Lanka is crucial .
That would be easier to achieve with a corrupt , disorganised , despotic regime in Colombo , than with an independent Tamil state .
What has to be done
International human rights monitors must be admitted into Sri Lanka , now .
Tomorrow might be too late for the Tamils .
Sri Lankan disinformation that the problem is “ Tamil terrorism ” must be exposed .
The problem is Sinhala - Buddhist ethno- religious chauvinism and state terrorism aimed at turning Sri Lanka into a Sinhala - Buddhist nation .
I have DVDs that set this out in detail , which I have donated to the Socialist Alliance in Australia .
Sri Lanka must be isolated , as was apartheid South Africa .
Economic sanctions should be imposed .
We should stop buying Sri Lankan goods .
A boycott should target tourism and point to the blood - stained beaches of Sri Lanka .
Trade union action to stop handling goods , to and from Sri Lanka , should be implemented .
Public protests need to be organised internationally .
We should pressure our governments to force Sri Lanka to the negotiating table and to make clear that a military “ solution ” to the Tamil question is not acceptable .

If you ’re looking to convert MP4 to MP3 , chances are you want to convert an MP4 audio file to play on your MP3 player .
But before we move on to cover how to convert the files , let ’s go over the main differences between Mp3 and Mp4 .
MP3 ( MPEG - 1 , Layer 3 ) : MP3s are small , high quality audio files that can be played on MP3 players or software .
It can be easily created using a home computer , a ripper program that copies a song from a CD to your computer , and an encoder that converts your music to MP3 format .
MP4 ( MPEG4 Part 14 ) : Mp4 is used for audio and video .
This file type enables for high quality streaming over the Internet and next generation cell phones .
Mp4 players are available for download online .
There are 2 main types of these files .
The first type is called Simple Profile , which is used for low resolution digital video content , popularly used for online distribution .
The second version is called Advanced Video Coding , which is a higher quality format used for HDTV content .
So in basic terms , MP3 is for audio files used on MP3 players and software , and MP4 is for audio / video files used for internet streaming and high tech cell phones .
Converting MP4 to MP3
To convert MP4 to MP3 , you must use a file format converter program .
These programs are abundantly available via the web .
Downloads.com may be a good place for you to start shopping around .
Many downloadable programs offer a free trial period so you may find it a good idea to try a program before purchasing it .
Three basic steps to converting MP4 to MP3 :
Download a free converter or purchase a converter that supports MP4 to MP3 file conversion .
Install the program on your computer .
Follow the instructions the program provides you with and you will be able to convert Mp4 to Mp3 .
Here are some converters for your reference :
The US Patent and Trademark Office yesterday released Apple 's most recent application , in which the company files for patent protection for ... wait for it ... a glove .
No , not a Power Glove .
Patent # 20090000010 is for what Apple calls a High tactility glove system designed to aid users in operating their multi- touch devices - think iPhones - in frigid weather .
" I love patent # 20090000010 .
It 's so bad ! "
As the application says , " When users , in cold weather , wear thick or bulky gloves ... the loss of tactile feedback to the user may prevent the user from properly operating the electronic device , and may lead to frustration .
Alternatively , if the user has to remove his gloves ... the user 's hand may become cold and uncomfortable , which may also lead to user frustration . "
Fair enough .
We do n't want those poor iPhone users up in Frostbite Falls to be frustrated , do we ?
Apple 's glovely solution is two - layer " system " with an outer insulating layer and an internal conductive layer .
In the fingertips of the outer layer there are " apertures " through which the user may thrust his or her desired digit so that it might appropriately caress a multi - touch display while still protected by the inner layer .
These apertures , according to the application , may be closed by an elastic ring or cap in order to " to prevent rain from reaching the liner through the aperture , or to prevent cooling of the user 's fingers through the aperture . "
Considerate , do n't you think ?
Also , check out the flow - chart ( right ) filed with the patent , which describes the series of activities a user must engage in to enjoy the benefits of this boon to mankind .
Sorta brings you back to your first Basic - programming class , does n't it ?
Frankly , we had to examine the date on this application publication to ensure that it was n't intended to be filed exactly three months in the future .
After examination of the document , however , we feel comfortable in assuring you that it is , indeed , authentic .
Is it just us , or is this vaguely disconcerting ?
To be sure , the warmth and protection of scrolling , flicking , and pinching digits is a noble cause , but is n't a hole in the finger of a glove taking patent protection a wee bit too far ? ®
The final , farcical moments of the failed Revolutionary NYU Food Court Occupation were caught on film by one of the protesters .
And then shown to the world , despite being — by any standard — incredibly embarrassing .
" You may not come in here .
This is student 's free space , " says the cameraman , as a security guard pulls apart the flimsy barricade that the administration had chosen to leave in place for the past two days .
As soon as the guard sets foot in the food court : " Excuse me , brutality here .
You are on camera ... Do not use brutality .

My arrival ( very recently ) at philosophical anarchism has disturbed some of my conservative and Christian friends .
In fact , it surprises me , going as it does against my own inclinations .
As a child I acquired a deep respect for authority and a horror of chaos .
In my case the two things were blended by the uncertainty of my existence after my parents divorced and I bounced from one home to another for several years , often living with strangers .
A stable authority was something I yearned for .
Meanwhile , my public - school education imbued me with the sort of patriotism encouraged in all children in those days .
I grew up feeling that if there was one thing I could trust and rely on , it was my government .
I knew it was strong and benign , even if I did n’t know much else about it .
The idea that some people — Communists , for example — might want to overthrow the government filled me with horror .
G.K. Chesterton , with his usual gentle audacity , once criticized Rudyard Kipling for his lack of patriotism .
Since Kipling was renowned for glorifying the British Empire , this might have seemed one of Chesterton ’s paradoxes ; but it was no such thing , except in the sense that it denied what most readers thought was obvious and incontrovertible .
Chesterton , himself a  Little Englander  and opponent of empire , explained what was wrong with Kipling ’s view :  He admires England , but he does not love her ; for we admire things with reasons , but love them without reason .
He admires England because she is strong , not because she is English . 
Which implies there would be nothing to love her for if she were weak .

The report suggests China 's rapid development has a human cost
A senior family planning official in China has noted an alarming rise in the number of babies with birth defects , a Chinese media report says .
Jiang Fan , from China 's National Population and Family Planning Commission , said environmental pollution was a cause of the increase .
The coal - mining heartland of Shanxi province had the biggest problem .
China has reported the trend before , and it was not clear if Mr Jiang was commenting on new or old statistics .
A 2007 commission report said the rate of defects had risen 40 % since 2001 , from 104.9 per 10,000 births to 145.5 in 2006 .
Officials blame emissions from Shanxi 's large coal and chemical industry for the problems there .
" The problem of birth defects is related to environmental pollution , especially in eight main coal zones , " said An Huanxiao , the director of Shanxi provincial family planning agency .
' Prevention plan '
Mr Jiang said a child was born with physical defects every 30 seconds because of the degrading environment .
Correspondents say the report suggests there is a human cost to China 's rapid economic development .
Researchers also blamed exposure to nitrogen dioxide , carbon monoxide and particulates for the increase .
" The number of newborns with birth defects is constantly increasing in both urban and rural areas , " China Daily newspaper quoted Mr Jiang as saying .
" The rather alarming increase has forced us to kick off a high - level prevention plan . "
The commission had introduced a screening programme in the eight worst - affected provinces , Mr Jiang said .
Cost - Plus Markup and Mandatory Overhead
In recent weeks H.R. 875 ( Food Safety Modernization Act of 2009 ) has occasioned the expression of a considerable amount of alarm on the Internet .
The bill , it is variously said , will outlaw organic farming , criminalize seed banks , and do to community - supported agriculture what the CPSIA ( Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act ) does to small apparel and toy manufacturers .
It will impose costly inspection and certification regimes on even the smallest producers .
It was introduced by Rosa Delauro , whose husband is supposedly a Monsanto employee , and is an attempt to use the regulatory state to suppress competition from small - scale organic producers .
On closer inspection , it ’s probably not anywhere near the bogeyman it ’s being made out to be .
Tom Philpot at The Gristmill , who is a pretty reliable source on issues involving collusion between the USDA and big agribusiness , dismisses it as a tempest in a teapot .
Most of the worst alleged features of the bill , as attributed to it by the wild surmises of the blogosphere , simply are n’t found in the bill itself .
Even the bit about Delauro ’s husband and his ties to Monsanto , it turns out , is a wild exaggeration .
But we probably dodged a bullet , in any case .
If most of the conspiracy theorizing is unfounded in this particular instance , we still have every reason to be suspicious until proven wrong , and to remain vigilant against legislation that really does such things .
The danger that any federal safety regime for agriculture will embody such features is very real .
The simple fact of the matter is that most food safety regulations , in classic Baptists - and - Bootleggers fashion , are written by the big producers and have the primary effect of imposing minimum overhead costs on small producers .
The primary offenders in the food contamination scares of recent years have been large - scale agribusiness operations and large - scale food processors , whether in California or in China .
The spinach e. coli deaths associated with “ organic farming , ” for example , actually occurred at a nominally organic factory farming operation producing for Earthbound Farms , where crops were contaminated by fecal runoff from the grain - fed cattle at yet another factory farming operation nearby .
But if the USDA ever takes large - scale regulatory action to address the problem , you can be sure it will be a costly and paperwork - intensive inspection regime that the factory farms actually causing the problem can easily absorb , but that will destroy small , community - based market gardeners who were n’t killing anybody in the first place .
That ’s exactly what happened with the above - mentioned CPSIA , in a different industry .
In response to scares of phthalate and lead contamination in toys and clothing imported from China , some consumers started buying handmade toys and clothing produced locally in people ’s homes , in order to have a better sense of where the stuff they purchased actually came from .
People attempted to take back control of their lives from distant and unaccountable corporations , by turning instead to relocalized economies outside the corporate supply chains .
But what did Congress do to address the lead and phthalate scares ?
It imposed a costly testing regime whose primary effect could well be to drive the small - scale local producers of handmade toys out of business .
The giant transnational corporations that farm toy and apparel manufacturing out to sweatshops in China , of course , can easily absorb the cost of mandated testing and paperwork .
As described by Eric Husman , of GrimReader blog , the small apparel industry works like this :
First , you develop a couple dozen or so different designs .
Then you see which ones sell , and produce them on a just - in - time basis as orders come in .
This a business model that can be followed even by someone operating out of their own home with a few sewing machines .
Because there ’s almost no initial capital outlay or overhead , there ’s also no pressure to achieve some minimum level of business to amortize the overhead cost .
Consequently , there ’s no risk involved in taking it up as a moonlight operation to supplement wage income and then gradually replace wage labor with self - employment a few hours at a time .
The CPSIA , by mandating test costing hundreds or thousands of dollars for every separate product line , essentially criminalized this model of production .
It added enormous levels of overhead , which could only be paid for by large - batch production to spread the cost over a large number of units .
In other words , if you ca n’t afford the initial startup capital to do it full time and on a large scale , you ca n’t do it at all .
That ’s the central function of almost all safety regulation : to impose mandatory minimum levels of overhead on small producers .
Consider all the forms of production that are amenable to small - scale production in the home , using only the spare capacity of ordinary household capital equipment that most of us own anyway , if only government - imposed entry barriers were removed .
Roderick Long , in a November article at Cato Unbound , mentioned microbakeries using ordinary kitchen ovens , unlicensed cab services with only a car and a cell phone , cooperative daycare arrangements in which parents in a neighborhood paid someone to care for children out of their home , home - based beauticians with only a chair and sink and a basic set of cutting and styling tools , etc .
Because of mandated overhead , most of society ’s economic functions are carried out through the model of organization Paul Goodman described in People or Personnel : high - overhead , with bureaucratically defined procedural rules , job descriptions , prestige salaries , rents on artificial property rights , management featherbedding , and all the rest of it .
The cost of paperwork and bureaucratic rulemaking , in many cases , is the inevitable result of the fact that people lacking any intrinsic motivation or control over their own work ca n’t be trusted to use their own judgment .
Our society is run by an interlocking directorate of enormous bureaucratic organiations : corporations , government agencies , universities and charitable foundations .
As a result , most forms of production are characterized , in Goodman ’s words , by “ the need for amounts of capital out of all proportion to the nature of the enterprise . ”
“ Everywhere one turns , … there seems to be a markup of 300 and 400 per cent , to do anything or make anything . ”
Their overhead costs are compounded , in addition to the initially mandated capital outlays themselves , by their bureaucratic style : the layers of bureaucratic overhead and administrative costs associated with such organizations .
Compare the total charge for a service call by a plumber , most of which goes to office rent and clerical staff , profit and interest on debt , utilities , etc. , to the portion that actually goes to the plumber .
A skilled tradesman ’s wage is typically about 40 % of the cost of a service call .
When we do business with each other indirectly through bureaucratic organizations , we pay a 150 % markup over what we ’d have paid to one another directly ( for example , a plumber working through a LETS system , simply taking calls on his phone and buying materials at the local hardware store ) .
The effect of criminalizing such low - overhead production , Paul Goodman said , is to erect barriers to transforming one ’s labor directly into subsistence , and to render comfortable poverty impossible .
We often hear that the per capita GDP in Italy or Ireland is a fraction that of the U.S. , and yet the actual quality of life does n’t seem to be anywhere near that small a fraction of our own .
The reason is that much of our increased GDP results , not from a proportionate increase in the value of the goods and services we consume , but from the increased ratio of overhead cost to the value of what we consume .
Suppose we decided we could meet our need for bread by baking it in our own ovens , or producing some other good in the household to exchange with a neighbor ’s bread , with a fraction of the hours of wage labor required to buy it .
Suppose we decided that we could meet a major part of our needs through such informal and household production , and non-monetized exchange through a neighborhood or community barter network .
The portion of GDP resulting from that wage labor and the purchase of those store goods would simply disappear .
But our quality of life would be improved .
Of course it would cause a lot of hand - wringing among econometrists .
In the early days of the Industrial Revolution , an English political economist dismissed as “ of no importance ” a village which met most of its needs internally rather than by participating in the money economy .
“ What , sir , ” thundered Samuel Taylor Coleridge .
“ Are seven hundred Christian souls of no importance ? ”
In the case of large scale mass production , the modest unit cost savings from economies of large - scale production are easily offset by all the mountains of overhead , open and hidden , required by the push - distribution system .
Sloanist manufacturing , as described by William Waddell and Norman Bodek in The Rebirth of American Industry , requires enormous buffer stocks of goods in process , and enormous inventories finished goods produced without regard to orders , in order to keep the machines running at capacity and spread out unit costs over the larget possible output .
To keep the wheels turning also requires expensive mass - marketing , brand - name markup of generic commodities that previously sold for 75 % less , enormous consumer debt , and planned obsolescence .
Ralph Borsodi described the effort to market the output industry was capable of producing at full capacity as the equivalent of making water run uphill .
His book The Distribution Age was a study of this paradox : modest decreases in unit production cost , more than offset by an explosion in the cost of distribution and high - pressure marketing .
Compare the mountains of crystallized labor and resources embodied in those inventories , and in the landfills full of discarded goods that could have been repaired for a tiny fraction of the cost of replacement , to the alleged cost savings from running the “ more efficient ” specialized machinery 24/7 .
We live in an age of cost - plus markup and mandated minimum overhead , buying stuff from public and corporate bureaucracies for several times what they would cost to produce either in local manufacturing organized on a lean basis or in the informal and household economy .
The system adds Rube Goldberg steps between effort and consumption , much like adding all sorts of baffles and eddies and reservoirs , and twists and turns , to a plumbing system .
On average we force in forty hours worth of effort into one end of the system , and get a trickle of consumption goods out the other end that could probably be produced in sixteen hours if production were organized rationally without the added overhead cost and subsidized waste .

The other day Bill O'Reilly did one of those quiet shifts in his narrative that he is careful never to announce or draw too much attention to -- mainly because if you 're paying attention , it means he was dead wrong about issues he 's previously taken vociferous positions on .
Essentially , he admitted that Bush has to take some blame for failing to recognize the oncoming recession -- which is to say , the recession is real and not just a figment of the imaginations of the media and the " nutty left . "
In other words , he 's been dead wrong all this time and he owes everyone in his audience an apology .
O'Reilly : Larry , look .
The reason I did n't get an exit interview with President Bush -- and we asked -- and I have a good relationship with him -- was that he knew I was going to ask one key question , Larry , one .
And that is ,
Why did n't you guys see this terrible recession when it was coming ?
Why did n't you see that ?
He did n't answer that today , did he ?
Larry Elder :
And the reason he did n't answer it is because it is a long , complicated answer , and primarily the reason nobody saw it , or very few people saw it , was because of government interference .
O'Reilly : But he 's the president .
He 's the president .
He 's the guy the who's got to protect the folks , and the folks got hammered .
And you 're right , it 's complicated and long , but that really sunk him , even more than Iraq or the war on terror .
Gee , I dunno , Bill .
I wonder if Bush cheerleaders like you -- who angrily shouted down anyone who talked about the dire long - term consequences of Bushonomics -- might have helped persuade him he was doing the right thing .
Ya think ?
And in case Larry Elder missed it , there were a number of people who saw it coming , and saw it from a long way off .
One of them was Paul Krugman , the recent Nobel Economics Prize winner .
Some of you may even recall that nasty , finger - wagging , threatening encounter with Krugman that Bill O'Reilly had on Tim Russert 's show back in 2004 :
Work on a major hydroelectric dam in the Himalayas has been stopped after one of India 's most eminent scientists came close to dying on the 38th day of a fast , in protest against the harnessing of a tributary of the sacred river Ganges .
Professor AD Agarwal , 77 , former dean of the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi at Kanpur , last week called off his second fast in a year against Himalayan dam projects , after the Indian government agreed to speed up its inquiry into how electricity could be generated without the flow of the water being impeded .
The free - running of the river is a crucial element of its sacred status .
" The water ... is not ordinary water to a Hindu .
It is a matter of the life and death of Hindu faith , " Agarwal said , before his fast began in January .
The 600MW Loharinag - Pala project is one of several hundred major dams and barrages planned or now being constructed by India , Pakistan , Nepal and Bhutan for the foothills of the Himalayas .
Together they are expected to provide 150,000MW of electricity for countries in which power cuts are frequent and demand is growing fast .
But experts argue the dams will have profound effects on the environment and culture of the region , directly affecting the lives of millions of people .
According to a recent report from the NGO International Rivers , the dams will fundamentally transform the landscape , ecology and economy of the region and will displace hundreds of thousands of people .
Shripad Dharmadhikary , one of South Asia 's leading water and energy experts who authored the report , said : " Damming and diversion of rivers [ in the Himalayas ] will severely disrupt downstream flows , impacting agriculture and fisheries and threatening livelihoods of entire populations . "
Tomorrow – designated International Day of Action for Rivers – the NGO is organising a global campaign against dams .
Dharmadhikary 's report said the dams are being planned and carried out with hardly any environmental assessment of individual or cumulative impacts .
" If all the planned capacity expansion materialises , the Himalayan region could have the highest concentration of dams in the world .
The dams ' reservoirs , tunnels , transmission lines and related works will destroy thousands of houses , rivers , forests , spiritual sites and even parts of the highest highway in the world , the Karakoram highway . "
In addition , it warns that climate change could reduce the amount of electricity that the dams are planned to generate .
This is because increased melting of glaciers is causing more silt to be washed down the mountains , reducing the capacity of the dams .
" The impact of global warming is already being felt much more in the Himalayas than in other parts of the world .
This is resulting in the accelerated melting of glaciers and the depletion of the massive water store of the region .
There are real fears the snow - covered mountains [ will turn ] into bare , rocky mountains .
As glaciers melt , water in the rivers will rise , and dams will be subjected to much higher flows , raising concerns of dam safety , " it says .
In the past few years , Pakistan , India , Bhutan and Nepal have all prepared plans for a massive programme of dam building in the region .
Bhutan , one of the most remote but pristine countries in the world , is planning to expand its hydroelectricity capacity by about 10,000 MW - the equivalent of at least five British nuclear power stations - in the next 10 years .
Among the projects planned for the near future in Bhutan are the giant 1,095 MW Punatsangchu - I and the 600 MW Mangdechhu projects .
Nepal is planning to install hydropower capacity of 22,000 MW in the coming years and while some of the dams would be to meet its own acute needs for reliable electricity , the majority would be for export to India .
Pakistan , with more than 150 million people , expects electricity needs to rise nearly 30 % in the next five years .
Hydropower is the cheapest form of energy production and the country has plans to add 10,000 MW , through five major projects , by 2016 , with a further 14 projects , totalling about 21,000 MW , under study for construction by 2025 .
The biggest would be the $ 12bn , 4,500MW Diamer - Bhasha dam , which would impound nearly 15 % of the river Indus and form a lake 100 km upstream of the dam 's site .
" Degradation of the natural surroundings and a massive influx of migrant workers will have grave implications for the culture and identity of local people , who are often distinct ethnic groups small in numbers " , said Dharmadhikary .
The study did not consider dam - building on the Chinese side of the Himalayas .
China recently announced plans to build 59 reservoirs , but its stated aim was to store water from its shrinking glaciers .
The Mission : Designed to catch pieces of the sun itself , Genesis flew into space to collect solar winds in specially designed sheets of gold , diamond and sapphire .
By studying actual pieces of the sun , scientists hoped to learn about the original composition of the solar system .
The Problem :
It was n't the grabbing a piece of the sun that proved to be a problem , but the bringing it back .
The satellite was too delicate to simply land , so NASA planned to catch the capsule in mid air by hooking its parachute with a helicopter .
Except the parachute never deployed , and the satellite slammed into the Utah desert .
Luckily , those wafers were built tough , and scientists managed to recover some of the samples for testing .

... Or reason # 7,589 why the Media is hurting America .
This clip is so unfocused that I think it perfectly exemplifies how the media dumbs down the populace so that the average American has n't a clue what 's going on .
Chris Matthews starts the segment by bemoaning that the Obama administration has no really strong spokespeople out there to sell their economic plan .
So far , no argument there .
The Republicans have been much better in throwing sand in our eyes and giving these easily digestible soundbytes that sound good on the surface .
Of course , that 's when Matthews goes off the rails a bit and says that the Obama needs someone as clear as Limbaugh to speak for the administration , but as Clarence Page suggests , that 's only if you want to convince a very small portion of the citizenry :
MATTHEWS : You know who can talk ?
You know who can talk ?
Limbaugh .
You do n’t have to like the big guy , but you know what he does ?
He defends capitalism .
What he says is , “ You , Mr. President , are out there raising taxes and getting rid of deductability and itemization and putting more injury on those of us who are already injured .
You ’re hurting the people who are driving the truck . ”
PAGE : Right , and nobody believes that but dittoheads .
The fact is , Bush has already done the same darn thing .
That argument is n’t working right now .
People know that government is in a spend mode , and by the way , you know we ’ve been in ….
MATTHEWS : Limbaugh ’s numbers are doubled .
Barack Obama ’s numbers are not doubled .
PAGE : That ’s his job , though , look at the numbers .
About 18 % of the public agrees with Limbaugh .
You do n’t win elections that way , you get radio ratings .
But ever since Reagan , we ’ve been on a trend of taxing lower income people and giving breaks to the upper income .
Obama has slightly reversed that now , and I do n’t see a revolution in the streets .
Nice of Matthews to go ahead and echo the ratings / audience share exaggeration for Limbaugh .
Who needs facts ?
The panel then admits that Wall Street are looking for immediate solutions with no pain to them .
Gosh , that 's not an unrealistic outlook at all , is it ?
The continued focus on the tax increases on the wealthiest 2 % of the population is simply intended to scare the rest of us schmoes not making that kind of cash ... and as CNBC 's Trish Regan admits , wo n't even come into play until 2011 .
Rick Stengel has the money quote ( literally ) :
STENGEL : Look , I confess that some of my best friends are investment bankers .
You know , I wo n’t … you should n’t hold it against me .
But they are … to a man with a hammer , everything looks like a nail .
They are just looking at the things that help them .
They are not looking for the wider economy , the relationship between Wall St. and actual value of companies has never been wider .
And by the way , I ’d say to Rush Limbaugh , and as he says to his folks , how is capitalism working for you these days ?
Not very good , right ?
I mean , these people are hurting and people want to have the government do something .
That 's it in a nutshell , is n't it ?
These " economic experts " like Limbaugh are big WATBs complaining because THEY are hurt .
They could n't care less about the country as a whole .
But to further obfuscate the issue , Matthews ' Meter Question asks if we should blame the Obama administration for some of the economic doom and gloom :
Um , excuse me ?
Did n't we just agree that all this hand - wringing and pearl - clutching over the stimulus plan is due to economists looking for an unrealistic quick fix that offers no pain to them , even if it 's not in the best interest for the country ?
How 's that the Obama administration 's fault .
Even reliable GOP mouthpiece Kathleen Parker ( who voted yes ) admits that the stock market performed worse under Bush .
Once again , the Fourth Estate abdicates their responsibility to inform the public .
If Florida transportation officials have their way , the state will soon lease a 78 - mile toll road across the Everglades to a private firm for 50 years , in a deal that could make hundreds of millions of dollars for both sides .
Advocates hail it as a windfall that the state can invest in other projects , but critics say no good will come from a shortsighted a plan to make a quick buck .
" You ’re talking about taking public assets , paid for with public dollars , and selling them off , " says Gina Downs , director of the Citizen 's Transportation Coalition .
The group opposes the plan to lease the stretch of Interstate 75 known as Alligator Alley .
" If governments start leasing assets to plug up budget deficits , pretty soon they 'll be selling off anything and everything they can get their hands on .
It 's a slippery slope . "
Such debates will grow more common as states increasingly turn public works projects over to the corporate sector , because they can't afford to do the work .
President Barack Obama promises to spend more than $ 100 billion overhauling the nation 's dilapidated roads , bridges and other vital infrastructure , but that gigantic sum is only a fraction of what 's needed to do the job .
The real cost of modernizing the country 's infrastructure , says the American Society of Civil Engineers , exceeds $ 2.2 trillion – an overwhelming figure .
Cities and states increasingly are inviting private firms to manage assets these governments can no longer afford and build projects they can't finance .
More than half of the states are considering public - private partnerships to get things done , following an example set by European countries that have turned over airports , highways , waterworks and other critical infrastructure to the corporate sector .
Proponents say such partnerships allow the government to generate cash and free itself from the burden of improving and maintaining expensive and crumbling public assets .
Critics argue the trend places profits ahead of safety , service and accountability .
Several high - profile public - private partnerships have been forged in the past year .
Chicago privatized the regional Midway Airport .
A corporate consortium joined Virginia to design , build and operate $ 1.9 billion of high - occupancy lanes on a 14 - mile stretch of the Capital Beltway .
Smaller deals have helped many cities and towns build schools , parking lots and other projects .
The global financial meltdown has slowed things down , some experts say , but such partnerships will almost certainly grow more common .
There are too many projects and too few dollars for it to be any other way .
" The needs are enormous , way beyond the ability of federal , state and local governments to cover them , " says Richard Norment , executive director of the National Council for Public - Private Partnerships .
" PPPs are a way for the government to amplify the impact of the money it plans to spend . "
Americans have traditionally been leery of entrusting corporations to do work historically reserved for the government , which is why the United States lags behind the rest of the world in turning to public - private partnerships .
London 's Heathrow Airport , for example , is privately run , as is Canada ’s air - traffic - control system .
The corporate sector has built 3,400 miles of highway in France alone .
It ’s a growing trend around the world , and institutions like the Carlyle Group , Credit Suisse , Goldman Sachs and other firms reportedly have amassed some $ 250 billion to invest in infrastructure projects in the United States and elsewhere .
If they spent every cent of it here , it still would n't be enough .
America 's infrastructure shortcomings are simply too staggering .
One in every four bridges in the country is deficient or " functionally obsolete , " according to the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials .
A study by Deloitte suggests poorly maintained roads contribute to more than one - third of the nation ’s auto fatalities .
The nation 's water - treatment plants leak as much as 10 billion gallons of raw sewage annually , the Environmental Protection Agency reports .
The list goes on .
The American Society of Civil Engineers gave the nation 's critical networks a D on its most recent Report Card for American Infrastructure .
The group 's estimate that we need $ 2.2 trillion over the next five years to bring everything up to snuff is up from its $ 1.6 trillion estimate in 2005 .
It 's impossible to say what our crumbling infrastructure costs the economy , but lousy roads cost motorists $ 67 billion a year in repairs and operating costs .
The National Education Association estimates the nation 's schools need $ 322 billion in repairs and upgrades .
" Failing infrastructure cannot support a healthy economy , " says D. Wayne Klotz , the society 's president .
" We have under - invested for decades , and we 're getting hit with the hard reality that ignoring a problem does n’t make it go away .
The longer we wait to close the investment gap , the more expensive it will become . "
Public - private partnerships attempt to close the gap .
Proponents call them mutually beneficial deals that allow the government to get things built with minimal capital or risk .
The companies recoup their investments through tolls , fees or leasing the infrastructure back to the government .
Such partnerships typically take one of two forms .
Green - field projects bring the public and private sectors together for new projects .
A private group that included Carnival Cruises and Royal Caribbean Cruise lines chipped in to build a cruise - ship terminal in Galveston , Texas .
The city of Tampa , Florida , paid American Water - Pridesa $ 29 million in 2004 to finish construction on a monumentally over - budget $ 158 million desalination plant , with the private partner assuming financial responsibility for the project .
Such deals have lead to projects like a 47 - mile toll road in Denver , the Hiawatha Light Rail Transit system in Minneapolis and the Narrows Bridge in Tacoma , Washington .
The city of Fredricksburg , Virginia , recently wrapped up $ 85 million worth of new green - field projects that include two schools and a parking lot .
Assistant city manager Bevery Cameron said the deals allowed the projects to be finished in less time , and with fewer hassles , than if the city had gone it alone .
Brown - field projects are more controversial , because they involve turning over existing public assets , such as Alligator Alley , to the private sector .
The faltering economy has slowed Florida 's plan , but the state transportation department has set a May 8 deadline for bids .
It remains to be seen how much the state might get , but similar deals in other states have proven lucrative .
An international consortium led by the Spanish firm Cintra and the Australian company Macquarie Infrastructure Group paid $ 1.8 billion four years ago to run the Chicago Skyway for 99 years .
They struck a $ 3.8 billion deal in 2006 to lease the Indiana Tollway for 75 years , one year after Macquarie picked up a controlling interest in the company running the Dulles Greenway in Virginia for $ 533 million .
The Macquarie group reportedly has netted $ 74.7 million in advisory and debt - arrangement fees on the three roads .
Consortium spokesman Matt Pierce says the two firms have widened toll plazas and improved traffic flow on the Indiana and Chicago tollways and says they will spend $ 4.5 billion on maintenance and upgrades over the course of the leases .
Because the lease agreements contain specific limits on toll increases , the private group shoulders the financial burden if traffic fails to meet projections – something that ’s entirely likely , given that traffic on the tollways has slumped along with the economy .
Macquarie 's funding reportedly has dried up , the U.S. roads it purchased are having trouble repaying their debts , and last month the company 's stock hit its lowest level since 1999 .
Other big brown - field partnerships include a 20 - year , $ 1.5 billion deal between Indianapolis and Veolia Water to run the city ’s water system , and Chevron - Texaco 's leasing land at Fort Detrick , Maryland , to build a power plant .
The city of Tampa pays American Water a monthly fee to operate the desalination plant it helped build , but the company refuses to disclose details of the deal .
But they can be very lucrative .
Proponents say such projects bring free - market efficiency and innovation to public works .
They provide governments with much needed cash while letting them off the hook for building , maintaining , and improving expensive infrastructure .
Freed from such obligations , the argument goes , the government can focus on tasks like national security .
But critics argue that although these projects can bring cities and states a quick jolt of cash , they may do more harm than good in the long run .
Nathan Newman , director of policy at the Progressive States Network , says that without a crystal ball , it 's impossible for the governments to know the real worth of the assets they are selling off .
" Unless you know what kind of revenue stream an asset will generate in the future , it is tough to know what you 're giving up when you turn it over to a private firm for 99 years , " he says .
He adds that private firms lack accountability when it comes to relations with labor unions and employees .
Mike Joyce , director of legislative affairs for the Owner Operator Drivers Association , a trade group representing truck drivers , is concerned that private firms will place profits above safety .
" What are these private companies doing to ensure they make a profit ? "
Joyce says .
" Are they cutting corners to make sure the numbers work ? "
No , says Norment , head of the National Council for Public - Private Partnerships .
Private firms have a vested interest in maintaining – and improving – the infrastructure they manage , he says , because " companies competing in a market environment must innovate to survive . "
He points to the Chicago Skyway as an example , noting that the consortium drags what is essentially a giant magnet across the road each morning to remove metal debris , reducing the incidence of flat tires and increasing safety .
" The public sector never would have come up with this , " says Norment .
" They ’re just not in the business of innovating . "
There is still fierce opposition to some PPPs .
Florida 's proposal has met with resistance among the public and in the state capital , and last year Pennsylvania lawmakers rejected a proposal to privatize a major highway .
But with more than half of the states considering such deals , they almost inevitably will gain broader acceptance among policymakers and the public .
" The message is getting out , " says Norment .
" As misconceptions about these programs are addressed , they 'll continue expanding in the U.S. "
I just opened the iTunes store to attempt to buy last night ’s episode of Battlestar Galactica and was greeted with a message telling me that my store credit balance is currently unavailable .
I found that odd because I do n’t currently have any credits in the store , but it turns out that all of the credit processing in the iTunes store — including credit cards — may be down right now .
A quick scan of Twitter Search is yielding hundreds of users with the same issue starting about 10 hours ago .
The error is a pop-up message that shows up anytime you try to buy something and it reads :
Due to a problem with the iTunes Store , your store credit balance is temporarily unavailable for use in purchasing music ; you may continue purchasing using a different method of payment .
Of course , it ’s not just a problem for purchasing music .
I not only tried my television show , but also tried buying an application from the App Store , which did n’t work either .
I then tried entering in another credit card as my “ different method of payment , ” and that failed as well .
Many of the Twitter users are joking about switching over to BitTorrent to acquire their media through less - than - legal means .
Or maybe they ’re not joking .
Regardless ,
Apple better hope it can get the service back up soon .
I ’ve contacted Apple about the issue and will update if I hear back .
Update :
The issue has now been resolved , but there ’s still no word from Apple as to what caused the problem .
Cabe B. closed his eyes tightly and sighed .
His pager was vibrating and beeping a sad interpretation of O Fortuna .
And yet again , their most important server had gotten precipitously hot .
If the situation was n't remedied , XDISP1 would shut down .
It was the early 2000s and Cabe was working for a small startup .
And for all the freedom , responsibility , and opportunities to get creative that his position afforded , it was a little frustrating that the budget for the " datacenter " was n't larger .
It was a claustrophobic little room with walls and shelves holding mostly repurposed workstations that were acting as servers and telecom equipment .
The A/C was unreliable , and would die several times each month .
As such , the equipment was always on the brink of overheating .
With a ladle and water to pour over the servers , it could 've been converted into a decent little steam room .
Cabe wanted to stay on top of all these issues , so he set up some monitoring tools that would page him the moment one of the servers reached a certain temperature .
Cabe casually walked to the server room all the way at the other side of the building .
He 'd heard his pager play O Fortuna more times than he could count , and what should be a distraction that happens once a month was now happening several times a week .
Learning to Hate the Classics
By the time he got there , the server room was fine .
It was surprisingly cool inside , and the A/C was n't even making the ka-chung sound that it made sometimes .
XDISP1's fans were spinning quietly , and the case was cool to the touch .
Cabe turned back , walked all the way back to his desk at to the other end of the building and sat down .
Five minutes later , his pager started beeping again .
O For - tu - na , ve-lut lu-na , sta - tu va - ri - a - bi - lis , he thought .
And after the long walk to the server room , he found it a pleasant , cool oasis , with servers and A/C quietly humming and zero sign of distress .
W. T. F .
The same thing happened three more times that day ; all from one server .
Finally , he could n't take it anymore .
He got Sun on the horn and demanded they come out and fix the system , and set his pager to play Auld Lang Syne instead .
Sun came , replaced the motherboard , and the problem disappeared .
That is , until the day after after they left .
The server room ( and the server ) , again , were fine by the time Cabe got there .
The problem persisted for weeks ; it got to the point that Cabe had temperature sensors installed in the room so he could monitor not just the server 's temperature , but the room 's temperature from his desk .
And for days , looking at the trends , there was never a significant dip .
Meanwhile , his pager still was going off all the time .
He tired of Auld Lang Syne , Hava Nagila , Fur Elise , and even freaking default beep .
Cabe wanted off the whirlwind tour of crappy pager renditions of the classics .
He told his boss that the following day he'd be in the server room and unavailable by phone , and he'd blocked all appointments for that day .
He carried his laptop into the server room and set up shop .
The World 's Most Expensive Clipboard
It was a little awkward in the cramped room when Joe walked in ; neither of them even exchanged a friendly " hello . "
Joe dropped his notepad , as well as a printout of a trouble ticket that referenced one of the servers in the room .
Cabe picked it up and handed it to him .
" Ah , thanks , bro , " he said , turning to hold it up against XDISP1's intake vent .
The server was at about eye level , and the suction from the intake vent kept Joe 's printout in place .
Joe typed away , occasionally glancing at the printout that was cheerfully blocking the air flow , while Cabe summoned all of his strength not to slap his own forehead .
Or to slap Joe , for that matter .
The server began gasping for cool air until it choked , causing Cabe 's pager to beep The Ride of the Valkyries in a desperate plea for help .
After asking Joe to please not kill the server , he checked the overheating history against resolved tickets from Joe .
Sure enough , the outages were almost all within thirty minutes of a " resolved time " in one of Joe 's tickets .
For that and other unrelated screwups , Joe was let go , and a post - it was stuck to the side of XDISP1 reminding people not to use the server as a clipboard .
That day , Cabe set the outage notifications to play Pictures at an Exhibition , and thankfully has n't heard it since .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - The United States welcomed Israel ’s ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and said it expected all parties to stop hostile actions immediately while the United Nations expressed relief .
A convoy of Israeli armoured personnel carriers ( APC ) moves after crossing into Israel from the Gaza Strip January 18 , 2009 .
Hamas said on Sunday it would cease fire immediately along with other militant groups in the Gaza Strip and give Israel , which already declared a unilateral truce , a week to pull its troops out of the territory .

Iran said the ceasefire was not enough and that Israel ’s military must withdraw , Turkey urged Western countries to engage with Hamas , and the pope urged the world to pray for peace in Gaza and the hundreds killed in the conflict .
“ The goal remains a durable and fully respected ceasefire that will lead to stabilization and normalization in Gaza , ” Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said after Israel called off its three - week offensive in the area .
“ The United States commends Egypt for its efforts and remains deeply concerned by the suffering of innocent Palestinians , ” she added .
“ We welcome calls for immediate coordinated international action to increase assistance flows and will contribute to such efforts . ”
Hamas announced an immediate ceasefire by its fighters and allied groups in Gaza on Sunday , senior Hamas official Ayman Taha told Reuters , adding that the Islamists gave Israel a week to pull out its troops .
U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon welcomed the Israeli ceasefire and urged Israel to withdraw all of its troops .
“ I am relieved that the Israeli government has decided to cease hostilities , ” Ban told reporters .
“ This should be the first step leading to the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza , ” he said , adding he wanted the withdrawal “ as soon as possible . ”
He said Hamas militants also needed to do their part to bring an end to the violence by halting their rocket attacks against southern Israel .
“ Hamas militants must stop firing rockets now , ” he said .
U.S. President - elect Barack Obama welcomed Israel ’s ceasefire and will say more on the situation in Gaza after he is inaugurated on Tuesday , his spokeswoman said .
Israel declared a unilateral ceasefire which took effect at 2 a.m. ( 0000 GMT ) on Sunday .
Within hours , five rockets were fired at the Israeli town of Sderot , causing no casualties .
Hamas announced its ceasefire later on Sunday .
EGYPT TALKS
European leaders and Ban will attend talks in Egypt on Sunday aimed at bolstering the ceasefire .
“ Israel must allow full access to humanitarian workers , and to relief supplies , ” British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said en route to the summit .
“ We must also end Gaza ’s economic isolation by reopening the crossings that link it to the outside world . ”
“ The priority now is to ensure that no more civilians die as a result of this conflict , ” the Czech EU presidency said in a statement welcoming the ceasefire .
“ It is vital , therefore , that all required humanitarian assistance , including food , fuel and medical aid is freely and rapidly delivered into , and distributed within Gaza . ”
Iran ’s Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said the ceasefire announcement showed the “ victory of the Islamic resistance and the heroic people of Gaza ” against Israel , the official IRNA news agency reported .
“ The mere halt in air , sea and land attacks , without the withdrawal of the ( Israeli ) forces from the occupied positions , would not be enough for the cessation of confrontation , ” Mottaki said .
“ It is necessary that the Zionist forces leave the occupied regions , ” he said , calling their presence “ provocative . ”
Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan criticized world leaders for leaving Hamas out of the peace process , saying it was a democratically elected political party .
He also warned that the situation in Gaza could take on a very different dimension if “ Western countries ” did not show appropriate sensitivity toward Hamas .
“ This political party Hamas won an election with nearly 75 percent of the vote .
The West , which has shown no respect for this embracing of democracy , is responsible for this situation , ” Erdogan told a news conference .
Pope Benedict , in his strongest comments yet on the situation in Gaza , on Sunday condemned the violence that he said had killed hundreds of “ innocent victims . ”
Speaking at his weekly Sunday noon prayer , the pope also asked his listeners in St Peter ’s Square and around the world to pray for the success of all efforts “ to end the tragedy ” and bring about lasting peace .
* Senate halts debate , will resume work Friday
* Obama says package needs to be in $ 800 billion range
* Obama warns economic crisis could be irreversible
* Grim jobs data underscores sense of crisis
By Thomas Ferraro and Jeremy Pelofsky
WASHINGTON , Feb 5 ( Reuters ) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid abruptly halted debate on a $ 937 billion rescue bill late on Thursday , but said lawmakers would resume work Friday and remained upbeat they would pass the measure demanded by President Barack Obama to combat a deepening recession .
“ I would hope that we could complete this legislation tomorrow ( and ) I ’m cautiously optimistic , ” Reid told colleagues after a third day of considering amendments to the measure .
Obama urged members of the Senate as well as the House of Representatives to resolve their differences and get a final bill to him within the next week or so .
“ If we do not move swiftly to sign the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act into law , an economy that is already in crisis will be faced with catastrophe , ” Obama said during a meeting with House Democrats in Williamsburg , Virginia .
Reid said if there is no Senate progress on Friday he will file a motion to set up a showdown procedural vote for Sunday .
About a third of the Senate package is composed of tax relief , with the rest devoted to spending on such projects as rebuilding roads and bridges and schools .
Democrats fought off Republican attempts to alter the bill to add more tax cuts and slash spending .
Republicans complain some projects would do little to stimulate the economy or create jobs .
Democrats say the spending Republicans call wasteful amounts to less than 1 percent of the package .
Reid said he was confident he can muster the 60 votes needed in the 100 - member chamber to move to end debate and head toward a vote on passage of the bill , perhaps on Monday .
MODERATES SEEK COMPROMISE
With a group of about 18 moderate Senate Republicans and Democrats seeking an agreement of their own to trim the package by roughly $ 100 billion to $ 837 billion , Obama signaled that might be acceptable -- even though Senate Democrats warned earlier in the day it might be inadequate .
“ Our original figure was roughly in the 800 range .
There have been some changes to our framework ... but that ’s , I think , the scale that we need to deliver for the American people , ” Obama told reporters while en route to Williamsburg .
Earlier , Reid indicated he might be able to win passage of the package without the proposed compromise by the Senate moderates .
Aides said Reid bet he could win approval with limited reductions and feared slashing the proposal by $ 100 billion could backfire and cost him Democratic votes .
“ Our number one goal is to pass this bill , ” Reid told reporters .
“ They ( the Republicans ) cannot hold the president of the United States hostage . ”
Obama had sought bipartisan support for the stimulus plan as part of his promise to change the tone in Washington .
But partisan bickering quickly resumed , and House Democrats passed their $ 819 billion version of the stimulus package last week with no Republican support .
Differences between the House and Senate legislation would have to be worked out .
At the Democratic retreat in Virginia , House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said House Democratic leaders think the bill should be $ 890 billion to $ 900 billion .
“ We need to act .
We ’re going to do that this coming week , ” he said .
SEARCHING FOR COMMON GROUND
The price tag for the Senate measure grew to $ 937 billion on Thursday after an estimate for a tax incentive to spur home sales added to the bill was revised upward .
Other amendments were added , including limits on executive compensation at companies that get federal government aid in the future .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has sought cuts in the package , but he and fellow Republicans do not want to be seen as obstructing efforts to stem the worst economic crisis since The Great Depression , party aides said .
“ Republicans are no less interested in doing what is right for our country than Democrats are , ” McConnell said .
But , he added , “ we have very serious differences . ”
Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine and Democratic Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska were leading the drive by moderates to find a compromise .
Nelson said White House officials still hoped for a bipartisan solution , but Obama , taking a tougher tone , warned that “ time for talk is over . ”
“ The time for action is now , because we know that , if we do not act , a bad situation will become dramatically worse , ” Obama said in a speech early in the day at the Energy Department .
Republican Senator John McCain , who lost to Obama in the November presidential election , criticized what he called a Democratic rush to pass the bill .
“ They are establishing a very partisan approach to the greatest domestic challenge we face . ”
In his speech at the Energy Department , Obama seized on data that showed new jobless claims at a 26 - year high as evidence that time was of the essence .
[ ID :nN05356889 ]
“ These numbers that we ’re seeing are sending an unmistakable message , and so are the American people , that time for talk is over , ” he said .

Advertisement Huntsmen had complained to authorities about being followed by a gyrocopter just days before the aircraft hit one of its members , killing him .
Trevor Morse , 48 , from Alderminster , Warwickshire , was killed at Long Marston airfield near Stratford - upon - Avon , Warwickshire , on Monday .
It is believed he had been following a hunt on foot and died at the scene .
Two people travelling in the aircraft have been arrested on suspicion of his murder and remain in police custody .
A post mortem - examination carried out at the University Hospital of Coventry and Warwickshire revealed that Mr Morse died as a result of severe head injuries .
Sam Butler , a family friend and joint master of the Warwickshire Hunt , said : " A gyrocopter had been following us for a couple of weeks and we had made a formal complaint to the Civil Aviation Authority 10 days ago . "
Mr Morse had been following a hunt when the incident occurred
He said he did not know why the aircraft had been following them and added : " It is a tragic but fatal accident , our first and foremost thoughts are with Trevor 's family and we must wait for the facts and truths ourselves . "
The Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA ) confirmed it " received a complaint regarding the operation of the gyrocopter involved in yesterday 's incident " .
" We can confirm that the complaint was received 10 days ago and an investigation had commenced prior to yesterday 's incident , " it said in a statement .
" The CAA is investigating that complaint in conjunction with the police . "
Gyrocopters are known to take off and land very slowly .
It is thought the privately owned aircraft , which is similar to a small helicopter , had landed at the airfield to refuel when the collision happened at about 1500 GMT .
Officers from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch and Warwickshire Police attended the scene on Tuesday .
WHAT IS A GYROCOPTER ?
Small , helicopter - like aircraft which generates lift using a free - spinning rotor Rotor uses air to turn while engine - powered propeller generates thrust
There are 304 registered gyrocopters in the UK , but only 75 are fully - licensed to fly ( source : CAA , Jan 09 ) Pilots require a licence and must fly in daylight , within sight of the ground , more than 500ft from other vehicles and buildings Police said a post - mortem examination would be carried out at the University Hospital of Coventry and Warwickshire later .
Mr Butler said hunting was Mr Morse 's life .
" No higher quality of person could you find than Trevor , " he added .
" He was the most wonderful son and brother and the most dedicated and loving partner of Caroline and we feel very , very , very deep sympathy for him and them today .
" Everybody was just completely shocked and can't believe that we have lost such a good friend , " he said .
West Midlands Ambulance Service said no one else was injured in the incident .
Senior investigating officer Det Supt Graeme Pallister said : " The investigation is still at a very early stage .
" We are working to establish the circumstances of yesterday 's incident and to find out how and why Mr Morse died . "

She may be one of the most beautiful women in the world ... but that does n't stop Jessica Alba from getting airbrushed
Most women would be only too happy have Jessica Alba 's stunning figure .
Just five months after the birth of her first child , the 27 - year - old actress showed off her body in a series of plunging beachwear and skimpy tops for a new calender .
But those feeling envious can now breath a sigh of relief ... because even Jessica 's curves were airbrushed before her latest pictures were released .
Before and after : Jessica 's natural hourglass figure ( left ) and the skinny airbrushed version ( right )
Leaked photos which have been posted on various internet blogs show an original shot of Jessica posing for Campari , in an image which was later airbrushed .
The newlywed is seen posing in a white strapless short suit with a black belt on the limited edition calender , snapped by celebrity - photographer Mario Testino .
However in the picture which is not airbrushed , Jessica looks softer and more natural .
In the before picture , Jessica reveals a stunning hourglass figure with a few more curves around the hips and waist .
Picture perfect : Jessica poses with a drink of Campari in the shoot by celebrity photographer Mario Testino
Looking good : Jessica wears a figure - hugging dress with Christian Louboutin heels
The airbrushed version of the picture seems to have narrowed her chin slightly and added more makeup to give her a pin-up girl look .
The touch - up also seems to have removed some flesh from her already slim thighs and added some definition to her bust .
However the equally gorgeous picture proves that skinnier does n't always mean better , as Jessica looks just as stunning before the retouch .
It also proves that the perfect images presented by celebrities are unobtainable - without the help of the airbrush at least .
Sizzling : Jessica Alba poses with a glass of Campari by the sea in a revealing one - piece
Red hot : Jessica is the centre of attention of a bevy of Brazilian male models
Jessica poses with glass and bottles of Campari alongside a series of hunky male models for the Italian aperitif 's calendar .
Only a few months after giving birth to her daughter Honor Marie Warren , Jessica looks as stunning as ever in both the airbrushed and natural photos for the shoot .
Following in the footsteps of previous Campari calendar girls Eva Mendes and Salma Hayek , the Sin City actress stars in 12 sexy shots for the hanging pictorial .
Jessica wore a series of designer bikinis during the shoot in Malibu as she was photographed by legendary lensman Mario Testino .
On set with her was five - month - old Honor , whose father is Jessica 's new husband , assistant director Cash Warren .
Jessica explained : ' All the clothes were very cool .
They 're young , sexy and fresh .
' I 'm usually walking around in comfy clothes with a baby on my arm and it's nice to dress things up and feel sophisticated , sexy and surrounded by so much beauty .

Wet look : Jessica gives the camera a knowing look as she stands with a male model
' Also being surrounded by Brazilian models made it even easier .
' It was all very chic , but still young and cool , my favourite combination . '
Jessica is currently taking time out of her film career to raise baby Honor and enjoy married life with Cash , who she married three weeks before the birth .
Hats off to her : Jessica peers from beneath an enormous brim
Behind the scenes : A pouting Jessica is prepared for the shoot
The couple had been dating for four years after meeting on the set of the Fantastic Four , in which Jessica plays Sue Storm .
Last year , she filmed The Eye and The Love Guru , which both hit screens this year .
Next year , Jessica will return to the big screen in An Invisible Sign Of My Own .

ACLU head : Worst civil liberties president about to be history David Edwards and Muriel Kane

The executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union is delighted that President George W. Bush is finally leaving office .
" Eight days from now , the very worst president for civil liberties -- is history ! "
Anthony Romero exclaimed exuberantly as he began an interview Monday with Comedy Central 's Stephen Colbert .
" I can't wait till this man who 's currently the president is cleaning brush at Waco , " Romero continued .
" A man who has allowed torture and abuse .
A man who has put people in Guantanamo with no legal recourse . "
" A man who has kept America safe ! " interjected Colbert , in his best fake - conservative pundit manner , demanding to know whether Romero really wants to close Guantanamo .
" I do want to close Guantanamo , " Romero replied .
" You ca n't fix it .
... President - elect Obama 's got to close it on day one .
He can't wait . "
" The torturers -- we have to deal with them , " Romero added .
" We have to hold them accountable .
We have to look back before we can look forward . "
" Do you find fault with everyone ? " Colbert complained .
" is there no one who pleases you ?
...
Try to find fault with me ! "
" I think that tie is not my favorite , " Romero responded cautiously , provoking a started look from Colbert and groans from the audience .
" Sorry , sorry , " Romero quickly apologized .
" You ask a gay guy a question -- with an answer about fashion . "
" I will grant you this , " Colbert finally agreed .
" If he does not close Guantanamo in the first week of his presidency , he owns it .
...
Six months in , the world will look at Barack Obama and see George Bush . "

In an effort to more easily identify those who upload and view child pornography , two lawmakers this week introduced a bill that would require Internet service providers to retain subscriber information for up to two years .
In an effort to more easily identify those who upload and view child pornography , two lawmakers this week introduced a bill that would require Internet service providers to retain subscriber information for up to two years .
The Internet Safety Act , introduced by Rep. Lamar Smith and Sen. John Cornyn , both Texas Republicans , would also create new federal crimes for those who facilitate the transfer of child porn over the Internet .
People who set up servers hosting child porn could face up to 10 years in jail , while those who fund these activities could get 20 years .
In addition , the bill increases funding for the FBI 's Innocent Images National Initiative by $ 30 million  double the funds FBI agents currently have to investigate online child porn and child sexual exploitation .
" Of the nearly 600,000 images of graphic child pornography found online and reported to law enforcement officials , only 2,100 of these children have been identified and rescued , " Rep .
Smith said in a statement .
" Federal , state and local law enforcement officials have reached a digital dead end in their battle against the online sexual exploitation of children . "
ISP 's should be held to the same data retention standards as phone companies , according to Smith .
" How many times have we seen TV detectives seek call logs of a suspect in order to determine who he has been talking to ? "
Smith wrote in a Thursday editorial for The Dallas Morning News .
" What if the telephone companies simply said to the detectives , ' Sorry , we get rid of that information after 24 hours ? ' "
The U.S. Internet Service Provider Association ( USISPA ) , - whose members include AOL , AT&T , Comcast , EarthLink , Microsoft , Verizon , and Yahoo - said the bill is unclear about what records the government wants the industry to retain .
" Congress will need to examine many tough issues when legislating a mandatory data retention scheme , " said Kate Dean , executive director of USISPA .
" Among other considerations , Congress will need to decide which providers and what information is covered , reconcile how such a requirement will comport with today 's and tomorrow 's technologies , and determine the effect on consumers , their privacy and their online security , not to mention the financial impact on companies in this uncertain economy . "
Dean was also concerned that the bill " appears to raise the specter of imputing criminal liability on ISPs and others for the provision of routine services , such as e-mail . "
Smith and Cornyn said the bill would target " those who deliberately endanger our children  not those Internet service providers who work with law enforcement to protect them . "
" With sexual predators increasingly using new technology to prey upon children , it is critical that law enforcement stay ahead of the criminals , " Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said in a statement .
Data retention was a big issue in Congress last year , but most lawmakers were calling for Internet companies to reduce the amount of time they retain data .
Companies like NebuAd , for example , took some heat over its practice of tracking users ' online behavior in order to serve up more relevant advertisements .
NebuAd later dropped out of the ISP business .
In December , Yahoo announced that it would anonymize its user log after three months .
A week earlier , Microsoft had said that it would anonymize its data after six months  but only if its rivals followed suit .
Its current policy anonymizes that data after 18 months .
Google announced in September that it would anonymize its data after nine months .
Comcast said on Friday that it only retains IP address assignment information for 180 days .
" We do not retain any additional information unless compelled to do so by valid legal process , " a spokeswoman said .
" It 's premature for us to comment on this specific bill since we have not studied it fully , " said a Cox Communications spokesman .
However , the company has a longstanding policy of maintaining IP assignment logs for six months , he said .
AOL said its data retention policies vary according to business needs and requirements .
" In terms of the specific legislation proposed , I also wanted to point out that AOL has a long - standing relationship with law enforcement and other organizations such as the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children ( NCMEC ) focused on fighting the problem of online child exploitation , " an AOL spokeswoman said .
" We are also committed to working very closely with Congress and industry organizations to develop the best solutions for addressing this issue . "
AT&T said it is reviewing the bill .
The U.S. government seized control of American International Group Inc. -- one of the world 's biggest insurers -- in an $ 85 billion deal that signaled the intensity of its concerns about the danger a collapse could pose to the financial system .
The step marks a dramatic turnabout for the federal government , which had been strongly resisting overtures from AIG for an emergency loan or some intervention that would prevent the insurer from falling into bankruptcy .
Just last weekend , the government essentially pulled the plug ...
( CNET ) -- OK , it 's California .
So we are quite used to the rest of the country rolling their eyes in knowing exasperation at our fads .
But often , they turn out to be harbingers of national trends .
And so the question : Will AB - 255 ( a bill that would " censor " some aspects of Google Earth ) number among them as well ?
Last month California Assemblyman Joel Anderson introduced a bill to limit the amount of detail someone could see on screen using online mapping tools .
It also calls for fines of up to $ 250,000 per day for violating what Anderson describes " as the same level of protections that foreign governments extend to their own citizens . "
Considering the strength of California 's high - tech industry , he may be tilting at windmills .
However , this is n't the first time that Anderson , a Republican from the San Diego area , has courted controversy .
In 2007 , he pushed through a state bill that California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed , requiring the state 's huge pension funds to stop investing in companies that do business with Iran .
Here are the clauses from AB - 255 sure to raise hackles in Silicon Valley :
-- " An operator of a commercial Internet Web site or online service that makes a virtual globe browser available to members of the public shall not provide aerial or satellite photographs or imagery of a building or facility in this state that is identified on the Internet Web site by the operator as a school or place of worship , or a government or medical building or facility , unless those photographs or images have been blurred .
-- " An operator of a commercial Internet Web site or online service that makes a virtual globe browser available to members of the public shall not provide street view photographs or images of the buildings and facilities described in subdivision ( a ) . "
Anderson argues that he 's part of a larger global trend where interests of state are being pressed by domestic politicians worried about the security implications of online mapping .
The latest instance came on Tuesday , when the minister of State for Home in the Indian state of Maharashtra , Naseem Khan , said that he wants to stop Google Earth from showing sensitive locations because of terrorism concerns .
" We want Google Earth censored , " he said .
" We shall submit a proposal to the center and other concerned agencies to implement it as soon as possible . "
Anderson , who says he is asking only what India and some other foreign governments are demanding for their citizens .
I spoke with Anderson late Tuesday to find out why he was so keen to promote the bill .
Question :
When is the bill expected to go into committee ?
Anderson : I 'm thinking that it will be in committee within a week .
That 's not official .
Right now , everything is fluid .
The majority party sets the pace but we were told to expect it to happen about a week from now .
Q : Your bill would ban online providers from showing detailed satellite images of schools , places of worship , government buildings , and medical facilities , unless they were first blurred out .
How did you arrive at that list ?
Anderson :
Well , I looked at where we 've had security issues in the past and potentially , might have issues in the future .
Churches and synagogues have been bombed .
So have federal buildings and then , of course , 9/11 .
So , the threats are out there and as a state legislator , public safety is my No. 1 job .
To ignore that fact would be irresponsible .
Q : Still , the wording of the proposed bill is not going to go down well with a lot of people .
Anderson :
The bill is fraught with undefined items and it has to be honed down and clarified .
What you 're looking at is not the finished product .
But the concept of the bill will remain .
After the Mumbai attacks , the Indian government found that the lone surviving terrorist used Google 's online maps and the level of detail it offered made them effective .
What 's interesting is that what they 're doing in India now is exactly what I 'm suggesting we do .
If you go throughout the world , many countries are trying to shut down Google mapping -- it 's not just Google .
My bill would address all online mapping .
Q : Is n't the real threat here the motivation of people who look to commit heinous acts , rather than the technology they use ?
Anderson : I 'm not against the technology ; it 's fantastic .
But we 're in an evolving world and we have to change our course as it changes .
I 'm all for online mapping , but knowing where the air ducts are in an air shaft is not necessary for me to navigate in the city .
Who wants to know that level of detail ?
Bad people do .
Q : But could not a terrorist just as easily plan out their attacks by using a map of a city like Mumbai ?
They do n't need to go up online to locate their targets .
Anderson :
The level of detail is not on the maps .
With a map , you cant count the number of bricks in a building , or see the elevator shafts .
With this level of detail ( afforded by online maps , ) you can .
I hear the argument that , " Yeah , I want to also ban cars because cars are used in robberies . "
Look , cars have other commercial uses .
There are no other uses for knowing on a map where there are air shafts .
These are all red herring arguments .
The fact is that I would be remiss in my job if I did n't take this seriously .
I 'm not interested in censoring Google or the others , but now that we know there 's a threat , how could we not address this ?
Q : But that 's where it becomes more complicated .
A colleague here at CNET pointed out that the way the bill is worded , government agencies that use Google Earth , for instance , to help the public find their buildings could conceivably be in violation as well .
Anderson :
The wording of the law would change .
But companies would still back off the level of detail .
The only concern people have had that 's been put to me is whether they 'll still be able to use the online maps and my answer is that , absolutely , they will .
I 'm not against technology .
Q : Do you believe you have the votes to pass your proposal ?
Anderson : I 'm working on that .
And I believe that other people from other states will follow suit and do something similar .
Q : If AB - 255 ( the censorship bill ) does pass , why do you believe it would stand up to a court challenge ?
Anderson :
That 's their option .
They can take it to court .
But since when do you have a First Amendment right to yell fire ?
This falls under the same category .
Q : So have you been in touch with software companies to talk about your bill ?
Anderson : Microsoft spent two hours with me last week .
I want to hone it down and work out something that works for them as well as for me .
I also spoke with the lobbyist from Google .
My door is open .
I do want to work with them in good faith .
The bill will be cleaned up and I have a pretty good idea of where it should go , but as we got through the vetting process , I 'm open to what my colleagues have to say or what Google , Yahoo , Microsoft , and Mapquest have to say .
But the concept of the bill will stay intact .
This is the trend that 's going around the world .
let 's not wait until an American has to die in order to do the right thing .

cufón - fonts for the people
What 's this ?
If you 're looking for the cufón generator , I 'm afraid you 're too late .
Originally launched in 2008 , the online cufón generator was discontinued in early 2017 .
The source code remains available at github.com / sorccu /cufon for those who may still need it .
No support will be provided , however .
If you were hotlinking to the cufon.js file on this site ( bad you ! ) , consider migrating to the cdnjs hosted cufon.js instead .
If you need to generate a font , you 'll have to host the generator yourself .
Seriously though , you should be using standard web fonts by now .
Why is it gone ?
The server , while still operational after all these years , was horribly out of date and becoming a security risk .
Furthermore , it cost on average $ 20 a month to keep it running , including the VPS and Route 53 fees , which has n't been great value for a long time .
Unwilling to provision a new server and update the codebase to work with new software , the decision was made to shut it down .
Why did development stop ?
I 've thought about this a lot over the years .
It boils down to a few main causes .
Inexperience and the inability to say no .
Promises that in the end turned out to be empty were made simply due to not wanting to disappoint .
At the peak of cufón's popularity , I spent an average of 2 hours per day just answering emails .
At first I found great joy in providing a useful ( at the time ) tool for other developers , and received intelligent and well thought out feedback in return .
Over time as the project gained popularity , these questions slowly became more and more focused of figuring out why the WordPress template they bought from who knows where was n't working quite right .
There was no enjoyment in this work and I began to resent many of these users .
Lack of automated testing and attempting to support every version of every browser .
At the time , automated browser testing ( especially for a graphical utility ) was n't really a thing at all .
It became extremely daunting to make any potentially breaking changes .
At the same time , vendors were only accelerating browser development , making the issue even worse to deal with .
Too many things going on at once .
In addition to work , I had at least 5 other major projects going on .
Combined , these reasons caused me to wake up one day and realize that I was no longer looking forward to returning home from work to continue playing with the project .
Stats Uploaded fonts were anonymously logged since July 8 2010 .
Since then , 3,316,175 fonts were uploaded to the server for conversion .
The recorded data includes dates , filenames , font names , font weights and not much else .
No private information whatsoever is included .
Any researchers interested in this data ( perhaps to understand past font trends ) may contact me .
Google Analytics was set up in early 2009 .
The steady decline in popularity over the years is apparent , but you can imagine what it was like running the whole thing as pretty much a one man show during the peak years !
Note that aside from a Typekit referral link , the site stayed ad - free till the end .
There are many variants of Ubuntu .
One of them is Ubuntu JeOS where JeOS stands for Just enough Operating System .
JeOS is a lean version of Ubuntu server and optimized for running in virtual machines like VMWare .
But it can also be used to setup your own Ubuntu that matches your taste without extra luggage .
I will get you started by showing you how to setup minimal GUI .
Later you can make customizations by installing applications that you like .
So lets get started .
Download Ubuntu JeOS
Download Ubuntu JeOS iso image from following url and install it either in VMWare or VirtualBox .
Download Ubuntu JeOS
Installing GUI
This part of guide can be used to install GUI on ubuntu server .
First update your apt cache by issuing following command .
sudo apt - get update
You may install either xdm / gdm / kdm for login manager .
Since xdm is lighter than others I prefer installing it .
sudo apt - get -y install xdm
Install core of gnome with out any extra baggage .
sudo apt - get -y install gnome - core
Install xorg since gnome needs it .
sudo apt - get -y install xorg
Your gui setup is now complete but since we did n't install any theme default desktop is not that eye friendly .
Just install Ubuntu human theme by issuing following command .
sudo apt - get -y install human - theme
Start xdm by issing following command .
sudo /etc/init.d/xdm start
Your basic Ubuntu desktop now ready without extra baggage like open office and other applications .
This basic setup works nicely in either VMWare or VirtualBox .
Remember to install either VMWare or VirtualBox guest addons to speedup your virtual machine .

Der Einsatz von Wahlcomputern bei der Bundestagswahl 2005 war verfassungswidrig .
Das hat das Bundesverfassungsgericht heute in einem Grundsatzurteil entschieden .
Die Wähler hätten nicht die abgegebenen Stimmen und die Auszählung kontrollieren können , argumentieren die Richter ( AZ : 2 BvC 3/07 und 2 BvC 4/07 ) .
Das widerspreche dem Grundsatz der Öffentlichkeit der Wahl .
Die Bundestagswahl selbst bleibe aber gültig , es werde keine Neuwahl nötig , weil keine Hinweise auf Fehler oder Manipulationen an den Wahlgeräten vorlägen und deshalb der " Bestandsschutz der gewählten Volksvertretung " überwiege .
Die Richter haben den Einsatz von Wahlmaschinen nicht grundsätzlich abgelehnt .
Da aber Programmierfehler oder gezielte Manipulation der Software schwer zu erkennen seien , müssten Bürger bei ihrer Stimmabgabe prüfen können , ob die Stimme vom Computer unverfälscht erfasst wurde .
" Die große Breitenwirkung möglicher Fehler an den Wahlgeräten oder gezielter Wahlfälschungen gebietet besondere Vorkehrungen zur Wahrung des Grundsatzes der Öffentlichkeit der Wahl " , heißt es in dem Urteil .
Die beiden erfolgreichen Beschwerdeführer , Ulrich Wiesner und sein Vater , der emeritierte Politikwissenschaftler Professor Joachim Wiesner .
In dem Verfahren ging es um die Verwendung von Wahlcomputern bei der Bundestagswahl im September 2005 .
An den Geräten der niederländischen Firma Nedap hatten in 1831 von insgesamt rund 80.000 Stimmbezirken etwa zwei Millionen Wähler ihre Stimme abgeben müssen .
Der Frankfurter Physiker und Software - Spezialist Ulrich Wiesner und sein Vater Joachim Wiesner hatten im Februar 2007 beim Verfassungsgericht geklagt , nachdem im Dezember 2006 sein Wahleinspruch durch den Deutschen Bundestag abgelehnt wurde .
Wiesner hatte den Wahlprüfungseinspruch insbesondere damit begründet , dass die Ergebnisfeststellung mit diesen Geräten eine geheime Auszählung darstelle , die den Augen des Wahlvorstands und anwesenden Bürger entzogen werde und deshalb " von Anfang an gesetzeswidrig " sei .
Update : Der Tenor der Entscheidung solle aber nicht " dazu verleiten zu meinen , das Bundesverfassungsgericht sei technikfeindlich und verkenne die Herausforderungen und Möglichkeiten des digitalen Zeitalters " betonte der Senatsvorsitzende Prof.
Andreas Voßkuhle bei der Verkündung des Urteils .
Nach Auffassung des Gerichts sei der Einsatz von Wahlgeräten , die die Stimmen der Wähler elektronisch erfassen und das Wahlergebnis elektronisch ermitteln , durchaus möglich .
Voßkuhle verwies in diesem Zusammenhang explizit auf Möglichkeiten zur parallelen unabhängigen Erfassung und Zählung der Stimmen durch einen Voter Verified Paper Trail , Stimmzettelscanner oder den digitalen Wahlstift .
Auch Internetwahlen habe das Gericht in dieser Entscheidung " nicht etwa einen endgültigen Riegel vorgeschoben " , erklärte er .
Zugleich aber nannte er als Voraussetzung für den Einsatz elektronischer Wahlgeräte " die Wahrung des verfassungsrechtlichen Grundsatzes der Öffentlichkeit der Wahl " , dem das Gericht zentrale Bedeutung für die demokratische Willensbildung beimesse .
Dieser Grundsatz setze insbesondere voraus , dass die wesentlichen Schritte der Wahlhandlung und der Ergebnisermittlung vom Bürger " zuverlässig und ohne besondere Sachkenntnis " überprüft und nachvollzogen werden können .
Dies sei weder bei den verwendeten Nedap - Geräten der Fall noch genüge die Bundeswahlgeräte - Verordnung einschließlich der Richtlinien für die Bauart von Wahlgeräten , die das Bundeswahlgesetz konkretisieren , diesen Anforderungen .
Bei den Wahlen im laufenden Jahr – mit Bundestags - und Europawahl , vier weiteren Landtags - und acht Kommunalwahlen – wird wieder mit Papier und Kugelschreiber gewählt .
" Solche Wahlgeräte dürfen bei der nächsten Bundestagswahl nicht mehr zum Einsatz kommen " , sagte Thomas Strobl ( CDU ) , stellvertretender Vorsitzender des Wahlprüfungsausschusses laut dpa .

You deserve some great tools , so I ’d like to share what I ’ve been working on .
You might have an upcoming presentation , or you might be looking to speak more at events .
( here ’s how to start speaking at events ) I have a few ideas for you .
I want to share with you my current thinking on presentations , such that I hope you feel equipped to do more with your own work .
Fair ?
Presentations are a way to move information from my head into your actions .
If I do it right , I give my ideas “ handles , ” so that you can run with what I ’ve started and make it your own .
If you do it right , then your presentations will also help others .
I ’ve been thinking about the anatomy of presentations , and what we can do to improve how we ’re doing what we do .
Start with WIIFM
I have talked about this before , but the first and most important thing to talk about first is explaining what ’s in it for me , the listener , the audience .
“ What ’s in it for me ? ” Answer that early .
You might start by saying , “ You ’ve got a lot of work on your plate .
I ’ve got seven ideas for how to make that go smoothly for you . ”
See what that does ?
It starts the story from the reader ’s perspective .
And if you think of your audience as readers in a story , or viewers of a movie , or an audience at a play , you ’re in the right mindset .
What Is the Goal of a Presentation ?
Perhaps the simplest goal is that a presentation is built to convey ideas .
But to me , that ’s not going far enough .
If I ’m going to bother to educate through a presentation , my goal is to influence you to take action and / or change behavior .
It ’s not good enough that you walk away as if you feel you know something more .
I want you to want to do something more .
So , if you think of it that way , a presentation is a sale .
If we ’re going to sell , we have to be a bit more serious about it .
With that in mind , I ’ve collected some ideas .
Maybe they ’ll spark some ideas of your own , and you can add them to the conversation .
Use a Framework of Some Kind
I absolutely loathe the “ I ’m going to tell you this ; I am telling you this ; I told you this ” method of presentations .
We do n’t watch movies that way .
Only some books have a table of contents up front ( fiction does n’t do that often ) .
It ’s just not fun seeing the “ Title , Agenda , About Me ” method .
We ’re too used to it .
Instead , how about a framework like this ( for example ) ?
Ask your audience a question that frames the speech .
Tell your audience how you ’ll try and answer that question .
Start with a personal or investigatory story .
Drill down into the details of how the story applies to your presentation .
Offer some takeaways or next - actions for this .
Tell another personal or informational story .
Repeat the drill down points , the takeaways , etc .
Thread questions in earlier than the end .
Finish with a solid set of steps people can use to take action based on your presentation .
This is one storytelling frame .
You can do all kinds of other variations on the theme .
For instance , what if you did something like this :
Start with a question about a famous figure .
Explain that your audience is there to help you figure out if that figure embodies the subject matter you ’re covering .
Ask them to consider the figure at every step in the presentation .
And present …
In whichever framework you choose , make sure that you check in , frequently with your audience .
Be sure they ’re moving along with your presentation .
If you see eyes glazing , react ( either by livening up your speaking tone , or by noting where people start to glaze and fixing it in a subsequent effort ) .
If you see enthusiasm , look at that person for inspiration .
But always check in .
Often .
Inspiration for Great Speeches
It ’s easier to learn if you pull from interesting sources for inspiration .
First off , some number of you thought my first link would be to TED or PopTech .
Though you can hear some amazing speeches there , I thought we ’d slip off the beaten path of presentations and look for our inspiration elsewhere .
Cirque Du Soleil –
If you ’re going to design presentations , what would happen if you thought of them like a performance ?
I ’ve seen two Cirque du Soleil shows in the last 12 months , and I think you could do worse than to think like a performance troupe who breaks the boundaries of showmanship with each event .

Alec Baldwin – The “ Always Be Closing ” Speech – The important part of this speech is the passion , the timing , the directness .
Yes , there ’s cursing , but there ’s also big heaps of passion .
Watch and learn .

David Lee Roth –
In his time , David was quite the showman .
Say what you will about his music , he knew what the audience wanted and he gave it to them .
A good showman ( showperson ? ) knows how to give the audience his or her best .

Watch Eve Ensler doing her vagina thing for TED ( yep , I blew it and had to point you to TED ) .
Did you see how she started ?
She pulled you in right away .
It ’s an uncomfortable topic ( to some ) , and you can watch her move people back and forth from emotions .
Do you even think about emotions when you think about presentations ?
Notice also how she does this as a conversation , and yet , it ’s very practiced .

Look at comic book covers .
Graphic design and interesting layout for your presentations sure does n’t come canned inside the application .
Look for it .
Think on ways to deliver different visual experiences , and think about how to make them more interesting than linear text and clip art .

What About the Physical World ? – I ’ve been increasingly more interested with thinking about how the physical world can tie into the world in our minds .
If you do something physical in the room , it makes a buzz .
The point is this : do n’t look at other slide decks to be inspired .
Look at other sources that go far afield of the beaten path and bring some synthesis of those ideas and your goals together on the table for you to work with .
Think like a creator and a storyteller , and use tools way outside one specific constraint to get where you need to go .
Shop Your Work
You can practice and test and work out your presentations , you know .
Author and speaker David Meerman Scott works from the perspective of perfecting his presentations , mapping them out to great detail , and then tweaking only small pieces while leaving the most of his work intact .
I think both Mitch Joel and Seth Godin do the same : take their presentations into a fairly solid form , and then just modify certain parts to match certain audiences .
It makes sense .
Working from a solid place , a home base , a pre-conceived set of ideas in a certain flow makes sense to lots of folks .
But do n’t be afraid to try things .
How I ’ve Been Doing It
The way I ’ve been doing my presentations over the last several weeks has been very experimental .
I ’ve been writing some ideas into a small notebook and presenting from that notebook .
The thing is , I ’ve been doing it without a linear storyline .
I ’ve worked strictly in the moment , like an improv actor or an artist or a cook .
I take all the raw pieces of my conversations and work them into pieces of information on the fly and in real time .
I enjoy it .
My audience does n’t seem to like it as much .
They come away appreciative of my passion but no more ready to take action .
And that matters , so after some feedback , I ’m working on my own presentations to reel them back into something that matches what ’s above .
It ’s important that you realize that your presentation is not just your creative work , but also your audience ’s time and attention .
If you do n’t give your work some level of care and if you do n’t constantly strive to communicate better with your audience , then why will people choose to learn from you over another source ?
Always pay attention to how your audience receives your work .
Always seek feedback .
Always strive to improve even more .
What Else Can I Tell You ?
I know what I know .
What do you want to now ?
How may I help you understand more ?
What will help this all make sense ?
What more can I add or clarify ?
Thank you , as always , for your time and attention .
It ’s my goal that you feel like you receive value from spending time with me , and it ’s my aim to be helpful .
Thanks .

As we all are experiencing economic downfall .
Technology market is greatly shaken and effected .
Many companies have cut jobs and productions to survive , as ' power to buy ' of people has decreased .
Apple , the most admired company of the world , has products that sell like hotcakes not just because of their sleek design and looks , but also as admiration and brand inspiration .
Not many users can afford Apple products as they are targeted for a certain class .
This year , as world ’s biggest problem is economy and highly decreasing standard of living , Apple seems to be taking steps by introducing cheaper products to retain survival and growth in market in such a critical and uncertain situation .
Netbooks are gaining popularity because of their affordability .
Apple plans to get in the Netbook market by introducing Mac Netbooks later this year .
A Taiwanese system manufacturer company named Quanta has agreed with Apple to start the manufacture of Netbooks .
But who knows if this Netbook will be really as affordable as a ‘ netbook ’!
after all its Apple !
The new iPhone nano ( cheaper iPhone ) is rumored to appear at MacWorld or later this year .
i Phone nano ’s rumors are appealing to me , and I believe that Apple is going to introduce a low price iPhone to capture more market .
Analyst also believe that iPod shuffle will become smaller and cheaper .
Large tablet devices are also expected like iPod touch with larger screen … also Tablet Macbook .
Apple is slowly expected to make place for pay - per - go services that it may introduce in upcoming 5 years .
As iWork is to become a Web Application , Apple will be pushing the boundaries of what a web application can accomplish .
Microsoft will push more towards mesh enabled device programming capabilities this year that will make device to device synchronizing easier and fun…Apple will surely concentrate for a cover .
Steve Jobs , having health issues , will be less active in Apple … and his old buddy Steve Wozniak ( Apple ’s co-funder who , once , quitted Apple ) has jumped in again and some changes are expected in the taste of Apple .
Let ’s see what comes at Macworld .
This year will be interesting for technology and moving more towards online services can be a common goal .

Matthews smacks down Ari Fleischer who 's been out on a Bush redemption media blitz of late for his Bush kept us safe from a terrorist attack nonsense .
He obviously got under Fleischer 's skin since Fleischer got pretty snitty with him for daring to challenge his talking points .
Matthews did a pretty good job here but as friend of the site and fellow contributor Jon Perr pointed out to us Matthews has disappointed in the past and is sure to continue to in the future .
For all his ferocity towards Fleischer today and his claim about the Bush White House in 2007 that “ they wo n’t silence me , ” Chris Matthews spent an awful long time calling George W. Bush and his friends , “ good guys . ”
As Jon noted at Perrspectives back in 2007 Chris Matthews : Bush White House " Good Guys " Wo n't Silence Me :
But what we do know is that Chris Matthews likes George W. Bush and the " good guys " of his White House - a lot .
They may be , Matthews now suggests , thugs and criminals , but they are thugs and criminals you want to drink a beer with all the same :
" I thought in listening to the president , I was listening to one of the great neoconservative minds .
We were given a rare opportunity to hear the real philosophy of this administration with regard to the war in Iraq . "

" I like him .
Everybody sort of likes the president , except for the real whack - jobs , maybe on the left . "
( November 28 , 2005 )

Americans love having a guy as president , a guy who has a little swagger , who 's physical . "
( May 1 , 2003 )
" For example , George Allen is a lot like George Bush .
He 's friendly .
He 's a jock in a way .
He 's happy go lucky .
He 's a good guy to hang out with , kicks back . "
( May 24 , 2006 )
" They 're very adept politically , this White House .
And whatever you think of Karl Rove , he is good and he is tough . "

Good guy , he has been , he is , and he will be . " ( September 4 , 2007 )

You live modestly .
You commute back and forth from Washington to Houston , Texas .

I looked at all the Republican candidates running for election in tough elections .
I thought he was probably the best of them . "
To Missouri Senator - elect Claire McCaskill , ( November 28 , 2006 )
" Mike DeWine , a good guy . " ( February 9 , 2007 )
" Chris Shays , actually a good guy , we 'll see how he deals with this thing . "

Glenn Greenwald talked with Bill Moyers Friday night about the rule of law and how it was perverted by the Bush administration :
BILL MOYERS : To be fair , you make a strong case in here that we have to stand up to extremism but that we have to protect our own constitutional principles while we do .
And as I read both of these books , it is the sense that out of this Manichean view there came this whole notion that you say is alien to America , this unitary executive powers of the presidency .
Have I stated that right ?
GLENN GREENWALD : You have .
Let ’s just quickly describe in the most dispassionate terms , as few of euphemisms , as possible , where we are and what has happened over the last eight years .
We have a law in place that says it is a felony offense punishable by five years in prison or a $ 10,000 fine to eavesdrop on American citizens without warrants .
We have laws in place that say that it is a felony punishable by decades in prison to subject detainees in our custody to treatment that violates the Geneva Conventions or that is inhumane or coercive .
We know that the president and his top aides have violated these laws .
The facts are indisputable that they ’ve done so .
And yet as a country , as a political class , we ’re deciding basically in unison that the president and our highest political officials are free to break the most serious laws that we have , that our citizens have enacted , with complete impunity , without consequences , without being held accountable under the law .
And when you juxtapose that with the fact that we are a country that has probably the most merciless criminal justice system on the planet when it comes to ordinary Americans .
We imprison more of our population than any country in the world .
We have less than five percent of the world ’s population .
And yet 25 percent almost of prisoners worldwide are inside the United States .
What you have is a two - tiered system of justice where ordinary Americans are subjected to the most merciless criminal justice system in the world .
They break the law .
The full weight of the criminal justice system comes crashing down upon them .
But our political class , the same elites who have imposed that incredibly harsh framework on ordinary Americans , have essentially exempted themselves and the leaders of that political class from the law .
They have license to break the law .
That ’s what we ’re deciding now as we say George Bush and his top advisors should n’t be investigated let alone prosecuted for the laws that we know that they ’ve broken .
And I ca n’t think of anything more damaging to our country because the rule of law is the lynchpin of everything we have .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Warner Bros on Monday became the first studio to open its film vault to “ made - to - order ” DVDs , as it sought new revenues in a slumping DVD market by making it possible for fans to buy decades - old films .
Warner Bros , owned by Time Warner Inc , made an initial batch of 150 titles available for purchase online at www.WarnerArchive.com , including 1943 comedy - romance " Mr. Lucky " starring Cary Grant and the 1962 release " All Fall Down " with Warren Beatty and Eva Marie Saint .
Sales are not expected to approach those of new releases on DVD , but the service gives Warner Bros another way to make money from a film archive it already exploits by selling titles for broadcast in the United States and internationally .
The on - demand service allows Warner Bros. to avoid the risk of manufacturing too many copies of old or obscure titles and shipping them to retailers because customers directly order only the titles they want to buy .
“ This way you ’ve completely eliminated the risk of not selling them .
You ’re not going to make them until they ’re sold , ” said Tom Adams , president and senior analyst with Adams Media Research .
Warner Bros. said that each month it will make about 20 films and television programs from its archive available for purchase through this DVD - on - demand program .
The new Warner Bros. initiative comes as the movie industry faces declining DVD sales .
Last year , amid the ongoing recession DVD sales fell by 7 percent to $ 21.6 billion , the Digital Entertainment Group said .
Studios are mainly looking to the emerging Blu-ray disc market to counter declining DVD sales , Adams said .
Last year , sales of Blu-ray discs quadrupled to nearly $ 750 million , the Digital Entertainment Group said .
But with the new DVD - on - demand service , Warner Bros can supplement its sales by appealing to collectors and fans .
The Warner Bros film archive has 6,800 titles .
Since it entered the DVD market in 1997 , the studio has released only around 1,200 of those titles from the vault .
By comparison , the company expects by the end of the year to have more than 300 titles available via the DVD - on - demand service .
“ I think ultimately the odds are very good that every film ever made will be available on this kind of basis , because why not ? ”
Adams said .
Warner Bros. is charging customers $ 19.95 per title , plus shipping , for the new service .
Titles also can be downloaded directly to a customer ’s computer .

QUEERTY REPORTS–
One of our tipsters alerted us to one of the creepier proselytizing efforts we ’ve seen by the ex-gay community .
Lambert Dolphin , a 76 - year old ex-gay writer and geophysicist who has written academic papers that aim to scientifically prove Biblical claims , signs on to gay dating site D - List on a nearly daily basis , where he ’s been emailing and befriending young gay guys in an attempt to get them to reconsider their sexuality .
Describing himself as a “ Freewheeling follower of Jesus Christ ” , Dolphin ’s profile makes numerous references to his religious beliefs that on the surface appear innocuous , but a closer investigation reveals an ulterior motive .
Eric ( not his real name ) is a regular D - List user and received a message from Dolphin earlier this year :
“ It was a kind of harmless , completely random message along the lines of “ Just wanted to let you know that I ’d be here for you if you ever needed support . ”
A lot of the same things he has on profile — stuff about how he wo n’t judge and he ’ll just offer support .
But then if you go to his official site , you can see that he ’s done tons of writing on ex-gay counseling .
I wrote back and kind of tried to get him to speak on that but he kind of ignored me in a way and just kept saying , “ I ’d be here for you to support you , ” talking about God , etc .
But then I mentioned the explicitly ex-gay writings on his web site , saying that I ’d rather him not message me ever again because after reading those things , it ’s clear that he had an agenda . ”
The site in question , Lambert Dolphin ’s Library , is a treasure trove of ex-gay articles and doctrines .
On a page called “ Jesus and the Homosexual , ” Lambert has clippings of over two decades ’ worth of ex-gay material , with a special focus on stories about gay “ boys ” ; the very kind of young men that Dolphin appears to be targeting on D - List .
Articles have titles like “ The Limitations Of Homosexual Love ” and “ Emotional Longing in Men . ”
One article says :
“ Boys who fail to identify with and bond with a father - figure feel uncertain of what it means to me a man–from a very early age .
They often inferior to , and alienated from , other boys their own age .
Accompanying this is a strong sense of envy : “ I wish I were as handsome and well built as so - and - so . ”
Crushes with other guys may develop signaling that a deep unmet need exists in the boy who has never felt really loved and affirmed by a father .
It is as if a deficiency existed in the boy ’s reservoir of masculine self - esteem and he is forever seeking the lost part of himself in other males …
It is wrong at this stage to label such boys as gay .
They are predisposed towards becoming homosexuals , but they are n’t there yet .
Since the basic problem –the inner most need–is for affirmation from members of the same sex–for “ same - sex bonding ” –the situation can be radically changed by special attention from an uncle , a scout leader , school teacher , youth leader or caring male friend .
Or better still , if the father who was never really “ there ” for his son takes radical steps to build a strong friendship with an alienated son , healing can begin …
The cure for homosexuality is not merely abstinence from sexual activity that displeases God .
Becoming whole means being loved and filled with Jesus the Lord as one ’s true and faithful Lover .
Anything short of this is spiritual –if not literal–adultery and infidelity . ”
And on D - List , it seems that Dolphin has decided to give that “ special attention ” to young men .
Dolphin ’s profile has 324 friends , most of them under the age of 24 .
Eric , who is 23 , says Dolphin ’s advances left him “ terrified ” , saying :
“ It was bizarre to me that he thought he could get away with it , so terrifying he was talking to young kids , maybe kids even just out of the closet — absolutely terrible and sad .
It was like he had a template of things to say .
My friend knows much more about ex gay organizations than I do , so he was helping me try and word things appropriately to get him to answer things without tiptoeing around what he was trying to do .
But he kept on tip - toeing — which was terrifying because we were reading his writings at the same time .
It scares me that he thinks people would n’t see that .
The other poor guys he ’s talking to might not have any idea .
You ’d be amazed .
He was just very “ I just want to support you , just want to help you out . ”
I can imagine many young people , having just come out , still trying to reconcile their faith , listening to him where he quite possibly later would start saying “ you need to be celibate ” , like he says on his web site . ”
Eric eventually confronted Dolphin and asked if he was an ex-gay :
“ He ignored the direct question asking him if he was “ ex - gay ” but denied being associated with Exodus or anything like that , though we never even insinuated that directly .
But he did allude to that he “ was ” gay .
And had struggled with that in his life .
He said things like , “ I ’ve been around for a long time .
I ’ve seen a lot . ”
Queerty tried to reach Dolphin for this article , but have not heard back .
Eric wrote D - List administrators about his concerns , but received no reply .
While there ’s nothing illegal about using a gay dating site to proselytize , the extreme age difference between Dolphin and the young gay men he approaches , along with duplicitous way he disguises his ex-gay motivations for reaching out to them , sends shudders down our spine .
What about you ?
LONDON ( Reuters ) - British industrial output shrank at its fastest pace since 1981 in January , confounding policymakers ’ hopes that exporters would get an early boost from weaker sterling and coming on top of bad news for retail .

REUTERS / Sarah Marsh
Industrial production , which makes up 18 percent of the British economy , fell 2.6 percent in January alone and is down 11.4 percent on a year ago , Tuesday ’s data from the Office for National Statistics showed .
Total production is now at its lowest since April 1993 after particularly sharp declines in the production of cars , machinery and electrical equipment .
The numbers are just the latest showing factory production lines all around the world have come to a halt , with French figures released earlier in the day showing a record 13.8 percent annual drop in industrial output .
“ The industrial sector is suffering a real hammering globally , and UK manufacturers are taking their fair share of the hits , ” said Howard Archer , chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight .
None of this bodes well for the Bank of England ’s hope that sterling ’s 20 percent fall in the last three months of 2008 would spur exports .
There is little support from retail either .
The British Retail Consortium reported that like - for - like sales were down 1.8 percent year - on - year in February after severely cold weather and the end of post - Christmas discounts .
“ These numbers continue to be weaker than those reported in the official retail sales statistics .
That ’s because Internet sales continue to be extremely strong so ... consumer spending should remain one of the less weak parts of the UK economy , ” said Neville Hill , director of European economics at Credit Suisse .
The housing market also maintained its downward course .
The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors reported that average home sales per surveyor fell to 9.5 in the three months to February , its lowest since the series started in 1978 , and its house price balance sank to - 78.3 from - 76.6 .
STEEP RECESSION
Britain entered recession last year for the first time since the early 1990s , and GDP shrank at its fastest pace since 1980 in the last three months of 2008 .
“ It ’s bad , ” said George Buckley , chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank .
“ This is very much part of a global downturn . ”
Manufacturing output , which accounts for around 14 percent of the economy and excludes energy and utilities , fell by 2.9 percent in January against forecasts for a 1.4 percent fall .
This brought an annual drop of 12.8 percent , also the steepest decline since January 1981 .
In the three months to January compared with the previous three months , factory output fell by 6.4 percent , its biggest drop since records began in 1968 .
“ This horrific outcome points to another chunky subtraction from overall GDP during Q1 , ” said Alan Clarke at BNP Paribas .
But analysts said the much weaker than expected figures would have little impact on monetary policy as the Bank of England has already cut interest rates to a record low of 0.5 percent and is starting an aggressive programme of quantitative easing .
The ONS said 12 out of 13 manufacturing sectors recorded declines in the three months to January , with especially significant falls in transport equipment , basic metals and metal products , machinery and equipment , and chemicals and man-made fibres .
The only sector which increased output was coke , refined petrol and nuclear fuel , which expanded by 4.2 percent .
Several distributors and retailers are showing that Intel 's upcoming Core i7 975 will ship at the beginning of April , not the end of May .
Is the Intel Core i7 975 coming sooner than we think ?
That 's what many distributors and retailers are reporting , and actually have the upcoming processor listed for next month .
As an example , this website shows an April 6 street date , and this website shows an estimated date of April 7 .
Granted , these dates are n't official , and are estimates only .
However , it 's a huge jump considering that the Core i7 975 was n't expected to ship until the end of May .
The release of the 45nm Core i7 975 ( Extreme ) is a rather highly - anticipated one , as the quad - core Bloomfield processor will serve as the new flagship chip for Intel , boasting a core speed of 3.33 GHz , support for LGA 1366 sockets , uses 1 MB of L2 cache and 8 MB of L3 shared cache memory , and has a TDP of 130W .
Recently the processor was leaked , overclocked , and benchmarked , pushed up to an " extreme " clock core speed of 5,239 MHz , breaking the then - current record of Futuremark 's 2DMark05 benchmark application .
As it stands now , the benchmarked rig featuring the Core i7 975 sits in the # 2 position , recently conquered by a rig sporting Intel 's Core i7 965 .
As of this writing , the Intel Core i7 975 will cost end -users a whopping $ 999 USD ; the Core i7 950 , clocking in at 3.06 GHz , will be available as well for a cheaper - but - still - hefty $ 562 USD .
Other processors included in the original May lineup consist of the Core 2 Duo E7600 ( $ 84 ) , the Pentium Dual - Core E6300 ( $ 84 ) , and the Celeron Dual - Core E1600 ( $ 53 ) .
Intel also plans to ship six Core 2 Quad processors next month .

The " Adorably " Bombastic Foreigner
The Classic Example : Roberto Benigni back - flipping off chairs and announcing that he " would like to be Jupiter and kidnap everybody and take them to the firmament and make love to everybody " after winning for Life is Beautiful in 1998 .
The Historical Precedent :
In 1961 , when Rita Moreno heard she had won Best Supporting Actress for her performance in West Side Story , she cha-cha'ed all the way up to the podium and then screamed " I can't believe it ! " into the microphone , which is kind of like a scene in West Side Story , but not quite as annoying .

Advertisement Police in the Pakistani city of Karachi have used sticks to beat up protesters as lawyers and political activists began an anti-government protest march .
Organisers intend the four - day march from cities across Pakistan to culminate in a sit-in at the parliament in the capital , Islamabad , on Monday .
They want President Asif Ali Zardari to fulfil a pledge to reinstate all judges sacked under his predecessor .
The government says the march is aimed at destabilising the country .
Police say they have arrested more than 400 opposition activists in the past few days .
The authorities have also banned political gatherings across the country , saying they could trigger bloodshed .
More arrests Lawyers had been entering the Sindh High Court complex in Karachi in ones and twos since the morning to get around the ban .
In pictures : Pakistan protests Pakistanis describe rising tension Deja-vu in Pakistan Hundreds of police and troops were deployed outside the court .
Despite the ban , a group of Jamaat - e - Islami party activists managed to arrive near the court and a scuffle broke out with the police .
The police used batons and sticks to beat back the protesters .
Dozens of demonstrators were arrested .
They later made further arrests as the protesters began marching down the main highway on the outskirts of the city .
There were minor skirmishes and some of the marchers suffered slight injuries , but the march was not allowed to proceed down the road .
The BBC's M Ilyas Khan says the situation is very tense .
Security forces remain on alert amid fears of violence , according to reports .
Protesters also rallied in the cities of Quetta and Lahore .
Activists believe the ban on political gatherings is a bid to disrupt the rallies , which they are calling the " long march " .
They have pledged that they will be peaceful .
' Promoting democracy '
The protest follows a heightening of tensions in Pakistan , after a court ruling barring Nawaz Sharif and his brother from holding public office .
Pakistanis defiant and fearful Q&A : Pakistan political instability Mr Sharif has backed the lawyers ' demand for the judges to be reinstated and has called on Pakistanis to join the demonstration .
" The march is going to be peaceful , it is a march which has been called by the lawyers ' community of the country and we are supporting this cause because we think that this march can certainly promote democracy in this country , " Mr Sharif told the BBC .
The current president was freely elected but that does not mean that Pakistan was a democracy , Mr Sharif said .
" You can't have democracy without an independent judiciary , without judges who are loyal to the state and we do n't want judges who are loyal to one single individual .
" Therefore , I think we need to have all those amendments in the constitution repealed which were introduced by dictator [ former President Pervez ]
Musharraf and we want the rule of law back in to this country .
And we do n't think without these things we will have democracy back in Pakistan . "
' Deepening crisis '
The sackings in November 2007 of some 60 senior judges , including the then - chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry , sparked countrywide protests and ultimately led to Mr Musharraf 's resignation .
FROM THE BBC WORLD SERVICE Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from BBC World Service Organisers hope that thousands of people will once again take to the streets .
They say they intend to continue their protest indefinitely in Islamabad until President Zardari acts on his promise to reinstate the judges .
Mr Zardari 's critics argue he has not done so because he fears the chief justice could revive corruption cases against him .
The government appears determined to keep protesters outside the capital , correspondents say .
Six months after Mr Zardari took office , Pakistan is descending deeper into crisis , correspondents add .
The country is being affected by the deteriorating political and economic situation as well as high - profile attacks by militants .
Observers add that Mr Sharif 's backing of the protesters has turned the march into a power struggle that the country can ill afford , says the BBC's Barbara Plett in Islamabad .

Israel 's national intelligence agency Mossad has been behind a failed coup in Turkey , the Turkish daily newspaper Milliyet reports .
A secret investigation into detained Ergenekon group members and other studies outside Turkey indicate that Mossad orchestrated the coup plot against the Turkish government , the report says .
The Ergenekon group is a Turkish neo-nationalist organization with alleged links to the military , members of which have been arrested on charges of plotting to foment unrest in the country .
Investigators uncovered evidence that show a Jewish rabbi named Tuncay Guney , who worked for Mossad and fled to Canada in 2004 , was a key figure behind attempts to overthrow the Turkish government .
A document uncovered this week by the / Sabah / daily shows how Guney purposefully infiltrated Ergenekon and another organization known as JITEM , an illegal intelligence unit in the gendarmerie suspected of hundreds of murders and kidnappings .
The rabbi was taken out of Turkey and sent to the US for protection after his identity was exposed in an investigation by Turkish police , according to Sabah .
Guney is also reported to have links with Israeli espionage activities in Egypt .
According to Egyptian security forces , at least one of three suspects currently being pursued by the Egyptian government for spying was in contact with Tuncay Guney .

The Toronto Board of Rabbis has no record of a rabbi by his name .
The communications director of the United Jewish Appeal in Toronto , Howard English , did not recognize him or his synagogue .
The education director of the Toronto branch of Jews for Judaism , rabbi Michael Skobac , did not recognize him , and could not reach them by e-mail .

Ergenekon network mainly aims to break Turkey 's ties with the NATO and the West in general .
Most of the Ergenekon members are anti-Semitic and ultra-Turkist .
They claim that the MOSSAD and Israel in general has played a dirty role in Turkish politics .
Almost all of them are anti-Semitic .
Some of the Ergenekon intellectuals wrote anti-Semitic books and started anti-Semitic campaigns in order to spread their anit -Israeli opinion among the people .
They claim the US , the EU and Israel have made efforts to divide the country .

You 're about to read a very , very strange story .
We begin by taking note of a national insult -- the sort of insult which , in the 19th century , might have led to war .
A debate about the Gaza attack was held at the World Economic Forum in Davos .
Israeli President Simon Peres attended , as did Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan .
The panel was moderated by David Ignatius of the Peres spoke for nearly half an hour -- well beyond his allotted time -- while Erdogan patiently took notes .
When Erdogan 's turn finally came , he accused Peres of speaking loud and long to cover up his guilt .
Ignatius ( who happens to be both Jewish and Armenian ) quickly cut him off , outraging many onlookers .
Erdogan stormed out Erdogan returned home to a hero 's welcome .
Turkey has long been one of Israel 's few allies .
( For some interesting backstory on the Israeli - Turkish alliance , see this piece by Victor Ostrovsky . )
After the Davos confrontation , that partnership may be at an end -- and the ramifications are disturbing .
The debate debacle appears to have beento sour Turkey 's relations with Israel ( and the U.S. ) .
If so , we should pay closer attention to David Ignatius .
Otherreporters have been known to practice a trade other than journalism .
( Chris Wren . ) I believe that this international dust - up concerns something more than a high - level debate beset by a biased moderator .
Although few Americans have noted the story , Mossad recently tried to mount a coup against Turkey .
At least , so says the Turkish press
That 's no small matter .
Turkey , for all of its many faults , is a key NATO ally and an important partner in the war on terror ( to the extent that there remains awar on terror ) .
The Turkish news article summarized above was preceded by this report written by -- egads ! -- Wayne Madsen .
I 've had serious problems with Madsen 's reportage in the past .
He 's right about half the time , and I usually can't tell which half is which , since he relies on unnamed sources .
In this case , Ithat he may be onto something , but I 'm not sure .
One thing 's for sure : Guney appears to be a lint - trap for occult speculation .
He 's a fascinating guy .
A Turkish citizen with " business " links to Russia and Egypt , he is listed as the chief rabbi for this synagogue in Toronto .
But he may not even be Jewish .
His mother teaches the Koran .
Other sources say that he converted to Christianity in 2004 .
He now likes to blather on about being an Egyptian " Sabbatian " Jew .
Believe that if you will .
Some speculate that he is actually CIA -- an allegation which , if proven true , might mean that this very post has been mis-headlined .
Wikipedia 's summary of Guney 's life is downright wild , especially when it discusses the man 's stay in New York ( where he wasup to spy stuff ) and his dealings with evangelicals .
( The CIA has often used evangelical missions for cover . )
Actually , Guney 's synagogue in Canada appears to be an intelligence front .
The pseudo - synagogue 's website lists him as Daniel T. Guney .
The Turks and the Egyptians say that he has used the alias Daniel Levi .
By the way :
The very complete Guney entry offered by Wikipedia looks to me like a dossier compiled by an intelligence professional , using open - source materials .
This is n't the only Wikipedia entry to convey that impression .
For more clues , see this article on Guney inGuney is connected with a secretive , ultra-reactionary " cabal " in Turkey called Ergenekon , which has long stood accused of perpetrating terrorism .
It 's the Turkish version of Italy 's P2 .
Ergenekon takes a fervently anti-Western , pro-Fascist line .
The group is willing to kill in order to separate Turkey from the U.S. , Israel and the rest of Europe .
In an earlier post , I noted that If Guney is a rabbi , why is aaiding such a group ?
If Guney is Mossad , why isaiding such a group ?
If Guney is CIA , why isaiding such a group ?
This report holds that Guney had infiltrated the group on behalf of MIT ( Turkey 's CIA ) .
But it also says that Guney was more of an informant than an .
And , as noted above , the Turkish government avers that Guney did everything he could to help Ergenekon bring down that government and hoist a hard - right faction into the seat of power .
I 'm trying to figure out the man 's motive .
Did GuneyErgenekon , or was his taskand ?
Milliyet , the Turkish journal , says that Guney manipulated the terror group .
If the Milliyet report is correct , why would a Mossad agent ( if Guney really is such ) want to help a pro-Hitler , anti-Israel group achieve prominence ?
( I 'm reminded of our earlier post , in which we learned that Israel helped Hamas come to power . )
And why ( to bring matters full circle ) did the President of Israel go out of his way to alienate the leader of the one nation in the Islamic world that had befriended Israel ?
Was that epic slight linked to the claimed Mossad coup attempt ?
I honestly cannot fathom what theis here !
I plan to continue my discussion of Boij–Söderberg theory from last time , but I ’d like to make a quick detour first .
This came up today in the office when I was talking with yanzhang .
Question :
If I randomly pick numbers ( with a uniform distribution ) from the unit interval [ 0,1 ] , what is the expected number of numbers that I need to pick before their sum is at least 1 ?
The answer for some strange reason is the number e , and I ’ll illustrate this with two approaches .
Both give different expressions of e , so this problem will show an equivalence between two definitions of e .
The first approach is to use calculus .
For , let f( r ) be the expected number of randomly selected numbers in [ 0,1 ] so that their sum is at least r , and define f( r ) = 0 if r is negative .
Then we have the following integral equation
.
To see this , pick a number t randomly in [ 0,1 ] , and then add f( r - t ) .
Since we need to account for all such t , we just integrate over [ 0 , r ] ( I could integrate over [ 0,1 ] , but remember that f( r - t ) = 0 if t>r ) , and divide this integral by the length of [ 0,1 ] , which is 1 .
The second inequality follows from a change of variables s=r-t .
Taking derivatives of both sides , we get by the fundamental theorem of calculus , so for some constant c .
Of course , f( 0 ) = 1 , so c=1 .
Our original question was for r=1 , in which case f( 1 ) = e , as we promised .
The second approach is the same , except we discretize everything .
Let ’s ask an analogous question .
First fix k .
If I randomly pick integers uniformly from [ 0 ,k ] , what is the expected number that I need before their sum is at least n , where ?
Let g( n ) be this expected value .
Then again , we have
by the same reasoning as before .
Let be the first difference operator , i.e. , .
Now apply to the above equation to get
.
Of course , g( - 1 ) = 0 , and rewriting this last equation gives
assuming that n>0 .
Since g(0 ) = 1 , this means that .
Now set k=n :
If we rephrase this question , we also see that g(n ) is the expected number of random selections of rational numbers with denominator n from [ 0,1 ] such that their sum is at least 1 .
Letting n go to infinity , we should get the answer from the previous method since the rationals form a dense subset of the reals .
So these two approaches show the equivalence of two definitions of e : one as the unique number such that , and the other as the limit .
Do you know of any other solutions to the original question ?

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
As Barack Obama takes off for his first overseas trip as president , a new national poll indicates that more than eight in 10 Americans think he will do a good job representing the United States to the world .
A poll indicates eight in 10 Americans think President Obama will represent the United States well to the world .
And seven in 10 people questioned in the CNN / Opinion Research Corporation survey , released Tuesday , believe that leaders of other countries respect Obama .
That last figure is in sharp contrast with George W. Bush .
At the start of his presidency in 2001 , only 49 percent believed that foreign leaders respected Bush .
" Except for the period following the 9/11 attacks , that number never got any better for Bush , " says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland .
Obama is scheduled to travel to Britain on Tuesday , where he will participate with other leaders in the G - 20 summit .
" Even among Republicans , a majority believes that other world leaders respect Obama . "
Obama is scheduled to travel to Britain on Tuesday , where he will participate with other leaders in the G - 20 summit .
The CNN / Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted March 12 - 15 , with 1,019 adult Americans questioned by telephone .
The survey 's sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points .

Are you confused by all the alternate timelines in the Terminator franchise ?
So are we .
That 's why we created a list of every timeline , and ran it past Sarah Connor Chronicles producer Josh Friedman .
Spoilers ...

1 ) The original (? ) timeline : Sarah Connor conceives John Connor with some random guy .
( All we hear about him is that " He dies , even before the war . "
Presumably it 's not Kyle Reese , since time - travel always seems to create an alternate timeline . )
John Connor 's resistance is on the verge of defeating Skynet in 2029 .
( Reese says , " The defensive grid was smashed .
We 'd taken the mainframes .
We 'd won .
Taking out Connor then would make no difference .
Skynet had to wipe out his entire existence . "
Date of Judgment Day : August 29 , 1997 .

2 ) A T -800 and Kyle Reese both travel back in time from 2029 .
Kyle Reese fathers John Connor .
Date of Judgment Day : still August 29 , 1997 .
3 ) A " scrubbed " T - 800 and an " experimental prototype " T - 1000 travel back from 2029 to 1995 .
Sarah Connor destroys Cyberdyne systems and apparently stops Skynet .
( In a deleted scene from Terminator 2 , we see that Sarah lived to an old age and John became a Senator . )
But we learn in Terminator 3 that Judgment Day was only delayed , until July 24 , 2004 .
According to T3 , Sarah Connor dies of cancer in 1997 .
John Connor dies in 2032 , at the hands of another T - 800 .
Advertisement
4 ) The T - 800 which killed John Connor is " scrubbed " and sent back in time to protect him , and a T - X is sent back to kill him and his future lieutenants .
What changes as a result of this time travel is unclear : the T - 800 ensures John Connor and Kate Brewster survive Judgment Day , but they were presumably going to survive it anyway .
John Connor now knows that this T - 800 will kill him in 2032 , meaning it probably wo n't .
And the younger John Connor has now encountered a T - X . This timeline leads into Terminator Salvation .

5 ) Sarah Connor does n't die of cancer in 1997 .
Instead , she 's still alive in 1999 , when a T - 888 ( Cromartie ) comes back to kill John , and another one ( Cameron ) comes back to protect him .
The Terminator known as Cameron jumps the Connors forward in time to 2007 , and Cameron informs Sarah she would have died of cancer in 2005 .
Judgment Day : unknown , but later than 2010 , because the Terminator known as Myron Stark is sent to kill the governor of California in 2010 .
Advertisement
6 ) Derek Reese , brother of Kyle , travels back in time with a whole squad of resistance fighters .
They seem to make a number of changes in the timeline , but most notably Derek kills Andy Goode , creator of an A.I. that might become Skynet .
From the glimpses of Derek 's version of 2029 , Skynet may no longer be on the " verge of defeat " as it was in the original timeline .
Judgment Day is now April 21 , 2011 .
Advertisement
7 ) Various other Terminators travel back in time , including Carter , who guards a warehouse full of coltan , Vick , who marries an L.A. city planner , and Myron Stark , who travels back to the 1920s by mistake .
There 's no telling what changes to the timeline these Terminators , in particular , make .
Advertisement
8 ) A T-1001 travels back in time to around 2005 , and kills Catherine Weaver , the CEO of Zeira Corp , and her husband .
It then impersonates Catherine Weaver .
What changes does she make to the timeline ?
It 's not entirely clear yet .
She buys Andy Goode's A.I. , " The Turk , " preventing it from falling into the hands of the Connors .
She saves a nuclear power plant that 's crucial to Skynet 's future operations , and later she destroys an entire factory that 's creating prototype Hunter - Killers .
She seems to be nurturing the " Turk " into becoming a more compassionate version of Skynet , but her real agenda remains unclear .
Judgment Day : unknown .

9 ) Jesse Flores and Riley Dawson travel back from the future ( possibly later than 2029 . )
The future Jesse comes from is much darker than the one Derek comes from , perhaps as a result of either Derek 's actions , or Cameron's .
We know that Jesse 's future is - at least partly - one Derek helped to create , because Jesse does n't know " Billy Wisher , " aka Andy Goode , the guy whom Derek killed in 2007 .
In Jesse 's timeline , John Connor 's resistance is heavily dependent on scrubbed Terminators , to the point where there 's " metal everywhere these days .
Connor 's got one in every major base . "
Sometimes the scrubbed Terminators go wrong and kill people .
And the Terminators seem to be running Connor 's war effort to a large extent , keeping secrets from Connor 's human lieutenants .
Skynet 's human agents ( like Charles Fisher ) commonly torture humans , like Derek Reese .
And there seems to be another " faction " of Terminators , which are n't on Skynet 's side but also are n't on the humans ' .
Jesse wo n't say when her Judgment Day happens , but it 's implied to be sooner than April 2011 , because Jesse is certain it can't be prevented .
Advertisement
10 ) In Terminator Salvation , it 's 2018 , and somehow Skynet is already developing the T - 800 , which is n't supposed to exist until 2029 .
And in the trailer , John Connor says " This is not the future my mother warned me about .
Something has changed " )
According to John Connor , Skynet 's defeat is even less certain than ever in this new altered timeline : " I do n't know if we can win this war . "
It 's not clear what 's changed the timeline from the T2 version , but hopefully the film will explain a bit .
We meet Marcus Wright , an advanced model of Terminator who has a great degree of self - awareness and believes he 's human until he sees his own metal body .
Marcus has the memories ( and appearance , presumably ) of a man who was executed in 2003 , and that 's his last memory before he turns up in 2018 .
( Rumor has it Marcus ' body is donated , after his death , to something called " Project Angel , " which turns him into a quasi- Terminator . )
It 's implied that Marcus ' arrival has something to do with changing the timeline .
Judgment Day : still July 24 , 2004 , since this movie follows on from Terminator 3 .

So we showed this list to Josh Friedman , producer and creator of Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles , and here 's what he had to say :
Jesus Christ .
I want to drink whatever you 're drinking .
Obviously ( or maybe not obviously but it should be said ) TSCC never attempted to mesh with the movies , maybe in the spirit of T / 1/ 2 but certainly not T / 3/4 .
We 've gone off the temporal reservation lately but to some degree that IS canon : almost all expressions of the franchise have massaged dates / ages to their convenience , some more than others .
The most controversial idea you have in here is the first one : the " pre-Kyle " Johnfather .
I believe the Terminator mythology supports that concept but many die hards just embrace the loop - ness of John sending back his dad to impregnate his mom .
Of course , a pre-Kyle Johnfather calls into question genetic differences in the two Johns and whether or not Sarah 's influence is the key to John v.2 .
If you go with the pre-Kyle Johnfather theory , the first John managed to become John Connor without her help .
Or did he ?
I 've mulled it over some more , and I still believe there has to be a timeline where someone other than Kyle Reese is John Connor 's father .
When The Terminator was a standalone movie , you could read it either way .
Either there 's a circular causality , where Kyle is " always " John Connor 's father , or Kyle 's time travel creates a new branch .
But Terminator 2 pretty much establishes that time travel always creates new branches , because there 's no fate but what we make .
And the Connors , with their friendly T - 800 , are able to stop or at least delay Skynet .
But of course , your mileage , even backwards and forwards through time , may vary .
Jeff Lamm , a spokesman for New Jersey 's Division of Consumer Affairs , said that the proposal would specifically ban genital waxing , and was prompted by complaints to the board from two women who were injured and hospitalized .
One of them sued .
Lamm said that the state only investigates infractions if consumers complain .

Tax Preparation Checklist
It ’s that time of year again : Spring is approaching — and so is April 15 .
It ’s tax time , and if you have n’t got your information together , now is a good time to start collecting the documentation you need to complete and file your tax return .
Even if you use a professional tax preparation service or an accountant , you are still responsible for getting everything together and taking it in .
For the simplest tax returns , your checklist is fairly short :
All you need are your Social Security Number , and the Social Security Numbers of your spouse and / or children and other dependents .
You will need your address , and any W - 2 forms .
If you have a child care provider , you should get the name , address and tax identification number so that you can deduct a portion of those expenses .
The only other things you might need are your charitable donations and the mortgage interest and property taxes you have paid if you itemize your deductions .
Receive your refund faster by providing your bank account number and the routing number for your bank for direct deposit purposes .
But what happens when you have a more complicated tax return ?
With investment gains and losses , interest income , self employment income and taxes and education expenses , the forms and schedules start to add up .
Here is a checklist that should help you get what you need for a more complex tax return .
Your accountant ( especially if it ’s you ) will thank you .
Self employment taxes
If you are self - employed , you know that there are any number of extra items to worry about .
One of the important things you will need , especially if you bring your taxes to an accountant for professional tax preparation , is a profit and loss statement .
Prepare this ahead of time , with your income listed , as well as your expenses .
Understand that foreign income should be broken out and listed separately , as well as foreign income tax paid .
Categorize your expenses so that they are easy to identify .
Expenses include 50 % of meals and entertainment for business purposes , mileage , supplies , trade subscriptions , cell phone use , Internet use and other items that are used strictly for business .
Personal finance or business finance software can help you keep track of business expenses to make this process easier .
If you offer insurance and retirement plans , these expenses can also be deducted .
You will need any 1099s that have been sent to you , recording work you have done for others .
For those with S - corps and LLCs , check the 1099s that have been sent to you .
You want your business tax ID on the form .
If your personal Social Security Number is on the 1099 instead , you will have to fill out Schedule C for that income .
If you pay for health insurance , make sure you have your total premiums paid over the year .
You can also hire your children under the age of 18 to work for you , receiving a deduction .
For most LLCs and for sole proprietorship , no FICA is required .
Depreciation deductions and new equipment deductions are also available .
Balance sheets and payroll information is also required in some cases ; make sure you keep good records .
If you pay estimated taxes quarterly , make sure you have what you have already paid for the year .
Interest income and capital gains
If you have investments , you will need to report your earnings .
Even interest earned on a savings account needs to be reported as income .
Capital gains ( and losses ) need to be reported .
Make sure you understand the rules for government municipal bonds .
You may not have to pay taxes on interest earned , but you may be subject to capital gains tax .
Retirement accounts are tax - deferred , and the earnings on these investments work differently .
Also , be aware of what taking different distributions , qualified or unqualified , might do to your taxes .
Do n’t forget about 529 plans , Coverdells and health savings accounts .
All of these have certain tax benefits and information on these accounts should be part of your tax preparation .
Other items you may need
In addition to the tax - related documentation above , you might fall into one or more of the following categories .
Here are some of the other items to remember when it comes to preparing your taxes :
Jury duty pay .
Alimony .
Unemployment benefits .
Prizes and / or gambling winnings .
State and local taxes paid during the year .
Student loan interest .
Qualified education expenses ( also : Lifetime Learning or Hope credit information ) .
Moving expenses .
Work - related expenses you were not reimbursed for .
Losses due to theft .
Casualty losses .
Medical expenses .
Gains from real estate sale ( consider a 1031 exchange ) .
Keep it organized
Keep what you need in mind throughout the year .
I have a file folder set aside for documents I need for my taxes .
I also keep track of my income , deductible expenses and charitable contributions in personal finance software so that it is easier to retrieve at the end of the year .
If you have a complex tax return , with a number of forms and schedules , you might consider having it professionally prepared .
Finally , if you have questions about what you need , it is possible to find most answers on the IRS Web site or by talking to a knowledgeable tax professional .
Seinfeld may have beennothing , but there was plentyit ... pop cultural references , recurring themes , self - referential jokes , and auxiliary characters .

Reorganising the banks : Focus on the liabilities , not the assets
Jeremy Bulow , Paul Klemperer
Fixing the banks is an absolute priority in G7 nations .
Doing this by buying toxic assets is costly , inefficient , and risky .
Governments should focus on which liabilities , rather than which assets , they need to support .
This column proposes creating “ bridge ” banks as a way of re-establishing a healthy banking system .
Summary of the argument
1 . We cannot efficiently value or transfer “ toxic ” assets - so a good plan cannot depend upon this .
2 . The UK ’s Special Resolution Regime , or one similar to that of the US FDIC , can cleanly split off the key banking functions into a new " bridge " bank , leaving liabilities behind in an " old ” bank , thus also removing creditors ’ bargaining power .
3 . Creditors left behind in the old bank can be fairly compensated by giving them the equity in the new bank .
4 . We can pick and choose which creditors we wish to “ top up ” beyond this level , but should not indiscriminately make all creditors completely whole as in recent bailouts .
5. Coordinating actions with other countries will reduce any risks .
As we pour good money after bad in trying to save the banks , far too much time and attention has been focused on attempting to value or transfer or shore up the so - called “ toxic ” assets .
This is natural enough , since they arguably caused the crisis , but it ’s also wrong .
Here ’s why .
Flaws of the current approach
First , the toxic assets are very difficult to value .
Many are held by only one or two owners so there is no real market even in good times .
And even if a hedge fund buyer and a bank seller both thought that an asset was worth 50 , the bank might demand 80 in the hopes of receiving that price in the next government bailout .
Furthermore , the banks may be the “ natural ” owners of these assets .
Say a bank makes a construction loan .
Even if the loan sours , the bank may be the most knowledgeable party to hold and possibly renegotiate the loan .
Second , purchasing or guaranteeing “ toxic ” assets creates other problems too .
Putting aside the obvious inequity of paying bank creditors a “ risk premium ” for having invested in failed businesses , how can we ever again rely on market signals to allocate capital efficiently among banks if their capital structures are effectively guaranteed by the government ?
And under schemes like the recent Citigroup , RBS and Lloyds bailouts , banks ’ incentives to manage the “ insured ” assets are drastically reduced , as the government bears up to 90 % of any marginal losses .
Lastly and perhaps most important , the obvious fiscal risks associated with the huge incremental costs of current policies may undermine confidence far more than paying off creditors in full may temporarily boost it , however superficially attractive the latter approach may seem .
Re-establishing a healthy banking system is crucial , but doing so through the purchase of toxic assets is costly , inefficient , and risky .
How to reorganise the banks
How then can we make banks healthy without separating the “ bad assets ” ?
The answer is , instead , to separate the “ bad liabilities ” . *
Take Citigroup , for example .
At the end of 2008 the bank had roughly $ 1.8 trillion in liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet , of which less than $ 800 billion were deposits .
Say Citi ’s assets were worth $ 1.5 trillion .
A new ( “ bridge ” ) bank that included all the assets plus say $ 1 trillion of the old bank ’s most senior liabilities would still be comfortably well capitalised , even if the asset values were overestimated .
The original bank would be left with all the equity in the new bank , worth $ 500 billion , and the remaining $ 800 billion in liabilities .
The original bank would still be insolvent , but that would not prevent the healthy new bank from operating efficiently and making good loans .
If a risky original bank 's marginal cost of funds is , say , 10 % it will not be profitable for it to make new riskless loans at 7 % , even if the market riskless rate is zero .
By contrast , because the new bank is well capitalised , it can borrow on sensible terms if it has a profitable investment to fund .
1
Giving the old bank an equity stake in the new bank is the best way to compensate the holders of old bank ’s liabilities to the full liquidation value -- but not more than that value -- of their claims .
It may also facilitate the reorganisation of the old bank if , as is likely , it goes into bankruptcy , since creating marketable equity in the new bank resolves the difficulty of valuing the old bank 's assets , and avoids any need to sell the new bank on to a third - party – a transaction from which the government might be unlikely to get full value .
2
The reorganisation could be managed under a regime like the UK’s Special Resolution Regime ( SRR ) or similar to that of the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) 3 ( there may be other possibilities too ) .
The government ’s role ends when the old bank has sold its shares or allocated them amongst its creditors .
Who loses ?
Paying all creditors at least their liquidation claims is probably a pre-requisite for maintaining market confidence .
It is anyway mandated by the Fifth Amendment in the US and by Human Rights legislation in Europe , and it is enshrined as the “ no creditor worse off ” principle in the recently - enacted UK Banking Act .
So both the FDIC and the SRR assure the non-guaranteed creditors of the banks that they will be paid at least as much as they would receive under a liquidation of the institution , but not that they will get back every penny they are owed .
4
Under a liquidation the junior creditors would suffer losses of $ 300 billion in our example ( and the old bank ’s shareholders would be wiped out ) , unless there were further government subsidies .
A key virtue of isolating the junior liabilities rather than the troubled assets is that while the government may then choose to subsidise some of the junior creditors ’ losses , it can more easily get off its current path towards subsidising them 100 % .
For example , in the U.S. system the order of priority for debts is the following : ( 1 ) administrative expense of liquidation ; ( 2 ) secured claims up to the value of collateral ; ( 3 ) domestic deposits ( both insured and uninsured ) ; ( 4 ) foreign deposits and other general creditor claims ; ( 5 ) subordinated creditor claims ; and ( 6 ) equity investors .
Recently issued subordinated debt has been guaranteed by the government , which would therefore take any loss on those securities in a reorganisation .
( The UK prioritisation is a little different ; in particular , it does not make domestic deposits senior to foreign deposits or other general creditors ) .
For a large bank like Citi or Bank of America the first three categories would be placed in the new bank , and so would be fully protected .
Foreign depositors should probably also be made whole .
As when the Icelandic banks defaulted , countries will try to “ ring fence ” the operations within their borders if their deposits are not paid .
Furthermore , not paying foreign deposits would lead to tit - for - tat behavior and might increase systemic risk .
Making these depositors whole , and protecting domestic depositors in a jurisdiction like the UK that does not have depositor preference , may give them more than their liquidation values , so the government would have to either infuse the new bank with enough capital that the claims of the remaining creditors would be worth as much as in a no-intervention insolvency , or make a cash payment directly to the old bank .
( The infusion to the new bank makes its equity more valuable and therefore raises the value of the claims of the “ original bank ” creditors in insolvency .
The amount of the equity infusion or cash payment is easily calculable if the new bank ’s stock is traded , as explained in this note .
5 )
However , other general creditors ( other than those with a government guarantee ) including non-guaranteed bondholders and owners of credit default swaps that are not fully collateralised need not be paid in full .
The government may , if it wishes , choose to pay these creditors more than they would receive in liquidation .
( It can even buy their claims from the old bank at full value and place them in the new bank . )
But because the old bank ’s creditors ’ leverage would be reduced to their financial claims , and they would not have the threat of bankrupting the new healthy bank were they not paid in full , this need only be done when not doing so would contribute to systemic risk .
If there is still concern that the new bank is undercapitalised , the government can infuse more equity , but in contrast to the current situation the infusion would no longer have to be large enough to pay off the junior creditors .
Finally , coordinating actions with other countries would resolve the concern that some have expressed that if one country alone fails to bail out a category of creditors , its institutions will find it hard to raise funding in the future .
International coordination may also make it politically much easier to favour some groups of systemically - important creditors ( especially foreign ones ) over others .
For some banks , particularly those whose liabilities are almost entirely deposits , this approach may save little money relative to the current bailouts .
And , of course , if it is systemically important to make every creditor completely whole , then there is no saving at all .
But if the authorities do not believe that any bank creditors can be asked to lose a penny then they should say so .
We can then stop worrying about things like whether , if the government buys ( or “ insures ” ) the troubled assets from the banks the government pays fair price or an extra couple of hundred billion , since in this case any overpayment simply reduces the amount the government will ultimately have to pay to make good all the creditors , by an equal amount .
If governments feel that they need to absorb more of the risk in the system , they should consider whether providing subsidies to bank creditors is the most effective use of their funds .
Conclusion
A plan that isolates the bad liabilities rather than the bad assets of the banks , and pays the owners of those claims everything they legally deserve in liquidation but does not fully immunise them from losses , will achieve three major objectives .
It will help unfreeze the credit markets by creating healthy banks able to lend .
It will assure that depositors are paid in full , and all creditors are paid at least their entitlement .
It will make the bailout cheaper for the government , increasing its flexibility .
Finally , as an additional benefit , paying creditors based on market values rather than government guarantees reduces moral hazard in bank finance , and increases the prospect of better monitoring by sophisticated private creditors in determining the future allocation of capital across financial institutions .
There will be a lot more we will need to do to solve the financial crisis -- let 's not make the bank bailouts more expensive than absolutely necessary .
* While presented in the form of a plan , what follows is intended to raise questions that deserve answers , rather than make definitive recommendations ; some of this might require other legal means than those suggested here .

I. BEFORE SPACEWAR
The Lensman , The Skylark , and the Hingham Institute
It 's Kimball Kinnison 's fault .
And Dick Seaton's .
Without the Gray Lensman and the Skylark of Space there would be nothing to write about .
So most of the blame falls on E. E. Smith , but the Toho Film Studios and the American Research and Development Corp. have something to answer for as well .
If Doc Smith had been content designing doughnuts , if American - International Pictures had stuck to beach blanket flicks , if ( most of all ) General Doriot had n't waved money in front of Ken Olsen in 1957 , the world might yet be free of Spacewar !
It all came together in 1961 at the Hingham Institute , a barely - habitable tenement on Hingham Street in Cambridge , MA .
Three Institute Fellows were involved : Wayne Witanen , mathematician , early music buff , and mountain climber ; J. Martin Graetz ( which is me ) , man of no fixed talent who tended to act superior because he was already a Published Author ; and Stephen R. ( Slug ) Russell , specialist in steam trains , trivia , and artificial intelligence .
We were all about 25 ( the more or less to be the same ) .
At the time , we were crashing and banging our way through the " Skylark " and " Lensman " novels of Edward E. Smith , PhD. , a cereal chemist who wrote with the grace and refinement of a pneumatic drill .
These stories are pretty much all of a piece : after some preliminary foofaraw to get everyone 's name right , a bunch of overdeveloped Hardy Boys go trekking off through the universe to punch out the latest gang of galactic goons , blow up a few planets , kill all sorts of nasty life forms , and just have a heck of a good time .
In a pinch , which is where they usually were , our heroes could be counted on to come up with a complete scientific theory , invent the technology to implement it , build the tools to implement the technology , and produce the ( usually ) weapons to blow away the baddies , all while being chased in their spaceship hither and thither through the trackless wastes of the galaxy ( he wrote like that ) by assorted Fenachrone , Boskonians , and the World Steel Corporation .
Is that enough to turn the mind to margarine ?
It is not .
In breaks between books , we would be off to one of Boston 's seedier cinemas to view the latest trash from Toho .
In the days before Mazdas and Minoltas , the Japanese ( and occasionally the British and Californians ) churned out a steady diet of cinematic junk food of which Rodan and Godzilla are only the best known examples .
These movies depended for their effects on high quality modelwork , oceans of rays , beams , and explosions , and the determined avoidance of plot , character , or significance .
They were the movie equivalent of The Skylark of Space .
If that 's the case , we asked ourselves , why does n't anyone make Skylark movies ?
Hearing no reply ( our innocence of current film technology , economics , and copyright laws was enormous ) , we often passed the time in the Hingham Street common room in deep wishful thought , inventing special effects and sequences for a grand series of space epics that would never see a sound stage .
Nonetheless , these books , movies , and bull - sessions established the mind - set that eventually led to Spacewar !
When Computers Were Gods
In early 1961 Wayne , Slug , and I , by no coincidence , were all working at Harvard University 's Littauer Statistical laboratory .
A large part of our jobs was to run statistics computations for various Harvard persons .
The agent of choice for this work was an IBM 704 .
To a generation whose concept of a computer is founded on the Z80 chip , it may be hard to visualize a 704 or to comprehend the place it held in the public imagination ( along with UNIVAC ) as the type specimen of what a computer was : a collection of mysterious hulking gray cabinets approachable only through the intercession of The Operator .
In the specially built computer room , The Operator set switches , pushed buttons , and examined panels of flashing lights , while his Assistants attended various whirring , clanking , and chattering devices , rushing to and fro with stacks of cryptically - printed paper , decks of weirdly - punched cards , and reels of recondite brown ribbon , all to the background hum of The Machine .
Add a little incense and a few candles , and you could be forgiven for thinking these were the rites of some oracular shrine .
Everything about the 704 , from the inscrutable main frame to the glowing tubes ( yes , tubes ! ) in the glass - walled core memory case , proclaimed that this was a Very Complicated System operated only by Specially Trained Personnel , among whom programmers and other ordinary mortals were not numbered .
In short , a computer was something that you simply did not sit down and fool around with .
A Stone 's Throw from Olympus
In the summer if 1961 I went to work for Professor Jack B. Dennis , who was then the proprietor of the TX - 0 , a machine that to me was only slightly less legendary than its ancestor , Whirlwind .
The TX - 0 was transistorized , and while solid - state computers were beginning to appear on the market , the " Tixo " was the original .
Even in 1961 it was acknowledged to be a historically important research facility ; many of the programs developed on the TX - 0 , such as Jack Dennis 's MACRO assembler and Thomas Stockham 's FLIT debugging program , were the first of their kind .
So the chance to work on this computer was in many ways a rite of passage ; it mean that I had joined the ranks of the Real Programmers .
While hardly your average populist Apple , the TX - 0 was definitely a step away from the Computer - as - Apollo .
Instead of being sealed into its own special chapel , it sat at one end of a typical large , messy MIT research space .
With its racks of exposed circuitry , power supplies and meters , and its long , low L - shaped console , the TX - 0 looked for all the world like the control room of a suburban pumping station .
And the thing of it was , you were expected to run it yourself .
So here was the former 704 Operator 's Assistant pushing buttons , flipping switches , and pressing keys to make his own programs work .
In some ways it was simpler than the 704 ; for one thing , there was n't a battery of clanking mechanical monsters .
The TX - 0's input and output medium was something called a Flexowriter : an all - in - one keyboard , printer , paper - tape reader and punch , that worked like a mule and had a personality to match .
There was also a " high - speed " paper tape reader , a Grand Prix whiz that could read programs into memory almost as fast as the cassette - tape reader on a TRS - 80 .
And the TX - 0 had a Scope .
Now console - mounted , programmable CRTs were not unheard of at that time but they were generally slow , inflexible , and awkward to program .
The TX - 0 scope , on the other hand , was easy to use ; you could generate a useful display with fewer than a dozen instructions .
And if that were n't enough , there was a magic wand : the light pen .
( The importance of these two devices can't be overemphasized ; Ivan Sutherland used the scope and the pen to develop his original " Sketchpad . " )
That was the TX - 0 , the world 's first on - line computer , and the training ground for the designers and programmers of later generations of hands - on machines .
The first computer bums -- hackers -- were the products of this training ; without it , and them , there would have been no Spacewar !
Tixo 's people
The users of the TX - 0 were a melange of students , staff researchers and professors with not much in common other than their need for large amounts of largely unstructured computer time .
The feel of the place , however , was established by the hackers -- mostly students , but including a professor or two -- whose lives seemed to be organized in 18 - bit strings .
Many of them worked for Professors John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky in the Artificial Intelligence Group , an odd bunch ( even by MIT standards ) who seemed convinced that given enough random - access memory and a really fast cycle time you could model the cognitive parts of the brain and hey presto !
a real thinking machine .
Others worked for Professor Dennis , who presided over the use and development of the TX - 0 and more or less benignly kept a semblance of order .
The man who kept it all running was a soft - spoken , white - haired gentleman , John McKenzie , the chief engineer .
Out of this cloud of computer bums emerged the group that brought Spacewar ! to the silver ( well , light gray ) screen : Dan Edwards ( AI Group ) , Lisp specialist ; Alan Kotok ( TX - 0 staff ) , who wrote MIDAS , the successor to MACRO ; Peter Sampson ( AI Group ) , who made the Tixo and PDP - 1 play Bach ; and Steve Russell and I .
" You Mean That 's All It Does ? "
When computers were still marvels , people would flock to watch them still at work whenever the opportunity arose .
They were usually disappointed .
Whirring tapes and clattering card readers can hold one 's interest for only so long .
They just did the same dull thing over and over ; besides , they were obviously mechanical -- at best , overgrown record changers -- and thus not mysterious .
The main frame , which did all the marvelous work , just sat there .
There was nothing to see .
On the other hand , something is always happening on a TV screen , which is why people stare at them for hours .
On MIT 's annual Open House day , for example , people came to stare for hours at Whirlwind 's CRT screen .
What did they stare at ?
Bouncing Ball .
Bouncing Ball may be the very first computer - CRT demonstration program .
It did n't do much : a dot appeared at the top of the screen , fell to the bottom and bounced ( with a " thok " from the console speaker ) .
It bounced off the sides and floor of the displayed box , gradually losing momentum until it hit the floor and rolled off the screen through a hole in the bottom line .
And that 's all .
Pong was not even an idea in 1960 .
( Note : Well , maybe not Pong , but something very much like it .
Watch these pages .
-- DHA )
The TX - 0's counterpart to Bouncing Ball was the Mouse in the Maze , written by Douglas T. Ross and John E. Ward .
Essentially , it was a short cartoon : a stylized mouse searched through a rectangular maze until it found a piece of cheese which it then ate , leaving a few crumbs .
You constructed the maze and placed the cheese ( or cheeses -- you could have more than one ) with the light pen .
A variation replaced the cheese with a martini ; after drinking the first one the mouse would stagger to the next .
Besides the Mouse , the TX - 0 also had HAX , which displayed changing patterns according to the settings of two console switch registers .
Well - chosen settings could produce interesting shapes or arrangements of dots , sometimes accompanied by amusing sounds from the console speaker .
The console speaker is a phenomenon whose day seems to have passed .
More than just a plaything , for the experienced operator the speaker was a valuable guide to the condition of a running program .
Finally , there was the inevitable Tic - Tac - Toe , with the user playing the computer .
The TX - 0 version used the Flexowriter rather than the scope .
( The game is so simple to analyze that there was even a version for the off - line Flexo . )
These four programs pointed the way .
Bouncing Ball was a pure demonstration : you pushed the button , and it did all the rest .
The mouse was more fun , because you could make it different every time .
HAX was a real toy ; you could play with it while it was running and make it change on the fly .
And Tic - Tac- Toe was an actual game , however simpleminded .
The ingredients were there ; we just needed an idea .
The World 's First Toy Computer
For all its homeliness , the TX - 0 was still very much a god .
It took up lots of space , it had to be carefully tended , it took special procedures to start it up and shut it down , and it cost a lot of money to build .
All this changed in the fall of 1961 , when the first production - model PDP - 1 was installed in the " Kluge Room " next door to the TX - 0 .
It had been anticipated for months ; an early brochure announcing the machine ( as well as a couple of no - shows called the PDP - 2 and PDP - 3 , in case you had been wondering about that ) had been circulating in the area for a while .
It was clear that the PDP - 1 had TX - 0 genes ; the hackers would be right at home .
The - 1 would be faster than the Tixo , more compact , and available .
It was the first computer that did not require one to have an E.E. degree and the patience of Buddha to start it up in the morning ; you could turn it on any time by flipping one switch , and when you were finished you could turn it off .
We had never seen anything like that before .
II .
SPACEWAR !
BEGUN
The Hingham Institute Study Group On Space Warfare
Long before the PDP - 1 [ original says PDP - 11 , an obvious typo ] was up and running Wayne , Slug , and I had formed a sort of ad - hoc committee on what to do with it -- it being the Type 30 Precision CRT display which was scheduled to be installed a couple of months after the computer itself .
It was clear from the start that while the Ball and Mouse and HAX were clever and amusing , they really were n't very good as demonstration programs .
Why not ?
Zooming across the galaxy with our Bergenholm Inertialess Drive , the Hingham Institute Study Group on Space Warfare devised its Theory of Computer Toys .
A good demonstration program ought to satisfy three criteria :
It should demonstrate as many of the computer 's resources as possible , and tax those resources to the limit ;
Within a consistent framework , it should be interesting , which means every run should be different ;
It should involve the onlooker in a pleasurable and active way -- in short , it should be a game .
With the Fenachrone hot on our ion track , Wayne said , " Look , you need action and you need some kind of skill level .
It should be a game where you have to control things moving around on the scope , like , oh , spaceships .
Something like an explorer game , or a race or contest ... a fight , maybe ? "
" SPACEWAR ! " shouted Slug and I , as the last force screen flared into the violet and went down .
The basic rules developed quickly .
There would be at least two spaceships , each controlled by a set of console switches ( " Gee , it would be nice to have a joystick or something like that ... " ) .
The ships would have a supply of rocket fuel and some sort of a weapon : a ray or beam , possibly a missile .
For really hopeless situations , a panic button would be nice ... hmmm ... aha !
Hyperspace !
( What else , after all , is there ? )
And that , pretty much , was that .
The Hackers Meet SPACEWAR !
By the end of the summer of 1961 , Steve Russell had returned to the Artificial Intelligence Group ( he 'd worked there before Littauer ) ; consequently , whatever ideas the Study Group came up with were soon circulating among the hackers .
Spacewar ! was an appealing , simple concept , and the hackers were the appealingly simple people to bring it to life .
First , however , there was the small matter of software .
The PDP - 1 was a no- frills machine at the beginning ; except for a few diagnostic and utility routines , there was no program library .
In a way this suited the hackers just fine ; here was a chance to improve on TX - 0 software and to write new stiff that could n't have been done before .
MACRO and FLIT were translated from TXish to PDPese , FLIT becoming the first in a continuing line of DDT on - line debugging programs .
Steve Piner wrote a text display and editing program called Expensive Typewriter ( For a while , " expensive " was a favorite adjective for naming various PDP - 1 routines that imitated the functions of more mundane devices .
Among them was Peter Samson's E. Planetarium , as we shall see . ) , another original whose lineage you can trace , if you like , right down to the latest word processors .
With the software taken care of we could write real programs , which is to say toys .
Bouncing Ball was successfully converted to PDP - 1 use , but HAX , for some reason , was not .
But no one really missed it , because we had a brand - new toy invented by Professor Marvin Minsky .
The program displayed three dots which proceeded to " interact , " weaving various patterns on the scope face .
As with HAX , the initializing constants were set in the console switches .
Among the patterns were geometric displays , Lissajous - like figures , and " fireworks . "
Minsky 's program title was something like " Tri-Pos : Three - Position Display , " but from the beginning we never called it anything but The Minskytron ( " tron " was the In suffix of the early 1960s . )
The classic needle and wedge space ship outlines and the opposite - quadrant starting positions were established at this stage , as shown in Figure 1 .
Acceleration was realistic ; it took time to get off the mark , and to slow down you had to reverse the ship and blast in the other direction ; the rocket exhaust was a flickering " fiery tail . "
Rotation , on the other hand , was by something we called " gyros " -- a sort of flywheel effect invented to avoid consideration of messy things like moments of inertia .
I guess they were really rotational Bergenholms .
It was apparent almost immediately that the featureless background was a liability .
It was hard to gauge relative motion ; you could n't tell if the ships were drifting apart or together when they were moving slowly .
What we needed , obviously , were some stars .
Russell wrote in a random display of dots , and the quality of play improved .
The only thing left , we thought , was hyperspace , and that was on the way .
In fact , we 'd just begun .
III .
SPACEWAR ! COMPLETE
Please keep in mind that what follows did not happen in a neat first - one - thing - and - then - the next progression , but rather all at once in a period of about six weeks .
When hackers are aroused , anything that can happen will .
The Control Boxes
Spacewar !
worked perfectly well from the test word switches on the console , except that the CRT was off to one side , so one player had a visual advantage .
More to the point , with two excitable space warriors jammed into a space meant for one reasonably calm operator , damage to the equipment was a constant threat .
At the very least , a jittery player could miss the torpedo switch and hit the start lever , obliterating the universe in one big anti-bang .
A separate control device was obviously necessary , but joysticks ( our original idea ) were not readily available in 1962 .
So Alan Kotok and Robert A. Saunders , who just happened to be members of the Tech Model Railroad Club , trundled off to the TMRC room , scrabbled around the layout for a while to find odd bits of wood , wire , bakelite , and switch - board hardware , and when the hammering and sawing and soldering had ceased , there on the CRT table were the first Spacewar !
control boxes ( Figure 2 .
These boxes have long since disappeared , but the sketch is a reasonably accurate reconstruction ) .
The box is wood with a Bakelite top .
The two switches are double - throw ; the button is a silent momentary switch .
Their functions are as follows :
a. Rotation control .
It is pushed to the left to rotate the ship counterclockwise , to the right to rotate clockwise .
b. A two - function control .
Pulled back it is the rocket accelerator ; the rocket continues to blast as long as the switch is thrown .
Pushed forward , the switch is the hyperspace control , as described below .
c. The torpedo button .
It had to be silent so that your opponent could not tell when you were trying to fire .
( There was a fixed delay between shots " to allow the torp tubes to cool " and fire was not automatic ; you had to keep pushing the button to get off a missile . )
With the control boxes , players could sit comfortably apart , each with a clear view of the screen .
That , plus the carefully designed layout of the controls , improved ones playing skills considerably , making the game even more fun .
First Steps
By the end of 1961 , all the elements were in place : a brand new , available computer , a cloud of hackers , tolerant when not actively implicated employers , and an exciting idea .
Slug Russell was getting the head from everyone to " do something " about Spacewar !
( I was in a different department at MIT by this time , and Wayne , alas , was one of those unlucky Army Reservists called to active duty during the Berlin Wall panic in October .
He never got to participate in developing his own idea . )
Russell , never one to " do something " when there was an alternative , begged off for one reason or another .
One of the excuses for not doing it , Slug remembers , was " Oh , we do n't have a sine - cosine routine and gee , I do n't know how to write a sine - cosine routine ... "
Then Alan Kotok came back from a trip all the way to Maynard ( DEC headquarters ) with paper tapes saying " All right , Russell , here 's a sine - cosine routine ; now what 's your excuse ? "
" Well , " says Slug , " I looked around and I did n't find an excuse , so I had to settle down and do some figuring . "
With the heavy mathematics in hand , Slug produced the first object - in- motion program in January 1962 .
This was nothing more than a dot which could accelerate and change direction under switch control .
Even without a hardware multiply - divide capability ( on the early PDP - 1s , anything stiffer than integer addition and subtraction had to be done by subroutine ) the computer was clearly not being pushed .
From dot to rocket ship was a surprisingly easy step : " I realized , " Slug says , " that I did n't have to worry about the speed of the sine - cosine routine , because there were only two angles involved in each frame -- one for each ship .
Then the idea of rotating the grid came out . "
The ship outlines were represented as a series of direction codes starting from the nose of the ship ; when the ship was vertical and tail - down , each code pointed to one of the five possible adjacent dots could be displayed next .
To display the ship at an angle , Russell calculated the appropriate sine and cosine and added them to the original direction code constants , in effect rotating the entire grid .
With this method , the ship 's angle had to be calculated only once in each display frame .
The outline codes were kept in a table so that different shapes could be tried out at will , but this meant the table had to be searched every frame to generate the outline .
As the game developed , this arrangement proved to be a sticking point which we shall see was neatly solved by Dan Edwards .
By February , the first game was operating .
It was a barebones model : just the two ships , a supply of fuel , and a store of " torpedoes " -- points of light fired from the nose of the ship .
Once launched , a torpedo was a ballistic missile , zooming along until it either hit something ( more precisely , until it got within a minimum distance of a ship or another torpedo ) or its " time fuse " caused it to self - destruct .
The Stars of the Heavens
One of the forces driving the dedicated hacker is the quest for elegance .
It is not sufficient to write programs that work .
They must also be " elegant , " either in code or in function -- both , if possible .
An elegant program does its job as fast as possible , or is as compact as possible , or is as clever as possible in taking advantage of the particular features of the machine in which it runs , and ( finally ) produces its results in an aesthetically pleasing form without compromising either the results or operation of other programs associated with it .
" Peter Samson , " recalls Russell , " was offended by my random stars . "
In other words , while a background of miscellaneous points of light might be all very well for some run-down jerkwater space fleet , it just would n't do for the Galactic Patrol .
So Peter Samson sat down and wrote " Expensive Planetarium . "
Using data from the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac , Samson encoded the entire night sky ( down to just above fifth magnitude ) between 22 1/2 ° N and 22 1/2 ° S , thus including most of the familiar constellations .
The display can remain fixed or move gradually from right to left , ultimately displaying the entire culinder [ cylinder ? ] of stars .
The elegance does not stop there .
By firing each display point the appropriate number of times , Samson was able to produce a display that showed the stars at something close to their actual relative brightness .
An attractive demonstration program in its own right , E.P. was " duly admired and inhaled into Spacewar ! "
The Heavy Star
Up to this point , Spacewar ! was heavily biased towards motor skills and fast reflexes , with strategy counting for very little .
Games tended to become nothing more than wild shootouts , which was exciting but ultimately unrewarding .
Some sort of equalizer was called for .
Russell : " Dan Edwards was offended by the plain spaceships , and felt that gravity should be introduced .
I pleaded innocence of numerical analysis and other things " -- in other words , here 's the whitewash brush and there 's a section of fence -- " so Dan put in the gravity calculations . "
The star blazed forth from the center of the screen , its flashing rays a clear warning that it was not to be trifled with .
Its gravity well encompassed all space ; no matter where you were , if you did not move you would be drawn into the sun and destroyed .
( As a gesture of good will towards less skillful or beginning players , a switch option turned annihilation into a sort of hyperstatial translation to the " anti-point , " i.e. , the four corners of the screen . )
The star did two things .
It introduced a player - independent element that the game needed ; when speeds were high and space was filled with missiles , it was often sheer luck that kept one from crashing into the star .
It also brought the other elements of the game into focus by demanding strategy .
In the presence of gravity both ships were affected by something beyond their control , but which a skillful player could use to advantage .
The first result of this new attention to strategy was the opening move in Figure 3 , which was quickly dubbed the " CBS opening " because of its eye - like shape .
It took a while to learn this maneuver but it soon became the standard opening among experienced players , as it generally produced the most exciting games .
The addition of gravity pushed Spacewar !
over the edge of flicker - free display .
To get back under the limit , Dan Edwards devised an elegant fiddle to speed up the outline display routine .
In Russell 's original program , the outline tables were examined and interpreted in every display frame , an essentially redundant operation .
Edwards replaced this procedure with an outline " compiler , " which examined the tables at the start of a game and compiled a short program to generate the outline for each ship .
This dramatically reduced calculation time , restoring the steady display and making room for the last of the original bells and whistles .
Hyperspace
While all this was going on , I was in my secret hideaway ( then known as the Electronic Systems Lab ) working on the ultimate panic button : hyperspace .
The idea was that when everything else failed you could jump into the fourth dimension and disappear .
As this would introduce an element of something very like magic into an otherwise rational universe , the use of hyperspace had to be hedged in some way .
Our ultimate goal was a feature that , while useful , was not entirely reliable .
The machinery , we said , would be the " Mark One Hyperfield Generators ... had n't done a thorough job of testing ... rushed them to the fleet " and so on .
They'd be good for one or two shots , but would deteriorate rapidly after that .
They might not work at all ( " It 's not my fault , Chewie ! " ) or if they did , your chances of coming back out intact were rather less than even .
Slug : " It was something you could use , but not something you wanted to use . "
The original hyperspace was not that elegant .
" MK I unreliability " boiled down to this : you had exactly three jumps .
In each jump your ship 's co-ordinates were scrambled so that you never knew where you would reappear -- it could be in the middle of the sun .
You were gone for a discernible period of time , which gave your opponent a bit of a breather , but you came back with your original velocity and direction intact .
To jump you pushed the blast lever forward .
Hyperspace had one cute feature ( well , I thought it was cute ) .
Do you remember the Minskytron ?
One of its displays looked very much like a classical Bohr atom , which in those days was an overworked metaphor for anything to do with space and science - fiction .
Reasoning that a ship entering hyperspace would cause a local distortion of space - time resulting in a warp - induced photonicstress emission ( see how easy this is ? ) , I made the disappearing ship leave behind a short Minskytron signature ( Figure 4 ) .
Crocks and Loose Ends
In retrospect , it is remarkable that the original Spacewar !
managed to include so many features , given the limitations of our PDP - 1 : 4 K words ( about 9 K bytes ) of memory , an instruction cycle time of five microseconds , and a subroutine multiply - divide .
It 's hardly surprising , then , that we had to let a few unsatisfactory ( all right , inelegant ) bits go by .
The most irritating of these ( and the first to be improved in later versions ) was the appropriately - named Crock Explosion .
Something dramatic obviously had to happen when a ship was destroyed , but were were dealing with a plain dot - matrix screen .
The original control program produced a random - dot burst confined within a small square whose outlines were all too discernible ( Figure 5 ) .
This explosion was intended merely as a place - holder until something more plausible could be worked out , but after all the other features had been " inhaled , " there was n't room or time for a fancier calculation .
Similarly , the torpedoes were not quite consistent with the Spacewar !
universe after the heavy star was in place .
The gravity calculations for two ships was as much as the program could handle ; there was no time to include half a dozen missiles as well .
So the torpedoes were unaffected by the star , with the odd result that you could shoot right through it and hit something on the other side ( if you were n't careful getting round the Star , it could be you ) .
We made the usual excuses ... mumblemumble photon bombs mumblemumble ... but no one really cared .
The heavy star itself was not entirely Newtonian .
The common tactic of plunging down the gravity well to gain momentum by whipping around the sun ( Figure 6 ) gave you somewhat more energy than you were really entitled to .
As this just made the game more interesting , nothing was immediately done to correct it .
IV .
AFTER SPACEWAR !
The game was essentially complete by the end of April , 1962 .
The only further immediate work was to make Spacewar !
presentable for MIT 's annual Science Open House in May .
A scoring facility was added so that finite matches could be played , making it easier to limit the time any one person spent at the controls .
To provide for the crowds that we ( accurately ) anticipated , a large screen laboratory CRT was attached to the computer to function as a slave display .
Perched on top of a high cabinet , it allowed a roomful of people to watch in relative comfort .
Also in May , the first meeting of DECUS ( Digital Equipment Computer Users ' Society ) was held in Bedford , MA .
At that meeting , I delivered the first paper on the subject , pretentiously titled " SPACEWAR !
Real - Time Capability of the PDP - 1 . "
Over the summer of 1962 , the original Spacewar hackers began to drift away .
Alan Kotok and I went to work for Digital .
Steve Russell followed John McCarthy to Stanford University .
Peter Samson and Bob Saunders stayed in Cambridge for a while , but eventually they too went west .
Dan Edwards remained with the AI group for a few years , then moved to Project MAC .
Jack Dennis and the PDP - 1 also wound up at Project MAC , which evolved into MIT 's Laboratory for Computer Science .
Others took up the maintenance and development of Spacewar !
Program tapes were already showing up all over the country , not only on PDP - 1s but on just about any research computer that had a programmable CRT .
A Mystery , Just For Good Measure
Slug tells me that there is a Lost Version of Spacewar !
There would be , of course .
He says the game is pretty much like the original , but the scoring is much more impressive .
After each game of a match , cumulative scores are displayed as rows of ships , like a World War II fighter pilot 's tally .
Slug says he saw this version for a short time on the PDP - 1 , but never found out who produced it or what became of it .
Twenty Years Later
The original Spacewar PDP - 1 was retired in 1975 and put in storage at DEC's Northboro warehouse , where it serves as a parts source for the similar machine now on display at Digital 's Computer Museum in Marlboro , MA .
At this writing , DEC engineer Stan Schultz and I are trying to put the original Spacewar !
back into operating condition .
So far , all attempts at finding the original control boxes have been futile ; we will probably build replicas ( the plastic Atari joysticks we have no got no class ) .
Dan Edwards still works for the U.S. Government , developing computer security systems .
Alan Kotok is still a consulting engineer with DEC .
Peter Samson is now director of marketing for Systems Concepts , Inc. , in San Francisco .
Bob Saunders had gone to Silicon Valley , where [ he ] is an engineer - programmer for Hewlett - Packard .
Jack Dennis is a Professor of Science in the Electrical Engineering Department at MIT .
John McKenzie , the chief engineer , is retired , but over the past year or so has been helping to restore the TX - 0 and PDP - 1 to life at the Computer Museum .
And what of the Hingham Institute ?
Wayne Wiitanen has recently become a Senior Research Scientist at the General Motors Research Laboratory , where he is happily designing eyes for robots .
Slug , after various adventures , is now a programmer - analyst for Interactive Data Corp. in Waltham , MA .
I am reduced to writing for a living , but tend to act somewhat less superior therefore .
Spacewar !
itself has bred a race of noisy , garishly - colored monsters that lurk in dark caverns and infest pizza parlors , eating quarters and offering degenerate pleasures .
I think I know a few former hackers who are n't the slightest bit surprised .

This blog post also appeared on Stanton 's blog at The Huffington Post website .
Two Types of Confidence - Obama and Bush
George W. Bush preserves his self - confidence by shutting out other points of view .
Barack Obama 's openness is possible , on the other hand , because of his genuine self - confidence .
Outgoing President George W. Bush 's farewell speech put on display , once again , the psychology of a man who is incapable of self - examination , whose mind simply does not permit him to reflect on his actions .
As though added by a speech writer , Bush recited the words , " There are things I would do differently if given the chance . "
Other than a few flights of verbal fancy , however , Bush has never been able to identify anything he would do differently .
His Bush - version of a mea culpa was immediately followed by the real Bush philosophy : " I have always acted with the best interests of our country in mind .
I have followed my conscience and done what I thought was right . "
Bush is confident that people respect him simply for making the " tough decisions . "
Nowhere does his world view permit him to question the quality or consequences of these decisions .
Laura Bush describes the time George crashed their car into their garage after she once criticized him -- presumably , she never did it again .
After the speech , Chris Matthews on MSNBC correctly identified the relevant aspects of Bush 's biography -- that he was resolutely anti-intellectual and disdained the " pointy heads " at Yale and Harvard .
Unequipped with book knowledge or a philosophy of his own -- or , more important , the intellectually ability to evaluate the perspectives of others -- Bush simply latched onto the neoconservative ideas of Dick Cheney , Scooter Libby and Paul Wolfowitz .
Once he adopted these men's world views , he did n't have the tools to question them .
Two nights before , President - elect Barack Obama dined with a number of prominent conservative columnists , including such sharp minds as George Will , William Kristol and David Brooks .
Questioned the next morning about the dinner on Fox and Friends , Kristol made light of the meeting , saying nobody changed their minds during the evening .
But the correct question to ask Kristol would have been , " What does it say that Barack Obama met with a group of intelligent political opponents while George Bush would never think of doing so ? "
Paul Krugman described how he was received at the White House after winning the Nobel Prize for economics during the current economic break - down .
" Did Bush speak with you ? " he was asked .
" He made small talk with my wife , who is also from Texas , " Krugman answered .
What Obama 's dining with the opposition shows is that -- while Bush is impervious to other points of view -- Obama does n't find alternative ideas challenging .
He is capable of assessing and integrating them with his own secure and well - considered slant on things .
We are reminded of Thurlow Weed 's assessment of Lincoln ( Weed was campaign manager for Lincoln 's chief opponent for the Presidential nomination , William Seward ) : " He sees all who go there , hears all they have to say , talks freely with everybody , reads whatever is written to him ; but thinks and acts by himself and for himself . "

Modern - day gladiatorial contests – man against man , usually to the death .

最近FSFが力を入れているのが、ACTAへの反対運動である。
ACTA というのはAnti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( 模倣品・海賊版拡散防止条約 ) のことだ。まだ構想段階ではあるが、知的財産権の執行を強化するための国際的な法的枠組を新たに作りましょう、ということで、米国やEU、日本といった知的財産を多く有する先進国の主導で話が進んでいるらしい。ちなみに、そもそもの言い出しっぺは日本(2005年、当時の小泉首相がG8サミットでぶちあげた)だそうだ。
ところで、なんでそんなものがフリーソフトウェアに関係あるかと言うと、ようするにこれは知的財産の国際的な流通に何らかの網をかけて規制しましょうという趣旨だからである。もちろん規制対象の一つはインターネット上における流通だ。偽ブランド品を水際で食い止めるというだけなら大変結構なことだが、大体においてこの手の網は目が粗すぎて、たとえばP2Pによるソフトウェア流通のような、それ自体は別に違法でもなんでもないものすらも一網打尽にしてしまいがちである。最近では、ネットワークへの負荷を下げるためにフリーソフトウェアをBitTorrentのようなP2Pネットワーク経由で配布するということも決して珍しくないので、こうしたものもACTAを根拠に取り締まられてしまうのはフリーソフトウェアの今後の流通促進にとってマイナスとなる。また、コンテンツにDRMをかけることが強制されたり、DRMの回避がさらに厳しく違法化される可能性もある。そうすると、そうしたコンテンツはフリーソフトウェアのプレーヤ(それにはもちろんRockboxのようなものも含まれる)では原則的には再生できなくなってしまうだろう。これも、フリーソフトウェアの一般への普及を阻害する大きな要因になる。
一応強調しておくと 、ACTA が最終的にどのようなものになるかはまだ不明な点が多い。というより、ほとんど何もわかっていないというのが適切である。リーク情報を載せるWikiとして有名なWikileaksにはACTA素案に関する2007年10月時点でのメモ[PDF ]と称するものが公開されているが、何せ素案というだけに何ら具体的ではないし、そもそもリークなので内容の信憑性は全く保証されていない。Ars Technicaの記事も指摘するように、税関の職員や「著作権警察」が、私たちのラップトップや携帯音楽プレーヤ、携帯電話を開けて、中に違法にコピーされたものが入っていないか調べることが出来るようになる「かもしれない」し、そうはならないかもしれない。よくわからないのである。よくわからないものには反対しようがない。おそらくこれがACTAを巡る秘密主義の狙いであろう。議論の場がWTOやWIPOといった(
途上国もメンバの)国際機関ではなく、いわば「有志連合」のような形を採っているのもこの見方を裏付ける。
そう、ACTAに関して最も問題なのは、そもそも具体的な条文案のようなものが全く表沙汰になっていないということなのだ。表沙汰にならないまま話だけ進んでいる。しかもわざと隠しているふしがある。構想段階といっても、実のところ昨年7月の時点で年末までには交渉を終わらせましょうと言えるくらいにはすでに内容が固まっているはずなのだ。実際にはまだ合意していないようだが、今年3月モロッコで開かれる会合で合意・締結に至るのではないかという観測もある。ようするに、うるさいのに絡まれる前にうやむやのうちに決めてしまおうという思いが見え隠れしているのである。実際、新聞やテレビといったメディアで報じられることはあまりないし、ブログでも日本語ではあまり見かけない(P2Pの見地からこの問題を精力的に扱い続けているブログ、P2Pとかその辺のお話は希有な例である。手前味噌ながら弊サイトも昨年7月記事を掲載している)。昨年9月には、EFFを含む世界中100以上の団体が現時点でのACTA草案の公開を求めて公開書簡を送っているのだが、今のところ黙殺されているようだ。
そんなわけで、いまだ曖昧模糊とした雲の中にあるACTAではあるが、今後も新たな情報が出て来しだい、本コラム等で取り上げてみたいと思っている。最近、私が何か言うと何でもMIAUの方針だと思われるふしがあって閉口しているのだが(私は別にMIAUにそれほど深くコミットしているわけではないし、私が言うことは基本的に私個人の意見である)、今後ACTAの全体像がはっきりしてきたら、あるいはMIAUとしても何らかのアクションを取るべく提案するかもしれない。
Sulfuryl Fluoride - Newly Discovered Greenhouse Gas Has 4800 Times The Warming Impact Of CO2
Sulfuryl fluoride , a gas used for fumigation , has the potential to contribute significantly to future greenhouse warming , but because its production has not yet reached high levels there is still time to nip this potential contributor in the bud , according to an international team of researchers .
Their study of sulfuryl fluoride this month in the Journal of Geophysical Research , measured the levels of the gas in the atmosphere and determined its emissions and lifetime to help gauge its potential future effects on climate .
Sulfuryl fluoride was introduced as a replacement for methyl bromide , a widely used fumigant that is being phased out under the Montreal Protocol because of its ozone - destroying chemistry .
Methyl bromide has been widely used for insect control in grain - storage facilities , and in intensive agriculture in arid lands where drip irrigation is combined with covering of the land with plastic sheets to control evaporation .
“ Such fumigants are very important for controlling pests in the agricultural and building sectors , ” says Ron Prinn , director of MIT ’s Center for Global Change Science and a co-author on the new paper .
But with methyl bromide being phased out , “ industry had to find alternatives , so sulfuryl fluoride has evolved to fill the role , ” he says .
Until the new work , nobody knew accurately how long the gas would last in the atmosphere after it leaked out of buildings or grain silos .
“ Our analysis has shown that the lifetime is about 36 years , or eight times greater than previously thought , with the ocean being its dominant sink , ” Prinn says .
So it would become “ a greenhouse gas of some importance if the quantity of its use grows as people expect . ”
For now , the gas is only present in the atmosphere in very small quantities of about 1.5 parts per trillion , though it is increasing by about 5 percent per year .
Its newly reported 36 - year lifetime , along with studies of its infrared - absorbing properties by researchers at NOAA , “ indicate that , ton for ton , it is about 4,800 times more potent a heat - trapping gas than carbon dioxide ” says Prinn .
Fortunately , though , “ we ’ve caught it very early in the game , ” says Prinn , the TEPCO Professor of Atmospheric Science in MIT ’s Department of Earth , Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences .
The detection was made through a NASA - sponsored global research program called the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment ( AGAGE ) .
“ In AGAGE , we do n’t just monitor the big greenhouse gases that everybody ’s heard of , ” he says .
“ This program is also designed to sniff out potential greenhouse and ozone - depleting gases before the industry gets very big . ”
The lead author of the research paper is Jens Mühle of Scripps , and other co-authors include Jin Huang , a research scientist at MIT ’s Center for Global Change Science , Ray Weiss of Scripps , who co-directs AGAGE with Prinn , and eight others from Scripps , the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom and the Centre for Australian Weather and Climate Research .
“ Unfortunately , it turns out that sulfuryl fluoride is a greenhouse gas with a longer lifetime than previously assumed , ” says Mühle .
“ This has to be taken into account before large amounts are emitted into the atmosphere . ”
Prinn adds that “ fumigation is a big industry , and it ’s absolutely needed to preserve our buildings and food supply . ”
But identifying the greenhouse risks from this particular compound , before many factories have been built to produce it in very large amounts , would give the industry a chance to find other substitutes at a time when that ’s still a relatively easy change to implement .
“ Given human inventiveness , there are surely other alternatives out there , ” says Prinn .
He describes this approach as “ a new frontier for environmental science — to try to head off potential dangers as early as possible , rather than wait until it ’s a mature industry with lots of capital and jobs at stake . ”
One of the things that makes it hard to talk about quality software is that we first must overcome the dominating myth about quality , which goes like this :
The quality of a product is built into it by its development team .
They create quality by following disciplined engineering practices to engineer the source code so that it will fulfill the requirements of the user .
This is a myth , not a lie .
It ’s a simplified story that helps us make sense of our experience .
Myths like this can serve a useful purpose , but we must take care not to believe in them as if they were the great and hoary truth .
Here are some of the limitations of the myth :
Quality is not a thing and it is not built .
To think of it as a thing is to commit the “ reification fallacy ” that my colleague Michael Bolton loves to hate .
Instead , quality is a relationship .
Excellent quality is a wonderful sort of relationship .
Instead of “ building ” quality , it ’s more coherent to say we arrange for it .
Of course you are thinking “ what ’s the difference between arrange and build ?
A carpenter could be said to arrange wood into the form of a cabinet .
So what ? ”
I like the word arrange because it shifts our attention to relationships and because arrangement suggests less permanence .
This is important because in technology we are obliged to work with many elements that are subject to imprecision , ambiguity and drift .
A “ practice ” is not the whole story of how things get done .
To say that we accomplish things by following “ practices ” or “ methods ” is to use a figure of speech called a synecdoche– the substitution of a part for the whole .
What we call practices are the public face of a lot of shadowy behavior that we do n’t normally count as part of the way we work .
For instance , joking around , or eating a salad at your desk , or choosing which email to read next , and which to ignore .
A social researcher examining a project in progress would look carefully at who talks to whom , how they talk and what they talk about .
How is status gained or lost ?
How do people decide what to do next ?
What are the dominant beliefs about how to behave in the office ?
How are documents created and marketed around the team ?
In what ways do people on the team exert or accept control ?
Source code is not the product .
The product is the experience that the user receives .
That experience comes from the source code in conjunction with numerous other components that are outside the control and sometimes even the knowledge of product developers .
It also comes from documentation and support .
And that experience plays out over time on what is probably a chaotic multi-tasking computing environment .
“ Requirements ” are not the requirements , and the “ users ” are not the users .
I do n’t know what my requirements are for any of the software I have ever used .
I mean , I do know some things .
But for anything I think I know , I ’m aware that someone else may suggest something that is different that might please me better .
Or maybe they will show me how something I thought was important is actually harmful .
I do n’t know my own requirements for certain .
Instead , I make good guesses .
Everyone tries to do that .
People learn , as they see and work with products , more about what they want .
Furthermore , what they want actually changes with their experiences .
People change .
The users you think you are targeting may not be the users you get .
Fulfillment is not forever and everywhere .
The state of the world drifts .
A requirement fulfilled today may no longer be fulfilled tomorrow , because of a new patch to the operating system , or because a new competing product has been released .
Another reason we can’t count on a requirement being fulfilled is that can does not mean will .
What I see working with one data set on one computer may not work with other data on another computer .
These factors make certain conversations about quality unhelpful .
For instance , I ’m impatient when someone claims that unit testing or review will guarantee a great product , because unit testing and review do not account for system level effects , or transient data occurring in the field , or long chains of connected transactions , or intermittent failure of third - party components .
Unit testing and review focus on source code .
But source code is not the product .
So they can be useful , but they are still mere heuristic devices .
They provide no guarantee .
Once in a while , I come across a yoho who thinks that a logical specification language like “ Z ” is the great solution .
Because then your specification can be “ proven correct . ”
The big problems with that , of course , is that correctness in this case simply means self - consistency .
It does not mean that the specification corresponds to the needs of the customer , nor that it corresponds to the product that is ultimately built .
I ’m taking an expansive view of products and projects and quality , because I believe my job is to help people get what they want .
Some people , mainly those who go on and on about “ disciplined engineering processes ” and wish to quantify quality , take a narrower view of their job .
I think that ’s because their overriding wish is that any problems not be “ their fault ” but rather YOUR fault .
As in , “ Hey , I followed the formal spec .
If you put the wrong things in the formal spec , that ’s YOUR problem , stupid . ”
My Take on the Quality Story
Let me offer a more nuanced version of the quality story – still a myth , yes– but one more useful to professionals :
A product is a dynamic arrangement , like a garden that is subject to the elements .
A high quality product takes skillful tending and weeding over time .
Just like real gardeners , we are not all powerful or all knowing as we grow our crop .
We review the conditions and the status of our product as we go .
We try to anticipate problems , and we react to solve the problems that occur .
We try to understand what our art can and cannot do , and we manage the expectations of our customers accordingly .
We know that our product is always subject to decay , and that the tastes of our customers vary .
We also know that even the most perfect crop can be spoiled later by a bad chef .
Quality , to a significant degree , is out of our hands .
After many years of seeing things work and fail ( or work and THEN fail ) , I think of quality as ephemeral .
It may be good enough , at times .
It may be better than good enough .
But it fades ; it always fades , like something natural .
Or like sculpture by Andy Goldsworthy .
( Check out this video . )
This is true for all software , but the degree to which it is a problem will vary .
Some systems have been built that work well over time .
That is the result of excellent thinking and problem solving on the part of the development team .
But I would argue it is also the result of favorable conditions in the surrounding environment .
Those conditions are subject to change without notice .
Since 1913 , when the Seventeenth Amendment took the selection of senatorism out of the hands of the state legislatures , gave it to the voters , and allowed governors to fill unexpected vacancies , a hundred and eighty senators have attained their seats by appointment .
As I suggest in this week ’s Comment , most of them have been even less remarkable than their elected colleagues .
But a few have been of interest .
Some appointees ( Arthur Vandenberg , of Michigan ; Sam Ervin , of North Carolina ; William Knowland , of California ; Walter Mondale , of Minnesota ; Howard Metzenbaum , of Ohio ; George Mitchell , of Maine ) achieved distinction in the Senate ; others ( James O. Eastland , of Mississippi , and the two Harry Byrds , Sr. and Jr. , of Virginia ) just made themselves notorious .
John Foster Dulles , the future Cold War Secretary of State , and Pierre Salinger , J.F.K.’s bouncy press secretary , flitted briefly through the Capitol as senators by appointment .
( The voters quickly showed them the door . )
At least two — Frank Graham , of North Carolina , and Harris Wofford , of Pennsylvania , both former college presidents — were genuine creative intellectuals .
Graham , a heroic specimen of that admiral breed , the southern white liberal , was appointed in 1949 .
He was defeated almost two years later by a filthy , racist campaign engineered by the youthful Jesse Helms , but his protégé — Allard Lowenstein most prominent among them — changed American politics .
Harris
Wofford may still be best known as the man who not only arranged Martin Luther King ’s trip to India to study Gandhian methods but also persuaded J.F.K. to call the imprisoned King on the eve of the 1960 election , thereby clinching Kennedy ’s hairbreadth win .
In 1991 , Governor Bob Casey appointed him to the Senate .
Running in his own right later that same year on a platform of healthcare for all , he handily upset Richard Thornburgh , a popular ex-governor .
Three years later , he lost narrowly to the egregious Rick Santorum ( who , poetically , was routed , in 2006 , by Casey ’s son , Bob , Jr. ) .
But that did n’t stop Wofford from running and saving Americorps during and after the Clinton Administration .
Still going strong at eighty - two , he campaigned tirelessly for Obama .
On the other hand there was Senator Rebecca Felton .
In 1922 , Thomas Hardwick , the governor of Georgia , hoping to ingratiate himself with newly enfranchised women voters ( he was in the doghouse for having opposed the Nineteenth Amendment ) , made gimmicky history by appointing a woman , the first ever , to the world ’s supposedly most exclusive club .
Mrs. Felton , an eighty - seven - year - old suffragist and prohibitionist , spent one day in the job before being displaced by an elected successor .
If she is not remembered today as a feminist heroine , perhaps it has something to do with her bloodcurdling enthusiasm for murder as the surest remedy for interracial relationships of the sort that gave us our soon - to - be President .
As she said on August 11 , 1897 , “ When there is not enough religion in the pulpit to organize a crusade against sin ; nor justice in the court house to promptly punish crime ; nor manhood enough in the nation to put a sheltering arm about innocence and virtue — if it needs lynching to protect woman ’s dearest possession from drunken , ravening beasts — then I say lynch a thousand a week . ”
I guess she ’d have been a PUMA .
I do n’t know what it is with Pam Anderson , but she ’s one of those girls that gay dudes seriously relate to .
Maybe she ’s a dirty fag hag , but I think it ’s most likely got to do with the hope she brings them by being living proof that all you need is a lot of money for surgery to be an accepted sex symbol to straight men everywhere , that or because she brings all the coke to the party and free coke is the best kind of coke .
So when clubkid Richie Rich and his clothing line had their fashion show , I was n’t surprised to see Pamela Anderson there , especially now that her ass hit menopause and is jacked with testosterone and slowly lookin like one you ’d find on a tranny on estrogen therapy , seeing this bitch is like taking a human biology class and like I am just as confused as I was when I took it in the ninth grade because I do n’t know if getting off to this makes me a faggot .
Enjoy .

Build Your Own Algae Bioreactor from Recycled Water Bottles
February 4th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
I do n’t know about you , but I ’ve always fantasized about having an algae bioreactor in my backyard .
Instructables recently posted a video to help me do just that .
The DIY algae photo - bioreactor is built from plastic water bottles , and churns out some beautiful green biofuel .

Ah , inline - block , that elusive and oh so tempting display declaration that promises so much , yet delivers so little .
Too many times have I received PSD files like this :
and begin to cry .
Normally , this type of layout would be a cakewalk .
Fixed width , fixed height , float : left and you ’re done .
Buuuuut , the design needs to work with variable amounts of content , which means if one of these blocks has more content than the others , it will break the layout :
Because the first gallery item is taller than the rest , the 5th item is floated left against it instead of below it .
Basically we want a layout with the flexibility of a table , but proper , semantic markup .
We start with a simple page with an unordered list and display set to inline - block :
< ul > < li > < h4 > This is awesome </ h4 > < img src= "
http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3623/3279671785_d1f2e665b6_s.jpg " alt =" lobster " width = " 75 " height = " 75 " /> </li > ... < ul > < style > li { width : 200 px ; min-height : 250 px ; border : 1 px solid # 000 ; display : inline - block ; margin : 5 px ; } </style >
And it looks ok in Firefox 3 , Safari 3 and Opera :
Obviously , something is wrong with the vertical alignment .
Well , not exactly wrong , because this is the correct behavior , but it ’s not what we want .
What ’s going on here is the baseline of each < li > is being aligned with the baseline of the parent < ul > .
What ’s a baseline , you ask ?
A picture is worth a thousand words :
The baseline is the black line running through the text above .
Putting it as simply as possible , the default vertical - align value on inline or inline - block element is baseline , which means the element ’s baseline will be aligned with its parent ’s baseline .
Here ’s the first inline - block attempt with baselines shown :
As you can see , each baseline is aligned with the baseline for the text ‘ This is the baseline ’ .
That text is not in a < li > , but simply a text node of the parent < ul > , to illustrate where the parent ’s baseline is .
Anyway , the fix for this is simple : vertical - align : top , which results in a great looking grid :
Except it still does n’t work in Firefox 2 , IE 6 and 7 .
Let ’s start with Firefox 2 .
Firefox 2 does n’t support inline - block , but it does support a Mozilla specific display property ‘ - moz - inline - stack ’ , which displays just like inline - block .
And when we add it before display : inline - block , FF2 ignores that declaration and keeps - moz - inline - stack because it does n’t support inline - block .
Browsers that support inline - block will use it and ignore previous display property .
< style > li { width : 200 px ; min-height : 250 px ; border : 1 px solid # 000 ; display : - moz - inline - stack ; display : inline - block ; vertical - align : top ; margin : 5 px ; } </style >
Unfortunately , it has a small bug :
Honestly , I do n’t know what causes this bug .
But there is quick fix .
Wrap everything inside the < li > with a < div > .
< li > < div > < h4 > This is awesome </ h4 > < img src= "
http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3623/3279671785_d1f2e665b6_s.jpg " alt =" lobster " width = " 75 " height =
" 75 " /> </div> </li>
This seems to ‘ reset ’ everything inside the < li > ’s and makes them display appropriately .
Now , on to IE 7 .
IE 7 does not support inline - block , but we can trick it into rendering the < li>s as if they were inline - block .
How ?
hasLayout , a magical property of IE that allows for all sorts of fun !
You ca n’t set hasLayout explicity on an element with hasLayout : true ; or anything easy like that , but you can trigger it with other declarations like zoom :
1 .
Technically , what hasLayout means is an element with hasLayout set to true is responsible for rendering itself and its children ( combine that with a min-height and width , and you get something very similar to display : block ) .
It ’s kinda like magical fairy dust you can sprinkle on rendering issues and make them disappear .
When we add zoom : 1 and * display : inline ( star hack to target IE6 & 7 ) to the < li>s , we make IE 7 display them as if they were inline - block :
< style > li { width : 200 px ; min-height : 250 px ; border : 1 px solid # 000 ; display : - moz - inline - stack ; display : inline - block ; vertical - align : top ; margin : 5 px ; zoom : 1 ; * display : inline ; } </style >
Phew !
Almost done .
Just IE 6 left :
IE 6 does n’t support min-height , but thanks to its improper handling of the height property , we can use that instead .
Setting _height ( IE6 underscore hack ) to 250 px will give all < li >s a height of 250 px , and if their content is bigger than that , they will expand to fit .
All other browsers will ignore _height .
So after all that work , here ’s the final CSS and HTML :
< style > li { width : 200 px ; min-height : 250 px ; border : 1 px solid # 000 ; display : - moz - inline - stack ; display : inline - block ; vertical - align : top ; margin : 5 px ; zoom : 1 ; * display : inline ; _height : 250 px ; } </style > < li > < div > < h4 > This is awesome </ h4 > < img src= "
http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3623/3279671785_d1f2e665b6_s.jpg " alt =" lobster " width = " 75 " height =
" 75 " /> </div> </li>
