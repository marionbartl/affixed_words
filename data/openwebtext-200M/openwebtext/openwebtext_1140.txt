Verdensstjerne støtter nytt opprop .
I dag offentliggjøres et bredt opprop fra 35 ulike kultur - organisasjoner som ønsker å bevare opphavsretten i sin nåværende form .
Oppropet får støtte fra en av de største komponistene verden har sett , Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart :
– Det er klart at jeg hadde nytt godt av opphavsrett på musikk , hadde den vært virksom i min levetid .
Da kunne jeg lent meg rolig tilbake i 8 - årsalderen , og sett royaltisene rulle inn på konto .
For Mozart er det nesten uvirkelig at han i det hele tatt klarte å lage musikk under de vanskelige forholdene :
– Det var jo aldri musikken som var drivkraften .
Jeg var svært glad i punsj , og da valgte jeg meg den veien som gav mest punsj per arbeidstime .
Hadde opphavsretten vært håndhevet i min tid , kunne jeg drukket mye mer punsj og vært uspiselig rik , i stedet for bare uspiselig .
Komponisten tror han kunne laget mange store operaer og symfonier som ville blitt spilt over hele verden i mange hundre år , hadde han levd med dagens rettighetsregler :
– Dette gjorde jeg forsåvidt uansett , men det ble alts å mindre midler og tid til punsj enn det kunne ha vært .
Jeg tror dessuten jeg hadde trivdes godt i et plateselskap .
Da hadde nok færre penger tilfalt min grådige far , og istedet tilfalt et par grådig - perer i selskapet , spekulerer den avdøde musikeren .
Han er likevel sterkt kristisk til noen deler ved det moderne systemet :
– At folk kan sette seg ned i sin stue og spille og nyte mine musikkstykker – vederlagsfritt – nei , det er forkastelig , og gjør fint lite for at min musikk klatrer på VG - lista .
Som ville gitt mer punsj .
Mozart legger til slutt til at det hadde vært ok om det også var copyright på hans egen frisyre :
– Det var liksom min greie , det der : Hvitt , krøllete uvasket hår .
Hadde jeg fått en mark for hver gang de benyttet en slik frisyre i en film eller roman , hadde jeg ikke trengt å lage musikk overhodet .
Og altså mer tid til punsj .
Ten Questions for Winnifred Fallers Sullivan on Prison Religion : Faith - based Reform and the Constitution
( Princeton University Press 2009 )
What inspired you to write Prison Religion ?
What sparked your interest ?
After publishing The Impossibility of Religious Freedom , I had decided not to do any more expert - witnessing in religion cases .
I was just not sure that I could be helpful .
But when Alex Luchenitser , the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs in the Iowa prison case , called , I could n’t resist .
He told me that the case concerned a faith - based prison rehabilitation program in Iowa and that the program actually ran the entire wing of an Iowa state prison — where prisoners spent eighteen months .
After some discussion of what I might be able to contribute , I agreed to serve as an expert .
I thought I could help the judge to understand what was religious about the Iowa program .
I did not decide to write the book until the trial was over , though , when I found myself reflecting on how such a book might make a useful pair with my previous one , showing how disestablishment is also impossible .
What ’s the most important take - home message for readers ?
This book analyzes the record in a federal trial challenging the constitutionality of a faith - based prison rehabilitation program in an Iowa prison : Americans United v. Prison Fellowship Ministries .
The plaintiffs in the case argued that a residential program that advertises itself as “ Bible - based ” and “ Christ - centered , ” and requires prisoners to memorize Bible passages and learn to apply them to their lives , violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment to the US Constitution .
The judge agreed , describing the program , InnerChange Freedom Initiative , as a state - sponsored program of forced conversion .
The book presents the testimony of the witnesses in the case and sets that testimony in the context of American penal and religious history .
It addresses the convergence of two distinctive features of the United States : a place where a higher percentage of its population is incarcerated than anywhere else in the world , and a place that is often described as very religious .
Prison and evangelical religion have been linked throughout US history .
Both are fundamental to US identity .
Is their union an establishment of religion ?
What is the alternative ?
Anything you had to leave out ?
Some people have suggested that I should have spent more time talking about my own experience as an expert witness .
I wanted this book to be about the prisoners .
But I do think that there is a lot of misunderstanding about the role of expert witnessing , particularly in cases involving cultural evidence .
I teach Evidence Law to law students and I hope to write more about these issues in the future .
What are some of the biggest misconceptions about your topic ?
As many people have pointed out , the words “ separation of church and state ” do not appear in the Constitution .
That comes as a surprise to many Americans .
It reveals a kind of popular Constitutional understanding that exists alongside the actual words .
Not only are the words not present in the text , a strong argument can be made that “ church ” and “ state ” are not actually separate in the United States .
This country has a distinctive religio- legal culture resulting from the prevalence of the free church model — particularly when compared to the church - state regimes of most European countries — but it is not a very secular place .
I am one of a group of scholars of law and religion in the United States who have been working to find better ways to describe the nature of the intersection between the two .
Did you have a specific audience in mind when writing ?
I always try to write for an intelligent reader who is not a specialist .
I try to write for my mother .
She is an appreciative but critical reader !
Beyond that , I try to write for both a legal studies and a religious studies audience , hoping , in some sense , to act as go - between for these two very different conversations .
Are you hoping to just inform readers ?
Give them pleasure ?
Piss them off ?
I hope that I will interest readers in the religious lives of prisoners in this country and the similarities of those lives with their own lives .
What alternate title would you give the book ?
I wanted to call it A Prison Like No Other , which is the title of one of the brochures produced by Prison Fellowship Ministries , or Reforming the Secular .
Some of my friends wanted to call it The God Pod , the name given to the prison wing in which this program existed by the other prisoners .
Saner heads prevailed .
I think the final title gives a better sense of what the book is actually about .
How do you feel about the cover ?
I love the cover .
The photo was one that had been published in the Des Moines Register when the program was initiated .
The Princeton designer did a great job incorporating the photo into the design of the cover , in my view .
Books about this topic almost always have a church and a courthouse on the cover !
Is there a book out there you wish you had written ?
Which one ?
Why ?
There are two short books I really admire : The Garden and the Wilderness by Mark deWolfe Howe ; a beautifully - written book that does a better job than any other I know of showing the interrelationship over time of religion and law in the United States , of how law and religion shape each other in this country .
And The French Revolution and The Church by John McManners , which narrates the remarkable changes to the French Catholic Church over the time of the Revolution .
Both books bear repeated readings .
What ’s your next book ?
Spiritual Governance : The New Establishment of Religion .
It is about the bureaucratic regulation and licensing of spiritual care and chaplaincies by various parts of the state and federal governments .
A police officer pulls over a speeding car .
The officer says , I clocked you at 80 miles per hour , sir .
” The driver says , “ Gee , officer I had it on cruise control at 60 , perhaps your radar gun needs calibrating . ”
Not looking up from her knitting the wife says : “ Now do n’t be silly dear , you know that this car does n’t have cruise control .
” As the officer writes out the ticket , the driver looks over at his wife and growls , “ Ca n’t you please keep your mouth shut for once ? ”
The wife smiles demurely and says , “ You should be thankful your radar detector went off when it did .
” As the officer makes out the second ticket for the illegal radar detector unit , the man glowers at his wife and says through clenched teeth , “ Darn it , woman , ca n’t you keep your mouth shut ? ”
The officer frowns and says , “ And I notice that you ’re not wearing your seat belt , sir .
That ’s an automatic $ 75 fine .
” The driver says , “ Yeah , well , you see officer , I had it on , but took it off when you pulled me over so that I could get my license out of my back pocket . ”
The wife says , “ Now , dear , you know very well that you did n’t have your seat belt on .
You never wear your seat belt when you ’re driving . ”
And as the police officer is writing out the third ticket the driver turns to his wife and barks , “ WHY DON ’T YOU PLEASE SHUT UP ? ? ”
The officer looks over at the woman and asks , “ Does your husband always talk to you this way , Ma’am ? ”
‘ Only when he ’s been drinking . ’

Loose Change
Thursday , July 10 , 2008
I ’ve been sitting on this interview for a while , but after viewing the latest BBC piece on WTC7 , I feel the time has come to release it in its entirety .
After locating Barry in mid 2007 , Jason and I visited him and he graciously granted us an interview during a lunch break .
He had agreed to grant us an interview under the conditions that we , at no time , associate his interview with his place of employment .
Jason and I were so thrilled with the content of the interview that we decided to release a few bits and pieces of it on both our show and Alex’s .
( Article continues below )
A few months later , as the film was nearing completion , I called Barry again to touch base and see how things were going .
It took him a bit to remember who I was , but as soon as he did , he began complaining about phone calls to his place of employment and that he was in danger of losing his job .
He requested to have his interview pulled from Loose Change , and I honored his request .
Fast forward to February , 2008 , where I ’m doing an interview with the BBC , and I ’m informed by their crew that Barry told them the reason he asked for it to be pulled was because of the article on Prisonplanet claiming he was stepping over dead bodies , which he denies saying .
I call Barry to attempt to rectify the situation , and he is adamant that he did not use the phrase “ we were stepping over people ”
Fast forward one more time to two days ago , when the BBC piece finally aired .
I now feel an obligation to release his interview , in its entirety , into the public where it belongs for three reasons :
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
1 ) To see the difference between the interview he gave us , and the interview he gave the BBC .
2 ) To establish Barry ’s timeline in his own words .
3 ) To preserve his testimony , in his own words , for the historical record .
I have remained true to my word and kept his interview out of the film , however , I can no longer keep it from the public .
They deserve to hear Barry ’s story , out of his own mouth .
As I say in the end of the video , I would appreciate it if Barry could enjoy his privacy and live his life in peace .
My intention with releasing this is so his story can be told , not to cause him any further grief or suffering .

ebatten om president Obamas sjukvårdsreform har – både i USA och i referaten här hemma – återupprepat myter som försvårar diskussionen om ett viktigt problem .
De centrala frågorna om tillgång till vård och finansieringstäckning , samt uppdelningen mellan offent - liga och privata åtaganden , är dessutom relevanta även i en svensk kontext .
Att vårdkostnaderna i USA under senare år stigit betydligt snabbare än löner och inflation , har viktiga historiska orsaker .
Löne - och priskontrollen under andra världskriget tvingade företagen att konkurrera om arbetskraft genom att erbjuda skattefria sjukförsäkringar .
Det amerikanska skatteverkets officiella godkännande av detta 1943 , har sannolikt mer än något annat statligt ingripande präglat sjukvården .
Hyperforeignism is the mispronunciation of words borrowed from foreign languages … but it ’s actually a sort of an over - pronunciation , so correct that it ’s circled back around to incorrect again .
The noun octopus is often made plural in English as octopi , originally from the mistaken belief that all Latin nouns ending in - us take - i to form their plural .
However , this is only correct for Latin masculine nouns of the second declension .
For Latin fourth - declension nouns , such as manus , the singular and plural forms both end in - us .
For third declension nouns such as octopus , the plural is less regular .
The noun octopus in Latin is a third - declension noun borrowed from the Greek .
Although octopuses is generally considered correct in modern English , its plural in Latin is actually octopodes .
An easier example of this is prix fixe .
The common mispronunciation is something like “ pricks ficks ” but the hyperforeign version is “ pree fee ” , which is how one might presume the French would pronounce it .
The correct pronunciation is actually “ pree ficks ” .

There are a lot of opportunities for local businesses that have a web presence .
Improving your local web presence is the best way to have new customers getting into your front door .
Recent research has found that more than 80 % of local businesses that have an online presence reached out to new customers during the previous festive season .
These new customers increased the sales in these companies hence profitability also increased .
In addition to this , 43 % of the search queries recorded by search engines are for local businesses ; meaning 1 in every 3 queries is about a local enterprise of which more than 75 % end up buying a product .
In Tennessee , local businesses have started realizing the benefits of having a web presence .
Many SEO companies are insisting on creating a good website which is also mobile optimized ( many local websites are n’t ) to get you more customers buying your products .
Here are some ways to grow your local web presence ;
1. Publish accurate web content
If you want to publish accurate , user - friendly web content , you have to put yourself in the customer ’s shoes .
Try to think of how you would search for a business .
Most probably you will start with the name of the business or the address or the city you are in .
If you do n’t know the name , you might try to search for the product name or services offered .
This leads you to generate a few keywords .
A keyword is a word or words that is typed into the search engine ’s search box to find something on the internet .
SEO companies know a lot about keywords , and it is a great idea to hire one .
There are many Nashville SEO companies that give you a detailed plan of how they are going to get the correct keywords for your products .
2. Optimize your website for mobile devices
In this day and age , there are millions of smartphones in use .

This ensures that your site can be viewed easily on a tablet or smartphone .
The same website that fits perfectly on your desktop should also fit on a mobile device .
It is a fact that most local businesses do not have mobile - optimized websites .
Most local SEO services , including those provided by Nashville SEO companies , are incorporating optimizing websites for mobile devices in their efforts to boost a website ’s ratings .
Also , more than 70 % of the people who will view the website via a smartphone will follow up and view the desktop website .
3 . Have a map and accurate contact details
Setting up the correct and up - to - date contact information together with the operating hours of your brick and mortar business is very important in growing your local web presence .
In the Tennessee area , more than half of the local businesses do not have their telephone numbers on their website .
Others have the phone numbers but they are n’t functional and end up frustrating potential customers .

Try them out and see the results for yourself .
4. Encourage ratings of your business
You can encourage customers to do a review of the services you have offered them and post it on the Internet .
However , you should be very cautious about this as some people may post negative reviews about your establishment .
Offer your customers high - quality services or products if you want to go this route .
Have a comment section where your customers can express their gratitude .
Having a comment saying , “ Kudos for the great service ” will convince more people to visit your store .
Franklin SEO companies actually sign up your website to popular review sites and create an awesome profile for you .

Many top search engine optimization companies will do all these for you .
They will also add buttons and widgets on your site for easier navigation to social network sites and review sites .
It is up to you to choose whether to hire one or take the task head on .
Grimoire : Diminishing Returns Formula
Introduction
In the course of developing Lost Souls , we 've often needed a way to impose diminishing returns on various ratings .
I 've tried a lot of ways of doing this .
Eventually , one formula emerged as generally superior to others , having a progression that fits game usage much better than most alternatives , being open - ended rather than imposing an absolute cap , and being adaptable to whatever numeric range we might want .
I present this formula here .
I 'll explain in detail what the formula does , and the math behind it , but if you like , you can skip directly to the calculator interfaces where you can take a look at the results it produces for individual input values and scales , see an overview of the results a scale produces for a range of typical input values , or get code for the formula in LPC , C , C# , Perl , PHP , Python , JavaScript , or Java .
The formula works from the basis of a " scale number " , which is a sort of starting point that determines how " tough " the scale you 're using will be — how quickly it will begin diminishing .
If your scale number is 20 , for instance , then an input value of 20 will produce an output value of 20 .
This can be thought of as the first " performance level " of the formula .
To get from there to the second " performance level " , an output of 40 , takes 20 units more than it took to get to the first level ; so an input of 60 produces an output of 40 .
To get to the third level , an output of 60 , takes an additional 60 units , for a total of 120 .
So the progression of levels goes :
20 ( 0 + 20 ) -> 20 60 ( 20 + 40 ) -> 40 120 ( 60 + 60 ) -> 60 200 ( 120 + 80 ) -> 80 300 ( 200 + 100 ) -> 100 etc .
This gives a steady , but not drastic , reduction in marginal output as input grows larger .
The formula works just as well with any scale number you choose .
For results that begin diminishing very quickly , one could use a scale number of 3 , making the progression :
3 ( 0 + 3 ) -> 3 9 ( 3 + 6 ) -> 6 18 ( 9 + 9 ) -> 9 30 ( 18 + 12 ) -> 12 45 ( 30 + 15 ) -> 15 etc .
You can use this flexibility to tune your use of the formula for your needs in a particular situation .
Math
For those interested in the mathematics , the formula uses the sequence of triangular numbers : 1 , 3 , 6 , 10 , 15 , 21 , etc .
As you can see , the divergence between the numbers increases by 1 at each step , giving us the basic mathematical behavior we want for this formula .
To make use of it , we first determine what factor of the scale number we have as input :
factor = input_value / scale_number
Then we want to determine the position in the triangular number sequence that this factor occupies .
The formula for a triangular number is n = p * ( p + 1 ) / 2 .
Solving this for p , we wind up using :
position = ( sqrt ( 8 * factor +
1 ) - 1 ) / 2
We then multiply this position by the scale number to get our output value .
output = position * scale_number
Sample Calculators
You can use these calculators to try out the behavior of the function with different input values and scale numbers .

Tonight I had the extreme pleasure of seeing Senator Sherrod Brown , Congresswoman Mary Jo Kilroy , Secretary of State , Jennifer Brunner , Lt Governor Lee Fisher , Columbus Mayor Michael Coleman , and many others at the Let's Get It Done : Health Insurance Reform Now Event .
It was a tremendously exciting and energizing event .
The speakers were all excellent , there were hundreds of pro-reformers there , and me and Link were able to hand out 200 Facts not Fear Rally fliers .
This fight is going to be won this September , irrational anger and fear tactics are getting old and starting to fall on deaf ears .
Tonight there were hundreds of Central Ohio citizens cheering for healthcare reform , there was a handful of deathers announcing their Tea Parties and peddling their misinformation .
Sherrod Brown artfully pointed out that there were only 14 or 15 people trying to disrupt the meeting , after the first 20 minutes , there few and far between cries of " higher taxes " , " death panels " , and " where 's the beef ? " were put down completely as they knew that they had come up against their most feared enemy , energized , well informed , organized liberals .
After that the only cheers that interrupted our leaders were " Healthcare NOW ! " and " Everybody IN , Nobody OUT "
It was an amazing event , I scored a sweet sign , we informed 190 liberals , and I think about 10 deathers about the Facts not Fear rally , and we had our voices heard .
We are now fired up and ready to go for this Labor Day , the Facts not Fear Rally for Reform is primed and ready to go , we have the POWERHORN ( our amazing new bullhorn ) , and we are now in talks with Organizing for America , Workers United , and the Columbus College Democrats .

Thanks again , I love this community , together we can do anything .
Just when you thought evolution could n't get attacked by anyone else , a zoologist writing in Science and his colleagues are contending that changing winter conditions due to global warming are causing Scotland 's wild Soay sheep to get smaller despite the evolutionary benefits of having a large body .
Yep , climate change can trump natural selection , it turns out .
So much for adapting to the environment .
Too bad Darwin did n't know about CO2 .
" Sheep are getting smaller .
Well , at least the wild Soay sheep living on a remote Scottish island are .
But according to classic evolutionary theory , they should have been getting bigger , because larger sheep tend to be more likely to survive and reproduce than smaller ones , and offspring tend to resemble their parents , " said study author Tim Coulson , professor of population biology at Imperial College London who teaches courses in ecology , evolution and conservation .
" Our findings have solved a paradox that has tormented biologists for years – why predictions did not match observation .
Biologists have realized that ecological and evolutionary processes are intricately intertwined , and they now have a way of dissecting out the contribution of each .
Unfortunately it is too early to tell whether a warming world will lead to pocket - sized sheep , " Coulson said .
Coulson and his colleagues analyzed body - weight measurements and life - history data ( which record the timing of key milestones throughout an individual 's life ) , for the female members of a population of Soay sheep .
The sheep live on the island of Hirta in the St. Kilda archipelago and have been studied closely since 1985 .
The researchers plugged their data into a numerical model that they say predicts how a trait such as body size will change over time due to natural selection and other factors that influence survival and reproduction in the wild .
They selected body size because it is a heritable trait , and because the sheep have , on average , been decreasing in size for the last 25 years .
Their results lead them to state that the decrease is primarily an ecological response to environmental variation over the last 25 years .
Evolutionary change has contributed relatively little .
More specifically , lambs are not growing as quickly as they once did .
As winters have become shorter and milder , due to global climate change , lambs now do not need to put on as much as weight in the first months of life to survive to their first birthday .
So , even the slower - growing ones now have a chance of surviving , according to Coulson .
Also contributing to this trend is what Coulson and his colleagues call the " young mum effect . "
The researchers found that younger mothers are physically unable to produce offspring that are as big as they were at birth .
The reasons behind this are still unclear , but the young mum effect counters the effect of natural selection , which favors larger lambs , the authors report .

Who Killed California ?
Fall 2009
The story of California has always been a great American tale of triumph over long odds .
Since its entry into the Union , in the aftermath of war and the midst of gold fever , the state has seemed an improbable colossus .
But again and again , California has made its way through hours of challenge – not only surviving intact , but emerging as a model for the rest of the nation .
In the 19th century , despite immense geographic , ethnic , political , and social differences , Californians managed to form a cohesive identity , resisting numerous efforts to divide the state .
They overcame the " curse of natural resources " that so long afflicted other commodity - rich states ( and still afflicts some , like Alaska ) , laying the groundwork for a thriving and diverse economy that now dwarfs those of many developed countries .
In the 20th century , through one of the greatest feats of engineering in human history , they turned the semi-arid desolation of southern California into a booming megalopolis and home to the second - largest metropolitan area in America .
California ranked 20th among the states in population in 1900 , but by 1963 it was first , where it has remained .
And through a series of social , political , and economic experiments , California has acted as America 's foremost laboratory of innovation , trying out ideas the country as a whole would go on to adopt .
In the 1960s under Governor Pat Brown , the state offered a model of modernization , building the most advanced education and transportation infrastructures in the nation .
Under Brown 's successor , Ronald Reagan , it offered a model of conservative governance that would go on to transform American politics .
Hollywood has made California a crucial part of America 's cultural identity , and Silicon Valley has put it at the heart of our vision of the future .
For many decades now , Americans have seen California as a harbinger of promising things to come .
Today , however , California has become a warning sign .
Beset by economic disaster and political paralysis , the state is in the midst of a systemic crisis .
And while the meltdown has certainly been accelerated by the recession of the past two years , its causes involve two decades of poor judgment , reckless mismanagement , and irresponsibility .
How California got into this mess has a lot to teach the rest of the country ; how it gets out will say a great deal about America 's prospects .
A STATE IN CRISIS
It would be difficult to overstate the magnitude of California 's troubles .
In economic terms , the state is simply broke : issuing IOUs as payments for goods and services , begging the federal government to back state debt ( a request the Obama administration denied ) , and watching its credit rating plummet .
To address a $ 42 billion shortfall in February of this year , the legislature enacted a package that included the largest state tax increases in American history , leaving California with the highest sales and personal income - tax rates in the country ( though Hawaii would supplant its lead in the latter category in May ) .
When another $ 26 billion shortfall emerged by summer , lawmakers — chastened by the 2 - 1 rejection of further tax hikes in a May 19 special election — agreed on another package that featured more than $ 16 billion in spending reductions , including deep cuts to education , health , and social services .
That 's not even the worst of it .
For all of the high drama that has accompanied 2009 's fiscal travails ( a stunning populist backlash against high taxes , widespread public - employee protests over spending cuts ) , California 's lawmakers let the crisis go to waste — failing to use the moment to improve the state 's financial outlook .
As the San Diego Union - Tribune 's John Marelius noted :
[ California projects ] a deficit of between $ 7 billion and $ 8 billion for the next budget cycle .
Plus , federal stimulus money , $ 5 billion of which was used to backfill education cuts this year , may not be available .
And about the time the next governor takes office , $ 16 billion in temporary tax increases that were included in [ the ]
February budget deal will expire .
As if that were n't apocalyptic enough , California 's short - term ­financial difficulties pale in comparison to its long - term obligations .
In the most recent fiscal year , the California Public Employees ' Retirement System and the California State Teachers ' Retirement System , the state 's two largest pension plans , lost a combined total of nearly $ 100 ­billion — about a quarter of their value — in the market downturn .
If legislators thought tackling a $ 60 billion deficit was trying , they are sure to love the challenge of making good on California 's fixed pension obligations — which Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has estimated are $ 300 billion in the red .
And fiscal troubles are just the tip of the iceberg .
California 's percentage of adults without at least a high - school education is the second - highest in the nation ( and the fact that 72 % of those without diplomas are immigrants only fuels the state 's growing problem of social stratification ) .
The Commonwealth Fund has ranked the quality of California 's health care lowest of the 50 states .
The state has the highest rate of criminal recidivism in the country .
It has six of the ten worst cities in the country in air pollution .
Los Angeles and San Francisco have some of the most congested roads in the nation , which costs the state 's employers billions in lost productivity each year .
The state is seriously discussing mandatory water rationing , and has in recent years experienced severe disruptions of its electricity supply .
Unemployment is over 11 % , and a recent survey of corporate CEOs ranked California the worst state in the country in which to do business .
It is losing native - born ­citizens faster than any other state .
To put the effects of these trends in perspective , from 2004 to 2007 more people left California for Texas and Oklahoma than came west from those states to escape the Dust Bowl in the 1930s .
California is in the midst of a man -made disaster .
How could things get so bad ?
The story of California 's decline is a tragedy of political dysfunction , misguided ideology , interest - group ­politics , and willful blindness .
DERELICT DEMOCRACY
To begin with , the state 's government and political system are designed to malfunction .
A series of ill - conceived constraints and incentives have created weak and unaccountable public officials , even as they have set California on a course to fiscal disaster .
In the state legislature , for ­example , a two - thirds majority is required to pass a budget .
The original law creating this requirement was passed in the 1930s , and invoked the two - thirds rule only for budgets that grew by 5 % or more over the prior year .
But that qualification was dropped in the 1960s , and the two - thirds majority is now an annual necessity .
Because California 's political districts are thoroughly uncompetitive ( in 2004 , 153 state or federal legislative seats were up for election , and none changed parties ) , members of the legislature tend to come from the parties ' ideological poles .
And since this static landscape also leaves each party short of a two - thirds majority , budget negotiations inevitably devolve into a Mexican standoff .
This dynamic can lead legislative fence - sitters ( usually pseudo - ­recalcitrant Republicans ) to become the state 's power brokers — a ritual that often deteriorates into a theater of the absurd , and causes consequential choices to be made carelessly and under pressure .
For example , Republican state senator Abel Maldonado of Santa Maria , one of the GOP 's few legitimate moderates , was able to use his standing as the swing vote on February 's tax increases to extract several massive concessions from fellow lawmakers — including the elimination of a planned increase in the state 's gas tax , and a ballot initiative to move California to a non-partisan primary system .
Since 1978 , state law has also required a two - thirds majority for any tax increase , so that both spending and taxing are very difficult undertakings for the legislature — turning each year 's budget negotiations into an epic battle among combatants whose hands are tied behind their backs .
But these constraints have not resulted in strict limits on the growth of government .
On the contrary , state government spending has nearly doubled in just the past decade , while the state 's population has increased by about 10 % .
This has happened in part because an enormous portion of the state 's budget ( estimated between 65 and 85 % each year ) is determined without direct legislative input .
Popularly ratified ballot initiatives have mandated that about 40 % of the state 's annual budget be directed toward education .
The public has also authorized endless bond measures to support various public projects — amounting to $ 85 billion since just 2000 .
And the state 's lavish defined - benefit plan for public pensions will cost taxpayers $ 3.3 billion in fiscal year 2009 - 2010 alone .
Much of this emasculation of the legislature has been the result of California 's exceptional reliance on direct ballot initiatives and referenda to make policy , especially when it comes to fiscal measures .
Such forms of direct democracy have been part of California politics for nearly 100 years .
They have their roots in the state 's early 20th - century Progressive movement , and especially Governor Hiram Johnson , who would go on to be Theodore Roosevelt 's running mate on the Bull Moose presidential ticket of 1912 .
In his 1911 inaugural address , while speaking of California 's plebiscitary provisions , Johnson laid out the case for direct democracy in terms that sound like a slightly more erudite version of the Golden State 's modern - day talk radio hosts :
I commend to you the proposition that , after all , the initiative and the referendum depend on our confidence in the people and in their ability to govern .
The opponents of direct legislation and the recall , however they may phrase their opposition , in reality believe the people cannot be trusted .
On the other hand , those of us who espouse these measures do so because of our deep - rooted belief in popular government , and not only in the right of the people to govern , but in their ability to govern ; and this leads us logically to the belief that if the people have the right , the ability , and the intelligence to elect , they have as well the right , ability , and intelligence to reject or to recall .
But whatever the Progressives ' intentions or premises , the referendum system has badly distorted California politics and policy .
The two - thirds requirement for tax increases , for instance , is a result of 1978 's Proposition 13 ballot initiative , which also capped the state 's property taxes at 1 % of assessed value and ensured that the assessed value can't increase by more than 2 % per year .
In the three decades since Prop. 13 passed , it has saved California taxpayers more than half a trillion dollars .
But its limitations on property - tax revenues have also led the state to rely far more on income and sales taxes .
And with the state 's steeply progressive tax code leaving it heavily dependent on the capital gains of California 's wealthiest citizens , bear markets inevitably lead to disproportionately sharp downturns in state revenue .
The legislature then finds itself unable to stanch the financial bleeding through tax policy , since it is constrained by the two - thirds rule .
At the same time that it has limited the state 's capacity to raise taxes , direct democracy has aggravated California 's fiscal incontinence .
In 1988 , for instance , voters approved Proposition 98 , guaranteeing that about 40 % of every year 's budget would be dedicated to K - 12 and community - college spending , thus severely restricting the legislature 's freedom of action .
( The mandate could be overridden only with the ever - ­elusive two - thirds majority of the legislature . )
By pre-ordaining appropriations , the move also undermined much of the impetus for increasing the cost - effectiveness of California schools , hastening the decline of the state 's education system into one of the nation 's worst , even as it drove up spending .
Two years after Prop. 98 , voters compounded the problem by passing Proposition 111 , effectively eviscerating a requirement known as the " Gann Limit , " which had imposed a spending cap on state government subject to adjustments for inflation and population growth .
The proposition was a bit of a bait - and - switch , focusing primarily on a gas - tax increase that was sold as a panacea for California 's notorious traffic woes .
But with the changes to the Gann Limit buried deep in Prop .
111's fine print , the measure passed — and meaningful fiscal restraints were removed .
Spending subsequently exploded , and governors Gray Davis and Arnold Schwarzenegger each oversaw increases in the state 's general fund of more than 30 % .
Beyond confounding the budget , the referendum system also often falls prey to exactly the oligarchic interests its Progressive creators were trying to counter .
Rather than vehicles for grassroots rage , many of the initiatives that make it to the ballot are the pet projects of a handful of wealthy donors or interest groups .
In 2006 , for example , Los Angeles real - estate heir and environmentalist Steve Bing single - handedly dumped nearly $ 50 million into Proposition 87 , an initiative to levy $ 4 billion in taxes on California oil producers .
That same year , actor / director Rob Reiner plowed nearly $ 3 million of his own money into a measure that would have raised state income taxes to fund universal pre-school .
And in 2008 , Orange County tech billionaire Henry Nicholas spent nearly $ 5 million bankrolling Proposition 9 , a measure that expanded victims ' rights under California criminal law .
In the end , both Bing 's and Reiner 's initiatives went down to defeat , while Nicholas 's passed with nearly 54 % of the vote .
But regardless of their outcomes , these endeavors bear witness to the fact that the referendum system is just as often a means for the powerful to circumvent the system as it is for the people to have their voices heard .
Such initiatives , referenda , and recall measures also tend to create a sense of permanent revolution in California politics .
No issue is settled for long ; no approach to public policy is given much of a chance to predominate ; and elected officials are left less , not more , accountable as their ability to control the levers of state power is substantially reduced .
In practice , all of this has meant that California politics has given expression to the public 's contradictory political impulses .
Liberals have won their campaign for bigger government and runaway spending , and conservatives have usually succeeded in keeping tax hikes at bay .
The Golden State 's signature optimism may be to blame :
How else to explain the delusion that Californians could be taxed like libertarians , but subsidized like socialists ?
The result , of course , has been a fiscal crisis addressed with slashed spending on public services and increased taxes in the midst of a deep recession — a recipe for yet more discord and trouble .
In a grim irony , Californians are now being taxed like socialists and subsidized like libertarians .
For all of these institutional obstacles to competent governance , however , California 's political leaders are hardly innocent bystanders in their state 's fall from grace .
For decades , even as they have been well aware of the state 's fiscal woes , governors and legislators have indulged key interest groups at the expense of California 's financial future .
LABOR PAINS
The most egregiously coddled of the state 's favored constituencies are California 's public labor unions .
This is partly the result of their bloated ranks :
The percentage of unionized public employees in California is 20 % higher than the national average .
Even more important , though , is the unions ' outsized influence .
Awarded collective bargaining rights with nearly every sector of government during the 1960s and ' 70s , the unions subsequently exploded into a political force to be reckoned with and a primary cause of California 's fiscal hemophilia .
Perhaps the most vexing labor organizations are the teachers ' unions .
These groups were the driving force behind Proposition 98 , locking in mandatory spending on public education without regard to any other fiscal considerations .
But that 's only where their transgressions begin .
In 1992 , the California Teachers ' Association — by far the most powerful teachers ' union in the state — blocked a ballot initiative to promote school choice in the Golden State by physically intimidating petition - signers and allegedly placing false names on the petitions .
When asked about his union 's opposition to the measure , the CTA president responded : " There are some proposals that are so evil that they should never even be presented to the voters . "
And in 2000 , when testing results revealed that two - thirds of Los Angeles public schools were ranked as failures , the president of the United Teachers of Los Angeles announced that his union would accept a proposal for merit pay only on " a cold day in hell . "
The result of the teachers ' flight from responsibility has been unadulterated dysfunction .
In Los Angeles schools , one out of every three students drops out before graduation .
And a research team from the University of California , Riverside , recently concluded that by 2014 — the year all students are required to be proficient in math and English under No Child Left Behind — nearly every elementary school in the state will fail to meet proficiency standards .
Yet despite the atrocious performance of California educators , it is nearly impossible to fire an incompetent teacher ( the percentage of California teachers terminated after three or more years in the classroom is just 0.03 % ) .
For example , in a May exposé on the Los Angeles Unified School District , Los Angeles Times reporter Jason Song revealed : " The district wanted to fire a high school teacher who kept a stash of pornography , marijuana and vials with cocaine residue at school , but a commission balked , suggesting that firing was too harsh .
L.A. Unified officials were also unsuccessful in firing a male middle school teacher spotted lying on top of a female colleague in the metal shop , saying the district did not prove that the two were having sex . "
But no matter how egregious their misconduct , California 's public - school teachers can always skirt the consequences .
With 340,000 members statewide , the California Teachers ' Association is perhaps the most powerful interest group in state politics .
In 2005 , for instance , the organization spent nearly $ 60 million to defeat ballot measures aimed at bringing more accountability to California schools .
And when budget agreements get hashed out in meetings of the state 's notorious " big five " ( the governor and the four legislative party leaders ) , the CTA is treated like an unnamed sixth party to the talks .
It 's no wonder , then , that despite having some of America 's lowest - performing schools , California 's teachers are the highest paid in the nation .
A far less visible but equally nefarious force is the California Correctional Peace Officers Association , the state 's prison - guard union .
With 33,000 members who wield extraordinary political clout , the Golden State 's prison guards are also the best paid in the nation ( many earn more than $ 100,000 a year ) .
Owing to their tremendous financial support for Gray Davis , the prison guards managed in 2002 to secure the then - governor 's approval of a contract that gave them a whopping 37 % raise and increased their already considerable retirement benefits .
As a result , California 's prison guards have become the state 's largest personnel expense , creating a situation in which the government 's cost to house each prisoner is an astounding $ 45,000 per year .
And there is no way to understand California 's fiscal catastrophe without first acknowledging the key role that union benefits have played .
In 1999 , the state legislature passed a financially reckless plan allowing the state 's public - safety workers to retire with a pension equal to 90 % of their salaries if they had served at least 30 years .
This move led to a spate of " pension spiking , " wherein public employees received dramatic pay increases in their last few years of service in order to feather their nests in retirement .
With unused sick leave and vacation time also included in the benefit calculus , the state 's obligations have multiplied at a dizzying rate .
As a result , more than 5,000 former state employees now enjoy taxpayer - supported retirement packages of more than $ 100,000 per year .
GREEN AND BLUE
Even as union pressures have brought absurd concessions and excessive spending , California 's leaders have also engaged in shameless preening on environmental issues — sapping the state 's economic strength , undermining growth , and drying up desperately needed sources of revenue .
The last several decades have seen the emergence of no -growth ­environmentalism in California — advanced by activists intent on restraining economic development , and championed by politicians eager to appear enlightened .
Admittedly , this impulse has legitimate origins in the state 's unique character :
After all , millions have chosen to make California their home precisely because of its abundant natural beauty , and it is easy to see why they would want to preserve it .
But today 's environmentalism is a long way from old - fashioned conservation .
The mindset that began with John Muir 's efforts to turn Yosemite into a national park has devolved into a reflexive urge to impede the gears of commerce at every turn .
Perhaps no organ of California government is as emblematic of this overreach as the California Coastal Commission .
Created through a 1972 ballot initiative , the commission 's mandate is to regulate development of the state 's coastline ( defined so capaciously that it sometimes includes territory up to five miles inland ) .
But however well intentioned coastal protection may seem in theory , in practice it has created a culture of corruption and outright bullying .
For years , the CCC regularly threatened to deny permits to property owners along California 's coastline unless they ceded parts of their land for government use .
When one Ventura County family refused to go along with the scheme in the mid-1980s , the case eventually found its way to the Supreme Court ; in a 5 - 4 decision , the court ruled against the CCC , with Justice Antonin Scalia declaring the commission 's practices " an out - and - out plan of extortion . "
The controversies kept on coming .
In the 1990s , a massive scandal erupted when it was revealed that bribes were often the only way to win commission approval .
And in 2001 , a Sacramento Superior Court judge ruled that the commission 's ability to simultaneously carry out legislative , executive , and judicial functions on local land - use issues was patently unconstitutional .
In his ruling , Judge Charles Kobayashi stated : " Purportedly an executive agency , the Commission is answerable to no one in the Executive ... [ nor is it ] directly answerable to the voters . "
Ironically , direct democracy had unleashed a government institution abusive of and wholly unaccountable to the people .
Beyond empowering would - be potentates , environmental fetishes have also placed an enormous burden on California 's economy .
A fascination with " smart growth " — typically a euphemism for privileging elite ( and dense ) urbanism over suburban development — has radically restricted the ability to build new housing units in the state .
This has created huge and unsustainable bubbles that price the middle class out of the housing market , and inevitably lead to dramatic crashes .
What 's worse , the problems only compound over time :
As the Cato Institute 's Randall O'Toole has pointed out , median California housing prices were twice median family incomes in 1960 , four times in 1980 , five times in 1990 , and eight times in 2006 .
As a result , nine of the ten housing markets hit hardest by the recent downturn were in California .
Meanwhile , high - growth markets with low regulation ( such as Houston ) have weathered the housing crisis essentially intact .
The environmental movement 's failure to acknowledge the exigencies of a state with more than 36 million people has also crippled California 's ability to develop infrastructure and tap vital resources .
Ignoring the state 's decentralized population and native car culture , greens have pined after quixotic public transportation projects like high - speed rail ( which received nearly $ 10 billion on last fall 's ballot ) , while doing nothing to address the fact that more than 80 % of the state 's urban interstates are congested .
In California 's Central Valley , one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world , farmers have lost access to more than 150 billion gallons of water because of environmentalist efforts to protect a local species of bait fish — efforts that are estimated to have taken as much as 85,000 acres of farmland out of production .
And in a state that is estimated to have 10.5 billion barrels of untapped oil reserves off its coast — enough to replace all of California 's oil imports for 30 years — new offshore drilling leases have n't been issued in four decades .
Finally , there 's California 's fevered response to global warming , the perfect issue for a state that prides itself on elegant alarmism .
In 2006 , the Golden State passed the Global Warming Solutions Act , essentially a statewide ratification of the Kyoto Protocol .
Under this regime , California will have to lower its greenhouse - gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 .
With the state expected to add 15 million net new residents in that 30 - year period , California is unlikely to meet its reduction targets without massive economic regression .
Estimates of the plan 's eventual costs to California families have been as high as $ 3,800 a year .
Yet California 's politicians continue to insist that the Solutions
Act will be an economic boon , sparking a revolution in " green jobs . "
Such is the fate of Californians : to live in a state where environmentalism is a religion and economics a superstition .
THE PEOPLE'S GOVERNOR
This combination of political dereliction , fiscal recklessness , and ideologically driven mismanagement was bound to eventually force a crisis .
California experienced something of a preview of the inevitable breakdown early in this decade , as the bursting of the tech bubble sent state finances into a tailspin , and left its political leadership looking powerless and inept .
The result , in true California fashion , was an exercise in direct democracy : the first recall of a sitting governor in the state 's history .
The public removed the hapless Gray Davis and sought bold leadership that might break the logjam and address the state 's systemic dysfunction .
Arnold Schwarzenegger , an actor - turned - politician with a knack for bold gestures , seemed to embody popular discontent with California politics — but has instead turned out to be the poster boy for its failings .
With the gusto that is perhaps his only consistent trait , ­Schwarzenegger ( for whom this author briefly worked in 2006 ) swept into Sacramento as an outsider who would be immune to the influence of moneyed interests , pledging to " blow up the boxes " of state government .
In his first few months , he capitalized on the populist wave that had secured his election , repealing a nearly $ 4 billion increase in the state 's car tax and putting a halt to the issuance of driver 's licenses to illegal immigrants .
He also spearheaded an overhaul of California 's workers ' compensation system ( previously the nation 's most expensive ) , earning strong support from the state 's business community .
But this reformist zeal would prove fleeting .
Despite his Austrian heritage , Schwarzenegger is fond of portraying himself as a quintessential Californian — and to the extent that he is an immigrant with a post - modern Horatio Alger biography , he is right .
But it is the way in which he embodies the spirit of the Golden State that has made Schwarzenegger the wrong leader for this moment in California 's history .
California is a state of fads and trends — often starting them , and just as often following them long after the rest of the nation has moved on .
And it is this California that Schwarzenegger has embodied .
His sensitivity to the public pulse made him seem the perfect man for the moment in the 2003 uprising ; he appeared impeccably attuned to the popular zeitgeist , firing up crowds to the tune of " We 're Not Gonna Take It " and even demolishing a car with a wrecking ball at one campaign rally to emphasize his opposition to Davis 's car - tax increase .
For his first two years in office , Schwarzenegger lived up to the hype he had generated on the campaign trail .
But in the fall of 2005 , he met his Waterloo .
Dubbing it a " year of reform , " Schwarzenegger called for a special election focused on four ballot initiatives that he claimed were necessary to clean up state government : Proposition 74 , lengthening the period necessary for teachers to get tenure and making it easier to fire underperforming educators ; Proposition 75 , requiring public - employee unions to receive explicit consent from members before using their dues for political purposes ; Proposition 76 , imposing limits on state spending ; and Proposition 77 , creating an independent panel to redraw the state 's electoral districts .
Each measure was laudable and would have profoundly reshaped the state 's future .
And each was handed a resounding defeat .
Being a man of the moment turns out to have its disadvantages when the moment turns on you .
For an executive who had styled himself " The People 's Governor , " the psychic trauma of being decisively rejected at the ballot box proved overwhelming .
Had Schwarzenegger taken a deep breath , he might have noted that his failure had been primarily tactical in nature .
However worthy his reform agenda may have been , creating a political atmosphere that united all of California 's powerful special - interest groups — especially the state 's public - sector unions — was a recipe for disaster .
But Schwarzenegger made matters worse by hyperventilating in the wake of his embarrassing defeat .
The man who had once slammed his opponents as " girlie men " took to the stage of the Beverly Hilton on election night and declared , " The people of California are sick and tired of all the fighting . "
It was about as bizarre as political transformations get .
Almost exactly two years to the day after his inauguration , the governor of America 's largest state was presiding over the public execution of his own mandate .
Desperate to remain relevant , and eyeing a 2006 re-election ­campaign , Schwarzenegger proceeded to undergo one of the most dramatic political makeovers in American history .
The hard - charging reformist morphed into an enlightened " post - partisan , " emphasizing accommodation over confrontation .
He brought in a veteran Democratic operative , Susan Kennedy , as his chief of staff .
And he began marshaling his political capital in the service of nationally fashionable issues like greenhouse - gas reductions , universal health care , and embryonic - stem - cell research .
Regardless of one 's stance on these issues , it began to feel suspiciously like Schwarzenegger was concerned more with buttering up the national media and the Beverly Hills cocktail circuit than actually forging an agenda to pull California back from the abyss .
Eventually this would lead to a near - complete break with California 's Republican base ( whose stamp of approval Schwarzenegger never had to obtain , because the recall election did not involve party primaries ) , culminating in the governor 's endorsement of the huge February 2009 tax increases .
Now , in the waning days of his administration , Schwarzenegger seems to be flirting with reviving his reformist image .
After the package of ballot initiatives he supported in May 's special election ( which included an extension of the recently - enacted tax hikes ) was ­overwhelmingly defeated , he forced the legislature to make up the remaining $ 26 billion deficit without further tax increases .
He has started targeting waste and fraud , ordering the state to sell off 15 % of its auto fleet , much of which has been used for the personal needs of state employees .
And he has begun efforts to reform California 's bloated welfare system ( the Golden State has 12 % of the nation 's population , but 30 % of the country 's welfare recipients ) by capping eligibility and enforcing federal work requirements .
But to Californians overwhelmed by the collapse of state finances and the prospect of sharp cuts in services , it all seems like too little , too late .
Schwarzenegger 's fundamental flaw is that his governing style has rarely consisted of anything more than acting as a lagging indicator of public opinion ; in a state already beset by the consequences of direct democracy , the " Governator " has simply proven too weak .
Given the overwhelming good will that met him when he took office , it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the nation 's most famous governor squandered a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity .
When he leaves office in early 2011 , his list of accomplishments will place him somewhere near the historical median of California 's governors ( correction appended ) .
And , in a fitting commentary on the state he has led , Schwarzenegger will be most famous for having been famous .
California still faces the same challenges it did when he took office — only now , the passage of time and the recent recession have made them all more acute .
CALIFORNIA'S CHOICE
As Californians contemplate next year 's gubernatorial race , it is increasingly clear that the state is at a crossroads .
One path before it , essentially an extension of the status quo , would mean continued decline in the fashion of states like New Jersey or Michigan .
The other path would be to pursue a bold reformist agenda , along the lines of what Rudy Giuliani accomplished during his time as mayor of New York City .
Without a sharp turn toward freer markets , a smaller public sector , and more responsive and responsible government , California may not be able to save itself from catastrophe .
But whether that charge will be led — and by whom — remains an open question .
The good news is that the chaos of the moment has generated a boom in public - policy entrepreneurship .
So far , however , it appears that most of the ideas gaining traction would compound , rather than alleviate , California 's problems .
Calls for a constitutional convention are growing , but most would - be framers seem intent only on eliminating the two - thirds requirement for budget passage and tax increases — which , without additional reforms , would just further enable the state 's profligate ways .
Electoral reform is also in the air .
Governor Schwarzenegger finally realized his dream of independent panels to oversee redistricting with the passage of Proposition 11 last year , and Abel Maldonado 's non-­partisan primary proposal will be on the 2010 ballot .
But it is far from certain that these efforts , aimed to boost California moderates , will be a net benefit to the state .
Though the media and sympathetic politicians like to suggest that only sensible centrism can pull the state out of its doldrums , it is California 's centrists who have been most culpable in creating an environment in which the state never says no to a spending increase or yes to a tax hike .
By portraying every hard choice as a false choice , they only further the state 's political culture of delusion .
One of the lessons of California 's troubles is that letting the center govern is no panacea .
But another lesson of the state 's hard times is that someone has to govern .
To right its course , California will need to both limit the excess of its legislature and empower it to make crucial governing decisions — ­especially about taxing and spending .
The state 's overfed interest groups must be brought down to size , but its over - reliance on direct democracy also needs to be tempered .
Leading California out of the mire will require a leader inclined to pro-growth economics and reformist politics , who will take on not only the state 's fiscal mismanagement but also its governing sclerosis .
Such a leader must also have the popular touch required to convince California voters — whose approval at the ballot box will be needed to make any meaningful changes to the state 's problematic governing institutions — to finally accept the difficult responsibilities of self - government .
Whether the disquiet of the moment is profound enough to rouse Californians into seeking such a leader remains to be seen .
It is also unclear if there is any such leader to be found .
While the current stable of Republican candidates for the 2010 gubernatorial election — led by Silicon Valley billionaires Meg Whitman and Steve Poizner — are all bright , accomplished , and talented , whether any of them is up to the enormous political challenge of taming the nation 's most dysfunctional state government is still a matter of conjecture .
What is increasingly clear , however , is that the Golden State 's troubles offer a warning to the rest of the country .
If America continues its long tradition of following trends begun in California , it will be brought to grief .
And the state 's recent history bears directly on some ongoing national political debates .
There is little in President Obama 's legislative agenda that has n't already been tried in California .
Need a model of runaway spending with no regard for growing debt ?
Look to California , whose bonds currently hover just above junk status .
Want to insist on restrictive carbon - emission controls ?
Note the example of California 's 2006 greenhouse - gas law , which is expected to reduce the state 's economic output by 10 % and destroy 1.1 million jobs .
Want to put the government in charge of health care ?
Look at California 's repeated legislative pushes for a single - payer system of health - insurance coverage , each of which ended in failure .
We will learn over the next decade whether California can manage to avoid disaster one more time .
But even if the state 's years of living large finally catch up with it , there is still an escape hatch : Sensible Californians can continue to flee to places like Arizona , Nevada , Colorado , Oregon , and Texas , where the respite from hostile government more than compensates for the social opprobrium that tends to meet California expatriates .
But if the nation as a whole repeats California 's mistakes , the consequences will be much more severe ; an America beset by rigid bureaucracies , economic decline , and enervated spirit will not be able to preserve liberty at home or protect it abroad .
Before we head down that path , we should look west to see how these ideas have fared — and absorb the lessons of how the Golden State lost its luster .

The MESSENGER spacecraft went into safe mode just before its closest approach of Mercury on Sept. 29 .
Although the instruments were taking data as the spacecraft came near the planet during this third flyby of the mission , after going into safe mode , no further data or pictures were obtained .
This means the expected science investigations from the flyby were not executed .
However , as Emily Lakdawalla pointed on in the Planetary Blog , the most important purpose of this flyby was the last gravity assist that will allow MESSENGER to enter orbit in 2011 , and to that end , the flyby was a complete success .
Additionally , the images taken during the approach are of the 5 % of Mercury that was previously unseen , as in the image above of this unnamed basin .
See more images from the approach below .
MESSENGER skimmed just 142 miles ( 228 km ) above Mercury at closest approach , and then whipped behind the planet for the gravity assist .
During the operation , five MESSENGER “ fellows ” or master teachers were reporting the flyby live via Twitter .
Gene Gordon ( Porchdragon on Twitter ) reported that unexpectedly , the signal dropped from MESSENGER before the expected signal blackout while flying on the other side of Mercury : “ Suddenly room got quiet and people hovering near computers .
Unexpected signal drop just occurred .
Sense of nervousness seems to have happened . ”
Read Gene Gordon ’s blog post about his experiences .
The MESSENGER team had to wait over 50 minutes until the spacecraft emerged from behind Mercury , and were relieved to be able to resume contact .
As of Wednesday morning , the spacecraft was operating normally , and the reason for the signal drop was unclear .
At a briefing , MESSENGER team members said the spacecraft went into safe mode when it entered Mercury ’s shadow and tried to switch to battery power .
The team is still looking into why this anomaly occurred .
A little less than half of the ” extra ” science goals for the flyby were accomplished .
See our previous article on the science goals for the flyby .
Following this flyby .
only the polar regions of Mercury have never been seen .
MESSENGER made its closest approach on Tuesday at about 5:55 p.m. EDT ( 2155 GMT ) , zooming at speeds of about 12,000 mph ( 19,312 kph ) .
Mercury ’s gravity was expected to slow MESSENGER by about 6,000 mph ( 9,656 kph ) during the flyby and place it on track to enter orbit of Mercury in March 2011 .
See all the images acquired by the third flyby here .

The outer diameter of the basin is approximately 260 kilometers ( 160 miles ) .
This basin has a double - ring structure common to basins with diameters larger than 200 kilometers ( about 125 miles ) .

In the cover story for Spin last month , Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo talked about how he was going to invite his fans to bring instruments to the shows on the band ’s Hootenanny Tour .
I had thought he was full of shit ; saying that was just a good way to get fans interested in the tour .
Apparently , he was n’t kidding at all .
On a recent stop in Portland , the band ( sans drummer Patrick Wilson ) played Radiohead ’s “ Creep ” with a crowd full of guitarists , drummers , and clarinetists ( WTF ?
Who would want to be caught in public with one of those things ? ) .
Cuomo does n’t sing however , he leaves that up to the crowd and bassist Scott Shriner .

There is " no danger " of mass power cuts in the UK during the next decade , Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has said .
He told the BBC it was possible to meet the country 's energy needs while using more " sustainable " sources such as wind farms and nuclear stations .
Last week the government 's new energy adviser warned that the UK could face blackouts by 2016 as green energy is coming on stream too slowly .
But Mr Miliband said building projects would be completed in time .
Cambridge University researcher David MacKay , who takes up his post as adviser at the Department of Energy on 1 October , has warned that the public will keep objecting to facilities such as wind farms and nuclear power stations being constructed near their homes .
New stations
As older coal - powered stations close , he argues , this will create a shortfall in energy which could lead to widespread blackouts by 2016 .
But Mr Miliband told BBC One 's Andrew Marr Show : " There 's no danger of power cuts in the next decade . "
He added : " The question is do we meet our own energy security needs in a high - carbon way or do we do it in with renewable energy ? "
Mr Miliband said power stations were closing but that new ones capable of producing 10 gigawatts - enough to power 10 million homes - were being built .
Stations with the same capacity again had planning consent , he added .
He said " about 75 % " of the population supported wind farms and that building the next generation of nuclear plants would begin by the end of 2017 .
The Conservatives say the government has been complacent over energy security and that ministers have dithered over policy .
ちょっと時間ができたので、 Google App Engine ( GAE ) 上で JRuby を動かしてみよう。 前に読んだ情報だと、 GAE 上で JRuby を動かすためには JRuby をコンパイルしたり WAR に固めてアップロードしたりと、かなり面倒な印象があった。 でも今は、ビックリするくらいカンタンに動かすことができるようになっている。
GAE 上で Java を動かすよりお手軽なんじゃないかな 。
とりあえずのゴールは、ちょっと前に作ったSinatra と OAuth を使って Twitter のタイムラインを取得を動かすところまで。 所要時間 は10分で 。
GAE のアカウント取 得 ( 2 分 )
Google App Engineのサイトで、 GAE のアカウントを取得する。 すでに Google アカウントを持っていれば、携帯メールのアドレスで認証するだけ。 携帯を持っていない人はどうしているんだろう…。 アカウントが取得できれば、 Python 版も Java 版も使えるようになっている。 前は Java 版は 先 着10,000様のみって書いてあったけど、今は特に申請不要みたい。
アプリケーション id の登録 ( 1分 )
Create an Application で新たにアプリケーション id を登録する。 ここで登録した id が *.appspot.com のサブドメイン名になる。 今回はテストなので machu - jruby とした。
現時点では合 計10 個までのアプリケーション id が登録できる。 一度登録した id は削除できないみたいなので、慎重に 。
《 参考 》 Java サンプルの動 作 ( 2 分 )
GAE / JRuby を動かすためにこの手順は不要なんだけど、参考までに。 興味がなければ読み飛ばしてもらって OK 。 まず、ローカル環境の JDK のバージョンを確認する。 環境は Mac OS X 10.6 ( Snow Leopard ) 。
$ java - version java version " 1.6.0_15 " Java( TM ) SE Runtime Environment ( build 1.6.0_15-b03-219 ) Java HotSpot ( TM ) 64 - Bit Server VM ( build 14.1 - b02-90 , mixed mode ) $ javac - version javac 1.6.0_15
次に、 Google App Engine SDK for Java をダウンロードして、サンプルを動かしてみる。
$ unzip appengine - java - sdk - 1.2.2.zip $ cd appengine - java - sdk - 1.2.2 $ bin/dev_appserver.sh demos/guestbook/war
これでローカルのポート 8080 に、ゲストブックのサンプルが起動する。 demos / guestbook / war にはコンパイル済みの class ファイルが生成されているけど、自分でアプリを作る場合には当然コンパイルしておかなければいけない。
アプリケーションの GAE へのアップロードは試していないけど、アプリケーションのアップロード
- Google App Engineの手順を参考にして、 appengine - web.xml を作成し ( さっき取得したアプリケーションidを書く ) 、「bin/appcfg.sh update demos/guestbook/war」を実行すればよさそう。
実際にはコマンドラインで頑張るよりも、 Google Plugin for Eclipse を使って Eclipse 上で開発することになると思う 。
GAE / JRuby を動か す ( 2 分 )
GAE / J の概要が分かったところで、いよいよ GAE / JRuby を動かす。 基本的な手順は 、appengine - jrubyで簡 単GAE / JRuby開発 - しばそんノートのとおり。
少し前のエントリで 、GAE/JRuby上でRackアプリを動かす手順を書きました。 このときの手順は 、Java SDKをインストールして、GAE
SDKをダウンロードして、jruby-complete.jarをコンパイルして…と、やや煩雑なものでした。この当時はおそらくこれが一般的な手法だったのではないかと思います。
しかし、今や時代は変わりました。今GAE/JRubyでRackアプリを作るのに必要な作業は、たったひとつのgemのインストールだけです。
その gem とは、appengine - jruby 。 普段使っている ruby の環境 ( JRubyではな くCRuby ) で、 google - appengine をインストールする 。
$ sudo gem install google - appengine
準備はこれだけ。 Java の時にダウンロードしていた Google App Engine SDK も、この gem を入れれば自動的にダウンロードされる 。
まずは appengine - jruby の GettingStarted に書かれている Hello World アプリを作る。 と言っても、以下の内容で config .ru を作るだけ 。
require ' appengine -rack ' AppEngine::Rack.configure_app( : application => " application - id " , :version => 1 ) run lambda { Rack :: Response.new ( " Hello World ! " ) }
config.ru は Rack の設定ファイル。普通 の
Rack と違うのは、 appengine - rack を呼んでいることと 、
AppEngine:: Rack.configure_app で GAE 用の設定をしていることだけ。この設定は、 Java 版の appengine - web.xml 相当かな。 " application - id " は、最初に取得したアプリケーション id に書き換えること 。
dev_appserver.rb コマンドを使ってサンプルを起動する。
Java 版と同じようにポート 8080 で立ち上がる 。
$ dev_appserver.rb .
appcfg.rb で GAE にアップロードする 。
$ appcfg.rb update .
これらのコマンドも、 Java 版の dev_appserver.sh と appcfg.sh にあわせているっぽい。 コンパイルが不要なので 、Java版よりお手軽。
GAE で Sinatra を動か す ( 2 分 )
ここまでで GAE / JRuby 上で Rack が動いた。 次は Rack の上に Sinatra さんを載せてみる。 この手順も、さっきと同じで appengine - jruby で簡 単GAE / JRuby開発 - しばそんノート とappengine-jruby の GettingStarted を参考にした。
JRuby と
Rack は最初にインストールした google - appengine の gem パッケージに含まれているけど、 Sinatra は自分でインストールしなければいけない。 GAE にアップロードするときには Sinatra のパッケージも war に含めるので 、
/ opt/ local/lib/ruby/gems ではなく、これから作成するアプリと同じディレクトリにインストールする必要がある。 gem パッケージのインストールには、 appcfg.rb gem コマンドを使う 。
appcfg.rb gem install sinatra
コマンドを実行すると、カレントに .gems ディレクトリが生成される。 パッケージは、この . gems ディレクトリに展開される。 逆に言うと、 . gems ディレクトリにインストールされていない追加パッケージは、
GAE にアップロードしたときに見えなくなる。
あとは、適当に Sinatra アプリを生成し、 config.ru を書き換えるだけ。普通に Sinatra を動かすのと変わらない 。
GAE / JRuby で Sinatra + OAuth を動か す ( 5 分 )
ただの Hello World アプリを起動するだけでは、 GAE を使っている特徴が見えてこない。 そこで、前に作った Sinatra と OAuth を使って Twitter のタイムラインを取得するアプリを動かしてみる。 GAE だとローカルファイルへ の IO や Fetch 以外での外部通信が禁じられているので、この辺が修正箇所になるかな。
まずは、 appcfg.rb コマンドを使って Sinatra に加えて oauth と twitter の gem をインストールする 。
$ appcfg.rb gem install oauth twitter
ローカルにてサーバを起動する。
$ dev_appserver.rb
予想どおり、 Consumer ( このアプリ ) から Service Provider ( twitter ) へ通信するところでエラーになる。
OAuth ライブラリ は
Net:: HTTP を使って外部と通信している。 以下 、OAuthコンシューマの仕組みと実装 〜 Ruby編 - しばそんノートより引用。
rb -gae - support は GAE が提供する機能を Ruby から簡単に使えるようにするためのライブラリ 。
Net:: HTTP 互換機能の他にも、 GAE が提供する認証機能を使うため の GAE :: User や、データを保存するための GAE :: Memcache がある。 という訳で、インストール 。
$ appcfg.rb gem install rb-gae - support
config.ru にてこのライブラリを require したら、今度はアプリのトップページからエラーになってしまった。 ここでさんざん悩んだんだけど、どうやらこの前に「 jruby-openssl」をインストールしていたことが原因だった。 rb-gae - support の README に、 jruby - openssl とは一緒に使えないよっていう記述がある 。
do not use jruby - openssl in your app engine application - it ’ll break it !.
It uses native code , which is not supported on app engine .
仕方がないので、 OpenSSL が提供する機能を使うのは諦めて、 jruby - openssl をインストールしたら動くようになった 。
最終的に、 config.ru は以下のようになった 。
require ' rubygems ' require ' appengine -rack ' require ' rb - gae- support ' require ' oauth - sample - gae ' AppEngine :: Rack.configure_app( :application => ' machu-jruby ' , :version => 1 ) run Sinatra : : Application
前に作ったローカル版の OAuth +
Sinatra アプリと GAE 対応版の差分は以下の通り。 ソースコードは Gist : 180755 に載せている。
--- /Users/machu/work/gisty/170131/oauth-sample.rb
2009-08-19 15:10:31.000000000 +0900 +++ oauth - sample - gae.rb 2009-09-04 09:14:50.000000000 +0900@@ - 9,7 +9,7 @@ end configure do - use Rack : : Session :: Cookie , : secret => Digest :: SHA1.hexdigest(rand.to_s ) + use Rack : : Session :: Cookie KEY = " twitter_consumer_key " SECRET = " twitter_consumer_secret " end
jruby - openssl ライブラリと rb - gae - support が競合しているため 、
Rack の : secret オプションが使えないのが大きな課題（つまり、セッションの中身をクライアントが自由に書き換えられる状態）。 まぁ、 GAE を使うのなら、 GAE 側にセッション情報を持たせる方向がいいよね。
次の一歩 ( Priceless )
GAE を使うならデータストアは避けて通れない。 これも以前なら Java の API を叩いていたみたいだけど、今なら appengine - jruby ライブラリから呼び出す方が楽みたい。 DatastoreOverview を一読するのがよさそう。 以下のようなサンプルコードが書かれている 。
require ' appengine-apis/datastore ' e = AppEngine :: Datastore :: Entity.new ( ' Employee ' ) e[ : name ] = ' Fred ' e[:role ] = ' Manager ' e[' hire_date ' ] = Time.now AppEngine::Datastore.put e
続きは以下の日記にて。
参考
まとめ
appengine - jruby を使うことで、お手軽に GAE / JRuby を試す環境が作れるようになっている。オススメ！
Rack ベースが基本 。 Rack 上で Sinatra も簡単に動く 。 Rails も動くらしい。 本格的なアプリを作ろうとすると無料のリソース枠では厳しいから、
Sinatra で作れるくらいの小さなアプリを作る場合の方が使えそう。
Java -> JRuby -> appengine - jruby と、複数レイヤの上なのでデバッグが大変そう。本格アプリなら
Java のほうがいい ？
GAE だと IO ( ローカルファイルの読み書き ) に制約。 rb-gae - support で
Net:: HTTP が使えるようになるが、 jruby - openssl が使えなくなる副作用。 その結果 、
Rack : : Session :: Cookie の : secret が指定できなくなるのは痛い。
10分って書いたのに14分かかってる。（もちろん、実際には試行錯誤しながら数時間かかってる）
Ruby は書けるけど Python を覚えるのはちょっと大変 。Java はコンパイルが面倒だし…という人には、いまが GAE で遊んでみるちょうどいいタイミングだと思う。

ACORN ( Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ) is once again in the news , with some of its " tax counselors " being videotaped giving advice on tax evasion to two people posing as a pimp and a hooker and looking for a government - subsidized loan for a brothel .
The two imposters also told the ACORN " counselors " that they intended to bring dozens of teenage girls into the country illegally from Central America to " work " in the brothel .
On the videotape the counselors happily advised them on how to go about doing this without the legal authorities finding out about it .
They seemed quite knowledgeable and experienced in such matters .
The organization is also being investigated by government authorities for allegedly perpetrating vote fraud , among other possible crimes .
( Recall that ACORN is the organization that Barack Obama attached himself to after earning his Harvard law degree .
During the presidential campaign his main claim to having the experience that would qualify him to be president was his " community organizing " experience while working for ACORN ) .
ACORN may be found guilty of the relatively petty crimes it is now being accused of , but there is a much larger issue that is being ignored .
Over the past thirty years or so , ACORN has been a major player in what can be described as a legalized extortion racket administered by the Federal Reserve and the Comptroller of the Currency , among other federal government agencies .
The racket started with Jimmy Carter ’s 1977 Community Reinvestment Act ( CRA ) , which empowered " community groups " like ACORN to effectively extort billions ( yes , billions with a " b " ) of dollars from banks .
Much of the money is then used for ACORN ’s political activities , which involve the mass registration of Democratic Party voters ; supporting left - wing political candidates at all levels of government ; organizing rallies , protests , and lobbying efforts for various planks of its " People ’s Platform , " which is essentially the same as the Socialist Party Platform of 1922 .
The " People ’s Platform " once promised , " We will continue our fight until the American way is just one way , until we have shared the wealth . . . "
Accordingly , the organization has advocated the government takeover of the energy and healthcare industries , punishing taxation , massive income redistribution , pervasive price controls , and just about every asinine socialistic policy that one can think of .
Hamiltonu2019s Curse : ... Thomas DiLorenzo Best Price : $ 1.35 ( as of 11:00 EST - Details )
The Federal Reserve Board has been ACORN ’s " partner " in this endeavor ever since 1977 , when the Fed was given responsibility ( along with the Comptroller of the Currency ) for enforcing the CRA .
For those who are not yet familiar with the CRA , which was significantly strengthened during the Clinton administration , it works like this :
The ostensible purpose of the Act is to get banks to make more mortgage loans in " minority and low - income " neighborhoods .
These loans have been defined by the government as " sub - prime " loans , implying that the borrowers have credit ratings just a tiny , tiny smidgen below the " prime " or highest - credit - rating borrowers .
This of course is a farce , as nearly everyone now knows .
The Fed keeps track of such loans , and gives each lender a CRA ranking .
A poor ranking can destroy a bank ’s plans for branch expansions , mergers , and other activities .
How Capitalism Saved A... Dilorenzo , Thomas J. Best Price : $ 2.18 Buy New $ 7.37 ( as of 12:45 EST - Details )
So - called " community groups " like ACORN , which is one of the biggest , are empowered by the law to " protest " proposed bank expansions or mergers .
This is the main " business " that ACORN has been in for the past thirty years .
They file a protest with the Fed , while demanding that the bank that is proposing the expansion or merger give it — ACORN — millions or sometimes billions of dollars , to be lent to sub - prime borrowers by ACORN , which keeps for itself some of the loot .
( WaMu bank , which is now defunct , once boasted of having made $ 375 billion in CRA loans ; the Fed gave Countrywide Bank an award after it made $ 600 billion in such loans .
It , too , was bankrupted by the loans . )
The CRA itself is based on a falsehood — that banks will systematically walk away from billions of dollars in profits that are just waiting to be picked up by someone in low - income and minority - dominated neighborhoods .
This argument is made by the same ACORN - style socialists ( like Barack Obama ) who argue that bankers are greedy , money - grubbing capitalist pigs .
In reality , business people do not have to be forced by the Fed to make money .
The fact that force or the threat of force is used by the Fed and its ACORN allies is proof that the loans that are being made are bad loans to unqualified borrowers .
During the Fed - induced housing bubble , thousands of CRA sub - prime loans for $ 300,000 — $ 400,000 houses were made to high school dropouts on welfare or in jobs paying barely more than minimum wage .
The Fed — and many other agencies of the federal government — was essentially telling these low - income and minority borrowers the following : " Yes , traditionally , people who own homes do so by working at a job , sticking with it , saving their money , and avoiding excessively extravagant spending on cars , vacations , etc. , until they can afford a home .
Forget about that !
The hell with financial responsibility !
We will fix things for you so that you can be fiscally irresponsible and get a home .
And the housing bubble inflation we have created will even potentially make you rich !
This way , we will share the wealth !
Just like the ACORN People ’s Platform says ! "
When Forbes magazine columnists Peter Brimelow and Leslie Spencer interrogated Boston Fed official Alicia Munnell about the Fed ’s claims of systemic lending discrimination in the early 1990s , Munnell was forced to admit that she had no evidence of it .
She and other Fed officials ( and the Clinton administration ) continued to step up CRA enforcement anyway .
This suggests that the goal has always been a forced redistribution of wealth through Fed banking regulation .
Charges of systemic discrimination have been used as a ruse to intimidate any un-cooperating mortgage lenders ( Not that stupid and self - destructive bankers who discriminate on the basis of race do not exist . )
In order to avoid having their business plans voided by the Fed , or being prosecuted for housing discrimination , mortgage lenders are forced to participate in what is essentially a legalized extortion racket .
But then again , what is government but just another criminal gang ?
( As Murray Rothbard used to say . )
The Best of Thomas DiLorenzo
James Tuton , CEO of automated ticketing scam vendor American Traffic Solutions , was booed by fellow “ Arizona Corporate Excellence ” attendees while receiving an award Thursday evening .
The gathering is organized by the Phoenix Business Journal and was held at the prestigious JW Marriott Resort in north Phoenix ( ironically , a city which just recently dumped ATS for crosstown - rival Redflex ) .
A CameraFRAUD reader was in attendance and provided the following account :
… hundreds of local business executives and employees of the top fifty private Arizona companies were recognized .
Once the audience realized who ATS was , about a quarter of those present actually started booing .
There was very little applause ; the situation was awkward .
Safety was only mentioned once during the five minute speech .
Tuton also bragged in front of the audience that ATS was adding cameras and contracts at a very fast pace .
The hundreds of executives ( voters ) in the audience acknowledged this with even more silence .
If only Kanye was around …

Some beetles play possum , and for the same reason that possums do : to avoid attention from predators .
A new study highlights the reason for the trick 's success — it works by sacrificing the neighbors .
Takahisa Miyatake of Okayama University in Japan has long studied the red flour beetle , Tribolium castaneum , and its spider predator , Adanson 's house jumper , Hasarius adansoni .
When a spider attacks , the beetle feigns death by entering a state known as tonic immobility , which often averts real death .
To figure out exactly why the tactic succeeds , Miyatake and three colleagues bred one beetle strain that feigns death for about twenty minutes and one that does n't do it at all .
Then they studied interactions between spiders and beetles of both strains .
Spiders prefer living prey , so they were less likely to devour beetles that feigned death after an attack , the researchers found .
That was especially true if alternative prey was available .
Spiders ate death - feigning beetles 38 percent of the time when the beetles were alone , but if the spider had a choice between a death - feigner and a nonfeigner , it bagged the nonfeigner almost every time .
The results were comparable when spiders had a choice of death - feigning red flour beetles and nonfeigning beetles of a different species .
The researchers conclude that tonically immobile beetles enjoy improved odds of survival , especially when in the company of more mobile compatriots .
The findings were detailed in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B .
Every day , gardeners across the world flush away a valuable and sustainable source of fertilizer for their plants -- urine .
Urine is a good source of nitrogen and other minerals and , providing it is used correctly , is completely safe .
Using urine as a fertilizer saves money , fossil fuels ( used extensively in the production of chemical fertilizers ) and water ( no need to flush ! ) .
It 's a standard of some organic gardens .
Using urine also cuts down on river pollution -- urine is a major source of nitrogen that contributes to river eutrophication if expensive denitrification is not used at the water treatment plant .
And it 's not a backwards step , it 's space age technology -- NASA has used urine in hydroponics systems !
It 's an average city street : buildings , buses , people with shopping bags .
Suddenly information bubbles pop up in your field of vision .

If Arnold Schwarzenegger 's Terminator had walked through , say , Bishop 's Stortford , this is the sort of information his computer - enhanced vision might have provided .
But " Terminator vision " is no longer just in the realm of science fiction films .
It 's called augmented reality and it is on its way to a smartphone near you .
Complete Terminator vision would require bionic contact lenses ... but from this month , anyone with an iPhone will be able to peer at the world through the phone 's camera and will see layered on their phone screen extra information about the physical things in front of them .
Phones with a phone that supports Google Android can already do this .
Virtual reality used to be technology 's Holy Grail .
It let you create new worlds where you can jack cars , date babes and win wars .
In contrast , augmented reality – in which computer graphics are layered onto a real world image – was the boring sub- technology confined to sports footage replays and technical engineering .
That 's what shows you the path of a tennis ball after a player has hit it , or demonstrates to an engineer how to piece a complex machine together by modelling it in 3D .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But with augmented reality about to be opened up to the mobile phone - owning masses , it has become an exciting field for development .
Developers are racing to find useful and interesting ways that computers can enhance our interaction with the real world .
And that could be by superimposing reviews on restaurants , directions on streets and Facebook profiles on people .
It could be trivial , it could be fascinating .
Perhaps the most useful application has n't been figured out yet .
The technology that has brought augmented reality to mobiles is called Layar .
As the name suggests , it layers computer information on top of " reality " as seen through the phone 's camera .
Layar uses the phone 's Global Positioning System ( GPS ) to work out where you are and what you are looking at .
Different types of information appear on different layers : there 's a sightseeing layer called Wikitude which contains tourist information about what 's around you – the posts are linked to specific buildings and points of interest ( the Tate Liverpool , the Belfast docks , Big Ben ) and pop up , like virtual blue plaques , as you pass by them .
There 's an estate agent layer which flags up properties for sale or rent : as you scan your camera down a street , available properties are highlighted .
Of course , a board outside a house would tell you as much , but the layer , called Trulia , will also tell you how much the house is going for , give you pictures of the inside and a phone number that you can ring to arrange a viewing .
You do n't only see things in your viewfinder – properties two streets away will show up too .
There 's a layer which tells you where the nearest council facilities are and plots them on an image of the street .
More interesting than the location of your local dump is information about your friends .
And that 's what applications like Brightkite offer – by bringing social networks into augmented reality .
Partnered with Layar , it offers an app which lets you see where your friends are on a real - time map .
Like the magic map in Harry Potter , they appear as moving dots .
Even more excitingly , you can create posts – pictures , messages , videos – and then anchor or " geo-tag " them to the places you made them .
They stick in that virtual space like graffiti or post - it notes and you can view them later .
You can see your friends ' posts or other peoples ' .
Say you 're in Trafalgar Square – by looking at Nelson 's Column with your phone 's camera , pictures of friends posing with it from three months ago will swim up and fix on your phone 's screen , and so will a tweet you wrote there last year .
Depending on what information you want , you can also call up reviews of nearby restaurants or of current plays showing down the road .
Gradually , layer upon layer of this virtual content will build up .
Some posts will be more interesting than others , but , like with the rest of the internet , we 'll get used to searching and filtering for what interests us .
Other applications of augmented reality lead us right back into Terminator territory : " There was a project , " says Dr David England , computer science lecturer at Liverpool John Moore University , " where people wearing visors and backpacks re-enacted a virtual Pacman outside , so they ran down the road shooting the enemy they could see in their visors , " he says , referring to the popular computer game .
" Human Pacman " took place in Singapore University , but similar though less - exciting experiments with augmented or mixed reality gaming have taken place around the world .
" The main problem is visor quality , " Dr England explains .
" When mass - produced visors improve , you 'll see a lot more of this kind of game . "
It 's called pervasive gaming and a group set up to explore it , IPerG ( Integrated Project on Pervasive Gaming ) describes it as " a radically new game form that extends gaming experiences out into the physical world " .
Which sounds dangerous .
However , Dr England says the risks are similar to driving when using a mobile phone : " Of course there will have to be basic common sense . "
He adds that AR can be put to much more co-operative and educative uses : letting people leave virtual treasure trails , or plant imaginary gardens together using the Facebook app Farmville , for example .
" You get more co-operative games in mixed reality , people in different places can come together and share tasks " .
He also mentions a mixed reality table that sketches science diagrams and can be used as a teaching tool .
There 's also a belt that can help its wearer avoid collisions in the dark by vibrating when it senses an approaching object .
Rob Hale – games designer and author of the Games Design Blog – thinks augmented reality gaming will be different from its virtual equivalent : " Getting hit by a car in reality hurts a lot more than it does in a videogame , " he says .
But he sees possibilities as well .
In sport for example : " AR could allow us to bring the best bits of video games to real - life sports such as feedback on your performance and positions of your team mates ...
If you were going for a run , you could bring up a display of your previous best times , heart rate and the locations of other joggers nearby . "
Slipping out of the gym and standing back to consider the philosophical implications of augmented reality , Japanese net culture expert Toshinao Sasaki has a few things to say .
He thinks that the boundaries between real and virtual , public and private will disintegrate further as augmented reality spreads .
" While the internet sphere and the reality sphere had previously been completely separate as ' virtual and non-virtual ' , mobile phones have rapidly shrunk the distance between them ...
Eventually , it seems possible that mobile phones might play the role of a kind of supplementary brain , " he told The Technological Innovation and Social Development Blog .
So perhaps augmented reality will make cyborgs of all of us , although we 'll have our prosthetic brains in our pockets rather than welded to our skulls , Schwarznegger - style .
Until the batteries run out at least .
And for the sake of our sanity , being able to tune out is going to be every bit as important as tuning in .
As Rob Hale wisely points out , " the most important thing about augmented reality will be the ability to turn it off . "
Augmented reality : How it can be used
Surgery : can be simplified by inserting extra information like labels onto the surgeon 's field of view .
Venue reviews : compare the price of beer in different pubs on the same street , and from just looking at a venue see menus , prices , reviews and real - time information about what 's on now .
Pre -recorded bursts of music from bands at gigs that are on later would start playing .
Person recognition : point your phone at a stranger and icons they 've selected bob up around their heads – last fm , Facebook – with links to their profiles .
Computer control : with AR embedded into visors or contact lenses and motion - sensitive cameras , we 'll be able to wave , flick or nod and control over a hundred simulated PC screens as projected into our eyes by computerised eyewear .
Curated walks : New York company Soundwalk " curate " walks that fuse treasure trails with interactive films and tourist info , feeding walkers with audio and visuals as you walk a variety of set paths .
Soundwalk claims it feels like being in a film .

What do abrupt changes in ocean circulation and Earth 's climate , shifts in wildlife populations and ecosystems , the global finance market and its system - wide crashes , and asthma attacks and epileptic seizures have in common ?
According to a paper published this week in the journal Nature , all share generic early - warning signals that indicate a critical threshold of change dead ahead .
In the paper , Martin Scheffer of Wageningen University in The Netherlands and co-authors , including William Brock and Stephen Carpenter of the University of Wisconsin at Madison and George Sugihara of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla , Calif. , found that similar symptoms occur in many systems as they approach a critical state of transition .
" It 's increasingly clear that many complex systems have critical thresholds -- ' tipping points ' -- at which these systems shift abruptly from one state to another , " write the scientists in their paper .
Especially relevant , they discovered , is that " catastrophic bifurcations , " a diverging of the ways , propel a system toward a new state once a certain threshold is exceeded .
Like Robert Frost 's well - known poem about two paths diverging in a wood , a system follows a trail for so long , then often comes to a switchpoint at which it will strike out in a completely new direction .

That system may be as tiny as the alveoli in human lungs or as large as global climate .
" These are compelling insights into the transitions in human and natural systems , " says Henry Gholz , program director in the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) 's Division of Environmental Biology , which supported the research along with NSF 's Division of Ocean Sciences .
" The information comes at a critical time -- a time when Earth 's and , our fragility , have been highlighted by global financial collapses , debates over health care reform , and concern about rapid change in climate and ecological systems . "
It all comes down to what scientists call " squealing , " or " variance amplification near critical points , " when a system moves back and forth between two states .
" A system may shift permanently to an altered state if an underlying slow change in conditions persists , moving it to a new situation , " says Carpenter .

Eutrophication in lakes , shifts in climate , and epileptic seizures all are preceded by squealing .
Squealing , for example , announced the impending abrupt end of Earth 's Younger Dryas cold period some 12,000 years ago , the scientists believe .
The later part of this episode alternated between a cold mode and a warm mode .
The Younger Dryas eventually ended in a sharp shift to the relatively warm and stable conditions of the Holocene epoch .
The increasing climate variability of recent times , state the paper 's authors , may be interpreted as a signal that the near - term future could bring a transition from glacial and interglacial oscillations to a new state -- one with permanent Northern Hemisphere glaciation in Earth 's mid-latitudes .
In ecology , stable states separated by critical thresholds of change occur in ecosystems from rangelands to oceans , says Carpenter .
The way in which plants stop growing during a drought is an example .
At a certain point , fields become deserts , and no amount of rain will bring vegetation back to life .
Before this transition , plant life peters out , disappearing in patches until nothing but dry - as - bones land is left .
Early - warning signals are also found in exploited fish stocks .
Harvesting leads to increased fluctuations in fish populations .
Fish are eventually driven toward a transition to a cyclic or chaotic state .
Humans are n't exempt from abrupt transitions .
Epileptic seizures and asthma attacks are cases in point .
Our lungs can show a pattern of bronchoconstriction that may be the prelude to dangerous respiratory failure , and which resembles the pattern of collapsing land vegetation during a drought .
Epileptic seizures happen when neighboring neural cells all start firing in synchrony .
Minutes before a seizure , a certain variance occurs in the electrical signals recorded in an EEG .
Shifts in financial markets also have early warnings .
Stock market events are heralded by increased trading volatility .
Correlation among returns to stocks in a falling market and patterns in options prices may serve as early - warning indicators .
" In systems in which we can observe transitions repeatedly , " write the scientists , " such as lakes , ranges or fields , and such as human physiology , we may discover where the thresholds are .
" If we have reason to suspect the possibility of a critical transition , early - warning signals may be a significant step forward in judging whether the probability of an event is increasing . "

The research also was funded by the Institute Para Limes and the South American Institute for Resilience and Sustainability Studies , as well as the Netherlands Organization of Scientific Research and the European Science Foundation , among others .

Before researching and photographing Chemtrails this past 7 months , I would have said that " We Are " .
However , after seeing the amount of environmental damage that the Chemtrail Planes are doing to Mother Earth and her atmosphere , each and EVERY Day ( I 've personally witnessed this in both San Diego and Las Vegas ) ...
I feel that there is a bigger entity involved in the destruction of the planet , its ecologies , and although it appears that they are trying to do something for " Global Warming " , if you delve deep enough into the research -- you will find that this is a FALSE Assumption .
If they were actually doing something for the cause of Global Warming , that would be perceived as a noble and just cause .
However , no one is stepping forward to " give an OFFICIAL Story " on this topic .
Why ?
Probably because they are not doing this ... just for the benefit of Global Warming Issues .
( Hello !!! )
All of these planes zooming around are only ADDING to the Global Warming Issue .
The chemicals that they are spraying are fostering droughts with the chemical additives that they are showering all over creation .
I feel that they are responsible for a great number of the Mass Wildlife Deaths that have recently happened .
I 've been on a mission to write about this topic and to try to share the videos and links that I have found to be the most helpful in educating people about this MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE , that the News and Media Sources are hardly even covering .
If there is ONE TOPIC that people should study -- this would be it .
The entire atmosphere of planet earth will be changed by these daily dumps that they are spraying into the earth 's oxygen supply .
I do n't know about you , but when I took Biology 101 -- they did not mention that the earth 's oxygen supply needed to have daily aerosol sprayings of Aluminum , Barium Salts , Boron , Strontium , and a whole laundry list of Biological Warfare Compounds .
If you delve far enough into the research on this project , you will see that whomever is responsible for this major " Experiment on Mankind " -- may not have the highest intentions for Health and Well Being of the Mass Population .
The more research that I have conducted , the more I am finding that I agree with what Ted Gunderson ( the head of the LA / Dallas FBI Branches ) said , that chemtrails appear to be a depopulation strategy , a plan for MASS Genocide on a Global Scale .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Jay Leno ’s new prime - time chat and comedy TV show lost more than 7 million viewers on its second night after a slew of bad reviews but was still the No. 1 U.S. network show of the night , audience ratings figures showed on Wednesday .
“ The Jay Leno Show ” -- the closely watched cost - cutting experiment by NBC -- was watched by 10.7 million Americans on Tuesday night , compared to a revised 18.4 million on its Monday debut , according to Nielsen Media Research .
Leno ’s move from his former 11:30 p.m. time period to the prime - time slot five nights - a- week that is traditionally occupied by expensive scripted drama is being scrutinized by the entire network TV industry as it struggles to cut costs and retain audiences .
General Electric
Co’s NBC network has been particularly hard hit and has been in last place for four years among the leading four networks .
Most TV critics slammed the new show after its Monday premiere , saying it was tired and old and failed to live up to the media hype of the past two months .
A drop off was expected and NBC executives have said they are looking at the long - term success of the show .
The network noted that the Tuesday audience was still double the average 5.2 million who used to tune in to “ The Tonight Show ” with Jay Leno at 11:30 p.m .
“ The Jay Leno Show ” also attracted more viewers on Tuesday than the season finale of “ Big Brother ” on rival CBS Corp ’s CBS , which drew an audience of 7.9 million , and Walt Disney Co’s ABC repeat showing of an interview with the actor Patrick Swayze , who died of pancreatic cancer on Monday .
The Swayze interview was seen by 6 million .
The leading U.S. networks will roll out the bulk of their new prime - time TV schedules in the next two weeks .
Animal , vegetable and mineral , a pristine tropical coral reef is one of the natural wonders of the world .
Bathed in clear , warm water and thick with a psychedelic display of fish , sharks , crustaceans and other sea life , the colourful coral ramparts that rise from the sand are known as the rainforests of the oceans .
And with good reason .
Reefs and rainforests have more in common than their beauty and bewildering biodiversity .
Both have stood for millions of years , and yet both are poised to disappear .
If you thought you had heard enough bad news on the environment and that the situation could not get any worse , then steel yourself .
Coral reefs are doomed .
The situation is virtually hopeless .
Forget ice caps and rising sea levels : the tropical coral reef looks like it will enter the history books as the first major ecosystem wiped out by our love of cheap energy .
Today , a report from the Australian government agency that looks after the nation 's emblematic Great Barrier Reef reported that " the overall outlook for the reef is poor and catastrophic damage to the ecosystem may not be averted " .
The Great Barrier Reef is in trouble , and it is not the only one .
Within just a few decades , experts are warning , the tropical reefs strung around the middle of our planet like a jewelled corset will reduce to rubble .
Giant piles of slime - covered rubbish will litter the sea bed and spell in large distressing letters for the rest of foreseeable time : Humans Were Here .
" The future is horrific , " says Charlie Veron , an Australian marine biologist who is widely regarded as the world 's foremost expert on coral reefs .
" There is no hope of reefs surviving to even mid-century in any form that we now recognise .
If , and when , they go , they will take with them about one - third of the world 's marine biodiversity .
Then there is a domino effect , as reefs fail so will other ecosystems .
This is the path of a mass extinction event , when most life , especially tropical marine life , goes extinct . "
Alex Rogers , a coral expert with the Zoological Society of London , talks of an " absolute guarantee of their annihilation " .
And David Obura , another coral heavyweight and head of CORDIO East Africa , a research group in Kenya , is equally pessimistic : " I do n't think reefs have much of a chance .
And what 's happening to reefs is a parable of what is going to happen to everything else . "
These are desperate words , stripped of the usual scientific caveats and expressions of uncertainty , and they are a measure of the enormity of what 's happening to our reefs .
The problem is a new take on a familiar evil .
Of the billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide spewed from cars , power stations , aircraft and factories each year , about half hangs round in the thin layer of atmosphere where it traps heat at the Earth 's surface and so drives global warming .
What happens to the rest of this steady flood of carbon pollution ?
Some is absorbed by the world 's soils and forests , offering vital respite to our overcooked climate .
The remainder dissolves into the world 's oceans .
And there , it stores up a whole heap of trouble for coral reefs .
Often mistaken for plants , individual corals are animals closely related to sea anemones and jellyfish .
They have tiny tentacles and can sting and eat fish and small animals .
Corals are found throughout the world 's oceans , and holidaymakers taking a swim off the Cornish coast may brush their hands through clouds of the tiny creatures without ever realising .
It is when corals form communities on the sea bed that things get interesting .
Especially in the tropics .
Yes , Britain has its own rugged coral reefs , but such deep - water constructions are too remote , cold and dark to really fire the imagination .
It is in shallow , brightly light waters , that coral reefs really come to life .
In the turquoise waters of the Caribbean , Indian Ocean and Pacific , the coral come together with tiny algae to make magic .
The algae do something that the coral cannot .
They photosynthesise , and so use the sun 's energy to churn out food for the coral .
In return , the coral provide the algae with the carbon dioxide they need for photosynthesis , and so complete the circle of symbiotic life .
Freed of the need to wave their tentacles around to hunt for food , the coral can devote more energy to secreting the mineral calcium carbonate , from which they form a stony exoskeleton .
A second type of algae , which also produces calcium carbonate , provides cement .
Together , the marine menage - a- trois make a very effective building site , with dead corals leaving their calcium skeletons behind as limestone .
For all their apparent beauty and fragility , just think of coral reefs as big lumps of rock with a living crust .
A fragile crust too .
The natural world is a harsh environment for coral reefs .
They are under perpetual attack by legions of fish that graze their fields of algae .
Animals bore into their shells to make homes , and storms and crashing waves break them apart .
They may appear peaceful paradises , but most coral reefs are manic sites of constant destruction and frantic rebuilding .
Crucially though , for millions of years , these processes have been in balance .
Human impact has tipped that balance .
Loaded with the agricultural nutrients nitrates and phosphates , rivers now spill their polluted waters into the sea .
Sediment and sewage cloud the clear waters , while over - fishing plays havoc with the finely tuned community of fish and sharks that kept the reef nibbling down to sustainable levels .
All of this is enough to wreck coral without any help from climate change .
Global warming , predictably , has made the situation worse .
Secure in their tropical currents , coral reefs have evolved to operate within a fairly narrow temperature range , yet , in the late 1970s and 1980s , coral scientists got an unpleasant demonstration of what happens when the hot tap is left on too long .
" The algae go berserk , " said Rogers .
Scientists think the algae react to the warmer water and increased sunlight by producing toxic oxygen compounds called superoxides , which can damage the coral .
The coral respond by ejecting their algal lodgers , leaving the reefs starved of nutrients and deathly white .
Such bleaching was first observed on a large scale in the 1980s , and reached massive levels worldwide during the 1997 - 98 El Niño weather event .
On top of a human - warmed climate , the 1997 - 98 El Niño , caused by pulses of warming and cooling in the Pacific , drove water temperatures across the world beyond the coral comfort zone .
The mass bleaching event that followed killed a fifth of coral communities worldwide , and though many have recovered slightly since , the global death toll attributed to the 1997 - 98 mass bleaching stands at 16 % .
" At the moment the reefs seem to be recovering well but it 's only a matter of time before we have another [ mass bleaching event ] , " says Obura .
With its striking images of skeletal reefs stripped of colour and life , coral bleaching offers photogenic evidence of our crumbling biodiversity , and has placed the plight of coral reefs higher on the world 's consciousness .
Head along to your local swimming pool for diving lessons these days , and chances are that you will be offered a coral conservation course as well .
Katy Bloor , an instructor at Sub-Mission Dive School in Stoke - on - Trent , says many divers are not aware of the problems corals face , particularly as holiday operators tend to visit reefs in better condition .
" Most have probably dived on a coral reef that they thought was a bit rubbish , but they have n't considered why , " she said .
If anyone knows what they are missing out on , it should be Charlie Veron .
So what does it feel like to dive on a pristine reef ?
" I have not seen many reefs that can be called pristine , and none exist now , " he says .
" But if I had to take a punt , I was diving on the Chesterfield Reefs , east of New Caledonia [ in the southwest Pacific ] about 30 years ago and was staggered by the wealth of life , especially big fish which were so thick that I was hardly ever able to photograph coral .
That place made even remote parts of the Great Barrier Reef look second rate .
" I can only describe it like walking through a rainforest dripping with orchids , crowded with birds and mammals of bewildering variety and trees growing in extreme profusion . "
Can the coral be helped ?
If planting more trees can regrow a forest , can coral be introduced to bolster failing reefs ?
There are a handful of groups working on the problem , many of which have reported encouraging results .
Off Japan , scientists are farming healthy coral on hundreds of ceramic discs , which they plan to transplant onto the badly - bleached Sekisei Lagoon reef within two years .
In 30 years or so , they hope the reef can recover fully .
A similar , if more low - tech , exercise is under way in the Philippine coastal community of Bolinao , where local people have broken off chunks from the healthy section of their local reef and have crudely wedged them into cracks in bleached sections .
Others have cultured corals in swimming pools , and researchers in the Maldives are using giant sunken cages , connected to a low level electric current , to help coral form their chalky shells .
But the problem with all these efforts , according to Rogers at the ZSL , is that they cannot address the looming holocaust that reefs face .
A new , terrible curse that comes on top of the bleaching , the battering , the poisoning and the pollution .
Remember the carbon dioxide that we left dissolving in the oceans ?
Billions and billions of tonnes of it over the last 150 years or so since the industrial revolution ?
While mankind has squabbled , delayed , distracted and dithered over the impact that carbon emissions have on the atmosphere , that dissolved pollution has been steadily turning the oceans more acidic .
There is no dispute , no denial , about this one .
Chemistry is chemistry , and carbon dioxide plus water has made carbonic acid since the dawn of time .
As a result , the surface waters of the world 's oceans have dropped by about 0.1 pH unit – a sentence that proves the hopeless inadequacy of scientific terminology to express certain concepts .
It sounds small , but is a truly jaw - dropping change for coral reefs .
For reefs to rebuild their stony skeletons , they rely on the seawater washing over them to be rich in the calcium mineral aragonite .
Put simply , the more acid the seawater , the less aragonite it can hold , and the less corals can rebuild their structure .
Earlier this year , a paper in the journal Science reported that calcification rates across the Great Barrier Reefs have dropped 14 % since 1990 .
The researchers said more acidic seas were the most likely culprit , and ended their sober write - up of the study with the extraordinary warning that it showed " precipitous changes in the biodiversity and productivity of the world 's oceans may be imminent " .
Rogers says carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are already over the safe limits for coral reefs .
And even the most ambitious political targets for carbon cuts , based on limiting temperature rise to 2C , are insufficient .
Their only hope , he says , is a long - term carbon concentration much lower than today's .
The clock must somehow be wound back and carbon somehow sucked out of the air .
If not , then so much more carbon will dissolve in the seas that the reefs will surely crumble to dust .
Given the reluctance to reduce emissions so far , the coral community is not holding its breath .
" I just do n't see the world having the commitment to sort this one out , " says Obura .
" We need to use the coral reef lesson to wake us up and not let this happen to a hundred other ecosystems . "
Reefs to see before they die
Florida Keys , United States
The only coral reef system in the continental US and the third largest in the world , stretching 221 miles down the Florida coast .
The US National Marine Fisheries Service says live coral is down 50 - 80 % in the last decade , mainly due to damage by humans .
Jamaican reefs
Threatened by sewage disposal , inland agricultural run-off and eutrophication , as well as tourist activities such as glass - bottom boat trips .
Hurricanes hinder reef recovery and Caribbean coral cover has declined 80 % in 25 years .
Scarborough Reef , South China Sea
Ownership disputes between the Philippines , mainland China and Taiwan mean the waters surrounding this reef are heavily overfished , and mangled by the blasts and cyanide used to maximise catch .
Reefs of the windward Southeast Hawaiian Islands , US
Management is improving around the main Hawaiian islands such as Oahu and Maui , but over - fishing and organic sediment from plantations remain major threats .
Seribu Islands , Java Sea , Indonesia
Spanning over 108,000 hectares and 100 small islands , this reef is a significant contributor to the Indonesian tourism economy .
Rapid urban development poses threats from domestic and industrial waste , urban run-off and oil and gas exploration .
The 1997-1998 El Niño event triggered severe bleaching and killed over 90 % of the coral down to 25 metres .
Stable but for how long ?
The Great Barrier Reef
The globe 's largest coral reef ecosystem , composed of over 2,900 individual reefs and stretching over 3,000 km , is the best example of reef management with little damage since 2004 .
Significant bleaching occurred in 1998 , 2002 and 2006 .
The Red Sea Riviera , Gulf of Aqaba , Egypt , Israel and Jordan
These reefs continue to remain in good health despite intense tourism .
Coral cover remains high to very high , despite localised losses from coral bleaching and crowns - of - thorns starfish , which prey on coral polyps .
Mombasa National Marine Park , Kenya
Adjacent to the most heavily populated beach along the Kenyan coast , damage due to tourism is inevitable .
In 1989 the area was pronounced a marine park , leading to an increase in recorded coral cover from 8 to 30 % .
Reefs of the Seychelles , Indian Ocean
Lost some 90 % of coral cover during the 1998 El Nino event .
Slowly recovering due to granitic coral , which is more resistant and supports regrowth .
Surin Islands , Thailand
The reefs located off this group of islands were weakened by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami
The majority of the damage is localized and low impact , but the coral is now more susceptible to future destruction .

A common way of combating spam traffic is to shut down the service provider through which the traffic is being processed .
With a new variety of botnets , though , this method is becoming increasingly ineffective .
The August report from Message Labs indicates that the shutdown of a Latvian ISP , while initially effective , ultimately did little to quell the malicious activity of one botnet , whose traffic recovered in a matter of days .
Cutwail is one of the largest botnets running amuck on the Internet , and is estimated to be behind 15 - 20 percent of all spam , including malicious websites , phishing websites , and fake antivirus products .
Message Labs noted that Cutwail was conducting a large portion of its dubious business through Real Host , an ISP based in Riga , Latvia .
Real Host was allegedly involved with " command - and - control " servers allowing large - scale botnet infection .
Proportion of traffic of top five botnets .
Source : Message Labs .
Because Real
Host was supporting such a large amount of suspicious traffic , it was disconnected by its upstream providers on August 1 , 2009 .
As a result , spam volumes dropped by 38 percent across the board within 48 hours , and Cutwail 's activity fell by as much as 90 percent during that time .
A win for the good guys , or so it seemed .
After the 48 - hour mark , Cutwail 's activity levels has rebounded significantly , nearly to those of its Real Host heyday .
This recovery indicates that botnets are increasingly able to continue their operations almost undisturbed , despite the lack of a colluding ISP .
V3 points out that when the McColo Web hosting firm was shut down back in November 2008 , its botnets took several weeks to reach their previous levels of activity .
Message Labs also indicated that it is difficult to discern ISP mal - intent from insufficient resources , and the process of determining which is which can hold up shutdowns .
There are few barriers to setting up an ISP , and network problems can result from a smaller provider 's even smaller abuse department .
The Message Labs report also noted the increase in use of URL - shortening services in spam emails , which may serve to disguise a questionable domain name or length .
Filters are increasingly being set to suspect a shortened URL , as with Microsoft 's ban on TinyURL from Windows Live Messenger .
With the fast evolution of botnet processes and methods , smarter protection that can evolve with the malicious traffic may be in order .

Stoned Bootkit : The Rise of MBR Rootkits & Bootkits in the Wild
Talk Abstract
This is the video of the talk " " given by Peter Kleissner at HAR 2009 .
We covered the Stoned Bootkit in a recent video .
This talk is given by Peter , the original author who wrote Stoned and is a highly recommended watch for people interested in understanding the inner workings of rootkits in general and the Stoned bootkit in particular . : " Stoned Bootkit is a new Windows bootkit .
It is loaded before Windows starts and is memory resident up to the Windows kernel .
Thus Stoned is executed beside the Windows kernel and has full access to the entire system .
It attacks all Windows versions including XP , Vista and 7 .
It has exciting features like integrated file system drivers , automatic Windows pwning , plugins , boot applications , and much much more .
Inside it is a small operating system !
It finally goes back to the roots .
So in this way , Your PC is now Stoned ! .. again :) There is one version for all Windows versions from XP up to 7 and it is even bypassing full volume encryption ( TrueCrypt ) .
It gives you back the full control over your system which was taken off with Windows Vista ( and the signed drivers policy ) .
Stoned is executed before Windows , stays memory resident and is executed beside the Windows kernel .
Thus it has full access to the entire system .
It gives the user back the control to the system – which was taken away by Windows Vista with its signed driver policy .
It allows executing any unsigned driver which can be useful both for device testers and malware developers .
The lecture will also handle other bootkits in the wild , the topic will be " The Rise of MBR Rootkits & Bootkits in the Wild " .
As an extra plus the Windows Product Activation ( with OEM BIOS identification ) will be discussed .
You can visit the Stoned Bootkit project site for more details and to download the framework code .

In the beginning , there was a father who craved respectability ; he begat a bad boy who enjoyed shocking polite society .
The father was Max Gaines , one of the founders of the American comic - book industry and publisher of the early adventures of the Green Lantern and Wonder Woman .
Stung by criticisms that comics were corrupting America ’s youth , Max rebranded himself as a purveyor of uplifting material , releasing Picture Stories from the Bible in 1942 and soon thereafter starting a firm called Educational Comics .
After Max died in 1947 , his wayward , mischief - loving son , Bill , took charge of the firm .
Unlike his dad , Bill did n’t shy away from the reputation comic books had for sensationalism .
EC , which now stood for Entertaining Comics , became a clearinghouse for blood - drenched horror titles such as Tales from the Crypt , as well as for the irreverent Mad .
These taboo - breaking comics , sold for a dime to any kid who wanted to read them , provoked a hornet ’s nest of censorious opposition .
Although Max and Bill Gaines had antithetical aims , both are precursors to Robert Crumb in his Book of Genesis Illustrated .
Like Max , Crumb has returned to the sacred text at the heart of Western civilization , but the result is a comic as unsettlingly drenched in sexualized violence as Tales from the Crypt and as subversively disrespectful to cultural icons as Mad .
Those familiar only with the Crumb of the ’60s and ’ 70s , the sex - obsessed chronicler of Mr. Natural and Fritz the Cat , may be surprised to learn that he has a bookish side .
Since the early ’ 80s , he has been releasing a remarkable series of literary adaptations , faithfully and lovingly based on scenes from works such as James Boswell ’s London Journal , Richard von Krafft - Ebing ’s Psychopathia Sexualis , Jean - Paul Sartre ’s Nausea , and Franz Kafka ’s stories .
These are all works of literary extremism , focused on scenes of heightened feelings and antisocial behavior .
Crumb ’s Book of Genesis is the culmination of his Classics Illustrated impulse .
As he did in earlier adaptations , the artist embraces a volatile , often abrasive text soaked through with lust and blood .
But The Book of Genesis Illustrated is far more ambitious than Crumb ’s previous adaptations , which tended to be only a few pages long .
This time , he has tackled a sizable text , all fifty chapters of Genesis , omitting very little ( such as “ and Bethuel , ” on the scholarly grounds that these two words were added by a scribal interloper ) .
The completeness of this version is important , because , as Crumb rightly complains , every other comics adaptation seems to have been streamlined and modernized , often to make the shocking old stories palatable to readers , especially kids .
In the rendition of Noah ’s story in Picture Stories from the Bible , for instance , no mention is made of Ham seeing his illustrious father naked and earning a curse for the transgression .
In the 1975 DC Comics “ Limited Collectors ’ Edition ” of the Bible , the sin of the men of Sodom seems to be that they are too greedy , and any hint of homosexual rape is carefully avoided .
Unlike these bowdlerized versions , Crumb ’s does n’t hide the fact that the holy book is filled with stories of incest ( Abraham marrying his half sister , Sarah ; Lot being seduced by his daughter ) , frenzied bloodlust ( God ’s various acts of mass murder , the terrible slaughter of a village after a young boy seduces Jacob ’s daughter , Dinah ) , and general unsavory behavior ( the theme of fraternal violence that runs from the story of Cain and Abel to the concluding saga of Joseph and his spiteful siblings ) .
Images can cut deeper than words , especially when those images are executed by so psychologically alert an artist as Crumb .
It ’s one thing to read about the daughters of Lot seducing their father in a desperate attempt to repopulate their tribe after the destruction of Sodom ; it ’s quite another to see Crumb ’s depiction of the sodden Lot , his eyes in a daze , straddled by a zaftig Amazon who looks vaguely troubled by her reproductive mission .
Crumb describes his adaptation as being “ literal , ” a rather loaded word in biblical circles .
The idea takes many forms :
There is the literalism of the fundamentalist , convinced that the Bible is the inerrant and inspired word of God , but there is also the literalism of modern scholars and translators , who use archaeology and philology to uncover what the words in this ancient text meant .
In striving to be literal , Crumb has leaned heavily on Robert Alter ’s 2004 translation , which hews to the Hebrew text .
Yet in his attempt to mimic the syntax and formal diction of biblical Hebrew , Alter occasionally sounds stilted .
Crumb has in some instances wisely rewritten him or reverted to earlier translations in the interest of fluency .
Alter ’s Jacob rhetorically asks his wife , Rachel , “ Am I instead of God , Who has denied you fruit of the womb ? ” Crumb ’s Jacob talks more plainly : “ So , then , it ’s me , not God , who has denied you fruit of the womb ! ? ”
The exclamation mark is a nice touch , in keeping with Crumb ’s tendency to use the exaggerated effects of the cartooning tradition ( such as the sweat drops that issue profusely from his characters whenever they exert themselves ) .
In general , Crumb ’s tendency is to simplify Alter and bring the text closer to the vernacular .
But being literal is not the same as being impartial or withholding interpretation .
The language of Genesis is extremely terse and suggestive , opening itself up to countless retellings .
Crumb ’s personal views are bodied forth in his drawings , which frequently undermine or question the text .
The words alone tell us nothing about how Dinah reacted to the murder of her sexual assailant ( and would - be husband ) , Shechem , but a heartrending panel by Crumb suggests the possibility that the vengeance was far greater than anything she wanted .
Surprisingly , given his reputation as the chief sexist of underground comics , Crumb has taken a strongly feminist slant on Genesis .
Influenced , as he notes in the commentary , by scholars like Savina Teubal , Crumb sees within the book a struggle between two religious systems : the familiar patriarchal God of the fathers ( whose story runs from Abraham to Isaac to Jacob to Joseph ) existing side by side with a covert matrilineal traditional of powerful women ( including Sarah , Rebekah , and Rachel ) .
Following Teubal , Crumb places considerable emphasis on a puzzling tale found in chapter 12 , where Abraham and Sarah travel to Egypt .
He tells her to hide the fact that she ’s his wife and say she ’s his sister .
Following these instructions , Sarah lives inside Pharaoh ’s house , and possibly as a result of this arrangement , Abraham prospers .
But then Pharaoh is cursed by a plague and discovers the truth , leading him to cast Abraham and Sarah out of Egypt .
( This tale is twice reworked in Genesis , once with Abraham and Sarah again pretending to be only siblings , and once with Isaac and Rebekah doing the same . )
Teubal makes sense of these bizarre stories by positing that Sarah and Rebekah had social roles akin to priestesses in other ancient civilizations .
As such , they would have been allowed to enter into temporary sacred marriages with powerful men , such as Pharaoh , as a means of building tribal alliances .
If these marriages or alliances proved inauspicious , they would have been broken .
While speculative , Teubal ’s analysis is deeply suggestive and allows Crumb to give an added emotional charge to his interpretation .
In his account , the sacred marriage is almost an act of pimping : Sarah is stiff with anger and weeps when she hears what Abraham wants of her .
Interestingly , Crumb follows Teubal rather than Alter in describing Hagar as a “ handmaid ” rather than a “ slavegirl , ” in keeping with the aim of seeing the biblical matriarchs as agents in their destinies instead of passive victims of male domination .
As presented in the Bible , the characters in Genesis have no internal lives :
We see them speak and act , with little sense of their motivations .
When a primary character ( God or one of the patriarchs ) speaks at length , we can only guess at how the words were received .
Crumb ’s major interpretive act is to offer reaction shots to this biblical speech making .
When God tells
Noah that divine justice demands the destruction of almost all life on earth , the poor farmer is aghast .
In chapter 35 , Jacob calls on the members of his household to cleanse themselves and destroy their idols .
The text is silent about their reactions , but Crumb shows the women of the family quietly crying as they hand over their beloved objects .
Among its many riches , Genesis is a book about bodies , a book where men and women constantly grapple with one another , where a servant swears an oath by putting his hand under his master ’s thigh , where even angels are threatened with sexual violation .
Crumb has long been the preeminent cartoonist of the body .
His women are notoriously full - figured , with ample butts and protruding nipples ( a motif he uses in this book ) .
But more significantly , the bodies he draws — whether they are quivering or standing still , dancing or drooping — have a visceral impact few artists can match .
That ’s why he was the perfect cartoonist to illustrate the Book of Genesis , a fitting capstone to a great career .

Do miracles depend on definitions of the laws of nature ?
( Image : Carsten Koall / Getty )
THESE days most people think it unscientific to believe in “ miracles ” , and irreligious not to believe in them .
But would the occurrence of miracles really violate the principles of science ?
And would their non-occurrence really undermine religion ?
David Hume and Richard Dawkins have attempted to answer these questions in their different ways , but I am not convinced by their arguments , and for me they remain open questions .
In 1748 , in one of his key essays , An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding , the Scottish philosopher David …

I wonder if uniball has ever thought of getting lance armstrong to sponsor their pens
Several weeks ago , I heard the infamous and brilliant financial expert / stock broker Robert Chapman talk about stock market manipulation .
Robert 's track record is stellar for predicting what will happen to America economically - including revealing $ 80 oil several years before it happened .
Mr. Chapman is well connected and aware of the NWO plans to take over the planet .
On the radio show Robert discussed a large computer complex being constructed near Wall St. - for the sole purpose of high frequency trading .
This type of ruthless trading can bring Wall St.to it 's knees ­ which just might be the purpose for doing it .
It was brought to my attention today that over the weekend of Sept. 27 and 28 , 2009 something had changed in the Forex ( Foreign Exchange ) market .
On Sept. 29 making a profit suddenly became very difficult .
Normal trading techniques that worked well in past weeks no longer seemed to work for this particular trader .
Many people who have n't been able to make money in the stock market anymore have moved into the Forex market .
Note -
Forex is highly risky , and thousands of dollars can be lost in minutes or even seconds .
Do not consider or use the above statement as a recommendation to enter the Forex market !
But something has happened .
I examined the Forex charts in the early morning hours to see if a pattern was visible .
Here is what I found upon examing the data .
A " tick " chart is considered the closest you can look at a currency pair which is trading live .
( This is also terminology used in looking at real time trading charts for stocks . )
1 . First , let 's look at a normal tick chart :
In the unaltered screen capture above , we can see the small variations of normal trading as clearly defined solid lines .
This chart is for the US dollar vs. the Japanese Yen .
The red line is the asking price , or the price a trader pays for the currency pair .
The blue line is the bid price , or the price a trader gets when selling the currency pair .
2 . Now let 's look at another currency pair which clearly shows high frequency trading :
In this unaltered screen capture we see a tiny square wave super - imposed upon the normal line showing the price .
Note this is the US dollar vs. the Swiss Franc .
Now let 's look at the high frequency trading wave even closer :
In the screen capture above is part the same trading chart magnified .
It is physically impossible for anyone to trade like this manually without the use of a specially programmed high speed computer (s ) to perform the trading .
Someone would only need to manipulate one or more key currencies to manipulate the rest .
All the western world 's currencies are traded on Forex .
So what 's makes the Swiss Franc so special ?
At least one of the banks I know of in Switzerland certainly does not have a solvency problem - its net worth exceeds 3.5 TRILLION dollars .
Now that could n't have anything to do with Forex manipulation , could it ?

' Excuse me , are you Simon Stephens ? '
He is sitting on the front steps of Black 's club , in Soho 's Dean Street .
His pose is a bit like Rodin's The Thinker - hand on chin .
He is on his mobile , talking concentratedly , dressed in black - a sort of uniform .
He could be a waiter or a theatrical usher .
But I am guessing that I have the right man .
I have just overheard him say he can't take on any more work - and that clinches it .
For Stephens is in overdrive .
To say that he is ' in demand ' would be putting it mildly .
' Pornography ' , about the London bombings has just finished a successful run at The Tricycle in Kilburn , ' Sea Wall ' , a tragic monologue - a Father 's Tale - has been at the Edinburgh Festival and his new play ' Punk Rock ' is about to open at the Lyric Hammersmith ( it is also a debut production from Sean Holmes as the theatre 's new artistic director with Simon Stephens as his associate ) .
It is true : Stephens does not have much room for manoeuvre .
He owns up to being himself at once - and scrambles to his feet .
He is tall , good - looking with hair that seems under attack ( all that earlier thinking ) .
He seems to have the combined energy of several people in one body .
I like his punchy , engaged manner .
At different moments , I notice him throw his arms wide , as if someone had scored a goal and use both forefingers to add double emphasis to his points .
If you were to guess what sort of plays he wrote from his demeanour , you would plump for dynamic comedy .
But you would be wrong .
His writing can entertain but it is darkness that draws him in .
Stephens 's first success was with ' On the Shores of the Wide World ' which won an Olivier award , in 2005 , for ' best new play ' .
The following year ' Motortown ' at the Royal Court , about the Iraq war , got admiring reviews .
But then came his most celebrated play ' Harper Regan ' , directed by Marianne Elliott , at the National , in 2008 .
On the surface , the subject could not have been more drab .
It was about a 41 - year - old , living in Uxbridge , visiting her dying father in Stockport .
But it was also a portrait of an England charged with secrets - and , as Michael Billington put it , the work of an accomplished playwright who understood the English curse of ' emotional evasion . '
Stephens 's new play , ' Punk Rock ' , set in a fee - paying school in Stockport , is evasive too - the title , at least , is a decoy , does not prepare you for the play .
But Stephens gives the crux of it away when he explains that it was the massacre at Columbine High School that first drove him , an event that has left its ' scar over the beginning of the 21st century ' .
On the page , the play reminded me of Alan Bennett 's ' The History Boys ' and also of Lionel Shriver 's novel ' We Need to Talk about Kevin ' but its tense rhythms are all its own .
Stephens is keenly aware that ' What happened at Columbine and in Iowa State and in Germany could happen here . '
As a writer , he is too close for comfort - that is his gift .
It is important to him that his version of a school shooting should take place not only in this country but in a middle - class , fee - paying school .
He argues against the reflex , especially in theatre , to consider violence in a ' working - class and often black , urban context . '
The truth is that violence is ' pervasive . '
And middle - class audiences will not be able to distance themselves from Stephens 's terrible subject .
He describes his schoolboy assassin as ' romantic , violent , funny , charming and ironic - suffering from an increasing dislocation from himself . '
For Stephens , there is no such thing as a villain .
It is what makes his work dangerous , persuasive , conspicuous .
We must make sense of a charming schoolboy assassin and - in ' Pornography ' - of terrorists that we are asked to see as human beings .
He is interested in human complexity and asks for an acceptance that good and evil are not always distinct , that black and white fuse .
And what about the punk music ( each scene begins with a blast ) ?
How does that fit in ?
' Punk rock is mistakenly considered working class but it more often came out of art school than housing estates .
It is the musical manifestation of the anger and frustration a lot of middle - class kids feel .
It cuts to the quick of that energy . '
All the teenagers in the play have something of the misfit about them .
It is a ' murderously difficult period in most peoples ' lives ' , Stephens says - and includes himself : ' I was n't as clever or as rich as the kids I describe .
As a teenager , I had immense periods of misery .
If it had n't been for the Smiths ( his devotion to the band was absolute ) I would have been an even more unhappy person . '
It is hard to believe in this - his Northern accent sounds so upbeat and he is so full of sunshine .
He grew up in Stockport , outside Manchester , the son of the managing director of a retail distribution company and a primary school teacher .
He went to an all - boys comprehensive school - not much like the school he describes in the play .
He is 38 now - and grew up during the Eighties when British television drama ruled ( Dennis Potter dubbed the BBC the ' real National Theatre ' ) .
Stephens 's teens were ' defined by Potter and Alan Bleasdale ' .
Later , at York ( where he read History ) , the ' most attractive girls were aspiring actresses ' and out of a ' pathetic and usually fruitless attempt to charm them ' he would watch them in Chekhov and Ibsen .
But there it was cinema , not theatre , that gripped him .
Films such as ' Blue Velvet ' and ' Taxi Driver ' inspired him to write plays : ' I wondered what would happen if someone could write something for the theatre with the visceral power of those films . '
He remains a film obsessive , adding , with disarming insistence , that ' Punk Rock ' is indebted to Lindsay Anderson 's ' If ' and Gus Van Sant 's ' Elephant ' ( about Columbine ) .
It is not surprising , given Stephens 's zest for what he does , that he has been a natural choice for theatres wising to acquire a dramatist .
He was resident dramatist at the Royal Court in 2001 , a tutor on the Royal Court 's Young Writers Programme between 2001 and 2005 and the first resident dramatist at the National .
He has also taught in prisons .
What has teaching taught him about writing ?
' Dramatic narrative needs present tense action , ' he says , almost without hesitation .
He makes me laugh by describing the common tendency in apprentice playwrights to write about ancient family secrets which are revealed ' four fifths through the play , often in a drunken confessional speech . '
This is ' theatrically inert ' he says .
Another problem is that people see life as ' something that happens to them ' .
It is the playwright 's task , as he sees it , to change the question from ' Why is this happening to me ? ' to ' Why am I doing this ? '
It is a lesson that offers a commentary on Stephens 's own work which is nothing if not immediate .
For the last 10 years or more , Stephens has been reconstituting himself as a Londoner and family man .
Mile End , in East London , is home .
And he says - with perhaps more excitement than the subject deserves - that he hopes to be buried in the East End : ' I adore it . '
He is ' intoxicated ' by the thought that he will be able to ' walk to the Olympics .'.
Yet , at the same time , he condemns London for its ' atomisation ' ' dislocation ' and ' hostility ' - an ambivalence that feeds his portrait of the city in ' Pornography ' .
He sees paternity ( he has two boys and a girl ) as vital to his writing life .
' It is fundamental .
Cyril Connolly said the " pram in the hall " was the " enemy of promise " .
I think that is pernicious and dishonest .
It has been the absolute opposite for me . '
And it is possible to see tenderness sneaking into the writing .
But Stephens 's wife , Polly , ( described as ' a full - time mum ... much harder than being a playwright ' ) wonders at her husband 's plays : ' You are quite cheery , energetic and optomistic .
Why do you keep having these dark thoughts ? '
The closest he can come to an answer is when he says : ' I write but because I understand but because I do n't .
I am trying to make sense of darkness . '
Stage struck : Theatrical admirers
" Simon Stephens is wonderful , his plays have such a big heart . "
Laura Wade , playwright
" He writes so passionately and soulfully for ordinary people who are in really difficult predicaments .
People who are violent , or whatever , can have immense humanity in them as well - Simon writes about that very well . "
Daniel Mays , actor
" I directed his play Port at the Exchange , and I think it 's one of the best things I 've ever done .
His writing is so detailed , so psychologically rich , so daring in terms of his emotion .
He 's not very English in that way . "
Marianne Elliot , director
'' I thought Simon Stephens 's play On the Shore of the Wide World was sensational .
I was thrilled when it won the Olivier because I thought it was really underrated . "

LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
Three men charged with sexually exploiting Cambodian children are being brought back to the United States to face prosecution , the Justice Department announced Monday .
The men are among the first charged under an international law enforcement initiative specifically targeting Americans traveling to Cambodia for the purpose of sexually abusing children .
The initiative , Operation Twisted Traveler , is an effort by the Justice Department and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to crack down on sex tourism .
" The men charged in this investigation apparently thought they could pursue their abhorrent desires by leaving the United States to prey on children in another country , but they were sadly mistaken , " U.S. Attorney Thomas P. O'Brien said in a statement .
" We are now working closer than ever with officials in other nations and concerned private parties to take every effort we can to identify and prosecute sex tourists , as well as to provide every protection we can to the world 's children . "
Ronald Boyajian , 49 , Erik Peeters , 41 , and Jack Sporich , 75 , are each charged with international travel and engaging in sexual contact with minors , a charge carrying a maximum prison sentence of 30 years , according to the Justice Department .
They are slated to make their first appearances in federal court on Tuesday , the Justice Department indicated in a news release .
The defendants are charged with international travel and engaging in sexual contact with minors , a charge carrying a maximum prison sentence of 30 years for each of their alleged victims , according to the department .
They are charged under the federal Protect Act , enacted six years ago to strengthen federal laws relating to predatory crimes against children outside U.S. borders , the department added .
The three defendants were apprehended , according to Immigration and Customs officials , as a result of information provided by the human rights organization International Justice Mission and the group Action Pour les Enfants , which combats child exploitation .
All three men have been previously convicted of sex offenses in the United States , the Justice Department noted in its statement .
" These types of cases are disturbing not only because young , defenseless children were victimized in unspeakable ways but also because the defendants went to such lengths to engage in their dark activities overseas , " O'Brien said at a news conference .
He highlighted the case against Peeters , who was convicted on child molestation charges in 1990 .
" Our case against Mr. Peeters outlines evidence of him allegedly molesting Cambodian boys , paying them small amounts of money -- $ 5 to $ 10 -- and possibly taking digital pictures of his young victims while they were naked , " O'Brien noted .
He said Peeters molested at least three boys in Cambodia over the course of several months .
One of the boys was 12 years old when the abuse is said to have started .
Boyajian is said to have " engaged in sexual activity with a 10 - year - old Vietnamese girl in an area outside Phnom Penh frequented by child sex tourists known as ' Kilo 11 , ' " the Justice Department statement said .
Sporich , according to Action Pour les Enfants investigators cited in the government 's criminal complaint , repeatedly hosted three Cambodian boys at a residence outside the city of Siem Reap .
The complaint states that Sporich " was known to drive his motor bike through the neighborhoods while dropping Cambodian ( money ) on the street in order to meet kids . "
The new charges " clearly demonstrate to the Cambodian people that the United States will not tolerate this type of abuse , " said Carol Rodley , the American ambassador to Cambodia .
" These cases not only signal to the Cambodian victims our commitment to justice , but they will also act as a powerful deterrent for those individuals who are contemplating traveling to Cambodia to engage in illegal sexual activity with minors . "
The International Labor Organization estimates that at least 12.3 million adults and children are victims of forced labor , bonded labor and sex slavery each year .
Cambodia is one of several countries recently added to a U.S. " watch list " because of what a State Department report calls a worsening human trafficking record in that country .

Coral reefs do more than look pretty - they are nurseries for many fish
Current climate targets are not enough to save the world 's coral reefs - and policymakers urgently need to consider the economic benefits they bring .
Those are two of the conclusions from a UN - backed project aiming to quantify the financial costs of damaging nature .
Studies suggest that reefs are worth more than $ 100 bn ( £ 60 bn ) annually , but are already being damaged by rising temperatures and more acidic oceans .
The study puts the cost of forest loss each year at $ 2 - 5 trillion .
Looking ahead to December 's UN climate conference in Copenhagen , study leader Pavan Sukhdev said it was vital that policymakers realised that safeguarding the natural world was a cost - effective way of protecting societies against the impacts of rising greenhouse gas levels .
Green roots
The current UN climate negotiations contain measures for protecting forests as carbon stores - an initiative called Redd ( Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation ) .
There 's evidence that current levels of CO2 are already causing damage to reefs
Alex Rogers , Institute of Zoology
Recipe for rescuing our reefs
Its roots lie in the calculation that forest loss accounts for about 20 % of greenhouse gas emissions , and that combating it is probably the cheapest way of reducing emissions overall .
But protecting societies against climate impacts ( climate adaptation ) will also be a key component of any Copenhagen deal , because it is the single biggest priority for many developing nations .
The TEEB ( The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity ) analysis emphasises that forests , coral reefs and many other ecosystems can be the cheapest " adaptation tools " as well .
" We feel this is n't really at the top of politicians ' minds at the moment , " he told BBC News .
" But when you decide how you invest money for climate adaptation , you should quickly come to the conclusion that ecology provides the best bangs for bucks - and that 's even without taking into account the added benefits of saving biodiversity . "
Mr Sukhdev , who is on secondment to the UN Environment Programme ( Unep ) from the global markets division of Deutsche Bank , cited studies showing that money spent on nature preservation provided rates of return of between three and 75 times the initial investment .
Preserving forests kept fresh water systems intact , he noted .
Coral reefs and mangroves protected communities from storm damage ; and healthy ecosystems were essential for food production .
Reef nots
There are a number of somewhat notional targets on the table in the run-up to Copenhagen .
One , an EU initiative that now has much wider support , is to keep the global average temperature rise since the pre-industrial age within 2C - which according to some analyses means carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere cannot rise above 450 parts per million ( ppm ) .
The current level is about 387 ppm , and it is rising at about 2 ppm each year , although this year 's global recession may bring a blip .
OCEAN ACIDIFICATION
Up to 50 % of the CO2 released by burning fossil fuels over the past 200 years has been absorbed by the world 's oceans
This has lowered the pH value of seawater - the measure of acidity and alkalinity - by 0.1
The vast majority of liquids lie between pH 0 ( very acidic ) and pH 14 ( very alkaline ) ; 7 is neutral Seawater is mildly alkaline with a " natural " pH of about 8.2
The IPCC forecasts that ocean pH will fall by " between 0.14 and 0.35 units over the 21st Century , adding to the present fall of 0.1 units since pre-industrial times "
Natural lab shows sea's acid path
What is ocean acidification ?
Mr Sukhdev 's team heard evidence from coral scientists that these targets would not be enough to prevent damage to coral reefs around the tropics .
" There 's evidence that current levels of CO2 are already causing damage to reefs , " said Alex Rogers from London 's Institute of Zoology .
" Stabilising at anything more than about 350 ppm will lead to further destruction , and really we need to be aiming for zero emissions . "
Elevated carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have a twin impact on coral .
They warm the oceans ; but also , a portion of the extra CO2 becomes dissolved in seawater , which makes it slightly more acidic ( or less alkaline ) .
Ocean pH levels have already decreased by about 0.1 since pre-industrial times .
A 2007 study showed that rates of coral growth on the Great Barrier Reef had fallen by 14 % since 1990 .
TEEB 's analysis suggests that between half a billion and one billion people depend on coral reefs for at least part of their food supply .
Set up in 2007 by the German government and the European Commission , TEEB is now supported by some other governments ( including the UK ) and by Unep .
Its final report is due out in the second half of 2010 , just before a key meeting of the UN biodiversity convention .
For that analysis , Mr Sukhdev 's team will also attempt to capture the economics of fisheries loss , and finalise a complex matrix giving legislators comprehensive information about the costs and benefits of protecting - or destroying - various aspects of the natural world .

Even by the intrigue - swilled standards of Pakistan 's frontier badlands it was a strange case .
On a muggy October afternoon last year a battered taxi trundled out of Mohmand , a Taliban - infested corner of the tribal belt , towards the settled area of North - West Frontier province .
In the passenger seat sat a swarthy young man of athletic build wearing a black shalwar kameez , a tight beard and trainers like those favoured by insurgent fighters .
At a government checkpoint a suspicious policeman searched him , only to make some startling discoveries .
The man had American dollars in his pocket , a laptop computer in his bag and a cheap Chinese knife tucked into his shoes .
He barely spoke a word of Pashto , the local language .
And he produced an American passport that identified him as Jude Kenan Mohammad , a 19 - year - old student , who claimed to be a tourist .
" He said he had come to visit a friend , " the officer , Khurshid Khan , said , sitting on his bed in the dingy checkpoint .
" I thought he looked like a Taliban spy . "
The case excited a brief stir in Pakistan .
Curious reporters turned up at two court hearings , as did officials from the fortress - like US consulate in Peshawar .
Pakistani intelligence interrogated him .
Just as quickly , the matter faded away .
The court charged Kenan with two minor misdemeanours – lacking the correct paperwork and carrying an illegal weapon – and freed him on bail of £ 750 .
The intelligence men said nothing , the world moved on .
But last month the case of the enigmatic American " tourist " resurfaced in a much more serious light , as a key element of a terrorism trial in his home city of Raleigh , North Carolina .
On 4 August , the FBI indicted Kenan as the eighth man in a plot by a gang of mostly American Muslims to commit murder , kidnap and mayhem in the name of " violent jihad " .
If convicted , he faces life in prison .
Prosecutors claim the men were led by Daniel Boyd , a 39 - year - old building contractor and convert to Islam who , they say , used his lakeside home to stockpile weapons , spread extremist literature glorifying Osama bin Laden , and foster a cell of homegrown American jihadi terrorists .
In preliminary hearings investigators played recordings of rattling gunfire at a military - style training camp run by Boyd , and a tape in which he declares : " I love jihad .
I love to stand there and fight for the sake of Allah . "
What has alarmed Americans most is the middle - class ordinariness of the accused .
Boyd had a Support Our Troops sticker on his truck ; one of his sons was an eagle scout ; his friend Ziyad Yaghi was arrested by the pool , wearing only his swimming trunks .
This shows , the FBI says , that " terrorists and their supporters are not confined to the remote regions of some faraway land but can grow and fester right here at home " .
But friends and family of the eight accused say the prosecution is a huge mistake , misinterpreting everything from politically driven talk of jihad to a shooting outing with legally held weapons .
" Pure poppycock , " said Boyd 's older brother , Robert , of the charges .
Boyd 's non-Muslim neighbours say the image of a dangerous fanatic is at odds with the devout , personable man they know .
" Everyone 's got guns , " said neighbour Jeremy Kuhn .
" Welcome to North Carolina . "
The trial is likely to revolve around one question : were the Boyd gang truly trainee terrorists , or just big - mouth blowhards ?
Part of the answer may be found thousands of miles away , in the swirling , violent frontier region of north - western Pakistan , where the eighth man is still at large .
Jude Kenan is the product of an unusual union .
His father , Taj Muhammad , hails from Dara Adam Khel , a lawless town of gunsmiths south of Peshawar known for its brisk sales of imitation AK - 47s and rocket launchers .
His mother , Elena , is a white American who converted from Catholicism to Islam .
According to Kenan 's lawyer , Khan Ghawas Khan , the couple met in New York in the early 1980s when Muhammad was pursuing a masters in law .
They had four girls and a boy and lived in Pakistan for several years .
But about a decade ago Elena moved back to America , he said , taking her son with her .
In Raleigh , Kenan was a pretty typical teenager – partying , drinking and dating girls .
His usual greeting was " yo , what 's up , man " , say friends .
" He was very popular , cool as hell , " said one .
About 18 months ago something changed .
Kenan , who had always played basketball outside the local mosque , became a more observant Muslim , stopped partying and made plans to see his father in Pakistan .
" He would say , ' I 've been there , done that , it 's time for me to settle down , ' " the friend said .
Last October he left for Pakistan .
While in Raleigh he shared a cheap two - bedroom apartment with a sister , in Dara Adam Khel he was part of the tribal elite .
According to his lawyer the family have extensive business interests across Pakistan – five petrol pumps , property in Karachi , a fuel distribution firm and millions of rupees worth of shares .
But his new home was also a dangerous place .
Last year , soldiers and Taliban fighters battled for months for control of Dara Adam Khel , and a major road tunnel near the family house was closed .
On 13 October , the day of his arrest , Kenan told his father he was going into Peshawar to buy movies .
That afternoon , he was arrested on the border of Mohmand agency and Charsadda , north of Peshawar .
He seemed unperturbed .
" He was very calm and friendly , not at all aggressive , " recalled officer Khan .
In court , Kenan lunged playfully at a cameraman who filmed him being led away in handcuffs .
His father loudly remonstrated with him before the judge .
" He said , ' Look at the problems you have created for me ! , ' " said journalist Kaman Shah .
Kenan 's lawyer , Ghawas Khan , called the trip a rash adventure of youth : " He only wanted to boast to the people in America that he had seen the place where the Taliban are fighting . "
Back in Raleigh , the FBI was taking a more sinister view .
Daniel Boyd was coming under scrutiny .
Federal agents tapped his phone and recruited an informant to penetrate his circle .
Boyd knew they were watching .
" The FBI wants to catch me slipping , " he told a friend .
The son of a US marine , Boyd converted to Islam at 17 .
In Raleigh he was a prominent , if intensely devout , Muslim .
His wife , Sabrina , wore a burka in public while his sons , Dylan , 22 , and Zakariya , 20 , stood out for their flowing white robes and scraggy beards .
A year earlier Boyd had opened the Blackstone Market , a shop selling halal food that became a meeting place for the Muslim community .
There , he liked to tell tales of past glory fighting the Soviet Union , a disputed episode that has become a central part of the FBI case against him .
In 1989 , Boyd and his brother Charles moved to Peshawar to participate in the CIA - sponsored " jihad " war against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan .
But they were too late – the Soviets quit Afghanistan six months before they arrived .
Instead the Boyds appear to have joined Hizb - i - Islami , one of the mujahideen factions that was fighting in Afghanistan 's growing , post - Soviet civil war .
During this time , the FBI claims , Boyd attended three " terrorist training camps " in Sadr , Khalden and Jawr – camps that only a few years earlier had been funded with tens of millions of dollars in covert CIA funding .
The Boyds ' Pakistan adventure soured dramatically in 1991 .
A Peshawar court convicted the brothers of robbing a bank of $ 3,200 , and handed down a shocking sentence : the amputation of their left hands and right feet .
" This is not an Islamic court , it is a court of unbelievers , " Daniel Boyd yelled as he was led away .
But the ruling was overturned on appeal , and the Boyds returned to America .
This colourful history will be explored in Boyd 's trial , due to start later this year .
But first there are unresolved matters involving his alleged accomplice , Kenan .
The young American is due back in court on 5 September to face minor charges from last year 's unlikely trip through the tribal belt .
His lawyer , Ghawas Khan , predicts a rapid acquittal .
" There is no evidence against him , I am 100 % sure . "
More pressing questions loom at home .
One witness told the FBI that Kenan " attempted to recruit him to travel to Pakistan to engage in violent jihad " .
Prosecutors refuse to say whether they will seek his extradition .
" We 're trying to actually locate him , " said Robin Zier , spokeswoman for the US attorney 's office in Raleigh .
Ghawas Khan said he had not even heard of the American charges until the Guardian approached him .
Despite repeated requests he could not provide a contact number for his client .
" All I can say is that the authorities here know he is totally innocent , " he said .
" He 's just a baby . "
I ’m at HacPDX working on judy , a finite - map like interface to the classic judy arrays library , which provides fast and scalable mutable collection types for Haskell .
While developing this library , where performance is the primary concern , I ’m making heavy use of Bryan O’Sullivan ’s new criterion benchmarking and statistics suite , announced recently at the Haskell Implementors Workshop .
Criterion is awesome .
It is going to change how we design high performance libraries in Haskell .
Read on to see why .
The Judy bindings for Haskell store Haskell keys and values in judy arrays , with resources tracked by a Foreign Ptr on the Haskell heap .
They provide a mutable , imperative collection type , similar to the old Data .
HashTable ( now slated for removal ) , but with an interface closer to Data .
Map .
The key benefit over previous hashtable implementations for Haskell is that the judy bindings scale very well , as we shall see .
Also , unlike , say , Data .
IntMap , judy arrays are mutable , making them less useful for some applications .
They are not a solution for all container problems .
However , if you need large scale collections , the judy binding might be appropriate .
The library is under active development , and currently approximates a mutable IntMap structure , with more work planned to add optimized hashes , type - family based representation switching , and more .
It has a straight forward interface :
new :: JA a => IO ( JudyL a ) insert :: JA a => Key -> a -> JudyL a -> IO ( ) lookup :: JA a => Key -> JudyL a -> IO ( Maybe a ) delete :: Key -> JudyL a -> IO ()
Let ’s look at the performance profile .
Insertion
Here we measure the cost for inserting 1 k , 100k and 10 M consecutive word - sized keys and values , over repeated runs .
Criterion takes care of the measurement and rendering .
First 1 k values :
Above , we see the timings for 100 runs of inserting one thousand values into an empty judy array .
The fastest times were around 0.22ms ( 220 microseconds ) to build the table of 1000 values .
The slowest was around 230 microseconds .
A tight cluster .
Criterion can then compute the probability density curve , showing a good clumping of times .
Next we see that inserting one hundred thousand elements takes about 100x longer .
That is , it scales linearly , as the docs suggest it should .
We go from 1 k elements in 0.2 ms to 100 k in 20ms .
Here we see a good clustering of values again .
There ’s very little variance .
I can reliably insert 100k elements in 20ms .
Now the bigger test , 10 million elements .
Again , the performance of the Judy bindings scales linearly with input size .
0.2 ms for 1 k , 20ms for 100k , ~ 2.2s for 10 M , though there are two distinct performance bands at 10 M elements .
The density function shows the performance clusters quite clearly .
A peak around 2.2s and a broader peak around 2.4s .
Judy arrays scale very , very well .
I was able to insert 100 million elements in 22s ( 10 x slower again ) , using < 1G of memory .
IntMap at equilvalent N exhausted memory .
Data .
HashTable
The main problem with Data .
HashTable is its reliance on the garbage collector to not get in the way .
As the hash sizes grow , heap pressure becomes more of an issue , and the GC runs more often , swamping performance .
However , for smaller workloads , and with decent default heap sizes Data .
HashTable outperforms the Judy bindings :
While at larger sizes Data .
HashTable performance degrades , taking on average 5.6s to insert 10 M elements ( using +RTS - H1000M - A500M ) .
With default heap settings Data .
HashTable has very poor performance , as GC time dominates the cost .
That is , the Data .
HashTable , at N=10 M is 20 x slower than Judy arrays , and with optimized heap settings , Data .
HashTable is 2.5 x slower than judy .
Data .
IntMap and Data .
Map
We can also measure the imperative lookup structures againts persistance , pure structures : Data .
IntMap ( a big-endian patricia tree ) and Data .
Map ( a size - balanced tree ) .
Data .
IntMap at N=10 M , with default heap settings takes on average 7.3s to insert 10 M elements , or about 3.3 x slower than judy arrays ( and slower than the optimized HashTable ) .
Data .Map at N=10 M , with default heap settings , takes on average 24.8s to insert 10 M elements , or about 11 x slower than judy arrays .
Conclusions
At small scale , ( under 1M elements ) , for simple atomic types being stored , there are a variety of container types available on Hackage which do the job well : IntMap is a good choice , as it is both flexible and fast .
At scale , however , judy arrays seem to be the best thing we have at the moment , and make an excellent choice for associative arrays for large scale data .
For very large N , it may be the only in - memory option .
You can get judy arrays for Haskell on Hackage now .
I ’ll follow up soon with benchmarks for lookup and deletion , and how to generalize the interface .

Mud is supposed to make pigs happy , but it does not work on him .
It does not work .

Description :
Remember that first time you visited a really nice expensive steak house and were shocked that your steak did n’t come with anything but the steak on a plate ?
Those amazing mushrooms or curly fries or green beans were an extra $ 5 each .
How could they do that ?
Oh , and since then , at every restaurant you go to , you wish you could just order sides .
I know you do .
I do .
Well , now you can get all the sides you want .
From the creators of the wonderful BrunchBox , they give you side cart .
I first saw the menu for side cart on FaceBook and it immediately made me drool .
So many options for sides , and almost everything on the menu is vegetarian .
Hushpuppies , seasoned curly fries , onion straws , cheesy tots , vegetable medley , okra bites , mac and cheese .
And all of the offerings are under $ 3 , so you can get a couple .
Upon my first visit , I really could n’t decide what I was hungry for and then I saw the option of mix and match – 3 items for $ 5 .
I opted for okra bites , mac and cheese shells and baked beans .
As you can see , these are n’t tiny portions , but enough to sate you for lunch .
You can order larger portions of each item on the menu if you so desire .
The okra bites were my favorite that day .
Little crunchy nibbles of goodness .
I know many do n’t like okra , but for me , it is one of the best tasting veggies out there .
The mac and cheese was appropriately cheesy with the shells perfectly al dente .
The beans were simple , like those you would pick up at a BBQ .
Nothing here was over the top nor too fancy and that is what I liked .
They served up a great meal at a great price with a great portion .
side cart has daily specials and “ Meatless Monday . ”
You should watch their Twitter feed for those or just swing by .
They do offer desert in the form of a battered and deep fried candy bar .
Lastly , there is a line item on the menu –
How ’s - this - for - awesome – you bring us something edible , we batter ( sweet or savory ) & fry it . $ 1-$3
I understand a certain someone who likes food carts is challenging them with items like squash and thin mints .
side cart is yet another example of a cart I would n’t have thought of , but Portland has embraced and loves .
When your out and about , even if you already have your lunch , drop by side cart for a little extra…and tell them Food Carts Portland sent ya .
Sample Menu :
[ prices reflect side portions .
full orders are available ]
Seasoned curly fries – $ 1.50
Zucchini sticks – $ 3
Hushpuppies – $ 2
Tater tots – $ 2
Cheesy tots – $ 3
Okra bites – $ 2
Mashed potatoes – $ 1.50
Mac and cheese shells – $ 2
Stuffing – $ 2
Thanksgiving : mashed potatoes , stuffing , vegs – $ 5
Mix and match any 3 dishes – $ 5
Smorgasfry : curly fries + tots + onion straws – $ 5
Battered and deep fried candy bar – $ 2-$3

Green Fridge Invention Uses Almost No Electricity
Nearly every household has a fridge that completely wastes at least 30 kwh of energy every month .
Most of that energy is wasted every time you open the door .
Cold air is heavier ( warm air rises , remember ? ) so it falls out onto the floor every time you open your fridge , and warm air from outside rises to fill the space it left .
But with a top opening fridge ; even if you leave the door wide open , gravity effortlessly keeps the heavy cold air down , inside the fridge .
Using this principle , a clever Australian inventor , Tom Chalko has converted a deep freeze into an incredibly efficient refrigerator .
He chose a freezer because they are top opening .
The only difference between a freezer and a fridge is the temperature maintained inside : freezers are colder .
Freezers maintain freezing temperatures , while fridges operate somewhere between 0 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit .
But , if converted to a fridge , it only has to run for a minute or two every hour to maintain normal fridge temperatures .
So turning a freezer into a fridge just meant installing a simple external thermostat to cut the power off when it reaches the temperature that Tom set .
( Carried away with his energy reduction ; he also took out the 15 watt interior light bulb , but he will reconsider this , if he ever finds some reason “ for opening my fridge in the dark . ” )
His home - made fridge uses much energy in 24 hours as a 100 Watt light bulb gets through in just an hour .
Not only is it energy efficient ; but it ’s absolutely silent too .
The thing is only running for a minute or two every hour .
At all other times it is perfectly quiet and consumes no power whatsoever .
I wonder why no company has thought of this easy way to cut energy use in fridges ?
All you clever designers out there ; leave your thoughts on how to make a top - open fridge easy to get stuff in and out of .
You just need a way for drawers to slide up , so you can access the depths without leaning down into a huge box .
Devise your system so it needs no electricity , of course .

At first I thought it was the map for some game level .
Or the plans for a new secret underground station of the Dharma Initiative .
The answer is a lot more bizarre than that , as the video shows :
Click to view
Believe it or not , those are the plans for an 8 - bit processor which actually exists .
A processor that runs exclusively on air impulses .
Here 's an image of this strange device , created by Minsoung Rhee and Mark Burns at the University of Michigan , Ann Arbor .
Advertisement
Instead of electric impulses or spasers , the processor uses pneumatic valves , which are operated by changing the air pressure in a tiny chamber below each air channel .
The binary signals are transmitted with air : Sucking means 0 , blowing means 1 .
Poetry , people .
This is what this thing really is .
Pure poetry in action .
[ New Scientist ]
Let ’s see , Leon Black of Apollo Management , which is a very savvy real estate player , warned of a coming “ black hole ” in commercial real estate six months ago .
US bank regulators seem to be taking warnings of his sort seriously only now .
The Fed is poking its nose into the portfolios of some banks , oddly taking great care to say these are NOT stress tests ( is that meant to say they are not bogus and actually involve people who might know a tad about the underlying assets ? )
Reader John L provided this tidbit :
I just spoke with a friend who does environmental studies for banks before they lend against the properties .
He said that the FDIC is in the process of getting pre-approved bidders for work of this sort , mostly sampling of the air and soil on the sites .
His problem was with the bidding process , they wanted a flat bid for a sample from the northeast ( NY , VT , MA , NH , CT , RI , PA , DE ) .
His answer was to quadruple his cost .
The majority of the cost is getting someone there ( background check required ) to take the sample .
The US was split into 7 zones .
Flat item bid for each type of sample in each zone .
Just thought it was interesting , maybe the FDIC is thinking they are going to have to get into the CRE buisiness in a big way .
For those who are curious about such matters , the consultant looks at the deed to see who owned the property in the past , which determines whether sampling is needed .
Pretty much every gas station is a Superfund site .
Dry cleaners and auto repair shops also get flagged .
The Financial Times reports on the Fed ’s efforts .
This is being positioned more as research than bank - level exams , but it begs the question of why they waited so long to get the overview .
Brewster is a minor league baseball player .
Unknown to him , he had a ( recently deceased ) rich relative .
In order to test if Brewster knows the value of money , he is given the task of disposing of $ 30 m in 30 days .
Brewster is n't allowed to have any assets to show for the $ 30 m or waste the money in any way .
If successful , Brewster gets to inherit $ 300 m .
The biggest problem of all however , is that Brewster can't tell anyone what he 's doing , so everyone thinks he 's crazy .
Add to this the fact that if he fails , two scheming trustees will get their hands on the money , Brewster 's task is not an easy one .

From the BLS :
Nonfarm payroll employment continued to decline in August ( - 216,000 ) , and the unemployment rate rose to 9.7 percent , the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today .
Although job losses continued in many of the major industry sectors in August , the declines have moderated in recent months .
Click on graph for larger image .
This graph shows the unemployment rate and the year over year change in employment vs. recessions .
Nonfarm payrolls decreased by 216,000 in August .
The economy has lost almost 5.83 million jobs over the last year , and 6.93 million jobs during the 20 consecutive months of job losses .
The unemployment rate increased to 9.7 percent .
This is the highest unemployment rate in 26 years .
Year over year employment is strongly negative .
The second graph shows the job losses from the start of the employment recession , in percentage terms ( as opposed to the number of jobs lost ) .
For the current recession , employment peaked in December 2007 , and this recession was a slow starter ( in terms of job losses and declines in GDP ) .
However job losses have really picked up over the last year , and the current recession is now the 2nd worst recession since WWII in percentage terms ( and the 1948 recession recovered very quickly ) - and also in terms of the unemployment rate ( only early ' 80s recession was worse ) .
The economy is still losing jobs at about a 2.6 million annual rate , and the unemployment rate will probably be above 10 % soon .
This is still a weak employment report - just not as bad as earlier this year .
Much more to come ...
MILLBURN , N.J. 
The principal of Millburn High , New Jersey ’s top - ranked high school , says it has gone on for a decade : annual hazing by senior girls who create a “ slut list ” of incoming freshmen for the first day of school .
A dozen or more names are written on a piece of notebook paper , with crass descriptions , and copies are passed around  hundreds this year , some say .
“ We ’ve had girls  which is one of the bad things  obsessed that their names are on it , and girls who were upset that they did n’t make the list , ” said the principal , William Miron .
“ It ’s basically vulgar . ”
And that is not the only type of hazing that goes on , some girls say .
Seniors blow whistles in some girls ’ faces and jostle or push them into lockers , leaving them afraid to come to school the next day .
These tales were out in the open on Friday after half a dozen parents complained to public school officials and a discussion of hazing on a private e-mail group for mothers made its way around this Essex County township .
Remember those choose your own adventure books that you used to read as a kid ?
As you read through the book , you come to these points where you have to make a decision for the main character , and depending on what you chose , a tailored adventure would divulge itself .
It always seemed like death was a common ending no matter what path you chose though .
Michael Niggel of Hazard Creative took a look at Journey Under the Sea , and mapped out all possible paths .
It turns out that death and unfavorable endings are in fact much more likely than the rest .
That somehow seems wrong , no ?
I liken it to something like … even in your own fantasy , you die or end with an unfavorable outcome .
Such is life , I suppose .

DIY beverage bubbles
I drink a lot of seltzer .
So much that my fiancee says I could n’t survive without bubbles in my water .
After trying a SodaClub home soda maker ( picture above right ) and realizing it would cost $ 70 to buy a special part for it , I found a really detailed resource for building my own , simple home carbonation system for under a $ 100 using a CO2 tank , regulator , hose and a carbonator cap ( details below ) .
It took ten minutes to build .
I love having very good homemade soda on the cheap and not having to lug around seltzer bottles or worry about it going flat .
With a scuba - like tank in the kitchen , guests always ask “ What is that ? ! ” and I really love demonstrating .
When one friend of mine said he did n’t like soda , I whipped him up a mango soda from this special puree of mango I had .
He absolutely loved it !
And a by - product of the cost of producing low cost seltzer water is that I can experiment with different flavored sodas .
I mean some really wacky stuff , like lychee - tangerine or coconut - lucuma .
If I do n’t like it , or it tastes weird , I do n’t feel guilty about draining the entire liter or two - liter bottle .
My 20lb system makes over 1133 liters of carbonated water .
In practice , efficiency is not perfect , with unavoidable losses in the hose and headspace .
But at current prices of $ 20 per 20 lb tank - fill , the cost to convert tap water to seltzer is under $ 0.02 cents per liter .
A single fill of a 20lb tank charges over 500 bottles , which will keep you supplied for 1.5 years if you consume an average of one bottle daily .
In terms of break even , assuming that you can find liter bottles of seltzer water for $ 0.99 per bottle , then it ’ll take roughly 100 bottles for the system to break even .
I definitely drink a liter a day , so it only took about 3 months for me to break even — not to mention all of the labor and space that it saves to lug in and store 8.3 dozen liter bottles of seltzer water .
I found a CO2 tank on eBay for about $ 30 bucks , including shipping .
I use a dual gauge CO2 regulator ; a single gauge one for CO2 output would work also , but I prefer the dual as it also tells you the amount of gas in the CO2 canister ( $ 20 on eBay ) .
You also need a hose ( or “ gas fitting tube ” ) .
To avoid the site ’s detailed instructions on how to fit the CO2 hose onto a 1 - liter bottle of soda , I bought a special carbonator cap that lets you easily insert the hose ( $ 11 from Northern Brewer ) .
You ca n’t refill a CO2 tank in NYC , as it violates several ordinances .
However , you can exchange your empty tank for a full one for $ 20 at a local welding supply place ; other spots include keg brewers and anywhere that refills fire extinguishers .
( I got mine refilled at McKinney ’s Welding Supply Co. at 535 W 52nd Street , New York , NY 10019 . )
The operating instructions are fairly straightforward .
On a dual gauge tank there are two gauges and two valves , one for the main tank and one for the output .
The valve between the CO2 tank and the regulator , I ’ll call the CO2 valve and the valve between the regulator and the carbonator cap , I ’ll call the output valve :
1 ) Fill up a one - or two - liter bottle .
2 ) Screw on the carbonator cap fairly tight ( it ’s a ball release
cap , so you simply push the entire cap to release it from the hose afterwards )
3 ) Make sure the Output valve is completely shut off
4 ) Turn on the CO2 valve and watch the CO2 tank gauge shoot up ( this will be
the remaining pressure in your tank )
5 ) Slowly turn the Output valve open until the pressure reaches about 50 PSI
( I ’ve been experimenting with various PSI ’s — 50 PSI works best for me )
6 ) As you feel the bottle get full ( do n’t worry , I read recently
that two - liter soda bottles are rated to handle 200 PSI ) , pick it up and start
shaking vigorously as you would a bar drink ( this helps carbonate the water ) .
7 ) Turn off the CO2 valve and then the Output valve
8 ) Remove the carbonator cap
Incidentally , it was a SodaClub home soda maker I bought on eBay that inspired me ultimately to build my own home carbonation unit .
The SodaClub unit has a proprietary design whereby it is nearly impossible to refill without a special adapter and the adapters I found online cost $ 70 bucks ( more than I paid for the SodaClub ) .
So rather than spend $ 70 to fix an inherent problem with the SodaClub ( and I would still need a 20 lb canister sitting somewhere in my house ) , I did some research and found this site .
For about $ 95 bucks — less than the cost of a new SodaClub ( they retail new for about $ 100 ) — I have more than 10 times the soda making capacity ( SodaClub claims you can get 110 liters of soda ) .
I should add that I ’ve seen plans on eBay for $ 5 or $ 10 bucks for how to construct your own soda fountain gun that spurts out bubbly water on demand .
With mine , the end result is the same , but the carbonator unit I built is so much simpler and cheaper and it does n’t require a heat sink or a refrigeration unit .

What is Negligence with Car Accidents ?
Fault or negligence issues can be complicated , and an experienced personal injury attorney will look to a number of sources , such as police reports , state traffic laws , and witnesses , to help you determine who was at fault for your accident .
13,000 people have been injured or killed since 1990 in crashes caused by aggressive driving alone .
Other causes of accidents where another driver may be at fault include but are not limited to reckless driving , speeding , failure to obey traffic laws , and weather conditions .
A person who negligently operates a vehicle may be required to pay for any damages , either to a person or property , caused by his or her negligence .
Generally , people who operate automobiles must exercise “ reasonable care under the circumstances . ”
A failure to use reasonable care is considered negligence .
The injured party , known as the plaintiff in a personal injury case , is required to prove that the defendant was negligent , that the negligence was a proximate cause of the accident , and that the accident caused the plaintiff ’s injuries .
If you have been involved in an accident , it is important that you seek legal counsel from an experienced accident lawyer in Pennsylvania .
Most Common Causes / Types of Car Accidents in PA and OH
While almost anything can cause an accident , there are certain factors that contribute to crashes in Pennsylvania and Ohio more than others .
In our years of experience representing auto accident victims , we ’ve learned that a handful of factors cause the majority of serious collisions , locally and around the country .
The three most common factors are as follows :
Distracted drivers .
Distracted driving killed 3,477 people nationwide in 2015 .
The fatality rates have increased in recent years due to cell phones and handheld electronic device use behind the wheel .
It is illegal to text on a handheld cell phone while driving in Pennsylvania .
if you have been hit by a distracted driver , speak to our Pittsburgh distracted driving accident lawyer .
Speeding .
Going above posted speed limits , or driving too fast for conditions , makes it almost impossible for drivers to control their vehicles .
They may not be able to stop in time to avoid striking another vehicle , object , or pedestrian .
They may take a turn too fast and roll over , or lose control and crash into other cars .
Drunk driving .
From 2003 to 2012 , 4,663 people in Pennsylvania died in alcohol - related motor vehicle crashes .
In PA , 1.8 % of people report driving after drinking too much in the last 30 days .
The age group most at risk of fatal accidents involving drunk drivers is 21 - to 34 - year - olds .
Reckless driving , poor weather conditions , red - light running , night driving , teenage drivers , vehicle part defects , unsafe lane changes , and drivers breaking roadway rules are other frequent contributing factors in Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh car accidents .
The best ways to protect yourself from accidents are to always obey the law , never drive while drunk or distracted , and to practice defensive driving techniques .

************************
From Chapter 4 : SEEK THE DEEPER STILLNESS
1
When the personal ego's thoughts and desires are stripped off ,
we behold ourselves as we were in the first state and as we
shall be in the final one .
We are then the Overself alone ,
in its Godlike solitude and stillness .
2
One feels gathered into the depths of the silence , enfolded by it
and then , hidden within it , intuits the mysterious inexplicable
invisible and higher power which must remain forever nameless .
3
A life with this infinite stillness as its background and centre seems
as remote from the common clay of everyday human beings , and especially
from their urban infatuation with noise and movement , as the asteroids .
4
This stillness is the godlike part of every human being .
In failing to look for it , he fails to make the most of
his possibilities .
If , looking , he misses it on the way ,
this happens because it is a vacuity : there is simply
nothing there !
That means no things , not even mental
things , that is , thoughts .
5
The spirit ( Brahman ) is NOT the stillness , but is found by humans
who are in the precondition of stillness .
The latter is their human
reaction to Brahman 's presence coming into their field of awareness .
6
That beautiful state wherein the mind recognizes itself for what it is ,
wherein all activity is stilled except that of awareness alone , and even
then it is an awareness without an object  this is the heart of
the experience .

My T - Mobile G1 is already a smartbook , is it not ?
Let me explain .
Â
I can surf the web , check e-mail , download and listen to podcasts , keep up with facebook / Twitter friends , use a variety of instant message clients , use Gmail as a word processor ( in a pinch ) and actually use this same device as a fully functional telephone .
Big deal , so is the iPhone , right ?
Â
Yes and no .
It can do all the above functions but , at the most two maybe three at a time .
I routinely use the G1 for simultaneous activity and connectivity .
Â Â This is the inherent beauty of what Google has allowed their developers and community to develop around Android .
Â
And because it is built on the Linux kernel there is no question about its reliability and security .
So based on the form factor and ability many of Android ’s phones may actually qualify as a smartbook : not quite a netbook but it can also be used as a full PC on the go with 3G and WiFi capabilities .
Add my Seidio extended battery to the mix and the device power is raised exponentially .
If they actually want some help they should convey their problem more clearly .

Sabato 26 , azione di disobbedienza per chiudere la centrale a carbone .
Verso il vertice sul clima COP15 .
Updates and reports in italiano and in english from modkraft.dk :
ore 19.00 last news
Dopo aver cercato per alcune ore di sfondare i cordoni di protezione della polizia per entrare nella centrale energetica a carbone e fermare la produzione , gli attivisti sono tornati a Christianshavns Torv. Tannie Nyboe , portavoce della rete Shut It down dichiara :
" Siamo molto soddisfatti che così tante persone abbiano mostrato la loro opposizione alla produzione danese di energia derivata dal carbone ed ai suoi effetti devastanti sul nostro clima .
Questo dimostra che ci sono moltissime persone che non sono disposte ad aspettare che siano i politici a fare qualcosa per risolvere i problemi .
Oggi abbiamo mandato un segnale forte , non possono piu ' far finta di nulla sui cambiamenti climatici .
Devono subito intervenire , e fermare le centrali a carbone . "
" Questo è solo l'inizio " - conclude - " Ci sono moltissime centrali a carbone in Danimarca che stanno distruggendo il clima .
Non ci fermeremo adesso ! "

L'intera cronaca della giornata
ore 18:54
La compagnia energetica svedese Vattenfall che possiede la centrale di carbone di Copenhagen ha dichiarato che la giornata " climate action " è stata uncomfortable sia per gli impiegati che per la compagnia .
ore 18:10
E' notizia confermata che 150 sono i manifestanti arrestati .
Numerosi manifestanti stanno per essere " accompagnati " negli autobus della polizia , mentre altri stanno facendo resistenza passiva seduti in gruppi , ma circondati da poliziotti in assetto antisommossa .
ore 18.00
la situazione è caotica .
La polizia ha cercato di disperdere i manifestanti e di effettuare numerosi arresti .
Fonti non ufficiali parlano di almeno 100 - 150 arresti .
ore 17:45
C'è una situazione bizzarra nel campo sulla sinistra della centrale di carbone .
Poliziotti e manifestanti si strattonano reciprocamente in cordoni .
Come ci riferisce un giornalista di Modkraft sembra un tango collettivo .
Un manifestante è stato arrestato .
Il camion con il soundsystem del corteo è ora circondato dalla polizia .
ore 17:44
5 blindati della polizia sono sopraggiunti all 'entra di Amagerværket a Kraftværksvej .
La polizia è scesa dai mezzi e sta attaccando un blocco di 3-400 persone che si trovano in quel punto .
Scontri diffusi tra polizia e manifestanti .
Molti possono essere arrestati .
ore 17:37
La polizia continua ad urlare : " Usate i manganelli ! Manganellateli !!! "
Più di 200 persone hanno invaso il campo vicino a Amagerværket e occupato l'area .
" La situazione è nel caos " riporta un giornalista di ' Modkraft.dk '
ore 17:12
La polizia sta attaccando i manifestanti .
La carica è violenta e stanno manganellando indiscriminatamente .
" E ' di una violenza inaudita " testimona un reporter di Modkraf .
ore 16:49
Il green - block ed il purple - block si sono adesso congiunti nella Vindmøllevej street .
Adesso sono quindi raddoppiati .
Ci sono meno poliziotti nella Vindmøllevej , ci si aspetta quindi che il tentativo di sfondare i cordoni di polizia possa avvenire in questo punto a breve .
ore 16.34
Gli attivisti stanno tagliando le recinzioni .
Ma non sono ancora dentro la centrale .
ore 16:25
Il green - block ha forzato il primo cordone di polizia .
E' successo dopo lo slogan collettivo " Noi adessi ci muoviamo .
Avanti ! " .
C'è un'altro dispiegamento di polizia a 50 metri , dove la polizia sta aspettando con mezzi blindati .
Ci sono anche poliziotti nel campo e sui tetti .
Gli attivisti avanzano urlando : " It 's not your business , not your business "
Il green - block sta strattonando i cordoni della polizia .
ore 16:24
La polizia ha caricato il purple - block il quale risponde muovendosi verso l'entrata principale .
Circa un centinaio gli attivisti che fanno parte di questo gruppo .
Un 'altro gruppo di 50 manifestanti si è diretto invece verso la seconda entrata della centrale .
L'atmosfera è tuttavia calma , ma tesa .
ore 16:20
Il green - blocks adesso è di fronte alle recenzioni della centrale .
La polizia ha avvisato i manifestanti di fermarsi e rispettare i divieti .
I manifestanni stanno urlando " Shut it down , shut it down ! ! "
ore 16:17
Il purple - block è adesso a 50 metri dal cordone della polizia .
La polizia dagli altoparlanti avvisa che se saranno rotte le recinzioni la polizia caricherà senza indugio .
La manifestazione si muove lentamente .
ore 16:07
La manifestazione si è ora divisa in alcuni gruppi .
Il purple block corre verso la centrale dalla strada " Kraftværksvej " puntando all 'entrata principale .
Il green - block invece si dirige verso Forlandet , ossia puntando al lato sinistro della centrale stessa.ore 16:06
Il purple - block che costituisce la testa del corteo ha cominciato ad equippagiarsi con protezioni e maschere .
ore 16.00
Il corteo sta per arrivare in prossimità della centrale di carbone .
I manifestanti si stanno dispiegando in gruppi di affinità dislocandosi nell ' area intorno alla centrale .
Stanno per cominciare le azioni di disobbedienza .
La disposizione dei gruppi ricorda la tattica a 5 fingers già utilizzata a Rostock .
ore 15.18
Circa 1500 - 2000 attivisti stanno marciando verso la centrale di carbone .
La rete Shut It Down ha chiesto in una conferenza stampa alle forze di polizia danesi di non incrementare la tensione quando gli attisti provaranno a invadere la centrale .
" Chiediamo che la polizia non usi violenza e che non renda più tesa la situazione .
Abbiamo annunciato pubblicamente che sarà organizzata un' azione pacifica di disobbedienza per interrompere la combustione di carbone nella centrale energetica , che sta danneggiando il clima " Dice Sophie Werenskiold della rete Shut It Down .
Ore 14.47
2 elicotteri della polizia stanno sorvolando la centrale Amagerværket .
Gli elicotteri sorvolano tutte le imbarcazioni per controllare se ci siano attivisti a bordo .
Al concentramento di Christianshavns Torv ci sono tra i 500 ed i 1000 manifestanti in questo momento .
Si susseguono interventi della rete
Shut it Down che sostengono che le centrali energetiche a carbone minacciano il clima globale e che ogni azione di disobbedienza civile è legittima .
Circa 30 attivisti del cosiddetto purple - block si sono vestiti in tuta bianca e si stanno attrezzando con protezioni corporali per difendersi dalla violenza della polizia .
Anche il green - block è pronto a partire .
ore 14.01
5 attivisti del gruppo acquatico Shut It Down sono stati fermati dalla guardia costiera quando hanno tentato di raggiungere a nuoto la centrale da Refshalevej .
Altri 3 attivisti stanno raggiungendo via mare la centrale da Christianshavns
Torv da dove parte la manifestazione .
Sono attrezzati con mute ed attrezzature subacquee .
ore 13.46
La polizia ha completamente riempito l'area intorno alla centrale Amagerværket , compreso il mare .
A poche centinaia di metri dalla centrale c'è una piccola nave e diverse imbarcazioni veloci della polizia .
La militarizzazione dell ' area si fa sempre piu' serrata .
ore 13.30
4 pullman e numerosi blindati della polizia si sono concentrati all 'entrata di
Amagerværket , la centrale di carbone .
Ci sono circa 30 poliziotti per ogni mezzo che stanziano alll ' ingresso mentre altri ufficiali muniti di cani e a cavallo presidiano l'area interna .
Alcuni gendarmi sono piazzati anche sul tetto della centrale .
La centrale è controllata anche con elicotteri e a 100 metri dall ' area è stata costruita una recinzione di ferro fissata su blocchi di cemento rivolti verso il mare in entrambi i lati della centrale .
Questo per difendere la stessa da eventuali incursioni dal mare .
Stop talking , Shut it down !
Il carbone è il più pericoloso combustibile fossile dispobinibile sul pianeta .
Emette più CO 2 per unità di calore e le sue polveri implementano l'effetto serra attraendo radiazione solare aggiuntiva .
Dobbiamo lasciare il carbone in situ invece di bruciarlo se vogliamo evitare la fusione dei ghiacciai in Groenlandia e ed in Antartide , ed una catastrofe climatica !
Basta parlare , chiudiamo la centrale di carbone a Copenhagen !
( Danish climate activists )
Con queste parole è cominciato il tam tam nelle reti danesi per promuovere Shut It Down ! , la settimana di mobilit / azioni verso il vertice mondiale sul clima di dicembre , il COP15 ( Conference Of Parties ) , che si terrà a Copenhagen il prossimo dicembre .
Lo hanno dichiarato pubblicamente dalle assemblee dentro la cittadella autogestita di Christiania :
" Sabato 26 chiuderemo la centrale di carbone di Copenhagen e a dicembre invaderemo le strade della città per fermare il vertice " .
We are ready , the weather is with us !
Copenhagen 26th ,
Shut it down : la mappa delle azioni .
Shut It Down è un'azione di disobbedienza civile di massa che vuole chiudere il 26 ottobre la centrale di carbone a Copenhagen .
SHUT IT DOWN claims :
- market solutions produce profit , not better climate
- climate justice for the global south now !
- and STOP burning fossil fuels , ... bastards
What is the problem with Atheism ?
Atheism is more than just a problem for faith .
It fails to qualify as science .
A good science pursues naturalistic explanations of natural phenomena .
The tradition of biology begun with Charles Darwin in 1859 and running down to the present time is good science .
Darwinism provides the most adequate natural explanations for the evolution of one species out of a previous species .
As good science , it avoids saying anything about Gods action in the world .
Because science tells us how creatures act with regard to one another , we do not expect science to say anything directly about the creator .
For a scientist to conclude that there is no God - which is the conclusion of the atheist - is simply unwarranted by the science .
Atheism fails to be scientific , because science deals with the world of creatures , not the realm of the creator .
Charles Darwin , who gave us the concept of evolution as descent with modification ,  was no atheist .
He belonged to the Church of England ; and he entertained agnostic ideas .
Darwin has drawn followers who are atheists , however .
Thomas Huxley in the late 19th century used evolutionary theory to argue for naturalism without belief in God .
In our own era , Richard Dawkins of Oxford writes in his book , The Blind Watchmaker ( Norton 1987 ) ,  Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist ( p.6 ) .
We believe this is a colossal error in logic .
Darwin s model of evolution is good science ; but good science does not require atheism .
There is no step in the scientific method that says at this point , abandon belief in God. 

Marc reported earlier today that there 's been a strategic shift in the White House 's health care reform efforts : to pose insurance companies as the enemy , tying them to the Republican Party and all who oppose White House - led reforms .
( As Marc noted , insurance companies are n't exactly the opposition -- they 've publicly supported the reform cause from the beginning , and America 's Health Insurance Plans , the industry group for health insurers , has run an ad supporting bipartisan reforms .
Bipartisan reforms likely wo n't include a public option , but bipartisanship is the current M.O. of Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus , who is negotating with committee Republicans on a deal . )
Well , there will be a new TV ad on cable nationwide this week seeking to do just that , though it 's not from the White House .
The liberal group Americans United for Change ( a prominent member of the liberal activist / labor coalition Health Care for America Now ! , which will do most of the field work backing Obama 's reforms this August ) released it this morning .
It focuses primarily on the salary of Cigna CEO H. Edward Hanway :

" Big fish eat little fish , " says the wisdom of the city .
Meet Buttkiss , the black pacu who has eaten more than 175,000 fish during his residence in Queens .
“ We feed him twenty - five goldfish every other day , ” says Steve Gruebel , the owner of Cameo Pet Shop in Richmond Hill .
You do the math .
He ’s been in the shop continuously since 1970 , becoming a Richmond Hill landmark in that time .
Why has n’t he been sold already ?
“ We actually sold him in 1968 to a Holocaust survivor named Kurt Emerick .
The fish was about two inches long at that time .
But he got so big he was knocking things over in Kurt ’s fishtank .
Kurt did n’t like that .
He was a perfectionist .
So he brought him back here in a bucket .
Later Kurt got hit by a bus on Metropolitan Avenue and died .
But the fish is still here .
I had just gotten back from Nam and I decided to keep him . ”
The fish has some personality too .
Named after the famed linebacker Dick Butkus ( though Steve corrected my spelling to " Buttkiss " ) , he will come to Steve 's hand because he knows that 's where the food comes from .
“ You can see the marks on the top of his head .
He ’ll bang on the top of the tank when he ’s hungry .
” Pacus are in the piranha family .
The New York Aquarium did not get back to us when we asked whether or not the fish could possibly be that old , but residents of Richmond Hill swear the fish has been there the whole time , in the same 75 - gallon tank .
When I walked around the block to go to the ( excellent ) Alfie ’s Pizzeria , Louie , Alfie ’s son , said , “ That fish !
That fuckin’ fish !
Is that fuckin’ fish unbelievable or what ?
When we ’re all dead and gone that fish will still be there . ”
( CNN ) -- A Muslim teenager from Ohio says her father threatened to kill her because she converted to Christianity .
Rifqa
Bary claims her father wants her dead after she converted to Christianity .
Rifqa Bary , 17 , ran away from her family in Columbus , Ohio , in July and took refuge in the central Florida home of the Rev. Blake Lorenz with the Global Revolution Church in Orlando .
The teen heard of the pastor and his church through a prayer group on Facebook .
The girl 's parents reported her missing to Columbus police , who found her two weeks later in Florida through cell phone records .
The teenager , in a sworn affidavit , claims her father , Mohamed Bary , 47 , was pressured by the mosque the family attends in Ohio to " deal with the situation . "
In the court filing , Rifqa Bary stated her father said , " If you have this Jesus in your heart , you are dead to me ! "
The teenager claims her father added , " I will kill you ! "
Mohamed Bary told CNN a lot of false information has been given and " we would n't do her harm . "
He knew his daughter was involved with Christian organizations .
" I have no problem with her practicing any faith , " he said , but Bary admitted he would have preferred his daughter to practice the Muslim faith first .
Although Mohamed Bary said he did not expect his daughter to run away , Rifqa Bary was placed in foster care by an Orlando judge in August while the Florida Department of Children and Family investigated the threat allegations against the parents .
In a court filing Monday , John Stemberger , Rifqa Bary 's attorney and president of the Christian advocacy organization Florida Family Policy Council , accused the parents '
Ohio mosque of having ties to terrorism and radical Islam .
The Noor Islamic Cultural Center has denied the allegations .
Stemberger told CNN he agreed with his client that she would be killed by radical Muslims if she is returned to Ohio .
" She is a person who is ripe for apostate killing or mercy killing .
I 'm not going to let my client slip away in the night by going back , " said Stemberger .
Roger Weeden , the mother 's attorney in Florida , said the filing had no credible evidence but instead was meant " just to inflame the community and the court . "
Weeden said he believes the teen 's attorney is trying to create an atmosphere of fear and intimidation .
The teen 's attorney said his client has endured a history of abuse from her family .
Stemberger said the young girl was forced to wear the Muslim headscarf called a hijab and was punched in the face by her father for being ashamed while wearing it .
Stemberger is asking the court to keep Rifqa Bary in the custody of the state of Florida until she turns 18 in a year .
Mohamed Bary , who is not a United States citizen , said he can't believe all the false allegations and the bad image caused by the situation .
" We are not bad people , " Bary said .
" We are not like that , we are normal . "
The mother 's attorney said the teenager was a normal girl , a cheerleader in Ohio , and what Muslim extremist would allow his daughter be a cheerleader ?
At a court hearing scheduled for Thursday in Orlando , the parents will have an opportunity to respond to the allegations against them .
Their attorney said the parents will deny all allegations .
After the court hearing , the judge may force all the parties involved into mediation , followed by an adjudication hearing .

Microsoft is to bring back a Mac version of Outlook , a move that will see the end of its current Mac OS X email , PIM and collaboration offering , Entourage .
This app will be canned when the next major release of Mac Office ships in late 2010 .
Entourage was released in 2000 , part of Office 2001 .
Entourage nominally replaced email package Outlook Express , but delivered a more Outlook - like array of functionality .
That was back in the Mac OS 8.5 era , and Entourage has since evolved to support OS X .
The most recent version was released in January 2008 .
For a while , MS offered a crude version of Outlook for the Mac , though it removed the email features - present in Outlook Express - when Office 98 was released .
Outlook , despite being compatible only with Mac OS 9 , was available to download - as Outlook 2001 - long after the release of OS X and Mac users ' shift away from Classic apps .
Entourage could , of course , have been Outlook , but at the time MS was facing criticism from Office users who increasingly saw the Mac version of the suite as a rough knock - off of the Windows version , especially given the un-Mac like nature of the product 's UI .
Entourage was intended to show that MS was serious about the needs of its Mac customers , who generated a tidy income for the software giant .
MS said the new Outlook has been built from scratch using Mac OS X's Cocoa API with full integration with Apple 's Spotlight data search technology and Time Machine back - ups .
It 'll incorporate a new , fast database and support information access rights management .
MS said it was announcing Outlook 's arrival so soon - more than 18 months from its release - " to meet the planning needs of enterprise customers " .
Clearly , big businesses want Outlook support on Macs in a way they never appear to have done before .
Entourage 's ousting implies they want full parity with the Windows version .
All of which suggests
Apple is doing better at selling Mac into business than it has traditionally been perceived as doing . ®
China 's pollution controls have failed to keep pace with economic development , the country 's environment minister has admitted as details emerged of another riot sparked by fears of industrial contamination .
In at least the third clash in as many weeks , 2,000 riot police fired tear gas and warning shots during a violent confrontation with anti-pollution protesters near an industrial plant in Quanzhou , Fujian Province .
The demonstrators destroyed cars , threw stones at police and took an official hostage last weekend in an attempt to sabotage a tannery and chemical plant that they blamed for a foul stench and high rates of cancer .
Tensions have risen as the smell has worsened , locals said .
According to the local government , the " rioters " badly beat four chemical factory employees , the chief of the nearby Chengping village and at least one policeman during sporadic fighting over the past week .
The authorities said the hostages have been freed and calm has been restored , but locals told the Guardian that at least 100 protestors were still blocking access to the plant .
" Do n't believe what the government is saying , " a resident named Zhang said by telephone .
Images posted anonymously online showed upturned cars and long ranks of police carrying shields and batons .
On a local government website , the odour problem is blamed on a broken pipe at the Quangang Urban Sewage Plant .
But residents said the facility , built about three years ago , discharged industrial waste that polluted the sea shore and threatened the health and incomes of local people .
" The stench is awful , " said a man , who gave only the surname Liu .
" Nobody wants to buy our fish .
We can't earn money .
The fishing boats have been abandoned on the shore . "
Calls to government offices in Quanzhou rang unanswered today .
Earlier in the week , the state - run Straits Metropolitan News , blamed " unlawful elements " for the trouble , but it said only 200 protesters were involved .
The clash in Fujian follows recent disturbances in Shaanxi and Hunan provinces , which has led to the arrest of 15 people , say authorities .
That unrest had been sparked by the lead poisoning of more than 2,000 children .
The government has acknowledged that it needs to do more to allay environmental health fears .
" Environmental quality is not satisfactory and environmental protection work is arduous , " environmental protection minister Zhou Shengxian told the People 's Daily .
— Terrorism charges against eight Triangle men are part of a wave of similar investigations federal law enforcement authorities have brought in recent years , according to experts .
Counter - terrorism has been the FBI 's top priority since the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks in New York and Washington , D.C. , said Frank Perry , who formerly oversaw the agency 's Raleigh office .
Every credible terrorism lead that comes into the FBI now must be disproved by an agent , he said .
" It used to be the discretion of management to decide what leads were looked at , " Perry said .
Joint terrorism task forces that were formed after 9/11 have boosted investigations , he said .
Previously , it was a felony for federal agents to share certain classified information with a local police chief or sheriff , he said , but the task forces allow cooperation between federal authorities and local and state agencies .
Authorities have n't disclosed how they uncovered the alleged terror plot , but investigating such cases often means using surveillance of phone lines and e-mail accounts .
Wiretaps in these cases usually require a warrant from a secret court in Washington under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
FISA sets out how intelligence on foreign agents in the U.S. , including suspected terrorists , can be gathered .
" There 's been a 10 - fold expansion of approvals of these types of warrants since 9/11 , so law enforcement has found them to be a very useful tool , " said David Schanzer , director of the Triangle Center of Terrorism and Homeland Security , a joint program between Duke University , the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill and research group RTI International .
Perry said the large increase in the number of warrants does n't mean they are easy to get , only that more cases where they are needed are being pursued .
The U.S. Attorney 's Office already has filed notices that it plans to use evidence gathered through FISA against the seven defendants who were arrested Monday .
Daniel Patrick Boyd , 39 , and his sons , Dylan Boyd , 22 , and Zakariya " Zak " Boyd , 20 , along with Hysen Sherifi , 24 , Mohammad Omar Aly Hassan , 22 , and Ziyad Yaghi , 21 , are expected to appear in federal court in Raleigh next Tuesday for detention hearings .
A seventh defendant , Anes Subasic , 33 , has requested a Yugoslavian interpreter for his detention hearing , so it 's unclear when that hearing will be held .
Federal authorities are seeking an unidentified eighth suspect in the case who is believed to be in Pakistan .
A WRAL News source has identified the suspect as Jude Kenan Mohammad , 20 , of Wake County .
The men are accused of trying to engage in terrorism in the Middle East and raising money , buying weapons and training in North Carolina to carry out their plan .
Schanzer , who tracks such cases nationwide , said at least 125 Americans have been prosecuted on terrorism charges in the past eight years .
Two - thirds were accused of plotting attacks outside the U.S. , he said .
" There 's really been a constant flow of these types of cases since 9/11 scattered all over the country , " he said .
" These are important cases .
These are potentially dangerous people .
It 's still a fringe element , ( so ) there 's a small number of cases . "

When Usain Bolt is no longer the main topic of conversation at the World Championships , you know something dramatic must have happened .
There had been whispers circulating about South African 800 m prodigy Caster Semenya ever since she ran a spectacular 1 minute 56.72 seconds in a low - key meet on 26 July .
Not only was it the fastest time in the world this year by more than a second , it meant she had improved her personal best by seven seconds in less than nine months .
And , she said afterwards , she could have run even quicker had it not been for a strong wind on the back straight .
For once , the tittle - tattle was not the usual sort about performance - enhancing substances .
This was more basic and a whole lot nastier : was the ' she ' actually a ' he ' ?
It was n't just the rapid time .
Semenya has a well - muscled physique .
She also has a dusting of facial hair .
Mix those three things together and ugly rumours spread like wildfire .
What no - one quite expected was the way the story would suddenly develop with the 800 m final just hours away .
Earlier in the week , it had been the stuff of bar - room banter .
The favourite quote was from Semenya 's coach Michael Seme , who had told reporters : " I can give you the telephone numbers of her room - mates in Berlin .
They have already seen her naked in the showers and she has nothing to hide . "
Seme also recounted how , when Semenya recently tried to use the women 's toilets at a petrol station in Cape Town , the attendants tried to direct her to the gents instead .
" Caster just laughed and asked if they would like her to take off her pants to show them she was a woman , " said Seme .
" We understand that people will ask questions because she looks like a man .
It 's a natural reaction and it's only human to be curious . "
So far , so amusing - but the atmosphere began to change when Semenya charged through her heat and semi-final in such dominant fashion that she was suddenly the red - hot favourite for gold .
What had been a story known only to athletics aficionados suddenly had legs .
Questions started being asked of athletics ' ruling body , the IAAF .
The jokes started getting more unpleasant .
The ' c ' word - cheat - rose to the surface .
Cynics recalled the famous case of German high jumper Dora Ratjen , who competed at the Olympics here in Berlin in 1936 but was later revealed to be a chap named Hermann .
The comparison was ridiculous - Ratjen was forced to conceal his gender by the Nazi government and had been born and raised a man - and the reaction from the South African team indignant .
' She is a female , " insisted general manager Molatelo Malehopo .
" We are completely sure about that .
We would not have entered her into the female competition if we had any doubts . "
Then , with just three hours to go until the final , news broke in Berlin that the IAAF had asked Semenya to take a gender test .
The story fizzed round the Olympiastadion .
What did the test involve ?
When would the results be known ?
Would Semenya even be allowed to run ?
Gradually the prevailing mood shifted .
Why was this coming out now ?
In the case of a doping test , the media are not notified unless both ' A ' and ' B ' samples have tested positive .
Until then there is silence .
Yet here a cloud of official suspicion was being allowed to gather before anything had been proved .
That any woman would be confronted with such serious accusation in front of a worldwide audience of millions struck many as callous .
That it was an 18 - year - old from Limpopo province at her first major senior championships seemed cruel in the extreme .
Semenya was on the warm - up track while inside the gossip flew round the adjacent main stadium .
" The timing has caught us out , " admitted an IAAF spokesman as the eight finalists were called together .
As Semenya emerged onto the track from the pre-race call - room , the photographers ' long lenses swung in unison and locked on her face .
She looked implausibly calm under her neat corn-rows .
On the blocks she waited for the television camera to come in close on her and then mimed brushing something from her shoulders .
That there were two British girls in the final - Jenny Meadows and Marilyn Okoro , both with a chance of a medal - had almost been forgotten .
As if trying to escape the furore , the South African went off at breakneck speed .
Reigning champ Janeth Jepkosgei took over for a few brief seconds on the back straight but was left struggling as the teenager took them through the bell in under 57 seconds , a blistering pace .
While the rest of the field went backwards , Semenya went again .
Coming into the final straight she had a lead of five metres .
At the line it was two and a half seconds , the biggest margin in World Championship history and another big personal best .
Yet while Jepkosgei and Meadows - a brilliant third - went off for laps of honour , Semenya was ushered away by officials , straight past the hordes of waiting journalists .
At the winner 's news conference half an hour later , there was no sign of the teenager .
" To protect her , " explained a weary IAAF secretary general Pierre Weiss .
For the hundreds of reporters waiting , this was not enough .
Where were the tests done ?
" At a special hospital here and in South Africa . "
When were they finished ?
" They are ongoing . "
Why was this not sorted earlier ?
Semenya had run the 800 m at the Commonwealth Youth Games as long ago as last October , albeit in a vastly slower time .
" She was unknown three weeks ago .
Nobody could have anticipated this .
We are fast , but we are not a lion . "
What had Weiss heard so far ?
" Personally , " he said , his moustache drooping even lower than normal , " I have no clue what is going on .
I rely on and trust our doctors . "
One thing was made clear : if the tests , whenever they do come out , subsequently show that Semenya cannot legally compete as a woman , she will be stripped of her medal and the placings revised .
The trouble is , those results could be weeks away .
From all accounts they are also incredibly complicated and open to various interpretations .
In the meantime , Semenya will be under media siege .
The most private aspect of her life will be the subject of intense public scrutiny .
" Running is just a game to me , " she had said after her semi-final win .
Not any more .
On Thursday she is due to be awarded her medal .
No - one could blame her if she asked for it to be posted to her instead .

Prostate cancer is a major killer Scientists have produced compelling evidence that a virus known to cause cancer in animals is linked to prostate cancer in humans .
The researchers from the University of Utah and Columbia University medical schools found the virus in 27 % of the 200 cancerous prostates they looked at .
They say it was associated with more aggressive tumours and found in only 6 % of non-cancerous prostates .
The finding raises the prospect of one day producing a vaccine .
Previous research has linked XMRV ( Xenotropic murine leukaemia virus ) to prostate cancer but not specifically to the aggressive form of the disease .
Retrovirus XMRV is a retrovirus like HIV which works by inserting a copy of its own DNA into the chromosomes of a cell they infect .
We still do n't know that this virus causes cancer in people , but that is an important question we are going to investigate .
Dr Ila Singh , University of Utah
Where this occurs next to a gene that regulates cell growth it can disrupt the normal development of the cell .
XMRV is known to cause leukaemia and other tumours in animals .
Dr Ila Singh , who led the study from the pathology department at the University of Utah , said : " We still do n't know that this virus causes cancer in people , but that is an important question we are going to investigate .
" One of the things peculiar about this virus is that it has an androgen response element - it grows better in the presence of testosterone and possibly other steroid hormones .
PROSTATE CANCER FACTS
Most common cancer in men in UK 10,000 die each year Most cases are in those aged 70 - 74 Higher rates in most deprived populations Source : Cancer Research UK " This is particularly interesting because if we can prove that it responds to oestrogen it could have a role in other cancers .
" We are already looking at the bodies of 100 women and 100 men , who died from other causes , to see if any other organs carry the virus . "
Risk factor Dr Helen Rippon , Head of Research Management at The Prostate Cancer Charity , said the research was intriguing but posed several key questions about the role the infection plays in prostate cancer .
It is critically important to identify key triggers of prostate cancer to improve early detection
Dr Helen Rippon , Prostate Cancer Charity
She said : " Around the world , extensive work is being undertaken to identify risk factors for prostate cancer which will enable treatments and tests for the disease to be refined .
" It is critically important to identify key triggers of prostate cancer to improve early detection of the disease in men with potentially life threatening prostate cancer . "
Dr Chris Parker , Cancer Research UK 's prostate cancer expert at the Institute of Cancer Research said : " This exciting study raises the possibility that the virus might contribute to the development of some prostate cancers .
" In the future , if it turns out to be true , then we could speculate about the possibility of vaccination to protect against prostate cancer , similar to the approach now used to prevent cervical cancer . "

As town hall meetings on health care reform are held across the state , now is the time to let your elected officials know your views on the issues .
The debate is filled with opinions , questions and emotions , but the role reproductive health care will play under health care reform has not received proper attention .
With 24 health centers across the state of Colorado , Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains wants to ensure women are not left worse off after health care reform than they are today .
As a trusted health care provider serving over 120,000 women a year with thousands of Pap tests , breast and cervical cancer screenings , and treatment and testing for sexually transmitted diseases , we know women rely on preventative care to stay healthy .
Policy makers need to understand that family planning and reproductive health care are mainstream health care , because 98 percent of women use contraception at some point in their lives , and most women in their reproductive years consider their ob / gyn their primary care provider .
Women of childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out - of - pocket expenses than men .
Birth control is not always covered by insurance and being pregnant can disqualify a woman from receiving health insurance due to a “ pre-existing condition . ”
This type of medical discrimination helps explain why the current system is not working for women .
Before Congress adjourned for the August congressional recess , we saw numerous misguided attacks in proposed health care reform legislation aimed to undermine women ’s health and take away existing benefits most women have today .
When members of Congress reconvene in September , women will likely face threats from legislators who fail to recognize that when women are healthy , their families are healthy , and this strengthens society in its entirety .
For all women who want their annual wellness exam , Pap test , and breast and cervical screening treated as covered health care , now is the time to act .
Now is the time to attend a town hall or call your elected official and ask them to support the full range of reproductive health services in health care reform legislation .
Ask them to support the right of all patients to access their provider of choice by including community - based health centers in future health plan networks .
Across America today , more than six in 10 patients who receive care at a women ’s health center like Planned Parenthood consider it their primary source of health care .
One in four women who receives contraceptive care does so at a women ’s health center .
One in six who obtains a Pap test or a pelvic exam does so at a women ’s health center , as do one - third of women who receive counseling , testing , or treatment for STDs , including HIV .
Each year , Planned Parenthood health centers across the country perform nearly one million Pap tests , identifying 93,000 women at risk of developing cervical cancer and provide more than 850,000 breast exams .
These numbers demonstrate that community - based health centers like Planned Parenthood are essential providers .
For many women , these health centers serve as their sole providers of health care .
Colorado is no different .
Planned Parenthood health centers from Durango to Fort Collins hear every day from clients who say they struggle to afford birth control but want to do the responsible thing when it comes to planning their families and futures .
Like other community - based health centers across Colorado , we ’re sometimes the only place people can turn to when denied care elsewhere .
Restricting reproductive care or restricting access to women ’s health care providers is not real health care reform .
Women know better and deserve better .
What ’s more , women comprise more than half of the nation ’s population .
Singling women out of health care would increase disparities and would be unjust .
Women – mothers , sisters , daughters , granddaughters , wives – simply deserve equal treatment under health care reform .
Vicki Cowart is CEO and President of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains .
EDITOR ’S NOTE :
This is an online - only column and has not been edited .
There can be little doubt that sooner or later we will outgrow our food supply – literally f— , sorry , copulate ourselves into overpopulation .
We could go the way of Easter Island which supported a thriving civilization until the islanders ran out of resources and their civilization died .
Today the world ’s population stands at around 6.5 billion , projected to rise to at least 7.2 billion in 2015 .
Just imagine how many of us will be here in 2050 !
This kind of population growth ca n’t be sustained but less sex is hardly the answer .
The only problem with sex is that sometimes it causes children and too many kids without adequate resources means more ignorance , hunger and more kids .
The cycle continues .
The basic tools for slowing or stopping population growth are simple : contraception , vasectomy , tubal ligation , sex education and education in general .
Simple for us common folk but is it simple for the Catholic Church ?
Nope , the Pope and his priests know a sin when they see it .
Of course , eating meat on Fridays used to be a sin too , but the Pope looked at that one and said – what the heck , the farmers need to eat too .
That was a good decision for the oceans , so how about now making a good decision for the world ’s resources ?
Unfortunately the Catholic Church remains a major stumbling block when it comes to any kind of population control involving birth control .
It maintains abstinence is the only sinless way , but even a small army of priests have found that hard to follow .
Some churches are literally going broke trying to pay for the sins of their past and present priests .
An organization that spans the globe and is still powerful in underdeveloped areas of the globe is a prime stumbling block in the fight against overpopulation .
In doing that it inadvertently promotes hunger and continuing ignorance .
Pope Benedict even claimed in a recent speech that the use of condoms is not only a sin but also increases the incidence of AIDS !
Benedict , oh Benedict , you ’re really misfiring on this one !
You must have failed your elementary science pretty badly to say that .
Fortunately for the world the Catholic church has lost some of the iron grip it once had .
Even so , its sway in some of the poorest regions of the world is formidable and troubling .
It would be nice if dogma fed people , but food is better .
The popular , politically correct , solution is to grow more food and improve the distribution network .
Good plan , but we ’ve been talking about that for years and the hunger is still there , only more of it .
What ’s that definition of insanity again ?
Something about doing the same thing but expecting different results ?
A far more practical and ethical solution is to decrease the world ’s population through free birth control devices and education .
While birthrates in most industrialized countries are already falling , they are more than counterbalanced by population growth elsewhere , especially where there is endemic poverty .
Will supply of condoms and education in birth control interfere with some cultural practices ?
I certainly hope so , if that will result in less ignorance , subservience and poverty .
“ Culture ” is not cast in stone , it evolves and adapts to changing needs like everything else does .
Western women have the vote today , and their husbands get sent to jail if they ’re caught beating them .
These are both recent changes among many in our western culture , so where ’s the problem ?
History tells us that societies disintegrated through the destruction of resources .
Easter Island is just one example where only huge , inscrutable human statues are all that remain of a once thriving civilization .
The end came when too many people exhausted the island ’s limited resources .
We could literally fornicate ourselves out of house and home … but what a way to go !

Environment correspondent , BBC News website
Walrus have been seen on Alaska 's north coast in unusual numbers
This summer 's melt of Arctic sea ice has not been as profound as in the last two years , scientists said as the ice began its annual Autumn recovery .
At its smallest extent this summer , on 12 September , the ice covered 5.10 million sq km ( 1.97 million sq miles ) .
This was larger than the minima seen in the last two years , and leaves 2007 's record low of 4.1 million sq km ( 1.6 million sq miles ) intact .
But scientists note the long - term trend is still downwards .
They note that at this year 's minimum , the ice covered 24 % less ocean than for the 1979 - 2000 average .
The analysis is compiled from satellite readings at the US National Snow and Ice Data Center ( NSIDC ) in Boulder , Colorado .
Colder front
Among the reasons for the less drastic melt are that Arctic temperatures have been cooler this year than last , researchers said , and that winds have helped disperse sea ice across the region .
Arctic ice in retreat 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 NSIDC scientist Walt Meier said the reasons for the somewhat cooler temperatures this year were not entirely clear yet .
" We had cloudier conditions and low pressure zones in late summer that probably helped keep temperatures down , " he told BBC News .
" It 's something we need to look at in more detail .
" But it certainly was n't as warm as 2007 , which was in the order of 2 - 3C warmer than the average in a lot of places . "
The question now , he said , was whether 2007 turns out to be a " high - melt blip " , or whether 2009 turns out to be a " low - melt blip " - which will not become evident until next summer at the earliest .
What continues to have scientists worried is that a significant proportion of the cover consists of young , thin ice formed in a single winter .
This is much more prone to melting than the older , thicker ice that dominated in years gone by .
" If we get another warm year , anything like 2007 , then the ice is really going to go , " said Dr Meier .
" And the chances are that at some point in the next few years we are going to get a warm one . "
White heat
In recent decades , the Arctic region has been warming about twice as fast as the average for the Earth 's surface .
Recently , scientists specialising in reconstructing past temperatures released data showing that the current decade is the warmest in the Arctic for at least 2,000 years .
Melting ice is a " positive feedback " mechanism driving temperature rise faster .
Whereas white ice reflects sunlight back into space , dark water absorbs it , leading to faster warming .
The NSIDC team cautions that this is a preliminary analysis and that further melt is possible , though unlikely , this year .
Next month they will publish a full analysis including more details of how temperatures , currents and winds affected the sea ice this summer .

Human resourcefulness and technological innovation may just help save the environment , argues Jesse Ausubel ( Image : Marc Asnin / Redux )
Throughout history , technological innovation has saved us from being overwhelmed by overpopulation , and Jesse Ausubel tells Alison George why he is convinced that human resourcefulness can pull the fat out of the fire even now
You ’re known as a techno - optimist .
Why have you got such faith in technology ’s power to save the environment ?
I regard myself as neither an optimist nor a pessimist .
But I do think that humanity is ingenious and enterprising .
Throughout the ages people have doubted that their descendants could exist , with improving health and longevity , in the numbers and densities we do now .
In the 19th century it was common to reason that horse manure or chimney smoke would bury or choke cities .
Yet air quality in New York City and water quality in New York harbour are better than when I or my mother was a child .
Over time people find , invent and spread solutions for many environmental problems .
So do environmental doomsayers fail to factor in our technical ingenuity ?
Malthus certainly underestimated technical change .
And numerous people considered experts in the 1950s , 1960s and 1970s thought that humanity would not make it to 2009 without big collapses in population , at least regionally .
It did n’t happen .
As a student in the early 1970s , I shared the tremendous interest in Garrett Hardin ’s 1968 Science article “ The tragedy of the commons ” , which described how herdsmen selfishly add cows to the common pasture until the resource fails for all .
In the tragic instances , individual rationality does destroy the collectivity .

BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
The Iraqi man who was jailed after throwing his shoes at then - President George W. Bush last year arrived in Syria on Tuesday night , hours after being released from prison , his employer said .
Muntadhar al - Zaidi speaks to reporters shorlty after his release from an Iraqi jail .
Al - Baghdadia TV said Muntadhar al - Zaidi had arrived in Damascus .
Al - Zaidi's brother , Dhirgham al - Zaidi , told CNN that the 30 - year - old journalist was to travel in a private plane to Greece for medical treatment .
Shortly after he left prison , the 30 - year - old journalist visited the studios of his employer , Al - Baghdadia TV , where he spoke to other reporters about his experience .
He wore a sash in the colors of the Iraqi national flag draped around his shoulders .
Muntadhar al - Zaidi said he was beaten with cables and pipes and tortured with electricity immediately after guards removed him from a news conference for hurling both shoes at Bush .
He said he was taken into another room and beaten even as the news conference continued .
However , he remained defiant about the incident that landed him in prison .
" I got my chance , and I did n't miss it , " he said .
" I am not a hero , and I admit that , " he added .
" I am a person with a stance .
I saw my country burning . "
Al - Zaidi , who was serving a one - year sentence after the jail - throwing incident December 14 , was given a " conditional discharge . "
Under Iraqi law , a " conditional discharge " allows for the release of a prisoner after he serves three - quarters of his sentence , on good behavior .

Al - Zaidi said he was compelled to act after witnessing what the U.S. invasion had wrought on his country : orphans , widows , refugees .
He said he promised those affected by the war that should he get the opportunity , he would avenge their loss .
That chance came at the news conference , when al - Zaidi threw both his shoes at Bush and called him a " dog , " two of the worst insults in the Middle East .
Bush ducked the shoes and was not hurt .
During his remarks , al - Zaidi offered one apology : to fellow journalists who perceived his act as unprofessionalism .
Sound off : Was a jail sentence too harsh a punishment ?
" Professionalism does not preclude nationalism , " he said .
Al - Zaidi was sentenced to jail for " assaulting a foreign head of state on an official visit to Iraq . "
His original three - year sentence was reduced to a single year by an appellate court in April .
The journalist 's family and supporters had waited for two days outside the Baghdad jail where he was held , initially hoping he would be freed Monday , but procedural delays kept that from happening .
Last week , al - Zaidi 's family prepared for his release , plastering the walls of their modest Baghdad home with his posters .
" We are happy , like any detainee 's family would be happy for the release of its son after the bitter time he spent in jail , " brother Dhirgham al - Zaidi said .
He said the family had received many phone calls from supporters across the country who planned to travel to Baghdad and welcome al - Zaidi after his release .
Though many Iraqis hold Bush in low esteem , opinions were mixed in Iraq following the incident .
Some viewed al - Zaidi as a hero , with thousands taking to the streets , calling for his release ; others said his act went against Arab traditions of honoring guests .
Al - Zaidi's brothers said they had been offered many gifts and financial rewards , though they had rejected them .

All About George W. Bush • Iraq
I am glad that Tory MP Damian Green 's DNA has been taken off the government 's database .
It was concerning .
The police raid on his office was wrong in the first place .
So why should an innocent man have his DNA kept in this way ?
But I am even more concerned about the hundreds of thousands of other innocent people with their DNA on the government database , particularly children .
Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys , the scientist who discovered the significance of DNA , made it clear years ago that he thought it was wrong for the government to keep the DNA of innocent people .
He said : " I 'm totally opposed ...
It 's discriminating , inconsistent with privacy laws and an example of ad hoc sloppy thinking . "
Dame Helena Kennedy , when she was chair of the human genetics commission , warned that this would create a class of people who were permanently under suspicion , even though they had never been convicted of any wrongdoing .
" Being on a database of potential offenders which might be regularly trawled by the police means that one is on a list of suspects and that surely very subtly alters the way in which the state sees , and we see , our fellow citizens . "
The European court of human rights also ruled this year that the " blanket and indiscriminate " retention of suspects ' DNA was unlawful .
There is a clear racial disparity in those people who have their DNA held .
In particular , one in four black children over the age of 10 have their DNA on the database .
I dealt with the case of a 14 - year - old black girl who happened to be a passenger in a car which was stopped by the police .
She had her DNA taken without her parents being present or their permission sought .
The car was not stolen and the driver had committed no crime .
But it took months of argument before the police agree to remove her DNA .
It seems that for the police , if you are a young black person of any gender , you are guilty until proved innocent and permanently under suspicion .
DNA evidence has undoubtedly been useful in clearing up crimes of sexual violence and assault .
But the government needs to adopt much stricter guidelines in retaining the DNA of innocent people .
So I am pleased to be working with Liberty in holding a series of special advice clinics in Hackney to advise innocent young people how they can remove their DNA from the government 's database .
If they can do it for Damian Green MP , they can do it for my young constituents .

Advertisement A German dairy farmer who received the world 's first transplant of two complete arms has spoken about his new limbs - and the joy of scratching .
Karl Merk had the 15 - hour operation a year ago in Munich after losing his arms just below the shoulder in a 2002 combine harvester accident .
The 55 - year - old 's new limbs came from an anonymous donor who had died .
Mr Merk told a news conference he can now open doors easily , eat without help , ride a bike and wash himself .
Doctors decided he should undergo surgery after his body refused to accept artificial limbs .
It is impossible to describe this to someone who has never experienced living without arms for six years
Karl Merk
" I can scratch myself if it itches somewhere .
It feels pretty good , almost like a new person , " Mr Merk , who had spent six years without arms , said on Wednesday .
He crossed his arms several times , raised the new limbs above his head and leaned forward on his forearms for the cameras .
" It 's getting a little better every day .
It is impossible to describe this to someone who has never experienced having to live without arms for six years without being able to do anything .
And now all of a sudden it works again - indescribable . "
Mr Merk said he hoped soon to toast the pioneering surgeons by being able to raise a glass of Bavarian beer to his lips .
One of the medical team , Christoph Hoehnke , said the results so far were better than expected .

HAMPTON , Ga. -- Danica Patrick will " all but certainly " be in NASCAR in 2010 , but wo n't give up Indy car racing and will limit next year 's activity to the Nationwide Series and Trucks , according to a source very close to the situation .
Tony Stewart is the " star candidate " to be her partner and mentor in NASCAR , the source said , adding that Patrick 's recent visits to Stewart - Haas Racing were much more than social -- that she and Stewart were discussing a deal , and are close to one .
" I can pretty much guarantee at some point she 's going to be over here , " Stewart told reporters Saturday at Atlanta Motor Speedway , meaning NASCAR in general and hinting at something the source confirmed and clarified .
Joe Hachem , the 2005 World Series of Poker champion , said he had lost respect for a new brand of aggressive players who seemed to want to gamble all their chips on every hand in the main event .
Hachem said after two hours of poker on Monday that the pace had not slowed at the no-limit Texas Hold ’em tournament in Las Vegas because many players were willing to risk their tournament with mediocre hands .
Play started with 185 players , and 38 were eliminated in two hours , despite starting with many chips relative to minimum bets .
Hachem said the overaggressive style was disrespectful to the tournament .
Hachem was eliminated later in the day , leaving last year ’s winner , Peter Eastgate , as the only former main event champion in the tournament .

The situation in China 's riot - torn city of Urumqi is now under control after the deployment of thousands of troops , local Communist officials have said .
The party chief of Urumqi , capital of the Xinjiang region , vowed that all those found guilty of murder during the riots would be put to death .
The unrest between Muslim Uighurs and Han Chinese began on Sunday and has left at least 156 people dead .
President Hu Jintao cut short his visit to the G8 summit to tackle the crisis .
Mr Hu flew back from Italy and arrived in Beijing on Wednesday .
Map showing protest area in Urumqi
The BBC's Quentin Sommerville , in Urumqi , says the Xinjiang authorities have been under intense pressure to sort the crisis out as soon as possible amid the embarrassment of Mr Hu having to cancel his G8 attendance .
Call for calm Urumqi's Mayor Jerla Isamudin said at a press conference in the city : " Under the correct leadership of the regional party committee and government ... the situation is now under control . "
AT THE SCENE : 8 JULY Quentin Sommerville , BBC News , Urumqi
Here in Urumqi's Uighur Muslim neighbourhood , just on the edge , many hundreds of paramilitary police are on the move .
They are seeking to separate this mainly Muslim part of the city from Han Chinese .
Riot police are all around with shields , helmets , some are carrying semi-automatic weapons , others have clubs .
They are lining up across the streets to separate these two sides .
We have n't seen any violence yet , we did see some Han Chinese running with batons , they were chased down a side street but this is massive deployment of troops on a scale this city has n't seen in a very , very long time .
It feels like martial law in everything but name .
The city 's Communist party boss , Li Zhi , told the same press conference that the government would execute all those found guilty of killings during the riots .
China carries out more state executions that any other country , and anyone convicted of murder in a riot faces an almost certain death sentence .
The Associated Press news agency quoted Mr Li as saying that many people accused of murder had already been arrested and that most of them were students .
More than 1,400 people are thought to have been arrested over the violence .
Mr Li also appealed for calm .
" Everyone , and particularly the Han people , should show restraint , " he said .
Thousands of security personnel had poured into Urumqi to try to quell the rioting .
Our correspondent says the situation in the city is virtually one of martial law .
Despite the security presence and calls for calm , there were reports of fresh violence on Wednesday .
Reuters news agency said a crowd of about 1,000 Han Chinese had faced off with security forces , with some angry that police were arresting young Han men .
AFP reporters also said they had seen fresh violence , including one attack on a Uighur man by Han Chinese .
They said the man was beaten and kicked by about six people as dozens of Han Chinese yelled encouragement , before police moved in to end the attack .
The Chinese president had been expected to join the G8 talks on Thursday .
Instead he flew home from an airport in Pisa , leaving officials to represent him at the summit .
A state visit to Portugal was postponed .

In pictures : Xinjiang troops Chinese media bullish over riots Assessing the role of Uighur exiles Officials say 156 people - mostly Han Chinese - died in Sunday 's violence .
Uighur groups say many more have died , claiming 90 % of the dead were Uighurs .
There were further protests on Tuesday when Uighur women rallied against the arrest of family members .
Groups of Han Chinese armed with clubs then rampaged through the streets in a counter - protest that police broke up with tear gas .
China 's authorities have repeatedly claimed that exiled Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer is stirring up trouble in the region .
But she told the BBC she was not responsible for any of the violence .
Tensions have been growing in Xinjiang for many years , as Han Chinese migrants have poured into the region , where the Uighur minority is concentrated .
Many
Uighurs feel economic growth has bypassed them and complain of discrimination and diminished opportunities .
Some Uighurs support the notion of an independent state and there have been a number of bombings and some attacks on security forces .
Chinese authorities say the Xinjiang separatists are terrorists with links to al - Qaeda and receive support from outside the country .
Campaigners accuse China of exaggerating the threat to justify tough security clampdowns in the region .

Advocates of medical cannabis say it is effective in treating pain and nausea Federal prosecutors in the US have been ordered to stop cannabis - related prosecutions in the 13 states where medical use of the drug is legal .
Attorney General Eric
Holder said it was wrong for federal resources to be spent on prosecuting people who were in compliance with existing state laws .
But he warned that the authorities would continue to go after traffickers hiding behind medical marijuana laws .
The policy is considered a sharp shift from that of the Bush administration .
California became the first state to permit medical use of cannabis in 1996 .
It allows special facilities to sell the drug and even to advertise .
In 2005 , the Supreme Court ruled that the federal government could continue to enforce US law barring the cultivation , possession and use of cannabis for any purpose , even when states had legalised it .
' Step forward '
But in a policy memo issued by the Department of Justice on Monday , prosecutors were told they " should not focus federal resources in your states on individuals whose actions are in clear and unambiguous compliance with existing state laws providing for the medical use of marijuana " .
We will not tolerate drug traffickers who hide behind claims of compliance with state law to mask activities that are clearly illegal
US Attorney - General Eric Holder
However , they will be required to go after people who distribute more than is permitted under state law or use it as a cover for weapons offences , money laundering and other crimes .
" We will not tolerate drug traffickers who hide behind claims of compliance with state law to mask activities that are clearly illegal , " Mr Holder said in a statement .
According to the government , 14 states allow some use of cannabis for medical purposes - Alaska , California , Colorado , Hawaii , Maine , Maryland , Michigan , Montana , Nevada , New Mexico , Oregon , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington .
However , Maryland only allows for reduced penalties for those found to have used cannabis solely for medical reasons .
Advocates of the medical use of cannabis argue that it is effective in treating chronic pain and nausea , among other ailments .
" This is a major step forward , " Bruce Mirken of the Marijuana Policy Project told the Associated Press news agency .
" This change in policy moves the federal government dramatically toward respecting scientific and practical reality . "
But critics said it signalled a retreat in the fight against Mexican drug cartels , whose largest source of revenue in the US is cannabis .

I knew there a coming ride report since I saw the video's in youtube a week or so ago .
Sambor you 're the man .
Did I just say that one of the differences between Bing and Google is that Bing is splashy and Google revels in its plain jane interface ?
I lied .
Google had a TechCrunch50 announcement of its own this afternoon , and involves a new Google Labs feature that has a high " wow , lookee there ! " quotient : Google Fast Flip .
Fast Flip is based on Google News , and Google says it came up with it to address the fact that browsing through news sites is usually a slow process - not at all like the effortless instant gratification of flipping through a magazine or newspaper .
Google has partnered with several dozen news sources - including the BBC , BusinessWeek , the Christian Science Monitor , the Daily Beast , Esquire , the New York Times , Newsweek , Salon , Slate , and TechCrunch - to create previews of their stories that live on Fast Flip but which display the first several paragraphs of the article in a form that looks like the originating site .
You rifle through these previews by clicking left and right arrows , and the pages zip on and off - screen in high - speed , fluid animation - hence the " Fast Flip " name .
Fast Flip has a Like button that lets you express your approval of stories you like , and Google says that the more you use the service , the smarter it will get about presenting you with stuff you 're likely to be interested in .
( It lets you browse in multiple ways - by subject , by provider , and by author . )
Oh , and there are mobile versions for iPhone and Android .
It 's quite neat - pretty addictive , actually .
But it 's also ... kind of odd .
For several reasons :
It does n't necessarily make browsing for news faster .
The flipping interface shows one story at a time in legible form - versus the dozens that plain ol '
Google News puts on one screen - along with thumbnails in which the headlines are tiny and the articles themselves are too tiny to read .
Once you click on a preview , you go to the originating site - which is no faster than usual - and getting back to Fast Flip may be kinda cumbersome , especially if you 've clicked through to a multi-page article .
The previews break some conventions of the Web .
They may have what seem to be hyperlinks , and tools like icons for printing the page , but none of this stuff works - the preview is a giant hyperlink to the article on the originating site .
The ads are un -Google - esque .
Google is putting ads in Fast Flip and sharing the revenues with its content partners .
Unlike classic
Google text ads , these are display ads - tall , skinny ones - and while they 're context sensitive , some of the ones I 'm seeing so far are a tad on the cheesy side :
It does n't always work .
Fast Flip does n't carry a beta tag , but it 's a Google Labs project , so it 's experimental by definition .
I found it a bit quirky - one Slate page was so wide it did n't fit in the preview , for instance .
And this one - line Atlantic blog post does n't really need a preview , except that Fast Flip fails to display the embedded video that makes the text make sense :
I do n't mean to be overly nitpicky - Fast Flip is clever , and I hope it sticks around and evolves .
If you check it out , let us know what you think .

You probably missed this earth - shattering news , but Ikea IKEA , the Swedish furniture and other assorted home decoration products company , has switched fonts .
The company always used the Futura font for its catalogues , but the latest edition has ditched it in favour of Verdana .
This has caused quite the stir among typography geeks .
IKEA has a name .
The Swedish company is the world ’s largest furniture manufacturer , and it obtained that distinction by producing stylish but affordable products .
Here in The Netherlands , you ’ll be hard - pressed to find a household without IKEA products , and I , too , have my apartment stuffed with their products .
IKEA has always used a modified variant of the Futura font in its catalogues and promotional material , but with the release of the latest catalogue , they switched to Verdana .
The backlash on the internet is of almost epic proportions : typography geeks the world over are fuming over IKEA ’s change of fonts .
Typography geeks argue that Microsoft ’s Verdana is designed for on - screen use , and not for print materials .
Futura is superior , according to them , so why did n’t IKEA just use Verdana online , and Futura for print materials ?
“ I shudder at the thought of hovering Verdana - emblazoned billboards and bus stop ads , ” Jamie Latendresse writes .
So , why is Verdana well - suited for on - screen use ?
“ It has open , wide letterforms with lots of space between characters to aid legibility at small sizes on screen , ” explains Simon l’Anson , creative director at Made by Many , a London - based digital - consulting company , to Time Magazine , “ It does n’t exhibit any elegance or visual rhythm when set at large sizes .
It ’s like taking the family sedan off - road .
It will sort of work , but ultimately gets bogged down . ”
It is argued that the switch to Verdana is done for cost - saving reasons ; apparently , the font is better suited for internationalisation ( use in different alphabets ) .
This means IKEA can more easily use the same font across all the countries it operates in , which should save costs for the company .
Now , I ’m sure many of you are wondering why this story is on OSNews .
Well , we all use our computers quite regularly , so I ’m sure many of you have your own ideas and preferences when it comes to the fonts you prefer to use on your computers – and I think it ’s interesting discussion material .
While I am a huge fan of Microsoft ’s Trebuchet MS ( beautiful ! ) my actual on - screen font preference for user interfaces are some of the fonts Microsoft introduced with Windows Vista : Segoe UI and Consolas ( the names more or less imply where they are used in Windows 7 ) .
Both of them were designed by Microsoft ’s Typography division specifically for their intended roles .
What ’s your font preference ?

Do n't be fooled by what you read in the press and hear in the media .
In Pakistan it was decided long ago that he can do no wrong .
He took those 12 wickets in Sydney , bowled that immortal afternoon spell of reverse swing in Karachi , stared the West Indies down on their home turf , led the cornered tigers in 1992 .
In short , he ushered Pakistan cricket into its golden era .
And then there is the man .
As any number of women would say , just look at him .
You would think this makes Imran Khan an irresistible biography subject - and you'd be right .
There are very few autobiographies of Pakistani cricketers , and fewer biographies .
Imran has become the focus now of a second worthy book ( after Ivo Tenant 's Imran Khan , which appeared in 1994 ) .
The latest effort is by Christopher Sandford , a seasoned biographer who has previously tackled Godfrey Evans and Tom Graveney in addition to an august list from the world of music and film .
It is not strictly a cricket book , because Imran is not just a cricketer .
There is naturally a great deal of cricket in it , but it is so seamlessly interwoven with general experiences of the human condition that this book can be read with equal enjoyment by die - hard fans and casual followers alike .
Indeed , Imran transcended cricket in that many people with little interest in the game found themselves absorbed by his public image and personality .
This book will appeal to them too .
Sandford succeeds in his essential biographical task , which is to conduct an enquiry into the making of the Imran Khan phenomenon .
The research and sources are extensive , complemented by a solid bibliography .
The prose , engaging and conversational throughout , is at times even riveting .
Imran cooperated and is the first in a long list of acknowledgments .
Delicious nuggets are buried here and there .
Asif Iqbal pockets serious cash from Kerry Packer at 100 - 1 odds in a World XI vs West Indies WSC match .
Imran floors Zaheer Abbas with a bouncer in a county match against Gloucestershire after being egged on by his Sussex team - mates , and immediately loses his aggression to become full of empathy .
A novice political reporter asks Imran the politician in the middle of a hysterical campaign rally if he has ever seen anything like it before , and Imran quietly answers that yes , he has .
Imran 's utter focus and devotion to the given task at hand - be it cricket , politics , or social welfare - is well known and understood .
But Sandford provides a nuanced picture of a shy yet restless soul brimming with self - belief , who is as concerned with substance and meaning as he is self - conscious about image and style .
" Sandford provides a nuanced picture of a shy yet restless soul brimming with self - belief , who is as concerned with substance and meaning as he is self - conscious about image and style "
Imran is vividly characterised for his fiercely independent Pathan streak , his bristling sensitivity towards any hint of colonial condescension , and his successful exorcism of Pakistan cricket 's post - colonial inferiority complex .
Yet paradoxically he is also totally at home in British culture .
Sandford presents this as not merely a post - colonial but in fact a post - modern phenomenon : Imran does have complete comfort and ease in even the most rarefied levels of British society , but it is without any sense of superiority .
The English , for their part , cannot have enough of him .
An unstated subtext running throughout Sandford 's narrative is that the English would love nothing more than to claim Imran as one of their own .
There are a few disappointments .
In January 1977 , Imran took 6 for 63 and 6 for 102 in Sydney to record Pakistan 's first Test win in Australia .
It marked him as the first Asian in the cadre of true fast bowlers , and the victory has been described by Javed Miandad - Imran 's sometimes dysfunctional partner in the making of modern Pakistani cricket , as Sandford puts it - as a crucial watermark in the nation 's cricket psyche .
Sandford makes short work of this match , disposing of it in barely a paragraph .
This is in contrast to page upon page devoted to obscure county games and to arcane proceedings such as Imran leaving Worcestershire and signing on with Sussex .
Sandford does identify a watershed in Pakistan cricket , but places it two years later , in Karachi against India .
But Karachi 1978 was just a jingoistic celebration compared to Sydney 1977 , which with all its symbolism was the true awakening .
As the book moves into Imran 's contemporary life , you keep expecting to read a dissection of his failings , but it never comes .
Sandford accepts that Imran is marginalised in Pakistan 's national politics , but also argues that he is better off for it .
Yes , he has an obstinate side , but that just makes him a formidable proposition .
And true , he may not have succeeded as a broadcaster , but an obscure poll is cited , which ranks him as the game 's fourth most popular celebrity commentator .
These judgments finally reveal Sandford 's hand as an admiring scribe .
Not that you can blame him , of course .
Everybody admires Imran Khan , and those that do n't are lying .
Indeed , in politics as in cricket , Imran receives a great deal of unspoken credit for insisting on stepping out of his comfort zone .
Sandford 's treatment has done him justice .

For the past 14 years , photographer and filmmaker Jill Heinerth has been exploring underwater caves around the world , from lava tubes off the coast of North Africa to icebergs in the Antarctic .
Wired.com recently caught up with Heinerth to talk about some of her most exciting cave diving moments , as well as the recent technological advances that have made cave diving easier , safer and more accessible to recreational divers .
This gallery showcases some of Heinerth ’s best underwater images and includes captions adapted from our conversation with her .
Above : “ My Neighborhood Cave ” in High Springs , Florida
Heinerth snapped this photo of herself as she descended through the tannic water of the Santa Fe River into her neighborhood cave in High Springs , Florida .
The swirling orange blaze above her comes from the mixing of river water , stained red by decaying cypress trees , with crystal blue spring water flowing from the cave .
The giant black mask she ’s wearing is connected to a special diving tank called a rebreather .
“ Basically , it does the same thing as a space suit , ” Heinerth said .
“ In normal scuba gear , you ’re inhaling gas and exhaling a column of bubbles into the water .
But in a rebreather , you ’re actually recycling your air , with carbon dioxide getting scrubbed out of the mixture and oxygen getting added back in .
With an electronic rebreather , you can tune the gases that you ’re using , so that in deeper water you can use helium and other gases to get the optimal mixture of breathing gas for deep water . ”

“ Prevent Your Death : Go No Farther ”
Here , two divers pose in front of one of the many signs warning divers without proper training to stay out of Ginnie Springs Cave or risk their death .
More than 400 people have died from cave diving accidents around the world , and most fatal accidents have involved open water divers without cave certification .
“ There ’s a lot of opportunity to make simple mistakes that could be fatal , ” said Heinerth .
“ Most errors happen because of human error , although there ’s been a slow progression to protect people from some of the most common mistakes through technology . ”
Although rebreathers can make cave diving safer by decreasing the amount of breathing gas you need to carry , Heinerth also calls rebreather tanks “ the ultimate suicide machine . ”
“ In two minutes , I could hook it up improperly in the garage and kill myself , ” she said .
That ’s one of the reasons why anyone who wants to buy a rebreather has to undergo mandatory safety training before receiving their unit .

Swimming through Stalactites in Quintana Roo , Mexico
In this photo , a diver swims through a palace of stalactites in Mexico ’s Yucatan Peninsula .
The delicate formations were created during past ice ages when the cave was dry , as rain water dripped through cracks and crevices in the limestone and left precipitated minerals behind .
“ An interesting aside is that our recent National Geographic project in the Bahamas included work on dating stalactite and stalagmite formations , ” Heinerth said .
“ Some of the formations in caves can be dated back hundreds of thousands of years , and could have formed many , many sea level changes ago . ”

A Cave with a View in High Springs , Florida
This beautiful snapshot captures a view of the trees looking up through the clear blue water of the cave at Devil ’s Eye Spring .
Plenty of cave divers enjoy exploration purely for exploration ’s sake , but cave diving also gives scientists access to data that they would otherwise never be able to reach .
“ A cave is like a protected little underground laboratory , ” said Heinerth , who has worked with scientists to do biological surveys , study new species and conduct geological studies of icebergs and lava tubes .
“ I even worked with an astrobiologist who was collecting algae samples from caves that are the closest roots to rudimentary life , ” she said , “ and I just got back from the Bahamas on an expedition where we were uncovering early human remains and early rock formations that show us a lot about ancient human history . ”

Squeezing Through the Passages of Ginnie Springs Cave , Florida
Cave diving often means creeping through small spaces , like the tight passageway that these two divers are traversing in this photo .
“ With cave diving , when something goes wrong you have to solve your problem right then and there with what you have , ” Heinerth said .
“ Sometimes we swim a couple of miles underground , so that if something happens , you have to swim back a couple of miles before you can even begin to come up . ”
“ Buddy diving is definitely the safer way to go , ” she said , “ but I ’m not always with somebody else .
There are times , especially in exploration , where it ’s small , it ’s silty and another person is more of a risk than a benefit .
When you ’re in small spaces and you ’re not able to turn around , then a second person can be a problem . ”

Swimming Through an Iceberg in the Antarctic
Heinerth captured this photo of a diver swimming out of an ice cave during an expedition to study the world ’s largest recorded iceberg , called B - 15 , which broke free from the Ross Ice Shelf in 2000 .
Before B - 15 began cracking into pieces , it covered an area of more than 11,000 square kilometers , larger than the island of Jamaica .
“ Probably the most dangerous expedition I ’ve ever been on was the Antarctic project , ” Heinerth said , “ This particular iceberg had calved off of the ice shelf , and we went down to intercept it and find a way to get inside it . ”
“ On that expedition , I was almost lost at sea and also got trapped inside the iceberg .
We had two separate issues — one time the entrance where we had gone in had caved and closed , and another time the current swamped us and became so strong that we could n’t make any headway against it . ”

The Old and the New : Scuba vs. Rebreather Technology
In this photograph , the diver on the left is wearing traditional open circuit scuba gear , while the diver on the right is using a rebreather , which recycles exhaled air much like an astronaut ’s space suit .
“ I started diving rebreathers about 14 years ago , ” Heinerth said .
“ I took it on really as a tool for underwater exploration .
For me , it has allowed me to go deeper , stay longer , go farther in the cave and create a better safety net for image capture . ”
With a rebreather , Heinerth says she ’s able to stay underwater for up to 12 hours , whereas with regular scuba gear , she might have only been able to stay at those depths for a few minutes .
“ And because it does n’t create any bubbles , ” she said , “ we can flit through the environment without disturbing animals or changing the water chemistry , and you can get up close and personal with things that would otherwise be scared of bubbles . ”

Mapping the Inside of a Cave in Three Dimensions
Here , a silhouetted diver pilots a device called the Cis-Lunar Digital Wall Mapper inside a cave at Wakulla Springs , Florida .
The device , designed by aerospace engineer Bill Stone , was the first machine capable of modeling a cave in three dimensions .
“ The cave project morphed into a NASA project , ” Heinerth said .
“ It ’s an autonomous , self - swimming underwater robot that can map in three dimensions and take samples .
We had it down in the Antarctic during our first winter expedition , and the ultimate destination for this probe is to take it to Jupiter ’s moon , Europa . ”
“ A lot of the technology for cave diving has crossed over from space and has been going back and forth between the two fields , ” she said .
“ The technology is great for covering two worlds . ”

Free Diving in a Northern Florida Spring
The cave entrance in this photo is a window into a fresh water aquifer below .
“ Where I live , here in northern Florida , caves are the conduit for our drinking water , ” Heinerth said .
“ It ’s a beautiful environment . ”
The diver in this photo has descended about 20 feet into the opening of Devil ’s Eye Spring .
Without carrying breathing gas , free divers can usually swim down only about 40 to 45 feet , but Heinerth says that a few brave souls venture further .
“ In Russia , I met a guy who they nicknamed ‘ Aqua Man , ' ” she said .
“ In water temperature just above freezing , Aqua Man would put on a wetsuit , enter the cave , and swim a couple of hundred feet before surfacing to sip from an air pocket on the ceiling of the cave .
Then he ’d free dive even further in , eventually getting 300 feet into the cave with no air .
He was free diving by leap - frogging from air pocket to air pocket inside the cave . ”

Exploring Ordinskaya Cave on the edge of Siberia
Here , a team of Russian divers brave near - freezing temperatures to explore a cave off the coast of Siberia .
Cave diving is always challenging , but Heinerth said diving in arctic waters adds an additional element of danger .
“ Certainly there ’s a lot of equipment preparation because of the cold , and even with the best exposure protection , there ’s a very finite amount of time that you can spend in those sorts of temperatures .
Nowadays people use suit heaters , and rebreathers will keep you a bit warmer , but you have to adjust your equipment to withstand the cold . ”
“ Ice diving definitely has its additional risks , ” she said .
“ And ice diving in caves ?
That ’s even worse . ”

Diving for Treasure in Homun , Mexico
In this photo , a diver is lowered into a drinking water well in Mexico during an archaeological expedition sponsored by the National Geographic Society .
“ In the course of exploring some of the local drinking water supplies , we found skulls and paleo animal remains and pottery from different areas , ” Heinerth said .
“ That particular well , I nicknamed the well of time , because at the very top we found rusty buckets that were just a few years old .
A little deeper , we found Spanish colonial water - carrying vessels , and below that , skeletons of longhorn cattle that had been ritually placed on the mound . ”
As the explorers ventured further into the cave , they found older and older archaeological remains , including human skulls that had been ritually defleshed and sacrificed , and one skeleton with its hands and feet chopped off .
“ Probably a thief , ” Heinerth said .
“ We found all those things and immediately called the archives and heritage government authority in Mexico , and that ’s how we launched the National Geographic project , ” she said .
“ We were smart enough to know not to touch anything . ”

Preparing for a dive in the Canary Islands
In this photo , a diver checks his equipment before descending into a cave in the Canary Islands .
To get to the submerged part of this cave , called a “ sump , ” the group had to carry their gear through more than a mile of dry passageways .
“ Ten years ago , we expected ( on ) almost every dive for things to break and to be getting ourselves out of the cave on a wing and a prayer , ” Heinerth said .
“ Safety and reliability have greatly increased in the past decade , and most recently a really exciting thing has happened .
One of the silent killers on a rebreather is carbon dioxide , as too much carbon dioxide can cause a person to pass out and die .
Now a company from the UK has designed a rebreather with an active gaseous carbon dioxide monitor — that ’s a huge advance that will make the market a lot safer , and it was a pretty significant technological nut to crack . ”

Yelp ’s Crusade To Liberate iPhone Developers
Hidden within
Yelp ’s new app this week was an augmented reality feature called “ Monocle . ”
Users gain access to the feature by shaking the phone three times on opening the app .
It ’s not the first easter egg we ’ve seen used to access otherwise prohibited features , but it ’s certainly the most prominent , and it seems not everyone is as excited about the feature as I am .
Enter Matt Galligan .
He ’s the CEO of CrashCorp , a development group looking to put together an augmented reality SDK to help developers create quality AR apps .
He was a guest author at TechCrunch this week , where he criticized Yelp for deceiving the Apple review team .
It ’s not that Galligan always agrees with what Apple mandates , but that he would rather play ball and stay in the game than take his chances with unapproved features .
Yelp , Galligan says , has changed the development game for everyone , ensuring even longer approval times as the review teams scour lines of code for tricks and treats .
I can understand Galligan ’s concern .
The App Store is a symbiotic relationship .
Apple gives developers access to a truly ravenous audience , and the best apps draw more customers to Apple ’s phone .
Everyone makes money , everyone goes home happy .
But Apple has been tightening its grip lately , reigning in even the tamest of applications , like Facebook 3.0 , and making them beg for release .
Rumored rejections of key apps , like Google Voice , have even led TechCrunch ’s founder , Michael Arrington , to leave his iPhone behind for greener pastures .
Granted , approval problems are n’t going to make the majority of iPhone users look for change ( if AT&T does n’t scare you off , what will ? ) , but the developers have more to worry about than Apple ’s good graces .
It ’s consumers making developers money , we ’re just letting Apple handle the transaction , and consumers love it when their phones can do something cool .
Monocle is decidedly cool and , though Yelp may have snuck one over on Apple to release it , Yelp created a bond with the consumer that Apple better not break .
Imagine the outrage if Apple pulled Yelp .
Granted , it ’s no Google Voice , but it ’s prominent enough that more than just the Arringtons of the world would notice .
And oh would they be pissed .
With as much bad press as Apple ’s recently had , it ca n’t afford to give consumers another reason to cry foul .
If anything , now is the perfect time for developers to take action .
I hate to turn this into some hyperbolic plea for an uprising but , developers , you have nothing to lose but your chains !
That ’s the real beauty of this situation – Yelp is catering to its real audience : the consumers .
While Galligan is worried about Apple , and whether developers will get to implement his SDK in a timely fashion , Yelp is using consumers to force Apple ’s hand , reminding Apple none too gently that it better behave .
This post is dedicated to all the stoners who have took something of limited use and turned it into a functional smoking device ..
DISCLAIMER : If you attempt to build one of these on your own make sure the parts you are using can withstand high heat without vaporizing .
You do n’t want to inhale plastic … that leads to all sorts of bad stuff in the long run .
Now let the fun begin :
The Mannequin Bong – by far the most sought after cutie of em all .. you inhale the smoke out of her mouth ..
Sexy or just creepy ?
Do n’t take her out of the basement .
The gatorade bottle bong –
The most reproduced bong , there seems to be a lot of different flavors of it ..
A six tree percolator gatorade bong ..
Definitely not safe to smoke out of .
But cool to look at !
This ones got some snazzy LED lighting in it ..
That ’s a whole lotta percolators !
CoCa -Cola is gonna be happy seeing their bottles used as a bong here ..
Sobe bottle +
Pipe = Bong
Pom bottle bong
You know she ’s saying , “ Smoke me ”
Beaker Bottle Improvised Bong – now that ’s smart

The Bible Code III !
Michael Drosnin's third book in the Bible Code series , called the Bible Code III : Saving the World , was released this week , accompanied by a full - page ad in the NY Times on Dec. 8th , 2010 .
Drosnin has kindly placed an excerpt from his new book on the internet :
http://www.thebiblecode.com/?p=10
I applied the " Bible Code " technique to this excerpt ( a mere 3,681 characters , for 818 words ) , and found these AMAZING secret messages : The Bible Code is a Vain Hoax : The Bible Code is Megalo - Mania :
Do these codes mean anything ?
Of course not !
They just serve to show how easily hidden messages can be produced in any text , not just the Torah .
I searched for MEGALO - MANIA because I suspect that Bible Code III will be just more of Drosnin 's megalomania that was so overdone in Bible Code II .
The man really thinks he 's the one individual who can save the World !

Shocking New Codes Found in Drosnin Sequel !
Michael Drosnin's sequel to the Bible Code , called the Bible Code II , was released in November 2002 .
Amazon.com has kindly placed an excerpt from the new book on the internet : http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/detail/-/books/0670032107/reviews/104-1983797-5535125#06700321072300
I applied the " Bible Code " technique to this excerpt ( a mere 6,966 characters , for 1,617 words ) , and found this AMAZING secret message : " THE BIBLE CODE IS A SILLY , DUMB , FAKE , FALSE , EVIL , NASTY , DISMAL FRAUD AND SNAKE - OIL HOAX . "
Drosnin predicts :
Dave Thomas will Hammer Drosnin's New Book !
Running from upper left to lower right is the very long ( nine letters ) hidden word " Hammerman . "
This is part of the eleven - letter ELS " DT - HAMMERMAN , " which obviously refers to Bible - Code critic Dave Thomas .
( Or not , if you prefer ! )
Suggestions for inclusion of " DISMAL , " " FALSE " and " HAMMERMAN " kindly supplied by Brendan McKay .
What does the puzzle above prove ?
It shows , once again , that detailed interlocking puzzles for ANY desired message can be harvested from ANY text , and not just from the Bible .
This directly contradicts Drosnin 's false assertion from his first Bible Code book :  Consistently , the Bible Code brings together interlocking words that reveal related information .
With Bill Clinton , President .
With the Moon landing , spaceship and Apollo 11 .
With Hitler , Nazi .
With Kennedy , Dallas .
In experiment after experiment , the crossword puzzles were found only in the Bible .

Bob Novak discusses the Bible Code with Drosnin on CNN Crossfire , December 2 , 2002 .
http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0212/02/cf.00.html
NOVAK : Mr Drosnin , as far as I can see all the experts , scientists , Judaic scholars , think you 're out to lunch on this book .
And let me quote one of them now Dave Thomas in " People Magazine , " this is not the late Dave Thomas from Wendy's , this is a mathematician and physicist .
And he says , he wrote in 1997 , " Hidden messages can be found anywhere provided you 're willing to invest time and effort to harvest the vast field of probability .
He , Drosnin , underestimates the power of chance combined with the brute force of computers .
He says these messages are beyond the power of chance , and I 've proven they are not . "
What is your response to Dr. Thomas here ?
DROSNIN : It 's really silly .
In fact , the great scientist who discovered the Bible code who is the world 's leading expert in group theory , the field of mathematics that underlies quantum physics , told me just the other day that the evidence for the Bible code is stronger than ever .
There is no question that the Bible code is real .
And there is no question that it does foretell events that happened thousands of years after the Bible was written .
Sometimes before they happen .
And when one of the critics can find encoded anywhere except in the Bible the assassination of a prime minister a year in advance then we can listen to them .
Until then , they are the ones who are just making a lot of noise .
See what Drosnin is calling " noise " - a successful prediction , based on secret codes in War and Peace , of the 1998 NBA champs , made months in advance !
I have already been asked by several people if I have found " Bible Codes " related to the September 11th terrorist attacks on New York , Washington D.C. , and elsewhere .
Since the " Bible Code " is simply an arcane mathematical technique which allows the user to " harvest " detailed " predictions " of ANY EVENT , using ANY TEXT , then of course , after - the - fact predictions of the terror attacks can be found in the Torah , or in War and Peace , or even the Albuquerque Telephone book .
Any message can be derived from any text .
Out of respect for the victims of these terrible acts , and for their families , I will NOT be searching for code " predictions " of these events , in any text , now or at any time in the future .
Sincerely , Dave Thomas September 25th , 2001
THOMAS IN THE TORAH
In 2000 , a nice lady from Louisiana , " Dee , " asked me if I had ever looked for my own name in the Torah .
" There 's an idea , " I thought .
What she really wanted was for me to look for her name in the Torah , but that did n't come out till later .
The fact that the Bible Code can be used to find any message ( in any text ) means that any John Doe can find himself in there .
And if John Doe is a believer , the thought that even he is mentioned ( secretly ) by God in the Bible is appealing indeed .
I resurrected my trusty code programs , and learned how to spell " David Thomas " in Hebrew .
I launched the search , and found several instances of my name encoded in the Torah itself .
One of these was located entirely within the first book , Genesis ; this appears below .
Here , the Hebrew letters spelling " DAVID THOMAS " run from bottom to top .
" David Thomas " in the Book of Genesis .
Of course , I did n't stop with the Torah .
I looked for myself in Charles Darwin 's classic Origin of Species , and found my name in there too !
When I told Dee about that , she replied , " Maybe that 's just how Jesus says ' Look , even here . ' " I then told her about a Muslim who found coincidences with the number 19 in the Koran , and how he felt those proved that only the Koran is Divine .
I told her I had found mysterious 19 coincidences , not in the Koran , but in Ted Kaczynski's Unabomber Manifesto .
I asked her how she would respond to my Muslim correspondent if he dismissed the Unabomber 's number - 19 coincidences by simply claiming " It 's Allah 's way of saying ' Look , even here . ' "
I do n't think I heard from her again after that .

As my wife and I were driving through New Mexico , on Sunday , June 14th , 1998 , we listened to game 6 of the Chicago Bulls / Utah Jazz National Basketball Association ( NBA ) playoffs .
As the game drew to a close , we heard the Utah crowd groan as Michael Jordan sank the winning basket .
And then and there , a chill went down my spine .
" Oh my God ... , " I thought to myself .
" The Tolstoy Code is real . "
Fifty days ( more than 7 weeks ) before , on April 27th , 1998 , I had undertaken a search for NBA teams and players using the technique of ' equidistant letter sequences ' popularized in the book The Bible Code , by Michael Drosnin .
( One of Drosnin 's strongest claims in support of the Bible Code was that his code - based prediction of the assassination of Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin was made a year before the event took place . )
Unlike Drosnin , however , I was n't searching in the Hebrew Torah -- instead , I was looking in book one of an English translation of Leo Tolstoy 's epic , War and Peace .
I had wondered if the NBA playoff winner could actually be predicted in advance .
What did my April search reveal ?
CHICAGO was found encoded just once in War and Peace , at a step of 8891 characters ( and therefore 100 % ' minimal , ' i.e. having the shortest step for that word ) .
Ominously , " JAZZ " was NOT encoded at all .
But there was more !
" BULLS " was also encoded 32 times in Book 1 of War and Peace , and of these , five matches had non-zero domains of minimality .
Amazingly , " CHICAGO " and one of the minimal ( shortest - step ) " BULLS " appeared close to each other in a classic " Bible - code " crossword puzzle .
I also found 14 hidden occurrences of " JORDAN , " and one of these ( minimal step , of course ) made an excellent , small puzzle with one of the minimal " BULLS . "
" JORDAN " and " BULLS " hidden in Tolstoy 's War and Peace
With all these " Bible Code " indicators flashing -- matching of long words , proximity of paired matches , and strict use of " minimal " matches -- I rushed to send my prediction to several reporters and scientists .
I thought about trying to warn Karl " the Mailman " Malone of the Jazz --- but I decided to let history run its course .
When I made my prediction , there were 16 teams in the playoffs .
And the Bulls , while favored , almost lost it all on more than one occasion .
In fact , the Indiana Pacers came very close to defeating them , but Tolstoy 's Bulls clung to their destiny .
And on June 14th , my prediction came to pass .
Not only had Tolstoy predicted the victors would be the Chicago Bulls , but Jordan 's key role in the victory had been forecast -- almost two months in advance .
And now , we are left to ponder the somber truth .
Either the " Bible Code " nonsense is just a general , arcane mathematical technique , which can be employed to find any desired messages or predictions , hidden in any book or text ....
...or , Leo Tolstoy is the Supreme Being who created the Universe .
THE END OF THE BIBLE CODE , PART II
By Dave Thomas , nmsrdaveATswcp.com ( replace the AT with an @ )
One of the chief arguments employed by proponents of the Bible Code is to mention that the original code proponents , Witztum , Rips and Rosenberg , published a paper supporting the phenomenon in the journal Statistical Science in 1994 , and that , to date , no rebuttal has ever been published there .
But just such a paper , authored by Brendan McKay , Dror Bar - Natan , Maya Bar - Hillel and Gil Kalai , has finally been published in the May 1999 edition of Statistical Science .
The authors show definitively that the secret of the codes lies not in any special properties of Genesis , but rather in methods by which the lists of modern names and dates were chosen .
In other words , the data ( the text of Genesis ) was not altered or modified , but the choice of the experiments ( e.g. the list of famous rabbis and measures of closeness ) completely determines the results .
McKay and his co-authors also show that several very reasonable measures of code effectiveness , much less convoluted than the complicated one chosen by Witztum and Rips , show no trace of the alleged " encoding " in Genesis or other books of the Torah .
The article , and many others , is available on the web at McKay 's excellent site ( see specifically the page at http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/StatSci/ ) .
Mckay 's article , at almost 40 pages , is much more detailed and rigorous than the original paper by Witztum , Rips , and Rosenberg , and contains a detailed bibliography .
Drosnin's claims are so sensational that they can be dismissed rather easily .
The claims of the original Israeli mathematicians are much more difficult to understand , and also to disprove .
We are indeed fortunate that McKay and colleagues have published their extensive and devastating research on the codes of Rips and Witztum .

MISCELLANEOUS NEWS
The Associated Press reported on Saturday , September 30 , 2000 the following :
" Ashland - A Hebrew scholar and a mathematician have found what they call one of the most significant discoveries in the field of Bible code research .
Nathan Jacobi , an Ashland scientist and Hebrew teacher , found a seven - word sentence encoded in the Old Testament book of Isaiah .
' Everybody I 've shown it to thinks it 's phenomenal , ' said Jacobi .
The longest code to date had been 13 letters long .
The chances of finding a sentence - length code in a Hebrew text is one out of 685 billion times 1 billion , said Ed Sherman .
He owns an Ashland firm that runs insurance statis - tics for several fortune 500 companies .
Jacobi and Sherman 's newest code is Shakak Meal Yeshua Shmi Az Sasu Avim , which is translated into ' Gushing over Yeshua was my mighty name and the clouds rejoiced . '
Yeshua is the commonly agreed - upon name for Jesus , Jacobi said .
The code was found in Isaiah 53 , a text that prophcies the coming of Jesus Christ as messiah .
Scholars attribute the text to a prophet who lived six centuries before Christ was born . "
Further details can be obtained from Jacobi and Sherman 's web site , at
http://www.biblecodecritic.com/page.php/23.
On October 17th , I contacted Bible Code expert Brendan McKay in Australia about the " stunning " new code .
McKay told me " Funniest thing about it is that the supposed 22 - letter ELS does not actually exist .
I tried 4 different editions of Isaiah and all of them have the last required letter out of place by one .
With only 21 letters it falls apart ( plural changes to singular then the verb does n't match , etc. ) .
Also , the Hebrew is appalling , according to my Israeli friends .
In any case you can read the same sequence of letters in lots of ways .
... "
McKay supplied some actual alternative translations of the sentence in question , including adding a letter at the beginning with the right skip .
These translations are far from what was claimed by Jacobi and Sherman - so far , in fact , that I chose not to present them so as not to offend our Christian browsers .
At any rate , it appears this latest " stunning " Bible Code confirmation falls short of the mark , once again .

Bible Code Movie a Flash in the Pan ?
The new movie " The Omega Code , " starring Michael York , is a millennial thriller based on the premise that the " Bible Code " is real .
The movie had a good first weekend in mid-October , with $ 2.4 million in sales , and an average of $ 7,700 per screen .
It has been advertised mainly through churches and word of mouth .
By the next weekend , only two more screens were added , and earnings fell 32 % ( 25 % is considered normal ) .
" Mr. ShowBiz " predicts that the film will be lucky to even break even ; the production cost $ 7.2 million .
Mr. Showbiz also notes that the producer of the film " wanted to have it playing in 450 theaters by the end of November .
At this point , the likelihood seems to be that Code may not be in theaters at all by then . "

More Bible Code Gossip
By Dave Thomas
There have been several interesting developments in the Bible Code saga since last month 's report .
o Aussie mathematician Brendan McKay e-mailed me the outline of a much faster search algorithm , which I incorporated into my own code program .
It is tens of times faster , and allows me to search for all possible step sequences .
It is faster than my brute - force approach ( checking all possible equidistant letter sequences ) because it 's more like the way you can find short words by inspection of the puzzles .
You focus on those letters of the text that match the first letter of the desired hidden word , and then find letters matching the second letter of the desired word .
For each two - letter pair , check the location of the third letter in the pattern ; if it matches your desired word , keep going , otherwise move on to the next pair .
o I have derived , with John Geohegan 's assistance , a formula for how many occurrences of given words you would expect to find in a text of a given number of random letters .
You must calculate the probability of selection for each letter , which depends on the particular text being examined .
This is just the number of occurrences of the letter divided by the total number of letters .
Typically , the probability for getting an " E " is above 0.1 , while that for a " Q " can be just 0.005 .
For a given word like " Roswell , " you multiply the chances for an " R " with that for an " O " , then an " S , " and so on .
The final product is multiplied by the total possible number of equidistant letter sequences for the word , which is roughly the square of the number of letters in the entire text divided by one less than the number of letters in the candidate hidden word .
This formula works quite well .
I estimated that I would find 18.7 occurrences of " Clinton " in War and Peace , Book 1 ( 212,000 characters , 7.5 billion possible 7 - letter equidistant sequences ) ; the actual number was 21 .
I estimated I would find 128.1 matches for " Apollo " - and got 129 .
For " Moon , " I estimated 150,283 , and found 151,704 .
With each additional letter in candidate words , the chances fall , because you must multiply your product by another number invariably less than one .
And rare letters reduce the expected matches greatly .
o People Magazine has picked up the chase , and reporter Michael Haederle asked me if I had looked for hidden messages in Drosnin 's book .
I replied " Hmmm . .. "
Shortly thereafter , I downloaded the chapter excerpt of Drosnin 's book The Bible Code from Simon and Schuster 's web site , and began searching away .
Even though the chapter was only about 4,000 characters in length , I was able to produce a number of hits .
One puzzle held a lunar theme : space , lunar , craft , and several " moon "s , all authentic hidden words .
I found the ubiquitous " Hitler / Nazi , " even though the excerpt did not mention those words directly , talking instead mainly about the Rabin assassination .
One puzzle has the hidden message " The Code is a Silly Snake - Oil Hoax . "
Oh , and I found " The Code is Evil " hidden in Drosnin 's book ( mixed message he 's sending us here ... ) .
" The Code is Evil , " hidden in The Bible Code by Michael Drosnin ( Simon and Schuster , 1997 ) .
o Drosnin has been stumping Australia , flattering code - buster Brendan McKay with compliments such as " clown , " " liar , " " fraud , " and " like a baby just learning to talk compared to the world - famous Professor Rips . "
But Drosnin is also attacking McKay because McKay 's puzzles allegedly do n't have " minimality . "
Not only must hidden words appear close together in a puzzle - they must also be the shortest skip distances for the given word in a fair - sized portion of the text .
Drosnin only mentions " minimality " in passing , buried in the chapter notes at the end of his book : " All of the Bible code print - outs displayed in this book have been confirmed by statistics to be encoded beyond chance .
The word combinations are mathematically proven to be non-random ... The computer scores the matches between words , using two tests - how closely they appear together , and whether the skips that spell out the search words are the shortest in the Bible .
( For a more detailed explanation see Appendix . ) "
Interestingly , some of Drosnin 's own puzzles are not " minimal . "
His match for " Clinton " has the largest step of all four " Clinton 's " found in the Hebrew Torah , and the other three occur entirely within the chosen match .
Each of these three serves to give the chosen " Clinton " a " domain of minimality " of zero .
( In contrast , the close matches of " Hitler " and " Nazi " I found in Drosnin 's own book are both minimal over the entire text . )
o I fetched the Torah ( Koren edition ) from McKay 's web site , and modified my program to handle the Hebrew characters via the Michigan - Claremont transliteration scheme ( in which , for example , the Hebrew letter Shin , , is represented as $ ) .
I have since reproduced a number of Drosnin 's puzzles , including the non-minimal " Clinton / President " match .
o Amazingly , Drosnin found Shoemaker - Levy ( transliterated as $ WMKRLWY , 8 characters ) , not in the 5 books of the Torah , but in Isaiah .
Eliyahu Rips used Isaiah as a control , an example of an ancient Hebrew text without the " code , " and found no unlikely codes therein .
Drosnin also found " computer " in the book of Daniel .
Perhaps he forget that the " Code " is supposed to occur only in the five books of Moses : Genesis , Exodus , Leviticus , Numbers , and Deuteronomy .

People does the Bible Code
By Dave Thomas
The Nov. 3rd 1997 issue of People Magazine had a 2 - page article on the Bible Code , including pictures of me , colleague Brendan McKay , and author Michael Drosnin .
Most of the work was done by Albuquerque free - lancer Michael Haederle .
Also , Eric Zorn of the Chicago Tribune did a nice piece on the codes in the Oct. 27th issue , available on the Web at [ link expired sorry ! ] .
This site has great links to many code pages , including John Fleck 's Journal piece .
I searched Zorn 's past editorials to see if he had predicted the very recent disgrace of an alderman named Huels .
He had , all right !
During the search , I also came across the best ELS ( equidistant letter sequence ) I have found to date : if you have ever committed the word " generalization " to print , you have created a hidden code about the Third Reich !
Behold , at a step of three , the Nazi : geNerAliZatIon .
And because the step is so small , this match has super " minimality " used to grade puzzle matches .
Watch what you write , people !

We are what we repeatedly do .
Excellence , then , is not an act , but a habit .
– Aristotle
Our daily lives are often a series of habits played out through the day , a trammeled existence fettered by the slow accretion of our previous actions .
By Leo Babauta
But habits can be changed , as difficult as that may seem sometimes .
I ’m a living example : in tiny , almost infinitesimal steps , I ’ve changed a laundry list of habits .
Quit smoking , stopped impulse spending , got out of debt , began running and waking early and eating healthier and becoming frugal and simplifying my life and becoming organized and focused and productive , ran three marathons and a couple of triathlons , started a few successful blogs , eliminated my debt … you get the picture .
It ’s possible .
And while I ’ve written about habit change many times over the course of the life of Zen Habits , today I thought I ’d put the best tips all together in one cheatsheet , for those new to the blog and for those who could use the reminders .
Keep it simple
Habit change is not that complicated .
While the tips below will seem overwhelming , there ’s really only a few things you need to know .
Everything else is just helping these to become reality .
The simple steps of habit change :
1. Write down your plan .
2. Identify your triggers and replacement habits .
3 . Focus on doing the replacement habits every single time the triggers happen , for about 30 days .
That ’s it .
We ’ll talk more about each of these steps , and much more , in the cheatsheet below .
The Habit Change Cheatsheet
The following is a compilation of tips to help you change a habit .
Do n’t be overwhelmed — always remember the simple steps above .
The rest are different ways to help you become more successful in your habit change .
1 . Do just one habit at a time .
Extremely important .
Habit change is difficult , even with just one habit .
If you do more than one habit at a time , you ’re setting yourself up for failure .
Keep it simple , allow yourself to focus , and give yourself the best chance for success .
Btw , this is why New Year ’s resolutions often fail — people try to tackle more than one change at a time .
2. Start small .
The smaller the better , because habit change is difficult , and trying to take on too much is a recipe for disaster .
Want to exercise ?
Start with just 5 - 10 minutes .
Want to wake up earlier ?
Try just 10 minutes earlier for now .
Or consider half habits .
3 . Do a 30 - day Challenge .
In my experience , it takes about 30 days to change a habit , if you ’re focused and consistent .
This is a round number and will vary from person to person and habit to habit .
Often you ’ll read a magical “ 21 days ” to change a habit , but this is a myth with no evidence .
Seriously — try to find the evidence from a scientific study for this .
A more recent study shows that 66 days is a better number ( read more ) .
But 30 days is a good number to get you started .
Your challenge : stick with a habit every day for 30 days , and post your daily progress updates to a forum .
4 . Write it down .
Just saying you ’re going to change the habit is not enough of a commitment .
You need to actually write it down , on paper .
Write what habit you ’re going to change .
5 . Make a plan .
While you ’re writing , also write down a plan .
This will ensure you ’re really prepared .
The plan should include your reasons ( motivations ) for changing , obstacles , triggers , support buddies , and other ways you ’re going to make this a success .
More on each of these below .
6 . Know your motivations , and be sure they ’re strong .
Write them down in your plan .
You have to be very clear why you ’re doing this , and the benefits of doing it need to be clear in your head .
If you ’re just doing it for vanity , while that can be a good motivator , it ’s not usually enough .
We need something stronger .
For me , I quit smoking for my wife and kids .
I made a promise to them .
I knew if I did n’t smoke , not only would they be without a husband and father , but they ’d be more likely to smoke themselves ( my wife was a smoker and quit with me ) .
7 . Do n’t start right away .
In your plan , write down a start date .
Maybe a week or two from the date you start writing out the plan .
When you start right away ( like today ) , you are not giving the plan the seriousness it deserves .
When you have a “ Quit Date ” or “ Start Date ” , it gives that date an air of significance .
Tell everyone about your quit date ( or start date ) .
Put it up on your wall or computer desktop .
Make this a Big Day .
It builds up anticipation and excitement , and helps you to prepare .
8 . Write down all your obstacles .
If you ’ve tried this habit change before ( odds are you have ) , you ’ve likely failed .
Reflect on those failures , and figure out what stopped you from succeeding .
Write down every obstacle that ’s happened to you , and others that are likely to happen .
Then write down how you plan to overcome them .
That ’s the key : write down your solution before the obstacles arrive , so you ’re prepared .
9. Identify your triggers .
What situations trigger your current habit ?
For the smoking habit , for example , triggers might include waking in the morning , having coffee , drinking alcohol , stressful meetings , going out with friends , driving , etc .
Most habits have multiple triggers .
Identify all of them and write them in your plan .
10 .
For every single trigger , identify a positive habit you ’re going to do instead .
When you first wake in the morning , instead of smoking , what will you do ?
What about when you get stressed ?
When you go out with friends ?
Some positive habits could include : exercise , meditation , deep breathing , organizing , decluttering , and more .
“ Habit is habit , and not to be flung out of the window by any man , but coaxed downstairs a step at a time . ” – Mark Twain
11 . Plan a support system .
Who will you turn to when you have a strong urge ?
Write these people into your plan .
Support forums online are a great tool as well — I used a smoking cessation forum on about.com when I quit smoking , and it really helped .
Do n’t underestimate the power of support — it ’s really important .
12 . Ask for help .
Get your family and friends and co-workers to support you .
Ask them for their help , and let them know how important this is .
Find an AA group in your area .
Join online forums where people are trying to quit .
When you have really strong urges or a really difficult time , call on your support network for help .
Do n’t smoke a cigarette , for example , without posting to your online quit forum .
Do n’t have a drop of alcohol before calling your AA buddy .
13 . Become aware of self - talk .
You talk to yourself , in your head , all the time — but often we ’re not aware of these thoughts .
Start listening .
These thoughts can derail any habit change , any goal .
Often they ’re negative : “ I ca n’t do this .
This is too difficult .
Why am I putting myself through this ?
How bad is this for me anyway ?
I ’m not strong enough .
I do n’t have enough discipline .
I suck . ”
It ’s important to know you ’re doing this .
14 . Stay positive .
You will have negative thoughts — the important thing is to realize when you ’re having them , and push them out of your head .
Squash them like a bug !
Then replace them with a positive thought .
“ I can do this !
If Leo can do it , so can I ! ” :)
15 . Have strategies to defeat the urge .
Urges are going to come — they ’re inevitable , and they ’re strong .
But they ’re also temporary , and beatable .
Urges usually last about a minute or two , and they come in waves of varying strength .
You just need to ride out the wave , and the urge will go away .
Some strategies for making it through the urge : deep breathing , self - massage , eat some frozen grapes , take a walk , exercise , drink a glass of water , call a support buddy , post on a support forum .
16 . Prepare for the sabotagers .
There will always be people who are negative , who try to get you to do your old habit .
Be ready for them .
Confront them , and be direct : you do n’t need them to try to sabotage you , you need their support , and if they ca n’t support you then you do n’t want to be around them .
17 . Talk to yourself .
Be your own cheerleader , give yourself pep talks , repeat your mantra ( below ) , and do n’t be afraid to seem crazy to others .
We ’ll see who ’s crazy when you ’ve changed your habit and they ’re still lazy , unhealthy slobs !
18 . Have a mantra .
For quitting smoking , mine was “ Not One Puff Ever ” ( I did n’t make this up , but it worked — more on this below ) .
When I wanted to quit my day job , it was “ Liberate Yourself ” .
This is just a way to remind yourself of what you ’re trying to do .
19 . Use visualization .
This is powerful .
Vividly picture , in your head , successfully changing your habit .
Visualize doing your new habit after each trigger , overcoming urges , and what it will look like when you ’re done .
This seems new - agey , but it really works .
20 .
Have rewards .
Regular ones .
You might see these as bribes , but actually they ’re just positive feedback .
Put these into your plan , along with the milestones at which you ’ll receive them .
21 . Take it one urge at a time .
Often we ’re told to take it one day at a time — which is good advice — but really it ’s one urge at a time .
Just make it through this urge .
22 . Not One Puff Ever ( in other words , no exceptions ) .
This seems harsh , but it ’s a necessity : when you ’re trying to break the bonds between an old habit and a trigger , and form a new bond between the trigger and a new habit , you need to be really consistent .
You ca n’t do it sometimes , or there will be no new bond , or at least it will take a really really long time to form .
So , at least for the first 30 days ( and preferably 60 ) , you need to have no exceptions .
Each time a trigger happens , you need to do the new habit and not the old one .
No exceptions , or you ’ll have a backslide .
If you do mess up , regroup , learn from your mistake , plan for your success , and try again ( see the last item on this list ) .
23 . Get rest .
Being tired leaves us vulnerable to relapse .
Get a lot of rest so you can have the energy to overcome urges .
24 . Drink lots of water .
Similar to the item above , being dehydrated leaves us open to failure .
Stay hydrated !
25 . Renew your commitment often .
Remind yourself of your commitment hourly , and at the beginning and end of each day .
Read your plan .
Celebrate your success .
Prepare yourself for obstacles and urges .
26 . Set up public accountability .
Blog about it , post on a forum , email your commitment and daily progress to friend and family , post a chart up at your office , write a column for your local newspaper ( I did this when I ran my first marathon ) .
When we make it public — not just the commitment but the progress updates — we do n’t want to fail .
27 . Engineer it so it ’s hard to fail .
Create a groove that ’s harder to get out of than to stay in : increase positive feedback for sticking with the habit , and increase negative feedback for not doing the habit .
Read more on this method .
28 . Avoid some situations where you normally do your old habit , at least for awhile , to make it a bit easier on yourself .
If you normally drink when you go out with friends , consider not going out for a little while .
If you normally go outside your office with co-workers to smoke , avoid going out with them .
This applies to any bad habit — whether it be eating junk food or doing drugs , there are some situations you can avoid that are especially difficult for someone trying to change a bad habit .
Realize , though , that when you go back to those situations , you will still get the old urges , and when that happens you should be prepared .
29 .
If you fail , figure out what went wrong , plan for it , and try again .
Do n’t let failure and guilt stop you .
They ’re just obstacles , but they can be overcome .
In fact , if you learn from each failure , they become stepping stones to your success .
Regroup .
Let go of guilt .
Learn .
Plan .
And get back on that horse .
TorrentFreak reports that Ukrainian - based BitTorrent tracker Demonoid is facing some huge hardware problems that will certainly result in some downtime for its users .
Demonoid admins have admitted to having serious problems with a lot of components ranging from system memory , hard - drives and power circuits .
It seems that a little problem has escalated into a serious damage since just days before , the tracker was working just fine .
After an unresolved initial hardware problem , the damage extended to some other components inside its data center .
“ We are experiencing power outages that have caused some ram and hard drive issues .
We might have to shut down everything to fix and prevent further damage , ” said a Demonoid statement , “ days maybe , until we can change the power circuit . ”
This comes as the tracker is struggling to stay alive after some serious legal disputes in recent years that forced Demonoid owners to move camp up to three times until now .
Initially , the tracker started out in Holland , but after the BREIN anti-piracy group launched several legal attacks , Demonoid quickly moved to a calmer environment in Canada .
That did n't last any longer after the local CRIA anti-piracy group forced Demonoid to shut down its operations there too .
The site made a triumphant return in 2008 , after six months of blackout , relocating in the Ukraine , a safer environment for piracy prone activities .
Recently , to obey local laws that forbids any piracy activity for Ukrainian ( and Russian ) citizens , Demonoid has blocked all those users coming from these countries and operates in legal peace from its new location .
Demonoid is still under scrutiny from major recording and entertainment companies around the Globe for its lite policy against copyrighted material , a scrutiny that it has managed to fend off until now with greater success than other rivals like Mininova , Pirate Bay or IsoHunt .
HONG KONG  China is set to tighten its hammerlock on the market for some of the world ’s most obscure but valuable minerals .
China currently accounts for 93 percent of production of so - called rare earth elements  and more than 99 percent of the output for two of these elements , dysprosium and terbium , vital for a wide range of green energy technologies and military applications like missiles .
Deng Xiaoping once observed that the Mideast had oil , but China had rare earth elements .
As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has done with oil , China is now starting to flex its muscle .
Even tighter limits on production and exports , part of a plan from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology , would ensure China has the supply for its own technological and economic needs , and force more manufacturers to make their wares here in order to have access to the minerals .
Calais migrants mutilate fingertips to hide true identity
Migrants massed in Calais in hopes of getting into Britain are mutilating their fingerprints so that their true identities cannot be established , it emerged today .
They burn their hands , or remove layers of skin to prevent analysis from being effective .
This means that data showing everything from criminal records to repeat attempts to claim asylum will not appear on European wide computers .
The sinister development was revealed by Calais prefect Gerard Gavory who said that at least 57 asylum seekers questioned in the port town over the past few weeks ' had their finger prints removed . '
Cat -and - mouse : Around 2000 UK bound migrants are repeat asylum seekers with criminal records , burning their skin to prevent fingertip analysis ( File pic )
Mr Gavory said scars caused by knives and razors were commonplace , or else polyurethane glue or even acid was used to remove fingerprint patterns .
The most common method was to place all ten fingers on an oven hob and turn up the heat .
The European Union has a joint database called Eurodoc which stores asylum - seekers ' prints .
If migration officials discover applicants have already had their case heard in another EU state , they are liable to be sent back .
Just as importantly , known criminals can be turned back at borders , preventing them living in countries like Britain on benefits while they claim asylum , or else disappearing into the black economy .
Police in Calais believe that some of the 2000 odd UK bound migrants sleeping rough in the town are repeat asylum seekers with criminal records .
All are prepared to try and get to Britain at any cost , regularly playing a cat - and - mouse game with the authorities as they try and get aboard ferries and trains .
Mr Gavory said he was hoping that deportation flights back to countries like Afghanistan would soon resume .
He said Britain was in favour of them , and ' By my reckoning , Great Britain is not less democratic than France . '
Mr Gavory added : ' We 're not sending them to their deaths , but towards peaceful zones .
In organising a return , we will be sending a strong signal to the Afghans .
At the moment they have a sense of complete impunity in Calais . '
The authorities in Calais are preparing to destroy the so - called ' The Jungle ' , an area of wasteland close to the ferry port where hundreds live in conditions of complete squalor .
Asked to respond to claims by charities that The Jungle will be closed as early as this week , Mr Gavory said : ' There are rumours .
We 'll see if they 're true or not .
What 's sure is that when it happens we wo n't be shouting it from the roof tops .
We 're working on it .
' We have to tear it down before the end of the year , and it 's a difficult job .
Razing it is easy , but we must do it the right way . '
Watch as these guys capture a lightning storm a little too close for comfort .
The village has set a standard of cleanliness much admired throughout India
By Jyotsna Singh
BBC News , Meghalaya
A small village in the north - eastern Indian state of Meghalaya has become the envy of its neighbours .
Large crowds of visitors have been thronging to the village curious to find out why Mawlynnong has earned the reputation for being arguably the cleanest and best educated in India - all its residents can read and write and each house has a toilet .
That is no mean achievement in a country that is still struggling to educate its population and address basic water and sanitation issues .
About 90 km ( 55 miles ) from the state capital Shillong and barely 4 km ( 2.4 miles ) from the Bangladeshi border , Mawlynnong is much loved by its inhabitants who work hard to keep it clean .
Bamboo dustbins
It is five in the morning and pouring with rain .
But that does not deter a group of volunteers in the village from rising early to sweep the roads .
It is a process that is repeated several times a day .
There is a fine imposed by the village council for anybody found to be throwing litter around or cutting trees
Mawlynnong village headman Thomlin Khongthohrem
" Some cleaners have been hired by the village council to sweep the roads - but many villagers take turns to make sure they are swept several times a day because it is not possible to pay so many people , " says young volunteer Henry Khyrrum .
The streets are all dotted with dustbins made of bamboo .
Every piece of litter and almost every leaf that has fallen from a tree is immediately discarded .
Plastic bags are completely banned and all waste disposal is environmentally friendly .
Rubbish is thrown into a pit dug in a forest near the village where it is left to turn into compost .
The villagers here say that lessons in hygiene start in school so that children can be taught from an early age how to keep their surroundings clean and green .
Mawlynnong is one of the wettest parts of the country - and while many parts of India are suffering under drought - like conditions this year , the south - western monsoon has not disappointed the north - east .
While the supply of clean water and sanitation is a huge problem in India 's teeming cities , it is an even bigger challenge for the authorities in the country 's villages where these facilities are almost non-existent .
Keeping it clean now comes naturally to most people here .
The village headman says the village council - or Darbar - maintains very strict discipline .
' Global warming '
" There is a fine imposed by the village council for anybody found to be throwing litter around or cutting trees .
You see , the fine is just $ 1 for each such offence committed .
But due to the humiliation and embarrassment that our self - respecting people feel at being fined , they make sure to follow the rules , " says village headman Thomlin Khongthohrem .
Children are taught to collect litter at an early age " Besides , the council carries out strict inspections of the sanitation facilities in each house .
" Workshops are also being organised to make people aware of the dangers from global warming . "
Experts say Mawlynnong , like the rest of the state , has a very effective local governance system .
The society is matrilineal - meaning that land is passed down through the female side of families - making women economically more powerful .
Mawlynnong 's reputation for being clean and green has been well documented , and its Khasi tribal inhabitants are known to be worshippers of nature .
Their reverence for nature is seen by some as an effective way of preserving the forest cover .
Thambor Lyngdoh , in charge of a sacred community forest in a neighbouring village , says the while it is true that many Khasi people are " nature worshippers " the drive for cleanliness and education is not about faith only .
" Even today we are very strict about how the forest can be used , " he says .
" People are allowed to take whatever they need from the forest for their own use .
But they cannot take anything more than that for any kind of commercial use .
They are punished for any violation . "
Local initiative Mawlynnong 's reputation for cleanliness has even earned it a place on the state 's tourism map .
For the villagers , cleanliness is next to Godliness Hundreds of visitors from all over India now visit the village throughout the year .
Most of those visitors are impressed with what they see .
" This is the first time I have come to this place .
I really want to congratulate the villagers who have made the place so beautiful and the cleanest in the continent .
There is something special about the place .
We just came to see why it has become so famous .
It really is clean and you have to give them 10 out of 10 for that , " says Sanjay Saraogi , a tourist from Shillong .
Another tourist , Euginea , says the rest of country should learn from Mawlynnong 's experience .
" I have come to this village to see its cleanliness and I think everybody should follow the example of the villagers , " she says Mawlynnong 's success is entirely driven by local initiative .
It has been so successful that the state government has been prompted to promote eco-tourism in the area but the locals are resisting this .
" There is a fierce sense of self - determination among these people .
There are certain rules they have followed traditionally .
They do not want government to borrow ideas from outside and impose it on them , " says Deepak Laloo , a member of the Meghalaya Tourism Development forum . "
The villagers are treading a path that the rest of India should be keen to follow .

I chose M State because it was close to home , and I never really thought of going anywhere else .
They have the Accounting program I was interested in , and I had always heard amazing things about the college .
Mysterious tool found at a garage sale .
About 3 inches long .
What is its purpose ?
Measuring _something_ , I suspect ; but what ?( Yes , in this orientation it looks like a cartoon man with a big mustache , but I already know that .
UPDATE 20 JULY 2011 : This is a Garnett pallet jewel setter , a device patented by Lemuel Edward Garnett of Chanute , Kansas , to install jewel pallets in the pallet forks of watches .
This is patent number 956956 , granted on May 3 , 1910 .
View of patent : [ link ]
The pallet fork is a part of the watch ; it 's the part that goes tick - tock .
The pallets , which are the bits on the ends of the fork that take the impact , are often made of small pieces of ruby called jewels ( article on pallet forks : [ link ] ) .
The pallet jewels used to be held in place with rosin , and jewel - setting devices often had large flat areas of metal ( on this device , the rounded ear - like things opposite the handle ) to absorb the heat of an alcohol lamp flame and melt the rosin while a jewel was being placed .
The notches in the rotatable square pieces on the spring - loaded jaws fit the ends of various pallet forks and the little levers push the jewels into the desired positions .
An eBay seller was offering one of these stamped with " Garnett 's pat .
May 3 , 10 " , and Google Patent Search found me another patent that gave the correct patent number .
The reason it did n't give me the patent I was looking for directly was that the name was mis-spelled " Gaiinett " in the Patent Search index .
It looks like the patent scans were " read " by software for the indexing , and the results have not been corrected by actual humans .... This confirms that * VladislausDantes had correctly identified the tool category and purpose , back in March 17 , 2010 .
It had seemed very likely , and it is now fully proven .
The patent also provided details of the exact use of the device which neither of us had guessed .
Another mystery solved .
Supporters of Aung San Suu Kyi reacted angrily to her conviction World leaders have reacted with anger and disappointment to the conviction of Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi for violating security laws .
The UN called for her immediate release after she was sentenced to a further 18 months of house arrest - where she has spent 14 of the past 20 years .
The US , the European Union , Britain and France were among those who condemned the verdict .
But trading partners China and India have made no public comment .
The UN Security Council adjourned an emergency session without agreeing a response to the sentencing , and will resume deliberations on Wednesday .
Keeping Aung San Suu Kyi under arrest ... does not serve the proclaimed national interest
Ton van Lierop
EU spokesman
Profile : Aung San Suu Kyi Burmese reaction International sanctions Putting pressure on Burma Britain 's ambassador to the UN , John Sawers , who is head of the Security Council this month , said some countries , including China and Russia , had asked for more time to consider a draft statement condemning the verdict .
Ms Suu Kyi was on trial for allowing a US national , John Yettaw , into her lakeside home after he swam there uninvited .
Mr Yettaw was jailed for seven years , including four years of hard labour .
Critics of Burma 's military regime say the verdict is designed to prevent Ms Suu Kyi from taking part in elections scheduled for 2010 .
' Sham trial ' UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has said he " strongly deplores " the verdict and called for Ms Suu Kyi to be freed .
" Unless she and all other political prisoners in Myanmar [ Burma ] are released and allowed to participate in free and fair elections , the credibility of the political process will remain in doubt , " he said .
The UN special envoy to Burma , Ibrahim Gambari , said Ms Suu Kyi was " absolutely indispensable to the resumption of a political process that can lead to national reconciliation " .
US President Barack Obama called for her " immediate unconditional release " , describing the extension of house arrest as unjust .
ANALYSIS Tin Htar Swe , BBC Burmese Service editor
This verdict was unexpected .
Aung San Suu Kyi herself was expecting a more severe sentence when she recently told visiting diplomats that her punishment " was obviously going to be painful " .
It seems that the ruling party 's real intention is to make sure she cannot influence the forthcoming elections in any way .
No one will have access to her without the authorities ' approval .
A spokesman for the European Union , Ton van Lierop , said the further detention of the 64 - year - old was unacceptable .
" Keeping Aung San Suu Kyi under arrest under fabricated reasons violates her fundamental freedoms , and does not serve the proclaimed national interest either , " he told the BBC .
UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he was " saddened and angry " by the verdict in what he called a " sham " trial .
In a strongly - worded statement , he condemned the " purely political sentence " .
A statement from the office of Nicolas Sarkozy said the French president was calling on the European Union to impose new sanctions on Burma .
Asian response Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Ms Suu Kyi's previous period of house arrest expired on 27 May .
This new term will mean she is still in detention during the polls , which are expected to take place in about May 2010 .
Her party , the National League for Democracy , won the last elections in 1990 but was never allowed to take power .
In Asia , the governments of Indonesia and the Philippines have been outspoken in condemning the sentence .
But , says the BBC's Jill McGivering , it is notable that two of Burma 's biggest trading partners and allies - India and China - have avoided public comment on the trial .
India and China , with Thailand , have been accused by critics of propping up the military government , especially in recent years as growing economic sanctions have strangled its trade relationship with the West .

Can neuroscience read people 's minds ?
Some researchers , and some new businesses , are banking on a brain imaging technique known as functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to reveal hidden thoughts , such as lies , truths or deep desires .
New research by neuroscientists at UCLA and Rutgers University provides evidence that fMRI can be used in certain circumstances to determine what a person is thinking .
At the same time , the research suggests that highly accurate " mind reading " using fMRI is still far from reality .
The research is scheduled to be published in the October 2009 issue of the journal Psychological Science .
In the study , 130 healthy young adults had their brains scanned in an MRI scanner at UCLA 's Ahmanson–Lovelace Brain Mapping Center while they performed one of eight mental tasks , including reading words aloud , saying whether pairs of words rhyme , counting the number of tones they heard , pressing buttons at certain cues and making monetary decisions .
The scientists calculated how accurately they could tell from the fMRI brain scans which mental task each participant was engaged in .
" We take 129 of the subjects and apply a statistical tool to learn the differences among people doing these eight tasks , then we take the 130th person and try to tell which of the tasks this person was doing ; we do that for every person , " said lead study author Russell Poldrack , a professor of psychology who holds UCLA 's Wendell Jeffrey and Bernice Wenzel Term Chair in Behavioral Neuroscience .
" It turns out that we can predict quite well which of these eight tasks they are doing , " he said .
" If we were just guessing , we would get it right about 13 percent of the time .
We get it right about 80 percent of the time with our statistical tool .
It 's not perfect , but it is quite good — but not nearly good enough to be admissible in court , for example .
" Our study suggests that the kinds of things that some people have talked about in terms of mind reading are probably still pretty far off , " Poldrack said .
" If we are only 80 percent accurate with eight very different thoughts and we want to figure out what you 're thinking out of millions of possible thoughts , we 're still very far away from achieving that . "
Poldrack 's study is one of the first to show that neuroscientists can make these kinds of predictions on new people , whose brain patterns the researchers have never seen before .
In most previous studies , researchers made predictions about a person 's mental state after having already studied that person 's brain to understand its particular patterns .

" Our study indicates that different people 's brains work very similarly , " Poldrack said .
" We often tend to focus on how different each person 's brain is , but our study suggests that most healthy people 's brains work in very similar ways ; otherwise , this approach would n't work .
" We can tell a lot about what you 're thinking using functional MRI , even though we have never seen your brain before , " he said .
" However , it is limited in that there are only eight things that we are letting you think about in this study . "
The tools used in this research come from a scientific field known as machine learning , which is related to statistics and computer science , said Poldrack , who noted that this technology is heavily employed by companies like Amazon to predict what people will buy based on their previous purchases .
Nearly 10 years ago , neuroscientists showed that if they take brain images with fMRI while people look at different objects , such as faces , houses and chairs , they can use the tools of machine learning to predict with high accuracy what object the subjects are looking at — if the scientists first know from studying brain activity how each subject 's brain responds to those objects .
Co-authors on the research are Yaroslav Halchenko , a graduate student in psychology at Rutgers University , and Stephen Jose Hanson , a faculty member in psychology at Rutgers University .
The research was funded by the U.S. Office of Naval Research and the James S. McDonnell Foundation .
Sylvain Raynes , an ex- Moody ’s vice president of the ABS group , agrees with the agency ’s whistleblower Eric Kolchinsky , who said that Moody 's is still issuing inflated ratings .
In an exclusive interview with The Business Insider , Raynes said that Kolchinsky is right on the money , and this pattern of behavior has been going on for years at Moody’s .
Raynes raised concerns about ratings to his superiors several times when he was at Moody's .
“ Moody ’s should be terminated right now .
They need to be put out of their misery , and the CEO should resign now , ” he says .
Talking about the deal Kolchinsky raised questions about , Raynes qualifies it as " nonsense . "
" They needed a Baa2 rating to sell it -- no one would buy a deal like that right now , " he said .
Asked about why Moody ’s - – which has come increasingly under fire in recent weeks -- is still in business , Raynes says : " It ’s like prostitution .
It ’s a crime but it 's feeding a need . "

Vancouver Canucks goalie Roberto Luongo is the man in the middle after signing a long - term contract .
Will his heavy workload in an Olympic year affect the team 's fortunes ?
( ( Christopher J. Morris / Canadian Press ) )
The Vancouver Canucks on paper look to be the strongest of the Canadian teams , but an Olympic year will present a unique challenge .
For the first time since NHL players began participating at the Olympics in earnest , one of the league 's member cities will host the Games .
The Canucks reached the Western Conference semifinals for the second time in three years last season , and according to assistant general manager Lorne Henning , they paid close attention to how they were beaten .
" Certainly Chicago 's defence has a lot of mobility and puck - moving defencemen , " Henning told CBCSports.ca .
" It 's the way the game is going now , you 've got to be able to skate .
" It was one of our keys for the summer — to upgrade our speed all - around , forwards and defence . "
Of course , a bigger key was re-signing their three biggest stars — Roberto Luongo and twins Daniel and Henrik Sedin .
At a Glance 2008 - 09 record : 45-27-10 , Northwest Division winner , Western Conference semifinals .
Hello : Christian Ehrhoff ( D ) , Brad Lukowich ( D ) , Andrew Raycroft ( G ) , Aaron Rome ( D ) , Mikael Samuelsson ( F ) , Dave Scatchard ( F ) , Mathieu Schneider ( D ) . Goodbye : Jason LaBarbera ( G ) , Mattias Ohlund ( D ) , Taylor Pyatt ( F ) , Curtis Sanford ( G ) , Mats Sundin ( ? ) .
No. of Olympians : 8 ( Alex Edler , Ehrhoff , Ryan Kesler , Roberto Luongo , Mikael Samuelsson , Sami Salo , Daniel Sedin , Henrik Sedin ) .
What to like
Luongo should have plenty of motivation after saving the biggest stinker of his two - season playoff career in Game 6 against Chicago .
He has signed a contract that could keep him in Vancouver for the rest of his playing days , and has designs on the Canadian Olympic starting job in his NHL home .
The Sedins twins rarely take nights off , and Ryan Kesler and Alex Burrows became vital forwards last season .
It is expected that at least one of Kyle Wellwood and Steve Bernier — both put on a fitness regime in the off - season — will increase their offensive output .
The defence corps is deep , with a more diverse group of styles than in years past .
For all the talk of Luongo 's Game 6 troubles , less attention was paid to how the Blackhawks riddled the back end .
Egos should n't get in the way on the blue - line , either : there is only a difference in salary of $ 1 million US from first to sixth spot .
With the additions of Christian Ehrhoff , Mathieu Schneider ( currently injured ) and Mikael Samuelsson , the Canucks seem poised to improve on a power - play unit that was middle of the pack last year .
" We just felt that , with our defence , when [ Sami ]
Salo went down , we did n't have the depth that we wanted [ at the point ] , " said Henning .
What to sweat
The Buffalo Sabres and the Calgary Flames have paid the price in the last two seasons to different degrees for skimping on the backup goalie spot and overworking their No. 1 man .
The Canucks are courting similar trouble with Luongo in an Olympic year .
It 's unlikely to put them out of the playoffs , but it could cost precious points .
Andrew Raycroft had his worst season ( 2007 - 08 ) when he sat on the bench for weeks between starts , which is exactly what the Canucks will be asking him to do .
Even Curtis Sanford , who was jettisoned by the club , had better stats in the last two years than Raycroft .
" I think Raycroft looked at it like he's got something to prove and has been really strong in camp and he 's working hard with [ goalie consultant ] Ian Clark , " said Henning .
Henning said the team will have no problem calling on Cory Schneider if Raycroft falters , even though the current conventional wisdom is that a young goalie should n't spend most of his time riding the pine .
Another intangible is complacency .
Luongo and the Sedins signed big contracts .
Secure in the knowledge the three most important players are in tow , will the supporting cast ease up and not carry its collective weight ?
Henning said the bitter taste of last season 's elimination , along with the personalities of players like Kevin Bieksa , Kesler and Ryan Johnson will prevent any kind of psychological letdown .
Fresh Face : Christian Ehrhoff
It will be interesting to see how Ehrhoff responds in Vancouver after being able to progress in the shadows of Rob Blake and Dan Boyle in San Jose .
While Bieksa and Willie Mitchell loom large personality - wise , Ehrhoff will expected to be a primary offensive cog from the back end .
Like many of his Sharks teammates , the German had a terrific start last season and then tailed off down the stretch and into the playoffs .
Under pressure : Pavol Demitra
Gillis signed his former client to a two - year , $ 8 - million US deal and at best he met expectations last year .
He suffered a shoulder injury in the playoffs , but has never been a particular standout in the post - season .
He is now confronted with an early season injury for the second year in a row , and with young forwards like Sergei Shirokov , Mason Raymond and Cody Hodgson angling for key roles to start the season , he will need to pay some immediate dividends when he returns or perhaps find himself expendable .
Olympic impact
The Olympic players from the Canucks will be close to home , but there are nine candidates : Luongo , Kesler , the Sedins , Ehrhoff are locks , with Salo , Demitra , Samuelsson and Alex Edler somewhere between possible and probable .
More importantly , Vancouver hosting the 2010 Games and Paralympics means that GM Place will be unavailable for a long stretch .
The Canucks play eight on the road heading into the NHL's Olympic break , and six more in a row away from home when the league picks up its schedule .
That means an eight - game home stretch in December and a span of nine home games in the last 14 of the season are particularly important .
Outlook
We wo n't get fooled again .
Last September we said the margin of error was too thin for Vancouver due to their offensive depth issues .
We predicted Alain Vigneault could be the first coach of a Canadian team fired .
Close .
Luongo jumpstarted the team with five shutouts in his first 14 games , Kesler and Burrows each upped their point totals by 20 - plus , and Vancouver took the Northwest .
Vigneault remains , while four of the other five Canadian teams have changed coaches in the interim .
We doubt the Canucks used our dire assessment as motivational material , so we have no problem this time around pegging them as the division winner .
Until Calgary shows it can gel as a team , it 's the most sensible choice .
The Olympic effect is a bit worrisome , but offset by the fact that the other two divisions in the conference are arguably even more fiercely contested than the Northwest .
So we 'll go as far as putting Vancouver in the second or third conference slot heading into the playoffs .
According to news reports on chessdom , chessvibes and chessbase , the World Championship match between Anand and Topalov will take place in April 2010 in Sofia , Bulgaria .

The modern male , he ’s softer than a slug with a beer belly
It ’s official .
Modern man is a wimp .
A new book by an Australian anthropologist called Peter McAllister entitled Manthropology : The Science Of The Inadequate Modern Male has come to the conclusion that men are the worst they have ever been – the ‘ sorriest cohort of masculine Homo sapiens to ever walk the planet ’ .
According to a set of fossilised footprints , prehistoric Australian aboriginals would have left 100 m and 200 m Olympic champion Usain Bolt standing .
Some Tutsi men in Rwanda were able to jump higher than the current world record of 2.45 m , Roman legions completed one - and - a - half marathons a day ( bear in mind this was before Lycra and bottles of water with teats had been invented ) and Neanderthal women would have had ten per cent more muscle bulk than modern man .
Progress ?
Modern man has evolved into a blob , says Liz Jones ( file picture )
Of course , we do n’t need a hefty scientific tome to tell us something that any woman who has ever asked her mate to pass the remote control and been confronted with a pathetic mew that says , ‘ I can ’t , it ’s far too heavy , ’ has long suspected .
Modern man has evolved , due to his love of cars and fast food , into a blob with all the muscle tone and definition of a slug .
Is n’t it interesting that while we women look up to Amazonians with amazing biceps such as Michelle Obama , men have the presenters of Top Gear as their heroes – armchair Lotharios who do n’t even have the upper body strength to comb their own hair .
Look at Jamie Oliver , a body as soft as butter .
Gordon Brown has a body mass index that probably far exceeds his own Government guidelines .
Peter Mandelson ?
Man boobs .
Simon Cowell ?
Peacock chest and underdeveloped thighs .
I could go on .
And on .
These men might all wear trainers and tracksuits and workwear such as denim jeans and combat trousers , but it is all just dressing up , an illusion , a hark back to the days when men actually knew how to do physical things like , ooh , I do n’t know , put in a light bulb or change a duvet cover or make love to a woman .
Honestly , the number of times I have wanted to exclaim , while prone : ‘ For God ’s sake , put your back into it , man ! ’
Actually , these men are n’t like slugs at all .
They are like snails – soft , spongy , grey bodies inside the crisp shells of their automobiles .
In fact , unless the man in question is an Olympic athlete or a footballer , to ‘ sport ’ anything other than old - lady buttocks is to render him a possible homosexual , that sweet sub -species of maledom , the only ones on the planet who feel the need to stay in shape for a mate .
I wonder why it is that gay men like to stay in shape , and be all smooth and oiled .
I hope I am not straying into Dannii Minogue territory here when I wonder if that is merely their feminine side emerging , a genetic tendency to have the humility to take care of themselves , rather than being an arrogant straight bastard who believes , despite the beer gut and nasal hair , he is catnip .
Modern men , on the other hand , like us women to stay at least as fit ( and I employ that word for its original definition , not the new slang meaning ) as Kelly Holmes .
There was an interesting blog posted on the internet last week in response to a debate that has been raging in the ether over a Time magazine special issue investigating whether being fat is down to genetics or to sheer greed .
( Men like the ether – it means they can sit at a desk with a nice mug of tea and a biscuit . )
This man was writing in response to a feminist who was championing the right for women to get off the dieting treadmill : ‘ My fear that a woman with the legal power to take half of my possessions might some day become so fat and sexually unappealing that I ’d sooner cut my own penis off than have sex with the manatee that used to be my wife is unfortunately all too common , ’ he types with one finger ( men have not yet evolved sufficiently to be able to touch - type ) .
‘ And [ articles ] like this one that dangerously suggest to naive future fatties that it ’s OK are only leading your victims down the primrose path to a battle they ca n’t win . ’
You see ?
Women are now the strong ones in our society .
Men no longer chase wildebeest across the pampas , and therefore have become hopelessly soft .
This deterioration has happened merely since two great leaps forward : the industrial revolution and the advent of free internet porn , which has created the unrealistic expectation that the ugliest slob in the world can bag a babe .
What poor , sad creatures modern men are .
What wimps .
What wastes of space .
They were older than most when they learned to yelp .
Most people , of most generations , in most of the world 's nations , learn to yelp at a young age .
Some are born yelping , others learn it when they learn their mother tongue .
Yelping , as they say , comes with the territory .
But these people , the ones we 're talking about - born in the United States at a certain time - they had not learned to yelp .
To yelp : open your mouth .
Convulse your stomach , as you would before a belch , or before vomiting .
Now form a word , a thousand words , but emit none .
In place of the words you might attempt , make a sound .
The sound is a combination of three sounds .
Each of these represents a third of your yelp .
First : there is the shrieking sound you might make if you hit your head on the bottom edge of an open kitchen cabinet door .
It is sudden , high - pitched , angry .
It speaks of the stupidity of pain .
Second : there is a whining aspect .
Imagine that you have not slept for many days , and after those many days , you are told to run over that hill yonder and back .
When you return , you are punched in the sternum .
You ask for mercy .
They laugh and kill your dog .
This is exhaustion .
Third : the last factor in your yelp is the moan .
The moan is shock in the face of a landslide .
Brutality .
A flood .
Machetes .
This portion of your yelp says that you did not think you could be surprised or overwhelmed , but you have been proven wrong .
The yelp is efficient .
The words , questions and statements that are encompassed in one quick yelp :
How could you ?
How could you ?
I wo n't believe it .
Stop it now .
Please stop it now .
Oh God. Oh God .
That poor man .
Those poor women .
Look at her arms .
Look at his face .
Those bastards .
This is not how it should be .
Goddamn all this .
I give up .
No , I will fight .
No , I will give up .
No , I will fight .
But for Americans of a certain age , there had until recently been no yelping .
There were many of these words said , and emotions felt , and questions asked , but never had they been concentrated enough - for there must be an overwhelming onslaught of stimuli , gradual and topped off suddenly - to become a yelp .
Their parents had yelped , most of them , and certainly their grandparents .
But they had not , which made them at once stronger and less strong .
There had been some hope that these people would never know the sound we 're talking about .
But now they and millions of others , Americans of a certain age , have followed the path of their parents and grandparents and billions of others before them .
They have learned how to yelp .
They cannot forget what it felt like - it burns , it burns - but now they can try to help those who have not yet yelped to live a yelping - free life .
This is what we want .
This is all that we can do .

consegna di 47 chalet a 200 dei trentamila sfollati

Giuseppe Zamberletti
premiata ditta B&B
appena 60 giorni dopo il terremoto
l ’Italia era ancora una democrazia
( Vignetta di Franzaroli )
L'approfondimento dalla rassegna stampa a cura di Ines Tabusso
Il miglior presidente del Consiglio che l’Italia abbia mai avuto negli ultimi 150 anni va ripetendo in giro che laper il terremoto d’Abruzzo dopo appena 162 giorni rappresenta “ il cantiere più grande del mondo ” , nonché l’opera di ricostruzione più rapida e imponente della storia dell ’umanità .
Anche meglio della muraglia cinese e della piramide di Cheope .
Non parliamo poi della bonifica delle paludi pontine e della battaglia del grano , che gli fanno un baffo .
A tenergli bordone c’è l’eccellentissimo , il gran ciambellano della Protezione civile nonché “ uomo della Provvidenza ” che tutto il mondo ci invidia perché senza di lui non sapremmo proprio come fare : anche lui si loda e si imbroda a proposito della ricostruzione più rapida e imponente eccetera .
La stampa al seguito registra e rilancia .
Peccato che non sia più in vita , che dopo il terribile sisma del 1980 in Campania e Basilicata , raccolse tra i lettori del suo Giornale ( quello vero , non la tetra parodia oggi in edicola ) un bel po ’ di quattrini e consegnò ai terremotati di Castelnuovo di Conza un intero villaggio di nuove case , il “ ” , inaugurato insieme all ’allora presidente della Repubblica Sandro Pertini 170 giorni dopo il sisma .
Cioè soli 8 giorni dopo l’attuale ricostruzione più imponente e più rapida eccetera .
Ma ci fu anche chi arrivò molto prima : lo staff di , democristiano lombardo concreto ed efficiente , che senza essere sottosegretario a nulla , ma in veste di commissario straordinario di governo , mise a frutto l’esperienza maturata nel 1976 in Friuli e riuscì a consegnare 150 chalet ( identici ai 45 inaugurati ieri dal premier , anche se a pagarli è stata la provincia autonoma di Trento , governata da Lorenzo Dellai , centrosinistra ) alla popolazione di Ariano Irpino , che aveva appena pianto 300 morti , riuscendo a seppellirli solo tre settimane dopo .
Quando avvenne la consegna ?
Qualcuno , sentita la , nel senso di Berlusconi & Bertolaso , dirà : sicuramente non prima di 170 giorni , altrimenti gli annunci del presidente del Consiglio e del capo della Protezione civile sarebbero nient ’altro che balle .
E i giornali che le registrano senza batter ciglio sarebbero nient ’altro che uffici stampa .
Bene , tenetevi forte : Zamberletti consegnò ad Ariano i primi prefabbricatie le 150 casette con giardino dopo soli 122 giorni , dando un tetto permanente a 450 persone : la metà dei superstiti .
Cioè impiegò ben 40 giorni in meno della ricostruzione più imponente e rapida eccetera , per fare il triplo del migliore presidente del Consiglio degli ultimi 150 e del capo della Protezione civile che tutto il mondo ci invidia .
Con tre lievissime differenze , fra il 1980 e oggi .
Primo : il terremoto in Campania e Lucania si estese per quasi due regioni intere , fece 3 mila morti ( 10 volte quelli d’Abruzzo ) , 9 mila feriti e 300 mila sfollati .
Secondo : all ’epoca la Protezione civile non esisteva : i soccorsi erano coordinati dalla radio della Rai , con le telefonate in diretta degli amministratori e dei cittadini .
Terzo : scalcinata fin che si vuole , .
E anche il politico più infame avrebbe esitato un po ’ , prima di pavoneggiarsi a favore di telecamera su un red carpet di cadaveri .
The mystery of the Punjabi girl in Imtiaz Ali ’s Love Aaj Kal , who gets royally wooed and won by the sardar Saif Ali Khan , has been solved – she is a Brazilian model Giselle Monteiro who could n’t speak Hindi or dance to save her life .
“ She is actually a Brazilian girl named Giselle Monteiro .
Why a Brazilian girl to play an old - fashioned Punjabi girl ?
Well , I was auditioning girls from all over the Country to play the Punjabi girl opposite the Sikh Saif .
I could n’t find the right girl to play the 1965 ki ‘ gali mein rehne wali ladki , purane zamane ki , Ali told IANS .
Giselle had walked into Ali ’s office to play another part .
“ Giselle came to me through dress Designer Anaita Shroff .
She was to play Jo , Saif ’s Caucasian girlfriend in the second half .
She was n’t right for Jo .
“ But my wife , who was there , suggested Giselle for Harleen .
I turned and looked at Giselle and realised she is Brazil ’s Harleen .
She did n’t know how to speak Hindi .
But she had only two lines to speak , which we dubbed , ” said the director who has got mixed reviews for the film .
“ She has been travelling all alone from all over the world from the age of 17 .
She ’s 19 now .
Saif kept grumbling he ’d look too old with Giselle .
But he pulled it off completely , ” he added .
Giselle understood the old - world values of her small town character .
“ The small - town mentality in every part of the world is similar , ” said Ali .
But when the sequence showing her dancing at her engagement was shot , she drove the entire unit up the wall because she could n’t get the steps right .
“ We wanted to put her through the paces with Sarojji ( Choreographer Saroj Khan ) , but it never happened .
Sarojji did n’t have the time .
For a foreigner to get the Indian ‘ adaa ’ right is very tough .
“ We take for granted those nakhra - jhatka - matka , which we ’ve seen our sisters perform at weddings .
Indian girls have those ‘ adaas ’ without being trained .
But for a foreigner it is tough , ” said Ali .
Throughout the making of Love Aaj Kal , Giselle was referred to by her screen name Harleen .
Even when she became visible in the trailers , she remained inaccessible to the public .
Bollywood is showing a lot of interest in Giselle .
good science meets terrible journalism
When reporters already know what story they 're going to write , your research becomes nothing more than bastardized fodder .
A few days ago that paragon of breaking science news ( not really ) , the Daily Mail , reported that psychologist Bruce Hood ’s research found that humans are wired to believe in deities and hold religious beliefs .
And not only that , but that his studies counter Richard Dawkins ’ conclusions that religion is a cultural phenomena that relies heavily on indoctrination from childhood and biases in our education .
But after the article started going around the web , lost in the noise of religious pundits patting themselves and each other on the back for their wise beliefs beating scientists to the punch by centuries , was the voice of Dr. Hood himself .
It seems that the articles in the Mail , The Sunday Times and The Daily Telegraph about his research were , well … wrong .
On his blog , Hood very clearly shows that the reporters who talked to him were interested in pushing a certain kind of story and technical details like the actual findings , what they meant and how they could be applied just got in the way .
The journalists and editors wanted a line about definitive proof that humans are wired to have a religion to stir up controversy and so they cherry - picked scientific work about our predispositions to believe religious doctrines and how they might have evolved to come up with a fluff piece espousing the same “ but it ’s natural to believe in God ” defense priests have been using for decades .
In reality , humans are predisposed to accept the ideas of supernatural entities as causal agents of the universe but their actual beliefs depend on a particular indoctrination .
According to Hood , religion as we know it today is indeed a cultural phenomena .
I talked about the early emergence of mind body dualism and how it relates to the notion of an after - life and my particular research interest , psychological essentialism .
I said that I thought many supernatural beliefs had a natural origin in the way children reason about the world and that while story - telling was one way of transmitting beliefs , in many instances [ the ] cultural stories reflected notions that were intuitively plausible to children .
In fact , I categorically said that religions were cultural constructs as Richard Dawkins had proposed .
Where I differ from Dawkins ( and again this is very clear in the book ) is the likelihood of removing supernatural beliefs through education but this is an empirical question that is not yet resolved .
So if the reporters were actually responsible science writers , what they would ’ve said is that we ’re suggestible to religious indoctrination as part of our evolutionary lineage .
As social animals , we need order and structure in society and organized religions can provide it , which is why one of the reasons religions stayed around as human civilization built from villages into city states and eventually nations and empires .
If you want to claim that a belief in your religion is somehow natural , there ’s not a shred of scientific evidence for your assertions because being a Christian , a Muslim , a Jew or a Wiccan is a matter of choice or indoctrination , not something with which humans are innately born , just something they could be taught to believe .
Hood ’s research simply tries to shed light on the psychological dynamics of how faith in the supernatural propagates .
This case is a clear illustration of why we need competent science writers reporting on science , not just hacks after a false controversy and with absolutely no regard for the facts involved .
If anything , their coverage was a gross misrepresentation of scientific work for the sake of selling copies and generating page views .
We keep wondering why people seem to be in the dark about so many scientific developments and this focus of using an edgy research topic as mangled fodder for culture war debates is one of the reasons .
If you think anybody will put a stop to this , you ’re sadly mistaken because for many media outlets today , accuracy and legitimacy of their reporting comes as a distant third to popularity and ad sales .
Can teachers really predict behaviour from a name ?
Teachers think they can tell which pupils are likely to play up by looking at their names , a survey suggests .
The poll of 3,000 teachers found more than one in three expected pupils with certain names to be more disruptive .
Pupils called Callum , Connor , Jack , Chelsea , Courtney and Chardonnay were among some of the ones to watch .
The online survey by parenting club Bounty.com found 49 % of UK teachers made assumptions about a child when they first looked down the register .
But it is not all bad news , with 57 % of the teachers surveyed saying the naughtier children tended to be more popular than their better behaved peers .
More than a third said the naughtiest pupils were often the brightest and the more sensitive .
Naughty list Many teachers ( 69 % ) said they had difficulty pronouncing some of the more obscure names chosen by parents .
NAUGHTIEST NAMES Callum Connor Jack Daniel Brandon Charlie Chelsea Courtney Chardonnay Aleisha Casey Crystal
Send us your comments
And 71 % of teachers admitted to have a private chuckle over some of the more unusual names .
The survey also asked teachers what the brightest children tended to be called , with Alexander , Adam , Christopher , Benjamin , Edward , Elizabeth , Charlotte , Emma , Hannah and Rebecca coming in as the brainiest names .
Names of the most popular children in the class included Jack , Daniel , Charlie , Callum , Emma , Charlotte , Hannah and Anna .
Faye Mingo from Bounty.com said : " Teachers are only human and make assumptions like the rest of us .
" Rightly or wrongly , most of us make assumptions based on something as simple as a person 's name and we base these on our previous experiences .
" It 's only natural for teachers to make judgments based on the behaviour and performance of former pupils with the same name , but I 'm sure that they are happy for to be proved wrong . "

Fragment from world ’s oldest Bible found hidden in Egyptian monastery
By Jerome Taylor , The Independent , A British - based academic has uncovered a fragment of the world ’s oldest Bible hiding underneath the binding of an 18th - century book .
Nikolas Sarris spotted a previously unseen section of the Codex Sinaiticus , which dates from about AD350 , as he was trawling through photographs of manuscripts in the library of St Catherine ’s Monastery in Egypt .
The Codex , handwritten in Greek on animal skin , is the earliest known version of the Bible .
Leaves from the priceless tome are divided between four institutions , including St Catherine ’s Monastery and the British Library , which has held the largest section of the ancient Bible since the Soviet Union sold its collection to Britain in 1933 .
Academics from Britain , America , Egypt and Russia collaborated to put the entire Codex online this year but new fragments of the book are occasionally rediscovered .

Victoria 's Twelve Apostles now number just seven after another of the rock formations tumbled into the sea off Victoria 's west coast on Friday .
A tour operator contacted Parks Victoria early on Friday and reported the small stack had disappeared .
Parks Victoria spokeswoman Jo Curkpatrick later confirmed the collapse .
" It 's a small stack just out from the ... Razorback Lookout , " she said .
" We have had some fairly stormy weather but it 's sort of natural that the stone wears away . "
The lookout is located near Loch Ard Gorge and Port Campbell .
Friday 's collapse follows the crumbling of another rock formation , the Island Archway , which fell into the sea on June 11 .
" Certainly the coast has taken a bit of a beating this winter , " Ms Curkpatrick said .
Although another stack had disappeared , she said the formations would still retain their name .
" It will always be the Twelve Apostles , " Ms Curkpatrick said .
" It remains unique no matter how many apostles come and go . "
The last time one of the Twelve Apostles collapsed was in July 2005 .
In 1990 two tourists were stranded on the outer part of London Bridge - another limestone formation off the Great Ocean Road - after one of its two arches collapsed .
No -one was injured , and the tourists were rescued by helicopter .
The apostles started to form up to 20 million years ago as erosion gradually attacked the limestone cliffs of Port Campbell .

Advertisement Iran 's legislative body , the Guardian Council , has said there were no major polling irregularities in the 12 June election and ruled out an annulment .
Opposition supporters called for the vote to be set aside and the elections re-run amid claims of vote tampering .
Iran has also condemned UN chief Ban Ki-moon for " meddling " in its affairs .
It comes after Mr Ban urged the authorities to respect fundamental civil rights " especially the freedom of assembly and expression " .
Guardian Council spokesman Abbas Ali Kadkhoda 'i said there was " no major fraud or breach in the election " .
Meanwhile , opposition candidate Mehdi Karoubi urged Iranians to mourn for dead protesters on Thursday .
Mourning Mr Karoubi , who is among those asking for the election to be set aside , wants mourning ceremonies to be held around the country , his aide Issa Saharkhiz said .
His call echoed an earlier one from cleric Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri , who has called for three days of national mourning for those killed in the street protests .
The secretary general reiterates his hope that the democratic will of the people of Iran will be fully respected
Spokesman for Ban Ki-moon
Where did votes come from ?
English - language Press TV reported the Guardian Council 's rejection of an annulment on Tuesday .
On Monday , it had conceded there had been voting irregularities in 50 districts , including local vote counts that exceeded the number of eligible voters .
But it said they were not enough to affect the overall result and incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had indeed won by a landslide .
The council 's spokesman said most of the irregularities happened before the election , not during or after voting .
In a letter to the council , Mr Karoubi said : " Instead of wasting time on recounting some ballot boxes ... cancel the vote . "
On Monday 1,000 people gathered in Haft-e Tir Square in the capital Tehran despite a warning from Iran 's Revolutionary Guards , an elite armed force , against holding unapproved rallies against the election results .
Iranian riot police in Tehran observe as 1,000 attend rally Basij militiamen wielding clubs were brought in to reinforce the police .
The protests in the last 24 hours are smaller than they have been over the past 10 days , amid the strong security presence on the streets .
BBC Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen said the protesters are talking about finding other ways to show their opposition , including strikes or civil disobedience .
' Beginnings of change ' A spokesman for the US government said it " would not endorse " general strikes .
But he added : " We 've seen the beginnings of change in Iran . " British Prime Minister Gordon Brown told the BBC : " We want a very good relationship with the Iranians , we also respect the fact that it's for the Iranian people themselves to choose who their government is .
" But when there is a sign of repression or where there is violence that 's affecting ordinary people in the streets , we have a duty to speak out and to say we want Iran to be part of the world , we do n't want Iran to be isolated from the world . "
On Friday Ayatollah Ali Khamenei banned protests , prompting street violence in which at least 10 people died .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has called for an end to the street violence , and threats of violence .
Have Your Say People are tired of being hopeless and have nothing to lose so they are very strong IS , Tehran Mr Ban urged the authorities in Iran to respect fundamental civil rights , " especially the freedom of assembly and expression " , and end arrests .
A spokesman for Mr Ban said he had been following the situation in Iran with " growing concern " and was dismayed by the use of force against civilians .
Call for dialogue
He called on Iran 's government and opposition to resolve their differences peacefully through dialogue and legal means .
Ban Ki-moon has damaged his credibility in the eyes of independent countries
Iranian foreign ministry spokesman " He urges an immediate stop to the arrests , threats and use of force .
The secretary general reiterates his hope that the democratic will of the people of Iran will be fully respected , " a statement read .
But Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Hassan Ghashghavi said : " These stances are an evident contradiction of the UN secretary general 's duties , international law and are an apparent meddling in Iran 's internal affairs .
" Ban Ki-moon has damaged his credibility in the eyes of independent countries by ignorantly following some domineering powers which have a long record of uncalled - for interference in other countries ' internal affairs and colonisation . "
A pro-government rally proposed by students to be held outside the British Embassy has been called off after they were denied a permit .
Reporting restrictions
Severe reporting restrictions placed on the BBC and other foreign media in Iran mean protest reports cannot be verified independently .
Election results show Mr Ahmadinejad won the 12 June election by a landslide , taking 63 % of the vote , almost double that of Mir Hossein Mousavi , his nearest rival .
An independent British analysis of the disputed election results has found irregularities in the reported turnout , as well as " implausible " swings in the vote in favour of Mr Ahmadinejad .
Analysts from St Andrew's University and the Chatham House think - tank said votes in favour of Mr Ahmadinejad in a third of the provinces would have required an " unlikely scenario " of voting patterns .

The long - awaited Capcom Platinum Hits Triple Pack is available today .
A measly $ 39.99 scores you 3 of this generations greatest games , including Shawn ’s favorite Lost Planet Colonies Edition , Devil May Cry 4 , and my favorite , the all - around awesome Dead Rising .
$ 39.99 is like $ 13 a game–so cheap that I ’m actually buying these as gifts to give to ignorant friends 🙂
Pick yours up here now .
Friday 's announcement of an additional 600 affordable housing units to B.C. 's stock has people once again addressing the costs of homelessness in the province .
There are thousands of homeless living in B.C. 's Lower Mainland , caught in the cycle because of mental illness and addiction .
But this existence is expensive .
" In the back of our minds we know that it costs us but until you actually do the math , you do n't have a real understanding of what it costs , " says Lesley Tannen of the Downtown Surrey Business Improvement Association .
For the first time , we 're getting a look at how much homeless people actually costs various levels of government .
The association compiled data on one homeless person over a year .
The organization would not reveal who that person is , but CTV News has learned that it is Sue , a woman who has spent the last 13 years living on the streets of Surrey .
" It was horrible , just horrible , " she says .
" Everything 's been horrible . "
Sue says every night she spent on the street she was afraid .
" I 'd stay awake and walk and walk .
Walk .
Keep walking . "
You might be shocked at what Sue -- one single homeless person -- can cost taxpayers .
In 2007 , Sue spent 63 days in hospital and 196 days in shelter .
Police were called to deal with her more than 340 times , mostly because of mental illness issues .
She was also on probation , spent time in a pre-trial centre and received income assistance .
That brings the grand total for one year for Sue to a staggering $ 171,000 .
According to the province , the average costs of services for a person living on the streets is around $ 56,000 .
" That 's a huge cost to the community of doing nothing , " says Tannen .
In six years , someone like Sue would cost the system more than a million dollars .
The Surrey Business Association believes by putting someone like Sue in stable housing with a support worker could drop the cost to $ 17,000 -- a 90 per cent decrease .
" From a business perspective , that 's a no- brainer , " says Peter Fedos , an advocate working for Highland House .
" Doing something makes economic sense . "
Fedos says social housing is always more cost effective than doing nothing .
" There are costs .
Leaving them on the streets means you 'll pay later and you 'll pay heavily . "
For now , Sue is now in supportive housing .
She might not recognize the financial benefit , but she knows that it 's a safe place .
With a report from CTV British Columbia 's Michele Brunoro
When Andrew unexpectedly shows up on Ben 's doorstep late one night , the two old college friends immediately fall into their old dynamic of heterosexual one - upmanship .
To save Ben from domestication , Andrew invites Ben to a party at a sex - positive commune .
Everyone there plans on making erotic art films for the local amateur porn festival and Andrew wants in .
They run out of booze and ideas , save for one : Andrew should have sex with Ben , on camera .
It 's not gay ; it 's beyond gay .
It 's not porn ; it 's an art project .
The next day , they find themselves unable to back down from the dare .
And there 's nothing standing in their way - except Ben 's wife Anna , heterosexuality , and certain mechanical questions .

Florida is looking to build a high speed train line connecting Tampa , Orlando , and Miami .
The project is in the early stages of development , but the estimated cost is $ 11 billion .
The state is hoping to receive $ 2.53 billion in stimulus cash for the trains .
This is n't the first time Florida tried to build high speed trains .
About 10 years ago , the state considered it , but then Governor Jeb Bush shot the plan down .
The current Governor Charlie Crist is supportive of the plan .
Tampa to Orlando would be built first from 2011 to 2014 , then Orlando to Miami between 2014 and 2017 .
Here 's more details from the Miami Herald :
The report says the Tampa - Orlando segment would cost about $ 3.5 billion -- including '' infrastructure , rolling stock and right - of - way . ''
The Orlando - Miami segment would cost more than $ 8 billion , according to the document .
If Florida receives the money , the state would look to leverage it into a partnership with a company or group that would assume the cost of operation and maintenance .
For the Tampa - Orlando segment , Florida proposes to build tracks along the median of Interstate 4 , with five stations from downtown Tampa to Orlando International Airport .
According to a map on a state transportation agency website , www.dot.state.fl.us/planning/economicstimulus/, the Miami segment would go from Orlando east to Florida 's Atlantic Coast , turn south between Titusville and Merritt Island , and run alongside Interstate 95 to Miami .
The line would end at the Miami Intermodal Center -- a massive transit and car-rental hub under construction just east of Miami International Airport .
The plan is not binding and is subject to change .
Applications are due beginning in late August , and the federal government expects to begin awarding funds between early fall and December .

FURTHER BLURRING THE LINES ….
I continue to be fascinated by the shrinking differences between the nutty , right - wing fringe and the Republican establishment .
Lee Fang flagged this gem yesterday .
Last Friday , Rep. Louie Gohmert ( R - TX ) joined radical conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on his radio talk show for an interview .
Jones has made a name for himself propagating conspiracies ranging from the claim that Bill Clinton planned the Oklahoma City bombings to the idea that the attacks on 9/11 were orchestrated by a cabal of American and Israeli government officials .
During the 30 - minute interview about “ nation ending stuff , ” Gohmert used his opportunity on the Jones show to showcase his own odd anti-Obama conspiracy theories .
Gohmert was on quite a roll , insisting that health care reform will “ absolutely kill senior citizens , ” because the government will put older Americans on a list and then “ force them to die early . ”
He added that the government will also control what Americans eat and where we can live .
When Jones , compared current events to Hitler and Mao , the Republican Texan replied , “ Well that ’s exactly what I was thinking of .
This is the kind of the thing we got to stop . ”
Gohmert went on to praise the fringe talk - show host for being “ on top of things . ”
Now , I do n’t much care what these obviously unhinged conservatives have to say .
What ’s fascinating to me , though , is the fact that there was no real difference between them .
Generally , politicians try to keep radicals and fringe activists at arm ’s length .
If a politician runs into a nut in public , he / she tries to avoid making eye contact , and scurries away as quickly as possible .
But here ’s an elected member of Congress , voluntarily appearing on a notorious extremist ’s radio show , as if this were a normal thing to do .
They two swapped insane conspiracy theories casually , as if radical nonsense were as commonplace as discussing the weather .
The line , in other words , between the member of Congress and the fanatic simply did n’t exist .
What ’s more , because right - wing extremism has become mainstream in conservative circles , there are no consequences for Gohmert ’s rhetoric or appearance .
It ’s just what GOP officials do in the early part of the 21st century .
Lawmakers , right - wing shock - jocks , Fox News personalities , conservative bloggers , major publications on the right — they ’re all largely on the same page , without a sense of shame or limits , and they ’re all spouting transparent nonsense .

A Vernacular Web
The Indigenous and The Barbarians
I 'll start with a statement like this , not to show off my contribution , but in order to stress that -- although I consider myself to be an early adopter -- I came late enough to enjoy and prosper from the " benefits of civilization " .
There was a pre-existing environment ; a structural , visual and acoustic culture you could play around with , a culture you could break .
There was a world of options and one of the options was to be different .
So what was this culture ?
What do we mean by the web of the mid 90's and when did it end ?
To be blunt it was bright , rich , personal , slow and under construction .
It was a web of sudden connections and personal links .
Pages were built on the edge of tomorrow , full of hope for a faster connection and a more powerful computer .
One could say it was the web of the indigenous ... or the barbarians .
In any case , it was a web of amateurs soon to be washed away by dot.com ambitions , professional authoring tools and guidelines designed by usability experts .
I wrote that change was coming " soon " instead of putting an end date at 1998 , for example , because there was no sickness , death or burial .
The amateur web did n't die and it has not disappeared but it is hidden .
Search engine rating mechanisms rank the old amateur pages so low they 're almost invisible and institutions do n't collect or promote them with the same passion as they pursue net art or web design .
Also new amateur pages do n't appear at such amounts as ten years ago because the WWW of today is a developed and highly regulated space .
You would n't get on the web just to tell the world , " Welcome to my home page . "
The web has diversified , the conditions have changed and there 's no need for this sort of old fashioned behavior .
Your CV is posted on the company website or on a job search portal .
Your diary will be organized on a blog and your vacation photos are published on iphoto .
There 's a community for every hobby and question .
This is why I refer to the amateur web as a thing of the past ; aesthetically a very powerful past .
Even people who were n't online in the last century , people who look no further than the first 10 search engine results can see the signs and symbols of the early web thanks to the numerous parodies and collections organized by usability experts who use the early elements and styles as negative examples .
Just as clothing styles come back into fashion so do web designs .
On a visual level things reappear .
Last year I noticed that progressive web designers returned to an eclectic style reincorporating wallpapers and 3D lettering in their work .
In the near future frames and construction signs will show up as retro and the beautiful old elements will be stripped of their meaning and contexts .
In the past few years I 've also been making work that foregrounds this disappearing aesthetic of the past .
With these works I want to apologize for my arrogance in the early years and to preserve the beauty of the vernacular web by integrating them within contemporary art pieces .
But this is only half of the job .
Creating collections and archives of all the midi files and animated gifs will preserve them for the future but it is no less important to ask questions .
What did these visual , acoustic and navigation elements stand for ?
For which cultures and media did these serve as a bridge to the web ?
What ambitions were they serving ?
What problems did they solve and what problems did they create ?
Let me talk about the difficult destiny of some of these elements .
WASHINGTON , Aug. 16 , 2009 --
The first dry powder inhalable vaccine for measles is moving toward clinical trials next year in India , where the disease still sickens millions of infants and children and kills almost 200,000 annually , according to a report presented here today at the 238th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society ( ACS ) .
Robert Sievers , Ph.D. , who leads the team that developed the dry - powder vaccine , said it 's a perfect fit for use in back - roads areas of developing countries .
Those areas often lack the electricity for refrigeration , clean water and sterile needles needed to administer traditional liquid vaccines .
" Childhood vaccines that can be inhaled and delivered directly to mucosal surfaces have the potential to offer significant advantages over injection , " Sievers said .
" Not only might they reduce the risk of infection from HIV , hepatitis , and other serious diseases due to unsterilized needles , they may prove more effective against disease . "
" Many serious infections , such as the measles virus , can enter the body through inhalation .
Measles vaccine dry powders have the potential to effectively vaccinate infants , children and adults by inhalation , avoiding the problems associated with liquid vaccines delivered by injection , " he added .
Although made for developing countries , the technology eventually could become the basis for a new generation of inhalable -- and ouchless vaccines -- in the United States and elsewhere .
So far , an inhalable vaccine is available for only one disease .
It is a wet mist vaccine for influenza .
Sievers , once an atmospheric scientist and who now is with Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and Center for Pharmaceutical Biotechnology , University of Colorado , Boulder , took inspiration for the new vaccine from research on how people inhale tiny airborne droplets of air pollutants .
To create an inhalable vaccine , Sievers and his team of students and researchers developed a patented process known as the " Carbon Dioxide - Assisted Nebulization with a Bubble Dryer , " called CAN - BD .
The weakened measles virus is mixed with " supercritical " carbon dioxide -- part gas , part liquid -- to produce microscopic bubbles and droplets , which then are dried to make an inhalable powder .
The powder is puffed into a small , cylindrical , plastic sack , with an opening like the neck of a plastic water bottle , and administered .
" By taking one deep breath from the sack , a child could be effectively vaccinated , " Sievers said .
In animal tests , the inhaler has been just as effective in delivering measles vaccine as the traditional injection , the researchers say .
They now are working on an inexpensive dry powder inhaler that would deliver measles or influenza vaccines to developing nations and could be used elsewhere .
In replacing injections , the new method also would help reach those who refuse inoculations because of their fear of needles .
The researchers say that the vaccine could be produced for about 26 cents a dose .
If the inhaler passes final safety and effectiveness tests , the Serum Institute of India Ltd. expects a demand growing to 400 million doses of measles vaccine a year , according to Sievers .
" Human clinical trials are expected to begin next year in India , after animal safety studies are completed this year , " Sievers said .
" About two - thirds of the world 's deaths due to measles occur in that nation .
Worldwide , several hundred people die every day from measles - related disease , " he added .
In earlier research in the 1980s in Mexico during a measles outbreak , 3 million children received a measles vaccine by inhaling a wet mist aerosol and those who took part in the test had a lower rate of developing measles than those who received a vaccine by injection , according to Sievers .
" The problem with that method , " he said , " was that the wet mists required power or batteries to generate the aerosol and the liquid vaccines had to be freshly made up and kept on ice and the nebulizer that delivers the dose had to be cleaned .
The new , inexpensive dry aerosol dispenser does n't need to be cleaned and does n't require power , " he said .

The federal government is considering taking humpback whales off the endangered species list in response to data showing the animal 's population has been steadily growing in recent decades .

( AP ) --
The federal government is considering taking the humpback whale off the endangered species list in response to data showing the population of the massive marine mammal has been steadily growing in recent decades .
Known for their acrobatic leaps from the sea and complex singing patterns , humpback whales were nearly hunted to extinction for their oil and meat by industrial - sized whaling ships well through the middle of the 20th century .
But the species has been bouncing back since an international ban on their commercial whaling in 1966 .
" Humpbacks by and large are an example of a species that in most places seems to be doing very well , despite our earlier efforts to exterminate them , " said Phillip Clapham , a senior whale biologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) .
The government is required by law to review the endangered species status of an animal or plant if it receives " significant new information . "
The National Marine Fisheries Service , a NOAA agency , received results last year from an extensive study showing that the North Pacific humpback population has been growing 4 to 7 percent a year in recent decades .
Public comment is being accepted until Oct. 13 on the upcoming review , which is expected to take less than a year .
It 's the first review for humpbacks since 1999 .
A panel of scientists will then study the data and produce a scientific report on their analysis in late spring or early summer .
It 's unclear what the decision on delisting the humback will be .
" I do n't know where the humpback people are going to come out , " said David Cottingham , who heads the marine mammal and sea turtle conservation division at the Fisheries Service .
" It would be premature to talk about it . "
Some environmental groups are already opposing the possibility of a delisting .
Miyoko Sakashita , the ocean programs director at the Center for Biological Diversity , said that ongoing climate change and ocean acidification are emerging threats that may hurt humpback whales .
" Ocean conditions are changing so rapidly right now that it would probably be hasty to delist the humpbacks , " Sakashita said .
Ralph Reeves , who chairs the cetacean specialist group at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature , said the U.S. should remove humpbacks from the list if populations have sufficiently recovered .
He said conservationists must " be prepared and willing to embrace success " if they 're to maintain what he called a " meaningful " endangered species program .
" The whole process , the credibility of it , depends on telling people that things are really bad when they 're really bad and tell people that they are n't so bad when they are n't so bad , " Reeves said .
There are now an estimated 18,000 to 20,000 humpbacks in the North Pacific , up from just 1,400 in the mid-1960s .
An early 1990s survey of humpbacks in the North Atlantic showed the population there was some 10,600 .
The results of a follow - up to that study , expected by the end of the year , are likely to show this population has grown , too .
The global humpback population is estimated to be about 60,000 , according to the Swiss - based Conservation of Nature union .
Helping the humpbacks is that they reproduce once every two to three years , as opposed to every three to five years for other whale species .
They also have a diverse diet , including krill and herring , capelin and other fish .
" They feed on a lot of different kinds of things , so they 're adaptable , " Clapham said .
" They seem to be a resilient species generally with a lot of options . "
There are some subpopulations of humpbacks , however , that are n't as robust .
A South Pacific group that feeds in the Antarctic and then migrates to the warm waters off New Caledonia , Samoa and Tonga to breed and calve is n't doing as well .
Whale experts say this is because commercial whaling , and later , illegal whaling by the Soviet Union , shrunk this population so dramatically that it's had a harder time recovering .
There are also humpback populations about which relatively little is known .
These include humpbacks that spend the winter in waters off southern Japan and the Philippines and the summer near Russia 's Far East coast .
This group also appears to be relatively small , with only about 1,000 whales .
There is a chance the review could lead to the removal of healthier subpopulations from the endangered species list while other groups that are still at risk could be left on .
Something similar happened in 1994 when the federal government removed a U.S. West Coast population of the gray whale from the endangered species list but left on the list a separate population of gray whale that lives off Russia 's Pacific coast .
The U.S. does n't have authority over species management in the waters of other nations , but it may prosecute U.S. citizens and corporations that violate U.S. endangered species law overseas .

Millie Louise Jones 's mother Sian Jones was asleep and her father Barry Owen was outside when she got in the bath at her home in Shotton , Flintshire .
The bath had water in after being run the night before and she drowned .
The coroner heard the family were investigated by police and social services but no charges were brought .
The inquest heard it was not uncommon for Ms Jones to run a bath the night before , then top it up with hot water when needed .
One morning last October , Mr Owen left the house to collect some tools from his shed , leaving Millie inside the house with her sleeping mother .
In a police statement he said : " I left Millie feeding herself with a bottle in the lounge and my partner was half asleep on the sofa . "
The inquest was told that he then heard his partner shout from the back door : " I hope you 've got Millie . "
Hospital
The pair then searched the house and the child was discovered in the bath water .
Mr Owen tried to resuscitate Millie but she later died at Liverpool 's Alder Hey Hospital , the inquest heard .
A pathologist said she died of major organ failure as the result of immersion .
The inquest heard that the parents were investigated by North Wales Police and social services .
A quantity of ecstasy and amphetamines " of various sorts " was found in the house but no charges were brought .
Ms Jones had a history of depression , according to evidence from her GP , but her children " always appeared well cared for and she always spoke to them in the appropriate manner " .
I as a father empathise with you in your loss , totally
Coroner , John Hughes
At one point during the inquest she appeared upset and told the coroner : " I do n't think it 's fair that you should be asking me this .
" You are making me go through something that was the worst thing in my life . "
John Hughes , the north east Wales coroner told her he was duty - bound to establish how Millie died , adding : " I can not compel you to say things that will get you into trouble with the law . "
Ms Jones replied she did n't like " going over it again in my head " .
Delivering a verdict of accidental death , Mr Hughes said Millie may have used an item close to the bath to climb in .
He told the parents that it was a tragedy that a " little innocent girl " should die in this way .
He added : " I as a father empathise with you in your loss , totally . "

I am in Munich for the month and last week I visited the Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial .
I was struck by the difference between the tour I took here and the tour I took of the Lara Plantation just outside of New Orleans in May .
Visiting Dachau put the two modes of remembrance into stark contrast .
Without trying to argue that the holocaust and U.S. slavery are the same in every way , I would like to suggest that both are tragic histories that included unimaginable human suffering .
Yet , the tours were very different .
I ’ll start with Dachau .
The first thing that our tour guide did was impress upon us , in no uncertain terms , that Hitler was a terrible man , that the things that happened under his rule were indescribably inhumane , and that the concentration camps were death camps , pure and simple , with or without a gas chamber .
In case his words were not clear enough , we took in a 22 - minute video featuring photographs and narratives , all camp specific .
No details , no horror , no gore was spared .
The entry gates lead to the main square in the camp where prisoners were required to congregate each morning and evening .
What dominates the square today is n’t the guard towers , though they are present and meticulously reconstructed , it is the memorial by Yugoslav sculptor Glid Nandor .
I had seen this sculpture in pictures before and have always found it to be one of the most impactful pieces of art I have ever seen .
The artist , who had been a prisoner in one of Hitler ’s concentration camps himself , meant for the sculpture to commemorate the prisoners who had committed suicide by throwing themselves against the electrified gates of the camp .
I appreciate that the sculptor makes no attempt to ease our acknowledgment of the horror and hopelessness of life in the camps .
This main memorial sculpture was one of many .
There were four memorial buildings , about six monuments , the museum , and a convent that had been located on the site .
And memorials are still being added .
The gift shop sold books and documentaries .
My impression was that the Germans took this deadly seriously and I was impressed by the way that the Germans are handling their national tragedy .
They seem fully committed to owning this tragedy so as to never ever allow anything like it to happen anywhere again .
Never did the guide try to sugarcoat the holocaust , minimize the tragedy , or put anything into a measured perspective .
All of this may seem unremarkable .
We ’ve all heard that Hitler and his concentration camps were bad before .
Hitler is , no less , synonymous with evil .
Accordingly , it may seem to you that it could not be otherwise ; it may seem that this tour of the Dachau concentration camp was the only possible tour that could exist .
Let ’s turn to the Lara Plantation tour .
The main story in this tour was about the glamorous lives of Lara ( the strong - willed female head of the plantation ) and her family members .
Plantation life was romanticized : strong women , dueling men , wine collections , expensive furniture , distinguished visitors , breeze basking and mint julep drinking , and an ever - expanding fortune .
The plantation was done up to look gorgeous :
I would guess that about 15 - 20 percent of the tour was spent on slave life .
They showed us some documents listing the slave “ inventory ” at its peak , they talked about laws regarding slaves and how they differed from laws elsewhere in the U.S. , they revealed that the Br’er Rabbit stories were originally collected from slaves there , they discussed the extent of the sugarcane fields , and they allowed us to walk through this reconstructed two - family cabin ( mentioning that slaves were allowed to have gardens ) :
In contrast to the almost obscene documentation of the abuse and murder of concentration camp prisoners , this was the only image of a slave that I saw during the entire tour :
The image shows one slave and the two rows of slave cabins reaching back into the sugar cane from the year behind the main house .
You can compare the reconstructed cabin with those in the image .
It ’s hard to say , but I ’m not sure I see cute picket fences and gardens .
Here are some things that were not included in the tour : extended discussions of the health of slaves , their physical and emotional abuse , the breeding programs , rape , their punishing labor , the destruction of their families , the age at which slaves began to work , and all of the other indescribably inhumane things about human slavery .
The gift shop sold jam and honey , CDs , yummy smelling candles , candy bars , New Orleans hot sauces , dried alligator heads , little angels made out of picked cotton … and Lara ’s memoirs .
The contrast with the Dachau tour was nothing short of stunning .
Could the Lara Plantation do a tour that mirrored that of Dachau ?
Absolutely .
Should they do that tour ?
Absolutely .
Plantations were many other things , but they were also the engine of slavery .
It is this that should stand out as the most important thing about them .
Concentration camps were many other things as well ( e.g. , a military training site , a daily job site for German soldiers , a factory producing goods , and a strategic part of the war effort ) , but we have absorbed the important lessons from them so thoroughly that it is difficult to even imagine what an alternative tour might look like .
In contrast , one can visit the Lara Plantation and come away not really thinking about slavery at all , in favor of how pretty the china was and oooh did you smell that candle as we walked by ?
Delicious .
I need a coke , you ?
A lot of Americans , when Germany is mentioned , express disbelief that a people could live with a history like the holocaust .
But Americans do live with a history like the holocaust , we just like to pretend it never happened .
While Germany is processing its participation in a human rights tragedy , the U.S. is denying its own ; while Germany is confronting its own ugly history for the betterment of the world , we are busy preserving the myth of U.S. moral superiority .
The plantation pictures are mine and the Dachau pictures are borrowed from here and here .

“ Russian Circles ” is like an onomatopoeia of band names ; I have no idea what a Russian Circle is , but I do know that if the band name is spoken — not written — it ’s accurate as fuck .
Listen to any Russian Circles song and tell me their music does n’t sound just like circles that are rushing , spiraling and spinning ( hint : it helps if you ’re stoned ) .
Their excellent 2008 release Station was one of my favorite instru-metal releases of that year , and judging from the new track “ Malko , ” their new record Geneva ( October 20th , Suicide Squeeze ) will bring more of the same rushing , circling goodness .
Noise / post - rock fans , take note : ex-Botch , current - These Arms Are Snakes bass player Brian Cook is now a permanent member of Russian Circles .
Yeah !

TRENTON --
A city resident caught a South American piranha in the Delaware River , a report in the Times of Trenton said .
George Horvath told the newspaper he caught the 14 - inch male red bellied pacu weighing 2 pounds 4 ounces by Trenton .
Larry Herrighty , assistant director of the state 's Division of Fish and Wildlife , confirmed the catch of the razor - toothed fish , according to the report .
It was the second piranha Horvath caught in the river , according to the report .
Herrighty told the Times of Trenton the fish does not do well in the northern climate and will probably not survive the winter .
MILLIONS of British men last night admitted they would give anything to be a 15 year - old pupil at an all - girls private school .
As slim , blonde teacher Helen Goddard was jailed for having an affair with one of her students , men across Britain said the teenager was the luckiest junior lesbian in the world .
Tom Logan , from Finsbury Park , said : " That young lady has , perhaps unwittingly , been living my dream .
" There is absolutely nothing I would not give to be a curious teenager at an upmarket school surrounded by other girls who are all discovering their sexuality while under the supervision of a lithe , sexy music teacher who specialises in jazz .
" I would keep forging a new birth certificate so that I never had to leave . "
Julian Cook , from Hatfield , added : " They are going to make a film out of this and it is going to be fantastic . "
Meanwhile experts said Goddard could now add her name to one of the longest lists in Britain .
Professor Henry Brubaker , of the Institute for Studies , said : " We estimate that Ms Goddard is at least the 34 millionth person in Britain to have had sexual relations with a consenting 15 year - old .
" Unfortunately for her she is a schoolteacher and is therefore not allowed to think the same thoughts as normal people .
But the really sad thing is , she is being jailed for having lesbian sex , which everyone knows is n't even proper sex . "
Nathan Muir , a 34 year - old accountant from Peterborough , said : " Yes indeed , my name is on that list , as are the names of all my friends , most of the people in my office and just about everyone I was at school with . "
He added : " Perhaps it was irresponsible of me to have sex with a 15 year - old girl but I 've just always had this thing for older women . "
In this week ’s issue of the magazine , Steven Brill writes about the Rubber Room , a sort of quarantine for New York City teachers who have been charged with incompetence or misconduct but are still on the payroll .
Brill presents the Rubber Room , an outgrowth of the bureaucratic procedures required to fire a teacher , as a symbol of the grip that teachers ’ unions have on education policy :
If the stimulus money does not push the U.F.T. and the legislature to permit these changes , and if Duncan and Obama are serious about challenging the unions that are the Democrats ’ base , the city and the state will miss out on hundreds of millions of dollars in education aid .
More than that , publicly educated children will continue to live in an alternate universe of reserve - list teachers being paid for doing nothing , Rubber Roomers writing mission statements , union reps refereeing teacher - feedback sessions , competence “ hearings ” that are longer than capital - murder trials , and student - performance data that are quarantined like a virus .
As the Manhattan Rubber Room ’s poster says , it ’s the children , not the teachers , who are fragile and need to be handled with care .
Last December , Malcolm Gladwell examined research showing that it was often obvious within two years whether someone would be a good teacher :
Teaching should be open to anyone with a pulse and a college degree — and teachers should be judged after they have started their jobs , not before … .
That means tenure ca n’t be routinely awarded , the way it is now .
Currently , the salary structure of the teaching profession is highly rigid , and that would also have to change in a world where we want to rate teachers on their actual performance .
Other recent New Yorker articles about education reform have complicated the argument that unions are an immutable obstacle .
In the May 11 , 2009 , issue , Douglas McGray profiled the Los Angeles charter - school entrepreneur Steve Barr , whose grassroots approach toward fixing schools had been successful partly because he saw labor as an ally :
He has built Green Dot to be a political force unlike anything else in the world of education .
For instance , Barr runs the only large charter organization in the country that has embraced unionized teachers and a collectively bargained contract — an unnecessary hassle , if his aim was to run a few schools , but a source of leverage for Green Dot ’s main purpose , which is to push for citywide change .
“ I do n’t see how you tip a system with a hundred per cent unionized labor without unionized labor , ” he said .
In January , 2007 , Katherine Boo profiled Denver ’s then school superintendent Michael Bennet , who inherited a system that was struggling even though the teachers ’ union had been willing to take risks .
He discovered that the problem lay outside the classroom , and implemented a far - reaching program that took on failing schools by going directly into the communities and taking on subtle social structures that kept kids from even showing up in the first place :
Out of panic , and of motivations that involved personal vanity as well as social justice , a safety net was being strung under a school system ’s hardest cases — one involving parents , mentors , fast - food restaurant managers , United Airlines executives and city - council members who knocked on doors , an engrossed media , nonprofit organizations , and student leaders like Julissa Torrez … .
The notion of high expectations for poor children had been converted from the rhetorical to the specific and pragmatic , and a rescue effort that once seemed a sinkhole of time and effort began to look like a prototype .
The articles by Brill , Gladwell , and Boo are available online .
The article by McGray — and the complete archive of The New Yorker , back to 1925 — is available to subscribers .

Bahkan permainan ini juga yang ternyata menjadi permainan yang dimainkan oleh banyak artis beberapa bahannya seperti Kunto aji yang menyebut di twitter dan membayangkan bawah bermain Among us bersama dengan Najwa Shihab .
Dimana kemudian semuanya membalas dengan pertanyaan seperti bagaimana cara memainkannya .
Namun apakah anda sendiri atau dengan game yang satu ini ?
Apa itu gim daring Among Us ?
Among
Us sendiri yang dimana adalah sebuah permainan yang merupakan gim daring besutan dari developer InnerSloth yang dimana sudah dirilis sejak 15 Juni 2018 di Android dan juga iPhone , serta komputer atau juga PC Windows per 17 Agustus 2018 lalu .
Mengutip seperti yang ada di laman SBNation , Among
Us yang dimana dijelaskan sebagai sebuah “ permainan kerja sama tim dan juga pengkhianatan ” ini , yang dimana juga menjadi salah satu hal yang dimana akan dapat mengisahkan sebuah perjalanan 10 orang astronot yang ada di dalam sebuah misi luar angkasa .
Apa dan Bagaimana Cara Memainkan Among Us
Namun , misinya yang dimana nantinya akan menemui sebuah tantangan , karena salah satu dari anggota yang ada di antara mereka yang ternyata adalah seorang pembunuh yang menyamar .
Dalam permainan ini , dimana nantinya satu - satunya orang yang bisa dan dapat mengetahui pembunuh yang menyamar yaitu adalah penipu lain , dan dimana nantinya tugas mereka yaitu adalah menyabot misi atau yang dimana nantinya akan membunuh pemain lain nya tanpa diketahui .
Ketika seseorang yang dimana nantinya akan menemukan mayat , atau rapat darurat dua kali dalam per pertandingan yang sudah dilakukan , pemain yang dimana akan dapat berdebat tentang siapa yang nantinya menurut mereka sebagai seorang penipu .
Mereka yang nantinya juga akan berbagi tentang sebuah informasi tentang apa yang nantinya mereka lihat , siapa yang nantinya tidak hadir dan jika ada yang bertindak mencurigakan .
Jika game ini terdengar cukup familiar karena mirip halnya seperti game Werewolf atau juga Mafia , yang dimana sudah ada sebelumnya .
Membuat Pengalaman Luar Biasa
Tetapi dengan kurangnya tentang bahasa tubuh untuk mendapatkan sebuah informasi , yang dimana hal ini membuat Among
Us sendiri yang di sebuah menjadi sebuah game yang menghadirkan sebuah pengalaman yang lebih luar biasa daripada Werewolf ataupun Mafia .
Cara bermain gim daring Among
Us yang sudah Dilansir dari Fanbyte , pemain Among
Us yang dimana nantinya akan bermain dengan empat hingga sembilan pemain yang lainnya secara virtual .
Jumlah pemain ini yang diman juga nantinya akan dapat ditentukan oleh host atau juga pemain yang menjadi tuan rumah permainan tersebut .
Selain menentukan total pemain yang ada dalam permainan , host juga dapat memilih map atau juga peta arena yang nantinya diinginkan , mulai dari The Skeld , Mira HQ , dan juga Polos .
Setiap lokasi yang dimana pastinya memiliki temannya sendiri , misalnya saja adalah The Skeld yang dimana game ini sendiri bertema pesawat luar angkasa .
Setiap lokasi yang dimana memiliki temanya sendiri yang dimana misal , The Skeld yang juga bertema pesawat luar angkasa .
Pemain yang nantinya akan berperan sebagai salah satu seorang astronot Crewmates atau juga seorang Impostor dimana dengan masing - masing memiliki tugasnya sendiri .
Kedua peran ini yang dimana nantinya akan diberikan secara acak dan juga dimana pemain yang tidak bisa melihat siapa saja yang nantinya yang akan dapat menjadi Crewmates atau Impostor .
Pemain yang nantinya akan menjadi Crewmates yang nantinya akan dapat diminta menyelesaikan semua tugas - tugas yang tersedia , seperti halnya yaitu dengan membetulkan kabel yang rusak , membersihkan sampah , dan juga lain sebagainya .
Crewmates yang dimana nantinya juga harus bisa mengidentifikasi siapa pemain yang menjadi Impostor , sebelum mereka nantinya membunuh kalian .
Membunuh semua Crewmates dan menyamar
Membunuh semua Crewmates dan menyamar sebagai salah satu yang ada di antara mereka adalah tugasnya Impostor .
Pemain dengan peran Impostor yang dimana nantinya juga bisa melakukan sabotase sistem , seperti halnya mengurangi oksigen , merusak sebuah reaktor , hingga juga menutup pintu ruangan .
Mereka pun yang dimana nantinya juga dapat bersembunyi .
Selama permainan berlangsung ada yang bisa berbicara untuk dapat menjaga anonimitas .
Jika pemain Crewmates menemukan mayat rekannya , mereka yang dimana nantinya akan bisa melapor untuk dapat menggelar sebuah rapat darurat dengan semua pemain untuk nantinya menunjuk siapakah nantinya pelakunya alias si Impostor tersebut .
Di sinilah nantinya adu domba akan dimulai
Setiap pemain yang dimana nantinya juga akan bisa menunjuk salah satu dari mereka yang sudah mereka duga sebagai Impostor .
Apabila Impostor asli yang dimana tidak terpilih dalam voting tersebut , permainan yang nantinya akan lanjut lagi .
Sementara Crewmates yang dimana kebetulan dapat voting yang tertinggi yang dimana biasanya akan ditendang dari sebuah permainan .
Permainan selesai ketika nantinya Crewmates yang dimana dapat berhasil menyingkirkan semua Impostor , atau juga Impostor yang dimana akan dianggap sebagai sebuah pemenang jika nantinya berhasil membunuh semua dari Crewmates .
Sayangnya , dimana nantinya setiap permainan yang nantinya juga akan dimainkan secara berbeda dan juga tidak ada cara yang pasti untuk tidak meyakinkan seseorang bahwa Anda yang dimana nantinya bukan penipu .
Jangan bicara terlalu banyak
Alih - alih nantinya menuduh orang , dukung pemain yang dimana menyalahkan orang yang salah .
Persiapkan juga semua alibi yang baik yang bisa anda gunakan untuk setiap diskusi .
Pelajari juga cukup banyak mini - game sehingga Anda yang nantinya akan dapat menjelaskan apa yang Anda nantinya lakukan dengan koheren .
Berilah juga sebuah jawaban singkat dan juga anda yang dimana nantinya juga harus memberikan sebuah penjelasan ketika anda nantinya diberi pertanyaan .
Hal - hal yang dimana terlalu banyak tentunya bisa menjelaskan biasanya malah menjadi bumerang .
Menjelang akhir , dimana dalam hal ini tidak apa - apa untuk langsung menuduh seseorang yang membuat anda menjadi marah .
Menjadi penipu yang dimana juga menjadi sebuah hal yang akan membutuhkan sebuah tipu daya dan juga licik , jadi mungkin nantinya perlu ada beberapa dari sebuah permainan yang dimana nantinya akan sebelum benar - benar anda nantinya akan dapat menguasainya .
Pahami Menu Utama
Untuk nantinya mengenal sebuah game yang sudah viral yang dimana nantinya anda juga perlu memahami juga perlu sebuah menu utamanya yang diman nantinya akan terlebih dahulu , seperti halnya pilihan Local dan juga Online .
Mode Lokal yang dimana nantinya dalam hal ini akan dimaksudkan untuk anda dan permainan dengan teman yang ada dalam satu alamat IP wifi atau juga router yang dimana sama .

Itulah penjelasan tentang permainan Among Us yang sekarang ini sedang viral .
Dimana permainan game ini sendiri adalah sebuah permainan yang mengandalkan keahlian untuk dapat menemukan sipa yang menjadi penjahatnya .
Selamat bermain !
In patients who have survived severe brain damage , judging the level of actual awareness has proved a difficult process .
And the prognosis can sometimes mean the difference between life and death .
New research suggests that some vegetative patients are capable of simple learning — a sign of consciousness in many who had failed other traditional cognitive tests .
The findings are presented in a paper today in Nature Neuroscience ( Scientific American is part of the Nature Publishing Group ) .
To decide whether patients are in a minimally conscious state ( MCS ) , in which there is some evidence of perception , or intentional movement or have sunk into a vegetative state ( VS ) , where there is neither , doctors have traditionally used a battery of tests and observations , many of which require some subjective interpretation , such as deciding whether a patient 's movements are purposeful — to indicate a sullied feeding tube , for example — or just random .
" We want to have an objective way of knowing whether the other person has consciousness or not , " says Mariano Sigman , senior study author and director of the Integrative Neuroscience Laboratory at the University of Buenos Aires .
Previous neuroimaging work had surprised doctors by showing that some vegetative patients , when asked to imagine performing physical tasks such as playing tennis , still had activity in premotor areas .
In other patients , verbal cues sparked language sectors .
" It 's really quite appalling that we do n't have better techniques to evaluate cognitive and brain states on these individuals , " says Joy Hirsch , a professor of neuroscience and psychology at Columbia University , who was n't involved in the study .
Recent research has revealed that about 40 percent of vegetative state diagnoses is incorrect .
That startling statistic reinforced the need for better tools to measure that which often eludes quantification — consciousness .
Training the mind
To study the ability of VS and MCS patients to learn via classical conditioned response , researchers built off the work of 19th - century Russian psychologist Ivan Pavlov , who famously conditioned his dogs to salivate at the ring of a bell by associating the sound with the presentation of food .
In this case , they sounded a tone , which was followed about 500 milliseconds later with a light puff of air to the eye , a mild adverse stimulus .
The air puff would cause a patient to blink or flinch his or her eye as a natural reaction , but after repeated trials over the course of half an hour , many of the patients would begin to anticipate the puff , blinking an eye after only hearing the tone .
If two stimuli are delivered at exactly the same time , even less conscious organisms , such as snails , can be conditioned to equate the stimuli .
But delaying the second stimulus by more than 200 milliseconds is enough to demonstrate some learning , says Tristan Bekinschtein , lead study author and a researcher at the Impaired Consciousness Research Group at the University of Cambridge .
To make that association , as brief as the time gap is , he says , " You need conscious processing . "
To demonstrate the extent to which the vegetative and minimally conscious patients showed consciousness , the researchers also performed the test on people under general anesthesia ( specifically , on patients who were on propofol for an endoscopic procedure ) .
These individuals , considered to be entirely lacking awareness , showed no sign of learning .
What was more , current designation of either vegetative or minimally conscious did not determine how well patients learned .
Some of those who were minimally conscious did n't learn as well as some who were classified as vegetative and vice versa .
" I think there 's some consensus that there is a [ need for ] revision in the way these patients are classified , " Sigman says .
The new detection of learning also opens up questions about when patients should be classified as being in a persistent vegetative state — in which emergence is n’t predicted to be likely — as Terri Schiavo was determined to be at the time .
Decisions to take people off of life support are often based in part on doctors ' predictions of recovery and assessments of consciousness .
If " someone shows the patients can learn , " Bekinschtein says , " I think it would be a very clear argument " to keep them alive .
New signs of recovery
The findings might also have practical applications for patient recovery .
At the outset , says Bekinschtein , " We wanted to test for capacity to learn and capacity for conscious processing . "
But once the study was underway , they found that learning ability and speed was about 86 percent accurate in predicting the extent of recovery within the next year .
" If you think about that in a subtle way , " he says , " that they can change their brain network — [ showing ] some plasticity — it implies that there 's room for at least some recovery . "
Other researchers in the field are encouraged by the results .
" This is a really important study , " Hirsch says .
" We do n't know a lot about the neurocircuitry that is involved in classical conditioning , " she says , but " the use of a learning paradigm to predict whether a patient would [ recover ] is a possibly important idea . "
The researchers hope that similar tests will be widely adopted by hospitals all over the world .
Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) machines and other diagnostic tests can be expensive and hard to come by in many places , the authors note .
Much of the testing was completed in Argentina , where imaging capabilities can be less available than in the U.S. or U.K .
For this test , " you just need two wires , and it costs $ 100 , " Sigman says .
" In practical terms , it has strong implications . "
Hirsch , who is also the director of Columbia 's Program for Imaging and Cognitive Sciences , still thinks that " functional imaging is by far the tool of choice " because it can reveal " cognitive processes that are latent in these patients that are n't visible through [ traditional ] bedside tests . "
Sigman is still cautious about declaring the test foolproof , but he asserts that their results could mean only two things :
Either the patients " have consciousness or maybe the test is wrong . "
Determining whether anything — outside of ourselves — truly has consciousness quickly spirals into a philosophical debate .
" It 's an extremely difficult question in the end , " Sigman says .
But he hopes that their simple test will help pave the way for more definitive and accurate assessments of consciousness in the severely brain damaged .
Testing treatments
The revelation that some vegetative or minimally conscious patients can learn does not come as a surprise to all .
That fMRI findings of cognitive processes in vegetative patients have been trickling in recently leads John Whyte , the principal investigator at the Neuro - Cognitive Rehabilitation Research Network , who was n't involved in the research , to question the designation system itself .
It may be that " there is a firm line " between vegetative and minimally conscious patients , " but our tools are too crude to tell us who is on which side of the line , " he says .
Or it may be that categories of consciousness are not so easy to define .
" It seems quite plausible that people can have neurocircuits that are capable of doing something and [ others ] that are not . "
Such a fuzzy future for assessing patients based on different abilities — rather than the current criteria , which are based on no demonstrable abilities — introduces more ethical dimness .
If doctors can no longer give a black - and - white answer to whether a patient is conscious or not , but rather must proceed with a complex , gray - area assessment of cognitive capabilities , it will leave tenuous standards " to hang our ethical decisions on , " Whyte says .
The current findings — and research that Whyte and his team have done — underscore the great individuality of each VS or MCS patient .
Whyte 's recent work has shown pharmaceuticals such as Ambien ( zolpidem ) help vegetative patients regain consciousness , but it has n't proved to be a silver bullet .
Even treatments that are found to be effective in some patients ,
Whyte notes , wo n’t work for everyone .
To Sigman and Bekinschtein , however , their discovery of even a little learning provides a glimmer of hope .
" To show that someone can form a memory over half an hour is a way to start , " Bekinschtein says .
" If we could use this basic association paradigm and build from that , then it could be a form of rehabilitation , " he adds .
" That 's where we 're aiming to go . "
The typical American household made less money last year than the typical household made a full decade ago .
To me , that ’s the big news from the Census Bureau ’s annual report on income , poverty and health insurance , which was released this morning .
Median household fell to $ 50,303 last year , from $ 52,163 in 2007 .
In 1998 , median income was $ 51,295 .
All these numbers are adjusted for inflation .
In the four decades that the Census Bureau has been tracking household income , there has never before been a full decade in which median income failed to rise .
( The previous record was seven years , ending in 1985 . )
Other Census data suggest that it also never happened between the late 1940s and the late 1960s .
So it does n’t seem to have happened since at least the 1930s .
And the streak probably wo n’t end in 2009 , either .
Unemployment has been rising all year , which is a strong sign income will fall .
What ’s going on here ?
It ’s a combination of two trends .
One , economic growth in the current decade has been slower than in any decade since before World War II .
Two , inequality has risen sharply , so much of the bounty from our growth has gone to a relatively small slice of the population .
Catherine Rampell has more details on the Census report , including some good charts .
Update : Responses to readers .
It was very much a moment of high drama .
Barack Obama , fresh from his history - making stint hosting the UN security council , took a break from his duties at the G20 economic summit in Pittsburgh to announce the existence of a secret , undeclared nuclear facility in Iran which was inconsistent with a peaceful nuclear programme , underscoring the president 's conclusion that " Iran is breaking rules that all nations must follow " .
Obama , backed by Gordon Brown and Nicolas Sarkozy , threatened tough sanctions against Iran if it did not fully comply with its obligations concerning the international monitoring of its nuclear programme , which at the present time is being defined by the US , Britain and France as requiring an immediate suspension of all nuclear - enrichment activity .
The facility in question , said to be located on a secret Iranian military installation outside of the holy city of Qom and capable of housing up to 3,000 centrifuges used to enrich uranium , had been monitored by the intelligence services of the US and other nations for some time .
But it was n't until Monday that the IAEA found out about its existence , based not on any intelligence " scoop " provided by the US , but rather Iran 's own voluntary declaration .
Iran 's actions forced the hand of the US , leading to Obama 's hurried press conference Friday morning .
Beware politically motivated hype .
While on the surface , Obama 's dramatic intervention seemed sound , the devil is always in the details .
The " rules " Iran is accused of breaking are not vague , but rather spelled out in clear terms .
In accordance with Article 42 of Iran 's Safeguards Agreement , and Code 3.1 of the General Part of the Subsidiary Arrangements ( also known as the " additional protocol " ) to that agreement , Iran is obliged to inform the IAEA of any decision to construct a facility which would house operational centrifuges , and to provide preliminary design information about that facility , even if nuclear material had not been introduced .
This would initiate a process of complementary access and design verification inspections by the IAEA .
This agreement was signed by Iran in December 2004 .
However , since the " additional protocol " has not been ratified by the Iranian parliament , and as such is not legally binding , Iran had viewed its implementation as being voluntary , and as such agreed to comply with these new measures as a confidence building measure more so than a mandated obligation .
In March 2007 , Iran suspended the implementation of the modified text of Code 3.1 of the Subsidiary Arrangements General Part concerning the early provisions of design information .
As such , Iran was reverting back to its legally - binding requirements of the original safeguards agreement , which did not require early declaration of nuclear - capable facilities prior to the introduction of nuclear material .
While this action is understandably vexing for the IAEA and those member states who are desirous of full transparency on the part of Iran , one cannot speak in absolute terms about Iran violating its obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
So when Obama announced that " Iran is breaking rules that all nations must follow " , he is technically and legally wrong .
There are many ways to interpret Iran 's decision of March 2007 , especially in light of today 's revelations .
It should be underscored that what the Qom facility Obama is referring to is not a nuclear weapons plant , but simply a nuclear enrichment plant similar to that found at the declared ( and inspected ) facility in Natanz .
The Qom plant , if current descriptions are accurate , cannot manufacture the basic feed - stock ( uranium hexaflouride , or UF6 ) used in the centrifuge - based enrichment process .
It is simply another plant in which the UF6 can be enriched .
Why is this distinction important ?
Because the IAEA has underscored , again and again , that it has a full accounting of Iran 's nuclear material stockpile .
There has been no diversion of nuclear material to the Qom plant ( since it is under construction ) .
The existence of the alleged enrichment plant at Qom in no way changes the nuclear material balance inside Iran today .
Simply put , Iran is no closer to producing a hypothetical nuclear weapon today than it was prior to Obama 's announcement concerning the Qom facility .
One could make the argument that the existence of this new plant provides Iran with a " breakout " capability to produce highly - enriched uranium that could be used in the manufacture of a nuclear bomb at some later date .
The size of the Qom facility , alleged to be capable of housing 3,000 centrifuges , is not ideal for large - scale enrichment activity needed to produce the significant quantities of low - enriched uranium Iran would need to power its planned nuclear power reactors .
As such , one could claim that its only real purpose is to rapidly cycle low - enriched uranium stocks into highly - enriched uranium usable in a nuclear weapon .
The fact that the Qom facility is said to be located on an Iranian military installation only reinforces this type of thinking .
But this interpretation would still require the diversion of significant nuclear material away from the oversight of IAEA inspectors , something that would be almost immediately evident .
Any meaningful diversion of nuclear material would be an immediate cause for alarm , and would trigger robust international reaction , most probably inclusive of military action against the totality of Iran 's known nuclear infrastructure .
Likewise , the 3,000 centrifuges at the Qom facility , even when starting with 5 % enriched uranium stocks , would have to operate for months before being able to produce enough highly enriched uranium for a single nuclear device .
Frankly speaking , this does not constitute a viable " breakout " capability .
Iran has , in its declaration of the Qom enrichment facility to the IAEA on 21 September , described it as a " pilot plant " .
Given that Iran already has a " pilot enrichment plant " in operation at its declared facility in Natanz , this obvious duplication of effort points to either a parallel military - run nuclear enrichment programme intended for more nefarious purposes , or more likely , an attempt on the part of Iran to provide for strategic depth and survivability of its nuclear programme in the face of repeated threats on the part of the US and Israel to bomb its nuclear infrastructure .
Never forget that sports odds makers were laying 2:1 odds that either Israel or the US would bomb Iran 's nuclear facilities by March 2007 .
Since leaving office , former vice - president Dick Cheney has acknowledged that he was pushing heavily for a military attack against Iran during the time of the Bush administration .
And the level of rhetoric coming from Israel concerning its plans to launch a pre-emptive military strike against Iran have been alarming .
While Obama may have sent conciliatory signals to Iran concerning the possibility of rapprochement in the aftermath of his election in November 2008 , this was not the environment faced by Iran when it made the decision to withdraw from its commitment to declare any new nuclear facility under construction .
The need to create a mechanism of economic survival in the face of the real threat of either US or Israeli military action is probably the most likely explanation behind the Qom facility .
Iran 's declaration of this facility to the IAEA , which predates Obama 's announcement by several days , is probably a recognition on the part of Iran that this duplication of effort is no longer representative of sound policy on its part .
In any event , the facility is now out of the shadows , and will soon be subjected to a vast range of IAEA inspections , making any speculation about Iran 's nuclear intentions moot .
Moreover , Iran , in declaring this facility , has to know that because it has allegedly placed operational centrifuges in the Qom plant ( even if no nuclear material has been introduced ) , there will be a need to provide the IAEA with full access to Iran 's centrifuge manufacturing capability , so that a material balance can be acquired for these items as well .
Rather than representing the tip of the iceberg in terms of uncovering a covert nuclear weapons capability , the emergence of the existence of the Qom enrichment facility could very well mark the initiation of a period of even greater transparency on the part of Iran , leading to its full adoption and implementation of the IAEA additional protocol .
This , more than anything , should be the desired outcome of the " Qom declaration " .
Calls for " crippling " sanctions on Iran by Obama and Brown are certainly not the most productive policy options available to these two world leaders .
Both have indicated a desire to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
Iran 's action , in declaring the existence of the Qom facility , has created a window of opportunity for doing just that , and should be fully exploited within the framework of IAEA negotiations and inspections , and not more bluster and threats form the leaders of the western world .

Gold fever is back .
The question is : For how long ?
The precious metal leaped above $ 1,000 an ounce Friday and stayed in four - digit territory , closing at record highs .
The steady ascent of gold in recent months -- it is up more than 15 % since April -- partly reflects a simultaneous slide in the value of the dollar against other currencies , analysts say .
Some gold buyers are also worried about inflation and are skeptical about the ability of any currency to hold its value as they nervously watch the world ’s central banks flood the financial system with money .
And some gold investors do n’t share the faith that the stock market has been exhibiting in a global economic recovery .

“ We do see a pickup in demand from people wanting that hard asset and the safety blanket that goes with it , ” said Matt Zeman , a metals trader at LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago .
On Friday , the price of the most heavily traded gold futures contract , promising delivery in December , jumped $ 9.60 to $ 1,006.40 .
That broke the previous record of $ 1,004.30 set almost 18 months ago .
The price rose as high as $ 1,013.70 during Friday ’s session .
The contract for delivery this month rose $ 9.50 to finish the day at $ 1,004.90 .
Although gold has risen from less than $ 300 an ounce in 2001 , climbing much above the $ 1,000 mark may be a tall order .
Each of the two other times it closed above that level -- in March 2008 and in February -- it did so only for a day or two .

Erin Stevenson , whose Long Beach company buys gold at gold - selling events at customers ’ homes several times a week , is skeptical of the metal ’s staying power .
“ But it ’s hit or miss -- we ’ve been at $ 1,000 before , but it ’s literally for a day and then it pops back down , ” she said .
“ We ’ll see if it sticks , but Monday or Tuesday it ’ll probably be back down at $ 950 . ”
But Brad Zigler , managing editor of Hard Assets Investor , a website about the commodity markets , said the fact that gold had been at this level before might make further gains more likely , not less .
“ The last time we got up to these levels , it was all brand - new , uncharted territory , ” he said .
“ This is now ground that ’s been trod , and there ’s been a large inflow of interest on the long side in gold futures . ”

Despite the huge rally in the stock market from 12 - year lows set in March , some investors still seem to want a haven in gold .
But Zigler sees no contradiction in that behavior .
Gold buyers , he said , may merely want the metal as a lifeline in case the stock market takes another dive .
“ We ’re now seeing the signs of an attitude of recovery , ” he said .
“ But gold can still provide diversification even in an investment portfolio dominated by equities . ”

Last week we were dragged over the coals — and rightfully so — for failing to communicate clearly regarding a security exploit that was discovered in early August .
It turned out that the issue was related to Ruby on Rails .
The exploit affected multiple products ( ours and others ) .
After the initial investigation , and escalation to the Rails security team , the root cause was patched within a few days of the initial report .
We then updated our apps , tested , and deployed updates .
Fixed promptly , communicated poorly
Problem was , we did a terrible job communicating from start to finish .
We did n’t communicate well with the person who initially reported the vulnerability , we did n’t communicate well internally , and we did n’t communicate well publicly .
Perfect security is a moving target .
New exploits and security discoveries pop up over time .
They occur in OSes , web browsers , frameworks , embedded systems , and commercial software .
Anyone who ’s in the software business has to deal with these issues from time to time .
What matters is that issues are taken seriously , delegated properly , handled appropriately based on severity and priority , and communicated clearly with all parties involved .
When someone reports a security issue , they ’re reporting it because they want to help .
It ’s important for us to keep that in mind .
Getting better
After ultimately reviewing what went wrong , we began to rework our internal process for dealing with security reports .
This is a longer term project which we ’ve just begun .
Something we could do in the short term was review how we communicate publicly about security on our main security page on 37signals.com .
After a fresh slap in the face ( which is definitely a healthy thing from time to time ) , it became clear that the words we were using were the wrong words .
We were n’t setting the right expectations .
Some of the lines were cringeworthy .
It just was n’t us .
I do n’t think any of us ever liked the way this page was written , but we never got around to changing it .
Now was the time .
The stereotype of zombies as lumbering , brain - hungry undead has been perpetuated by Hollywood and the video game industry for years .
Just like racist and bigoted behavior in films and games became taboo , so too must prejudice against zombies be ended .
You may have heard about the recent killing of a family of zombies outside a mall in San Jose , California .
It was all over the news .
In case you just arrived from Mars , I 'll recount the details for you .
Jessie Walker , his wife Clarissa , and his daughter Megan were leaving the Woodside Mall after a few hours of back - to - school shopping for Megan .
Wondering if they had time to have dinner before going to see the G. I .
Joe movie , Jessie tapped a young man on the shoulder to ask what time it was .
The young man seeing the zombie , and wrongly fearing for his brain , pulled out his shotgun and blew the heads off all three .
Upon questioning by the police , it was revealed the shooter , Carl Dornberg , loved games like Left 4 Dead and Resident Evil , and had seen Dawn of the Dead fourteen times .
Researchers say there 's no connection between video games and zombie killings , but I 'll let you draw your own conclusions .
Contrary to their portrayal in the movies and video games , zombies are productive members of society .
They 're the voice on the other end of the line when you call for tech support at the cable company ; they deliver your mail , and many others .

Advertisement Golden eagles have been filmed hunting and attempting to kill reindeer calves .
One eagle was filmed swooping down and grabbing a calf , while another pulled out of an attack at the last minute .
A BBC natural history film crew gathered the extraordinary footage along a reindeer migration route in northern Finland .
It finally proves this eagle species does occasionally hunt reindeer , something suggested by forensic evidence and the local Sami people .
The crew filmed the behaviour while capturing footage of the reindeer migration for the BBC natural history series Life , though the images were shot at too far a distance to be included in the final cut of the high definition programme .
In the last 100 yards it went into a low powerful glide and hit the back of a calf
Dr Ted Oakes Television producer Dr Ted Oakes , cameraman Mr Barrie Britton and scientist Mr Harri Norberg set out to film the hunt along the northern edge of Finland .
For his PhD thesis Mr Norberg has spent the past few years studying how predators interact with the reindeer ( Rangifer tarandus ) , which are known as caribou in North America .
Mr Norberg would tag calves , then search out those that had stopped moving to find out what had killed them .
By examining the bodies and the size and shape of claw , bite or talon marks , he ascertained that the majority of reindeer calves killed in the region had been attacked by eagles .
But he had never actually witnessed such an attack .
" It is also something that the Sami had always told people and complained about but people did n't believe them , " said Dr Oakes .
Migrating to safer pastures ?
So to get documentary evidence of the behaviour , Dr Oakes and his colleagues used four - wheeled bikes and the advice of local Sami reindeer herdsmen to follow the reindeer along their migratory route .
Striking a new camp every few days or hours , the crew kept up with the animals as they moved out of the forest and into more northern , open and mountainous land .
The reindeer travelled there to avoid wolves and biting insects such as mosquitoes .
" When the reindeer get out in the open , that 's when the eagles have a chance , " said Dr Oakes .
The film crew captured a handful of successful and aborted attacks on camera .
" One of the things I witnessed was an eagle up a kilometre high and it put its wings up over its head and it fell in a bizarre way , vertically , " Dr Oakes described .
" Then in the last 100 yards it went into a low powerful glide and hit the back of a calf . "
" This is an extremely dangerous thing for an eagle to do , because the prey is much larger and heavier . "

To kill a reindeer , the birds strike it in a specific region in its withers , driving their talons into the mammal 's lungs .
" They are not killing anything instantly so they have to ride like a rodeo cowboy on the back of the calf , " explained Dr Oakes .
" No wildlife filmmaker has ever filmed this before . "
" Another one was when the eagle came down and landed near to the calf and was trying to make up its mind , " he said .
" I think it had misjudged the approach to the calf and ended up on the ground .
It was staring at the calf thinking whether it should have another go and the mother reindeer ran in and scared the eagle away . "
More often than not the golden eagles ( Aquila chrysaetos ) appeared to attack white calves , rather than tan or brown ones , though the crew did not know why .
According to Mr Norberg , it is usually immature golden eagles that kill the calves .
However , he also believes the birds occasionally hunt adult reindeer .
Another larger species of eagle lives in the region , the white - tailed eagle , but this bird is less aggressive than the golden eagle , and will often be chased off a reindeer carcass by its smaller relative .
The Sami people that live in the area say they have seen white - tailed eagles also killing reindeer , but this behaviour has yet to be scientifically documented .

HONG KONG , China ( CNN ) -- Former U.S. Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin will be in Hong Kong this week to address about 1,000 investors from around the globe in what is billed as her first speech outside North America .
Sarah Palin is expected to speak on governance and economics in Hong Kong .
Palin , who recently stepped down as Alaska 's governor , will make the keynote speech on Wednesday to the 16th CLSA Investors ' Forum .
She will cover governance , economics and current events in the United States and Asia , said Simone Wheeler , head of communications for CLSA .
" What we look to do is invite our keynote speakers who we feel are opinion makers , who are newsworthy and who we feel our clients -- a very broad international client base -- would be interested in hearing from , " Wheeler said Monday , noting that CLSA is a politically neutral , independent brokerage .
" We certainly believe that Sarah Palin will be -- she has been in the news -- we believe that she will continue to be a newsmaker in the future and therefore someone we feel that is definitely of interest to fund managers . "
What does Hong Kong think of Sarah Palin ? »
Past keynote speakers include former U.S. President Bill Clinton , former Vice President Al Gore , rocker and activist Bob Geldof , South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu and former U.S. Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan , Wheeler added .
Would you pay to see Sarah Palin give speech ?
Soundoff below
The selection of Palin has received a lot of support , but there also are critics , Wheeler said .
" She is a controversial figure , so she attracts polarizing opinions .
And we have received feedback from people that question our decision .
But I would have to frame that by saying most of that feedback has come from people in the U.S. who are not our clients . "
CLSA decided to close the session to reporters , Wheeler said .
She also said CLSA does not disclose whether or how much it pays speakers .
Wheeler said Palin would be in Hong Kong only for the speech , adding that it was a short trip .
Palin 's political ambitions are unclear , though she has recently attacked U.S. President Barack Obama 's health care initiative .
During the 2008 presidential campaign , she was lampooned by critics and comedians for suggesting that she had foreign policy experience because she was then governor of Alaska and " you can actually see Russia " from part of the state .
Chinese - language media did not give much coverage to her appearance , and some local residents and visitors were surprised to learn she was in town .
Olivia Chung , a 29 - year - old woman who works in a shop that sells dried seafood , said she did not know Palin was in Hong Kong .
" I think most most people know who she is , " she said .
" I do n't think she will have some advice for Hong Kong people ...
I think they ( people ) do n't care what she will talk about . "
But retired investor , Pauline Rooney of Adelaide , Australia , said she knew Palin would be in Hong Kong while Rooney was vacationing here .
" I thought , ' wow , we might able to see or hear her , ' to see if she has got any better sense from her experience , " she said , later adding .
" I do n't know what platform she would be coming from that would have any relevance to anyone in investing . "

While AP sends threatening letters to bloggers , blames Google for their woes , and plots the overthrow of Fair Use , their biggest wire - service competitors , Reuters , is smartly positioning itself for the future .
Thomson Reuters ' media group president Chris Ahearn recently tweeted that his company " stands ready to help those who wish an alternative to the AP , " the Reuters competitor that has proclaimed it is " mad as hell " at various internet fiends .
AP is trying to charge people for quoting as few as five words of its content .
Ahearn has elaborated on his " alternative " in a blog post , writing that too many traditional media organizations waste manpower " recycling commodity news " and that they should instead seek to retool , including by forging a new " win-win relationship " with new media .
The executive dispenses bluntly with those who would point the finger , like AP :
Blaming the new leaders ... or saber - rattling and threatening to sue are not business strategies – they are personal therapy sessions .
Go ask a music executive how well it works ...
Let 's stop whining and start having real conversations .
[...]
Reuters is even authorizing bloggers to " hyperlink " and excerpt its side of things , as God and the U.S. Code intended .
Imagine that .
Afghanistan has quietly passed a law permitting Shia men to deny their wives food and sustenance if they refuse to obey their husbands ' sexual demands , despite international outrage over an earlier version of the legislation which President Hamid Karzai had promised to review .
The new final draft of the legislation also grants guardianship of children exclusively to their fathers and grandfathers , and requires women to get permission from their husbands to work .
" It also effectively allows a rapist to avoid prosecution by paying ' blood money ' to a girl who was injured when he raped her , " the US charity Human Rights Watch said .
In early April , Barack Obama and Gordon Brown joined an international chorus of condemnation when the Guardian revealed that the earlier version of the law legalised rape within marriage , according to the UN .
Although Karzai appeared to back down , activists say the revised version of the law still contains repressive measures and contradicts the Afghan constitution and international treaties signed by the country .
Islamic law experts and human rights activists say that although the language of the original law has been changed , many of the provisions that alarmed women 's rights groups remain , including this one : " Tamkeen is the readiness of the wife to submit to her husband 's reasonable sexual enjoyment , and her prohibition from going out of the house , except in extreme circumstances , without her husband 's permission .
If any of the above provisions are not followed by the wife she is considered disobedient . "
The law has been backed by the hardline Shia cleric Ayatollah Mohseni , who is thought to have influence over the voting intentions of some of the country 's Shias , which make up around 20 % of the population .
Karzai has assiduously courted such minority leaders in the run up to next Thursday 's election , which is likely to be a close run thing , according to a poll released yesterday .
Human Rights
Watch , which has obtained a copy of the final law , called on all candidates to pledge to repeal the law , which it says contradicts Afghanistan 's own constitution .
The group said that Karzai had " made an unthinkable deal to sell Afghan women out in the support of fundamentalists in the August 20 election " .
Brad Adams , the organisation 's Asia director , said : " The rights of Afghan women are being ripped up by powerful men who are using women as pawns in manoeuvres to gain power .
" These kinds of barbaric laws were supposed to have been relegated to the past with the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001 , yet Karzai has revived them and given them his official stamp of approval . "
The latest opinion poll by US democracy group the International Republican Institute showed that although Karzai was up 13 points to 44 % since the last survey in May , his closest rival , Abdullah Abdullah , had soared from 7 % to 26 % .
If those numbers prove accurate , it would mean the contest would have to go to a second round run -off vote in early October .
In that scenario , 50 % of voters said they would vote for Karzai and 29 % for Abdullah .
The survey was conducted in mid to late July , so it is not known whether Abdullah has made further gains on Karzai .
He could further increase his chance of victory by joining forces with Ashraf Ghani , the former finance minister who is also running on a platform fiercely critical of Karzai .
Fifty - eight per cent of the 2,400 people polled by IRI said they would like to see an alliance between Abdullah and Ghani , who is polling in fourth place .
As concerns grow of a possible flu pandemic onslaught this autumn , alert authorities worldwide have been stockpiling emergency supplies .
Masks , gloves and anti-viral medications are on the list .
And body bags .
Demand for the latter is prompting a surge of interest in the wares of a small Toronto custom bag manufacturer named Trevor Owen Ltd .
Inquiries about its pandemic body bags are pouring in from as far away as the Sultanate of Oman on the Arabian Peninsula .
TREVOR OWEN recently shipped several thousand of the thick plastic bags – sewn in its Scarborough factory and touted for their ability to " prevent leakage and seepage of bodily fluids " – to Alberta .
It is bidding on a contract to supply Ohio with 12,500 of the white woven polyethylene pandemic bags .
" Some seniors ' residences are starting to buy five , 10 or 15 at a time , " said Trevor Owen president Pierre Barcik .
" There are state and provincial governments that are starting to stockpile pandemic body bags ...
It 's a bad pun , but ( the business ) is growing . "
The general fear is that the traditional fall flu season will this time bring a surge in H1N1 swine flu cases – and deaths .
Microbiologist Dr. Allison McGeer , director of infection control for Mount Sinai Hospital , recently warned there would be more deaths and infections in the city as a result of the labour disruption at Toronto Public Health .
Trevor Owen is not the only supplier thriving because of the fears .
Richard Miller , owner of the U.S. - based web portal ToDieFor .
Biz that sells a line of body bags , said demand has doubled this year .
Although the competition is considerable , Barcik 's company appears to have found a niche with its pandemic body bag , which differs from the bag typically used to transport and temporarily store the dead .
WHILE MORGUES and hospitals mostly use bags made of light - duty plastic – glorified garbage bags with a zipper down the middle – the pandemic body bag 's material is thicker and stronger , comparable to a light tarp .
It is coated on both sides with polyurethane for imperviousness and can be outfitted with six carry handles , an option that allows for the possibility of inexperienced personnel hastily hauling bodies at a time of crisis .
" It basically lets you handle bigger bodies with less care , " said Barcik .
" I do n't suggest we should handle the dead with anything but the utmost care , but if you 've got a couple of volunteers moving people around in a pandemic centre , it 's a lot different than a morgue situation . "
HAULING DEATH ISN'T Trevor Owen 's stock and trade .
Barcik 's company makes a variety of bags for everyday functions , from the giant padded envelopes that keep your pizza warm on its delivery route to the heavy - duty duffles in which hockey players like the Ontario Hockey League 's Soo Greyhounds tote their gear .
Still , Trevor Owen carries a substantial array of body bags ; it 's a sector that appears to require a diversified product line .
Cindy Maguire , the controller of Centennial Products , a Jacksonville , Fla. - based distributor of body bags whose customers include public health centres in Nova Scotia , said that among coroners and other tenders to the departed , body bags " are like a fashion statement , almost .
" People are very particular about colour , style , the seal of the bag , the zipper . "
SOME CORONERS are partial to blue bags , which are known to provide a photo - friendly background for making a visual record of autopsies .
Fluorescent orange bags are often the choice of urban police personnel who frequently work in darkness .
And manufacturers say there is growing demand for extra-large bags , such as the widely used Chinese - made bag known as the " Big Girtha " in the Trevor Owen catalogue .

Where a standard body bag runs about three feet wide and seven feet long , the Big Girtha is close to five feet by nine feet .
Said Miller at ToDieFor .
Biz : " It 's for the 600 - pounders .
Our population is getting bigger .
It 's made of very , very heavy - duty material . "
If death , by fat or by flu , is a heavy subject , some in the body - bag trade – the death - care industry , in its gentile parlance – see its lighter side .
Maguire 's company designs and sells novelty T - shirts that have become popular among customers .
One is emblazoned with the company 's slogan , " You tag it , we bag it . "
Another cribs a coroner 's theoretical lament during an obesity epidemic : " I think I need a bigger bag . "
Said Maguire : " The coroners do have a little bit of a morbid sense of humour .
But I guess they use that to get through what they do . "
Barcik , whose company employs about 25 workers in an industrial mall near Eglinton and McCowan , said he expects body bags to remain a small part of his operation – currently about 10 per cent .
HE TAKES VISIBLE PRIDE in showing a visitor a custom tote manufactured in Scarborough for paramedics with Toronto Emergency Medical Services .
It 's a bag , he notes , that could help save a life rather than simply contain the remnants of a lost one .
Not that body bags do n't have various uses .
Quite apart from the spectre of the flu pandemic that got his phone ringing , Barcik said he has fielded calls from private citizens shopping for a single body bag for unstated purposes .
" There 's a bunch of nutty folks out there , " he said with a chuckle , recalling a summer hire at the plant " who was a little bit too goth – he wanted to get in a bag , take one home .
" It 's your party , man .
Have a good time . "
PRINCETON , NJ -- Americans are skeptical that President Obama 's healthcare plan will be able to accomplish all he intends -- to expand coverage to nearly all Americans without raising taxes on middle - class Americans or affecting the quality of care .
Thirty - eight percent believe his plan will achieve all of these goals , while 60 % do not think it will .
Republicans are nearly united in thinking the plan will not accomplish these stated goals ( 90 % believe it will not ) , and most independents ( 64 % ) agree .
Two in three Democrats ( 66 % ) , on the other hand , express optimism that the plan will achieve these aims .
" The poll suggests that support could drop if Americans come to believe the middle class will be asked to bear an increased burden in terms of higher taxes , higher medical costs , or diminished quality in order to expand healthcare coverage to those who currently lack it . "
These results are based on a Sept. 11-13 USA
Today / Gallup poll , conducted in the days after Obama 's prime - time address to Congress last Wednesday .
The speech served as a renewed call to action for the American public and legislators to support healthcare reform .
However , it does not appear to have materially increased support for the plan , and the poll reveals that Americans have doubts that the plan , as Obama described it , will work .
For example , less than a majority ( 43 % ) say they are confident that Obama 's plan can be paid for mostly through cost savings in Medicare and other parts of the healthcare system , as Obama has proposed .
Eleven percent are very confident of this .
On a more basic level , Americans do not expect healthcare legislation to improve the U.S. healthcare system in a number of areas -- including quality , coverage , cost , and insurance - company requirements they would have to meet in order to get procedures covered .
Although the public stops short of saying reform will make these things worse -- given that about one in five expect the reforms not to make a difference either way -- in three of the four areas , more predict healthcare legislation would make the situation worse rather than better .
These are key considerations given that support for a healthcare plan -- currently 50 % , including " soft " support -- could drop considerably if Americans were convinced that reform would have a harmful effect on the middle class through higher taxes , higher costs for healthcare , or reduced coverage or quality of care .
For example , the poll finds 26 % of Americans saying they would support expanding health insurance coverage if it would result in higher taxes on the middle class ; 13 % would support expanded coverage if it would reduce the quality of care middle - class Americans receive .
Bottom Line
Despite the fact that half of Americans support the idea of new healthcare legislation , many fewer are convinced that President Obama 's healthcare reform plan can expand coverage and maintain quality while not increasing middle - class taxes , and that the plan can be paid for mostly through cost savings in the existing healthcare system .
The poll suggests that support could drop if Americans come to believe the middle class will be asked to bear an increased burden in terms of higher taxes , higher medical costs , or diminished quality in order to expand healthcare coverage to those who currently lack it .
With 50 % of Americans backing healthcare reform in principle , it is unclear whether the president has enough of a public mandate at this point to convince reluctant members of Congress to vote for healthcare reform .
Equally unclear is whether public support for healthcare reform will grow or decrease in the coming weeks as more details of the plan are hammered out in Congress .
But as Congress continues to do its work , the president and other supporters of healthcare reform have an opportunity to continue making their case to Americans , and to allay some of the public 's doubts about what their vision of reform would accomplish and at what cost .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,030 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Sept. 11- 13 , 2009 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±4 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
In a study of cultural differences in the recognition of facial expressions ...
... eye movements of 13 Western Caucasian and 13 East Asian people [ were recorded ] while they observed pictures of expressive faces and put them into categories : happy , sad , surprised , fearful , disgusted , angry , or neutral .
The faces were standardized according to the so - called Facial Action Coding System ( FACS ) such that each expression displayed a specific combination of facial muscles typically associated with each feeling of emotion .
They then compared how accurately participants read those facial expressions using their particular eye movement strategies .
It turned out that Easterners focused much greater attention on the eyes and made significantly more errors than Westerners did .
The cultural specificity in eye movements that they show is probably a reflection of cultural specificity in facial expressions , [ Rachael E. ]
Jack said .
Their data suggest that while Westerners use the whole face to convey emotion , Easterners use the eyes more and mouth less .
A survey of Eastern versus Western emoticons certainly supports that idea .
" Emoticons are used to convey different emotions in cyberspace as they are the iconic representation of facial expressions , " Jack said .
" Interestingly , there are clear cultural differences in the formations of these icons . "
Western emoticons primarily use the mouth to convey emotional states , e.g. : ) for happy and : ( for sad , she noted , whereas Eastern emoticons use the eyes , e.g. ^.^ for happy and ; _ ; for sad .
East Asian observers made significantly more errors when categorizing " disgust " ’ ( p less than 0.05 ) and " fear " ( p less than 0.001 ) than Western Caucasian ( WC ) observers did .
In contrast , WC observers categorized all facial expressions with comparably high accuracy .
In addition to having their eye movements monitored , the participants in the study of Jack et al. ( 2009 ) classified same - race and other - race faces as conveying one of these emotions : happiness , surprise , fear , disgust , anger , sadness , or no emotion ( neutral ) .
The results suggested that facial expressions are not as universal as Paul Ekman made them out to be :
In East Asian participants disgust was most often confused with anger , and fear was mistaken for surprise -- which happened because of a greater focus on the eyes , as shown in the figure below .
Eye fixations on the mouth ( in red ) were less intense for the East Asians compared to the Western Caucasians , which resulted in less accurate discrimination of surprise vs. fear and disgust vs. anger ( shown in the red bars in the bottom two panels ) .
Adapted from Fig 1B ( Jack et al. ) - Color - coded distributions presented on grayscale sample stimuli show the relative distributions of fixations across face regions .
Higher color saturation indicates higher fixation density , shown relative to all conditions .
Note that the red ‘‘ mouth ’’ fixations for EA observers are less intense as compared to WC observers across conditions .
Color - coded bars to the left of each face represent the mean categorization accuracy for that condition , with red indicating a significant difference in categorization errors between groups .

That remains an open question ...
At the urging of community members and at the direction of the City Council , Portland police soon will be expected to hand out their business cards during every official interaction with the public .
The request to change Police Bureau practice , which now requires officers to provide a business card when asked , arose during Wednesday 's council discussion on the bureau 's plan to address racial profiling .
Community activists who urged several police chiefs to make the distribution of officers ' business cards second nature hailed the council 's move .
They called it a small but important step by police that would help gain the public 's trust .
" We 've been asking that for 17 years , " said Dan Handelman , who leads Portland Copwatch .
Jo Ann Bowman , executive director of Oregon Action who co-chaired a city racial profiling committee with the chief two years ago , called the action " a low - level community - policing effort " that will go a long way toward improving police relations with minorities .
At first , Police Chief Rosie Sizer resisted the change , preferring that any requirement for handing out business cards be restricted to traffic stops .
She hoped to delay any new requirement until the bureau starts issuing electronic tickets , allowing officers to print traffic warnings and citations along with business cards from their vehicles .
Bowman and council members , led by Commissioner Randy Leonard , were n't satisfied .
" To tell the community we have to wait for a half - million - dollar data collection system before we can print out business cards , the community is not that stupid , " Bowman told the council .
Leonard agreed .
" On every interchange , at the appropriate time , we want a business card handed out , " Leonard told the chief , following that up with several questions on when Sizer can achieve that .
Mayor Sam Adams stepped in , giving Sizer two weeks to return to the council with specifics on how the bureau intends to meet the council 's wishes .
Sizer said it will require a policy change , a clearer definition of exactly the types of encounters in which police will be expected to provide their cards , and probably orders for more cards .
Police union president Sgt. Scott Westerman doubts the business cards will make much of a difference , but is willing to go along with the council 's wishes .
" I can't imagine how handing out business cards is going to alleviate concerns of racial profiling , " he said .
" All it 's going to do is cost the city to print more cards . "
Listening to community concerns , the council also pushed the chief Wednesday to ensure that police training videos include members of the minority community to ensure they 're realistic .
Bowman and others criticized police videos that train officers on improving their communication with drivers during traffic stops , noting that no one of color was in three videos she watched .
Pressed by Commissioner Amanda Fritz , Sizer said she 'd allow community experts to help develop and review police training videos .
The chief said most of police training is not via video .
The bureau also released its latest data on traffic stops from 2008 , which was consistent with past numbers .
It showed that African American motorists were stopped at more than twice the rate of white motorists .
Police stopped 7,157 African Americans , accounting for 14 percent of all stops -- disproportionately high considering that blacks make up about 6 percent of Portland 's population .
Yet when searched , African Americans were less likely to have drugs , alcohol or other contraband on them .
Sizer said the bureau continues to try to increase the diversity of the police force through hiring , is considering placing video cameras in patrol cars ( they 're currently in traffic cars ) , and isworking with Portland State University on how to best analyze its traffic stop data .
Police figures : 963 sworn officers , which includes all ranks : 846 Caucasians , 54 Asians , 33 African Americans , 25 Latinos , and five Native Americans .
There are 798 men and 165 women .

It ’s almost impossible to genuinely surprise and shock people in movie theatres these days .
We ’ve already seen it all .
We suspect every member of the cast of being the murderer .
We ’ve developed strong stomachs after seeing just about every imaginable way an unstoppable maniac with a huge knife can kill horny teenagers .
Even most of the sexual taboos have become mainstream and boring by today ’s standards .
Anyway , we may feel pretty unshockable now , but here at hecklerspray we wanted to pay homage to the groundbreaking , WTF moments that really had us staring blankly at the screen in disbelief .
These clips are comprised of dastardly plot twists , sickening scenes of deaths or mutilation and , well , moments that really had us questioning the director ’s sanity .
Enjoy .
Just beware there are serious spoilers in here .
30 . The Thing
Moment : Chest turns into teeth
Anyone see that coming ?
Nah , neither did we .
29 . Star Wars : The Phantom Menace

Moment : Guy ’s head explodes
Did his head just explode ?
One of the most stunning introductions to a movie .
24 . Saw
Moment : Jigsaw gets off the ground
Wait !
The killer is the body in the room all along ?
The moment Saw got even better .
23 . Misery
Moment :
It ’s hammer time
Kathy
Bates makes sure that her favourite writer will not be going anywhere .
And a few people cough up their dinners .
22 . I Spit On Your Grave
Moment : Bath time !!
The worst thing about this moment is the sound it makes when she cuts off his manhood in the bath ?
and the fact he does not even realise what she has done !!
21 . Audition
Moment :
On a wire
The end scene gave us nightmares for weeks .
20 . The Orphanage
Moment : Best advert ever for road safety
This could easily be the creepy kid with the sack on his head , but it ’s pipped by the moment the old woman is run over by a car .
Her face is something that will haunt us for a long time .
In fact it is so bad , We do n’t even want to put it on our site .
19 . Oldboy
Moment : Cutting off his tongue
It ’s a pretty messed - up movie in general , but it was hard to watch as he decides to cut his tongue off .
18 . An American Werewolf in London
Moment : Nazi zombie stormtroopers
There was us innocently watching a werewolf film and then suddenly Nazi zombie soldiers storm into his house and slaughter his family .
To make it worse , he then wakes up , another one pops up and stabs Jenny Agutter to death .
17 . Ichi the Killer
Moment : Ichie is turned on by rape
The hardest thing was narrowing this film down into one moment .
Our jaws were wide open throughout out this movie .
It ’s basically about a guy who is normally timid , but turns into a homicidal maniac with knives in his shoes when he gets angry .
Think Incredible Hulk and James Bond meets Halloween .
But the moment that probably shocked us to the core is the moment he starts getting aroused by a girl being raped in high school .

One of the most disturbing moments in movie history .
15 . Evil Dead

11 . Do n’t Look Now
Moment : Midget attacks
Donald Sutherland finally corners what he believes is the ghost of his dead daughter , only to realise it ’s actually a Venetian midget with a knife .
If you think about it , it ’s actually more realistic .
10 . American History X
Moment : Curb stomping
Nothing on earth could have prepared us for that sound .
9. Psycho
Moment : Mom ?
So , his mother is actually dead and the killer is actually Norman himself pretending to be his dead mom .
It seems tame by today ’s standards , but must have stunned audiences at the time .
8. Un Chien Andalou
Moment : Eye , eye , that ’s gotta hurt
Still one of the most shocking and disturbing moments in cinema history .
We just ca n’t look .
Neither can she now .
7. Pee Wee Herman ’s Big Adventure
Moment : Large Marge
Put us off hitchhiking forever .
6 . The Exorcist
Moment : Giving it head
It could easily be the moment with the crucifix , but the head turn just wins because of the sheer stupidity of it .
It looks ridiculous , but actually works .
5. Sleepaway Camp
Moment :
What the hell is that ?
The ending of Sleepaway Camp ?
a pretty average 80s slasher movie ?
will live long in the memory .
It ’s the moment the killer is revealed to be Angela ?
and , to this day , we have no idea what it is .
All we know is that it has genitals and makes a horrible animal noise .
4. Saving Private Ryan
Moment : War ’s a beach
So this is what war is actually like .
The storming of Omaha beach is truly terrifying .
3. Full Metal Jacket
Moment : Private Pyle goes nuts
OK , it had been building up for a while ?

Gripping cinema .
Just brilliant .

Moment :
She ’s a dude ?
A girl with meat and two veg ??
1. Alien
Moment : Alien pops out
Chest incredible .

The pound has continued to fall , sliding to its lowest level against the euro for more than five months , on worries about the underlying health of the economy .
Oil prices reflected the gloom in the markets as they fell back below $ 70 a barrel on concerns that the global economy was not yet firing on all cylinders .
Sterling fell to as low as € 1.104 against the euro – the worst since early April and down from the recent peak of € 1.18 at the beginning of August .
Against the dollar , the pound fell to below $ 1.62 .
Dealers attributed the slide to continued concern about how quickly the economy will respond to record low interest rates of 0.5 % and the £ 175bn of quantitative easing that the Bank of England has pumped into the economy .
The Bank said in an article in its Quarterly Bulletin , released yesterday , that the pound could face a prolonged fall in value due to an increased focus on Britain 's economic imbalances following the global credit crisis .
It said the exchange rate may have " moved above its long - run sustainable level " in the years leading up to the crisis .
" It is also possible that sterling 's depreciation may be part of a more prolonged process of rebalancing of the UK economy ... although it is again difficult to obtain direct evidence about this possibility , " the report said .
Last week , the Bank 's governor , Mervyn King , told a parliamentary committee he was considering cutting overnight rates paid on the money that banks deposit with the central bank in a bid to get them to use it to lend to the wider economy instead .
Such a policy would suggest that the governor thinks that the monetary medicine is not yet working .
Markets are awaiting the publication of the minutes of the Bank 's monetary policy committee to see if it was discussed at its monthly meeting .
" Dovish comments could unleash another wave of sterling selling , " Richard McGuire at RBC said in a note .
Oil prices were also weighed down by news that Chinese demand for crude had dropped by more than 5 % last month , increasing doubts that the current price of crude was justified in a world economy that has barely emerged from recession .
US light crude futures dropped 4 % , or $ 2.85 a barrel , to $ 69.19 in New York .
An interesting interview in the latest issue of the Immanent Frame , a blog that everyone interested in the science of religion ought to read : Robert Bellah , a distinguished sociologist , is talking about religion before theology emerged .
( there is also a full transcript here ) What he said about body language and ritual made me think again of Tony Blair , and the extraordinary sense I had of watching two or three people sharing his body :
Today many people , including the harshest critics of religion , like Dawkins , Hitchens , et cetera , think religion is a theory or a set of theories that are simply wrong : science has disproved those theories ; therefore , we do n't need them .
[ But ] theory [ itself ] emerged at a certain moment in human history , and before that , it did n't exist .
We can say it emerged a long time ago , in the middle of the first millennium B.C. , about 2,500 years ago .
But looking at human evolution , it 's extremely recent ; it 's the flick of an eye .
Before then , he distinguishes two main forms of communication .
The first was pre-linguistic , what he calls " mimetic culture " ; it 's probably worth avoiding the term " body language " here , because there is so much more that spoken language can convey ( which tells you more about character in a modern film , the dialogue or the obligatory sex scene ? ) .
The key to understanding mimetic culture is ritual .
I think ritual is the phenomenological basis of all religion .
Ritual , of course , is part of our lives .
If you live in the university , you are hemmed in by an extremely elaborate set of rituals .
We do n't call it that , we do n't remember that , but that 's what it is .
Then , when language emerged around the period–we do n't know for sure –between 50,000 and 120,000 years ago , we get narratives .
Narratives add an enormous amount of information to what was communicated through bodily , or mimetic , exchange .
Again , we 're still there .
Most of our lives are controlled by narratives , not by logical reasoning , not by science .
But rational , logical thought emerges at a certain moment , and that is the so - called Axial Age , more or less around 2,500 years ago .
There , too , it comes out of religious experience .
The two examples I gave in that little paper are Plato and the Buddha , two of the great rationalists .
So part of the unease I felt in front of Tony Blair arose because he was communicating simultaneously in three registers : there was the body language , the narrative drive , and finally the analytical picture of the world ; and they were all telling different stories .
But what does this have to do with religion ?
Bellah 's answer , which some people here are not going to like at all , is that this almost everything has to do with religion why it gets deep enough : " at this point , both the word " religion " and the word " secularism " are used in such chaotically diverse ways that they are almost useless . "
Bellah talks a lot about Charles Taylor 's monumental and magisterial history of secularism , which traces the appearance of several senses of the word from the histories of Christian Europe and America .
In the end , he points out , the ideology , or philosophy of secularism takes on many of the functions and inherits many of the cognitive mechanisms , that Christianity once had .
" Ritual culture " he says , is a way for a group to express important things together – again , this idea that the function of religion is essentially groupish at least as much as it is about individual meaning seems to me terribly important .
" But there is a sense in which every form of ritual is quasi- religious . "
Bellah continues :
The university is an institution that we believe in .
Some of us are ready to lay down our lives for it when it 's under attack .
Family ritual is critical–and in danger .
The family meal is a central expression of the common life of the family , and it has a religious dimension .
The family is an instantiation of a kind of group that , through its deep ties , is tied into and related to some pretty deep meanings .
So you are sliding in and out of what is religious and whatever this word " secular " means .
And it is precisely this sliding in and out of what 's " religious " which seems to me the interesting area to write about .
There is a great deal more in the interview , to which I may return , about the nature and origins of fundamentalism .
But what he has to say about secularism as itself a mythical structure is tremendously important .
All of us who criticise the new atheists for getting religion wrong by understanding it as a set of theoretical propositions should watch ourselves lest we make the same mistake about atheism .
Jackie Cochran ’s Beech 18 donated to the Vintage Flying Museum
The Vintage Flying Museum is honored to be chosen by Tarrant County College ( TCC ) to be the recipient of an historic aircraft donation .
The aircraft is Beechcraft Model E18S - 9700 , Serial Number BA - 31 N13JC .
This particular “ Twin Beech ” was the last aircraft owned by famed aviatrix Jacqueline “ Jackie ” Cochran .
Here are just a few of her accomplishments :
Flew in the London , England to Melbourne , Australia race in 1934 .
In 1935 , she became the first woman to fly in the Bendix Trophy Race , which she won in 1938 .
Became the first woman to make a blind instrument landing in 1937 .
Set new women ’s records during 1939 - 40 , in altitude and open class speed .
During World War II she was the first woman to fly a bomber across the Atlantic Ocean , leading to the formation of the Women ’s Air Force Service Pilots ( WASP ) program for which she received the Distinguished Service Medal .
Received the Harmon Trophy in 1950 as the Aviatrix of the Decade .
In 1953 , she became the first woman to exceed the speed of sound .
In 1962 , subsequently setting 73 records in three years .
She exceeded Mach 2 in 1964 .
Jackie P - 51A
Jackie Cochran ’s Beech 18 was being used as a training aid in TCC ’s Aviation Maintenance courses .
It was discovered when researching the aircraft ’s history that Jackie Cochran was its famous previous owner .
A dedicated team of TCC volunteers worked hard to restore it , however , the college was unable to provide all the needed support and funding due to policies and regulations .
The decision was made to donate the aircraft to a worthy museum and the search began for a new home .
After more than a year of going through the process of reviewing proposals and vetting them , TCC chose the Vintage Flying Museum to receive the aircraft .
The aircraft was moved from the TCC Northwest Campus to the Vintage Flying Museum .
The restoration process will continue with the help of many of the TCC volunteers working alongside museum volunteers .
There is still lots of work to be done , and we hope to have the aircraft back in the air in 2 - 3 years .

Unheard of levels of peace would break out all over the place .
We could finally achieve a useful dialogue .
Without religion interfering politics might evolve in to something for humanity as a whole to benefit from .
Satan and his hordes would overrun the earth .
After I get raptured of course .
A lot of people would n't know what to do without someone telling them who to hate this week .
Nothing much to speak of .
People would just find other justifications for killing each other , filling in the void .
Expertos : desperdicia filón que representa el bono demográfico
México está desaprovechando el potencial productivo de su población en edad de trabajar por el bajo ritmo en la generación de empleos y por la mala calidad de los pocos puestos laborales que se crean .
De acuerdo con el Instituto de Investigaciones Económicas de la UNAM , nunca tantos jóvenes se fueron en busca de una vida mejor : siete de cada 10 emigrantes tienen entre 15 y 24 años , en el inicio de su fase productiva .
Además , emigra la fuerza de trabajo más calificada , con lo cual se pierden los recursos erogados en su formación , al no haber un mercado de trabajo suficiente para los mexicanos mejor preparados .
Cifras de los últimos dos años muestran que la fuga de talentos en México es de entre 100 mil y 150 mil personas por año .
El país está desperdiciando también el llamado bono demográfico — proceso de transición en el que la fuerza laboral de un país es más numerosa que la población dependiente ( niños y ancianos ) — , fenómeno que naciones como Alemania , Francia , Inglaterra , Taiwán , India y China han utilizado como factor de desarrollo .
De los mexicanos en edad de trabajar que permanecen en el país más de la mitad no tiene seguridad médica y una tercera parte se emplea en el sector informal .
Estudios del IIE - UNAM revelan que entre 300 y 350 mil trabajadores se incorporan a la informalidad anualmente .
Ante la actual recesión económica , expertos advierten una descomposición del mercado laboral porque los trabajadores más preparados se están viendo obligados a buscar fuentes de empleo complementarias para subsistir .
La búsqueda de más recursos lleva a empleos adicionales en actividades que tienen menor productividad , con lo que el potencial de las personas queda subutilizado , explican .
El número de personas con un empleo adicional pasó de 679 mil a un millón 300 mil .
VAMPIRE CYBORGS .
IT 'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME .
It is sly , knowing and often downright nasty .
Politicians and celebrities are its prey .
And it attacks , under the guise of wit , without proof or reason .

Configurations
Right - Clicking
One of the most visible differences between Macs and other computers is the former ’s lack of a second button on the mouse .
The Mac mouse harkens back to the original mouse invented at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center , which also had only one button .
Eventually , Windows grew to ubiquity , touting its two - button mouse , and the world became comfortable with that configuration .
As a switcher , you ’re used to that handy right - click , and lucky for you , the habit does n’t have to end .
All Macs support right - clicking , and it works just as it does on a Windows system , popping up menus and extras .
Without messing with your settings , you can always hold “ Control ” and click to active a right - click on a Mac , but this gets tedious pretty quickly .
To make the experience more seamless , go into your preferences and activate “ Tap to click ” and “ Secondary click , ” which will allow you to tap the trackpad with two fingers simultaneously to trigger a right click .
It may sound odd , but it takes only a few minutes to get used to .
You can also just hold two fingers down on the trackpad and click the physical mouse button to get the same effect .
Of course , plugging a two - button mouse into a Mac is another way to get your right - click back .
Tweak Mouse - Tracking Speed
The mouse tracking on a Mac feels quite different from that of Windows because it does not accelerate .
This can be partly alleviated by turning the tracking speed all the way up .
But if you really pine for that Windows feel , you can try SteerMouse , albeit for $ 20 .
Turn Off Screen - Dimming
While some people want their screen to dim after a period of inactivity , it can quickly become annoying for others .
This feature can be turned off in the preferences under the options for “ Energy saver . ”
Turn on the Firewall
Macs include two firewalls : a packet - filtering firewall called IPFW that filters traffic based on type , port number , origin and destination , and a socket - filter firewall ( new in Leopard ) that filters based on the application making the request .
While the socket - filter firewall in OS X is disabled by default , you can go into “ Preferences > Security > Firewall ” to enable it .
IPFW is short on configuration options , but that can be remedied by downloading either NoobProof or WaterRoof , which give you more security options .
Log -In Items
Setting applications to start upon logging in is actually quite simple on a Mac .
If the application you want to start at log - in is on your dock , simply right - click its icon and choose “ Open at log - in . ”
You can also go into “ Preferences > Accounts > [ your account ] > Log- in items ” and add applications manually there .
Keep in mind that the more applications you set to open at log - in , the longer your systems will take to boot .
You can also change the background for the main log - in screen on your Mac .
This handy little piece of freeware takes whatever your desktop background is and mirrors it onto your log - in screen .
Or you can use the following command in your terminal to change it to any image you want :
sudo defaults write / Library / Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow DesktopPicture “ / Library / path_to_your_pic/your_pic.jpg ”
Hot Corners
Hot corners allow you to set up each corner of your screen to be a hot spot that triggers an event whenever you mouse over it , such as shuffling active windows to off screen to show the desktop or displaying widgets .
This gets interesting when combined with the “ Expose ” and “ Spaces ” features .
Expose spreads your windows out on the screen so that you can focus on a new one .
Once you get used to it , you ’ll wonder how you ever lived without it .
To make it really useful , set up a hot corner to activate it .
Additionally , Spaces allows you to display multiple desktops from a bird ’s - eye view .
Add this to another corner and you ’ve got something really special .
You ’ll be able to show the desktop , drag a file , switch to a different space , find a window that ’s hidden behind several others and drop the file into that window , all with one mouse click .
Check it out in the video below :
Play around with different hot corner configurations to find the one that best suits you .
I recommend using three of the four for the “ Expose All Windows ” and “ Show Desktop ” functions and Spaces .
If you have a laptop , setting one of the corners to put the display to sleep is handy because no button or key does that otherwise .
Configure Spaces
Having multiple desktops to work from can be a boon to productivity .
Spaces allows you to create up to 16 different desktops , enough to satisfy even the most spastic multi-tasker .
Along with these desktops , you can specify that certain applications only open in certain spaces , as well as specify that some apps display no matter which desktop you ’re working in .
Here are a few applications we suggest displaying in all spaces :
Chat applications ( Adium , iChat , IRC ) , movie players ( VLC , QuickTime , DVD player ) , Twitter clients and any application useful in more than one context .
I have a space for general Web browsing , iTunes and iPhoto , email and communications , Photoshop and design , coding and development , Windows virtualization , notes and reminders and one that I keep clean just in case .
Add Activity Monitor to the Dock
Activity monitor is the equivalent of the task manager in Windows .
Certain items , when added to the Dock , take on a few extra behaviors .
In the case of the activity monitor , those items can display helpful information instead of their icons while sitting in the dock : such as a pie chart showing how much memory is being used , a live graph of processor activity and more .
While you can always pop up a window and hit Command +
Option + Esc ( your new Ctrl + Alt + Delete ) to force quit an application , you do n’t get any information about programs that are running .
Clicking on the activity monitor gives you the force quit option and a wealth of information about your processes .
A Smarter Finder
Finder is a file explorer that people either love or loath .
You can do a few things to make it more useful , though .
Right - click on the top part of the finder window , much like you would to edit a toolbar in the browser , and you ’ll see that you can configure the buttons in the finder window .
Choose “ Customize Toobar ” and add the “ Path , ” “ Delete , ” and “ New Folder ” buttons , along with any others you desire .
In the left sidebar of the finder , you ’ll see a list of favorites , including your home folder , main disk drives , any attached drives and the most used folders ( photos , music , sites , etc. ) .
You can customize this list by dragging folders and other items onto the sidebar .
You can also add “ smart folders ” ( File > New smart folder ) that filter files based on a set of rules .
For instance , one smart folder I keep in my sidebar is a list of all files over 100 MB , in case I need to free up some hard drive space .
If you want to add separators to the sidebar , there ’s a neat little guide on how to do that here .
You can download toolbar scripts for even more functionality .
For instance , you can add a button that opens the terminal in whatever folder you are currently browsing .
Check them out here .
Of course , if you end up hating the finder , you can try an alternative , like Cocoatech ’s Path Finder
Hacks
Widgets on Your Desktop
Widgets are Apple ’s version of Konfabulator ( now Yahoo ! Widgets ) , but unlike Konfabulator , they are doomed to exile in the dashboard ( a “ second desktop ” that pops up when you hit the right keys or hot corner ) .
The problem with Dashboard is that the more widgets you have running , the longer they all take to pop up the first time you activate it after a restart .
If you prefer to have your widgets available on demand on the desktop , enter the following command into your Mac terminal :
defaults write com.apple.dashboard devmode YES
To place a widget on the desktop , open up Dashboard , start dragging the widget and close the dashboard .
Unfortunately , widgets will stay on top of all your windows .
Frustratingly , the only way to override this behavior is to get a paid application called Amnesty Widgets , which makes OS X ’s widgets more like Yahoo Widgets .
Of course , you could just use Yahoo !
Widgets and forget OS X ’s widgets altogether .
Change Command to Control
This is an adequate configuration for most , but an absolute lifesaver for some .
It took me a while to get used to using Command instead of Control , but I eventually broke the old habit .
Some people have been known to give up on the platform because of this issue .
For those of you who have a hard time adjusting , simply map the Command key to Control .
doublecommand and fKeys are popular utilities that let you do all sorts of custom mapping to make your switch easier .
Maximize Your Zoom
One of the weirdest quirks to get used to when switching to the Mac is the behavior of the “ Zoom ” button on windows ( the green button in the top - left corner of all windows ) .
Instead of sticking the four sides of the window to the very edges of the screen , Zoom will simply expand the size of the window to fit the screen but the window will remain draggable .
Often it does n’t even do this and instead changes the size of the window in unexpected and frustrating ways .
Luckily you can download a handy little plug - in to force Zoom to use the window ’s maximize function .
Other than using this plug - in , you ’ll have to get used to dragging the bottom - right corner of the window to force it .
Hidden Applications , Hidden Files
If you ever need to find files that are hidden by default , type this into the terminal :
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE
You can hide windows by hitting Command + h , but you get no indication that a window is hidden once it ’s gone .
To make the application icon more transparent in the dock when it is hidden , type this into the terminal :
defaults write com.apple .
Dock showhidden - bool YES killall Dock
Quick Look Expanded
Quick Look can save you precious seconds by showing you a preview of a file before opening it in its default program .
Simply hit the space bar on a file to activate it .
This is limited to certain files , but a few handy plug-ins out there give you Quick Look functionality for folders , Zip files and more .
the AppleBlog.com has compiled a great list of fours such plug-ins .
Safari Debugger
Safari offers a great browsing experience , despite what you may have heard .
It ’s quick , clean and powerful , although not that easy to customize .
You can apply a few neat hacks to make it a little more useful though .
To enable the surprisingly rich Web development debugger tool , type this into your terminal :
defaults write com.apple .Safari IncludeDebugMenu YES
For a wealth of Safari hacks and plug-ins , check out Safari Hacks and Pimp My Safari .
SAFT is a great extension for Safari that provides a lot of great functionality for $ 12 .
Customize Your Dock
Apple has very definite feelings about how the Dock should look because it does not give you many means of customization .
To mess with the look and feel of the Dock , you can try Mirage , which removes all styling , Candybar , which gives you a variety of styling options , and Leopard Docks , a website dedicated to custom Dock stylings .
When the Dock is on the left or right side of your screen , it goes from a 3 - D look to 2 - D .
If you prefer the 2 - D and bottom - screen configuration , type this into your terminal :
defaults write com.apple.dock no-glass - boolean YES killall Dock
As far as the Dock ’s behavior goes , here ’s a must - have hack you can apply .
Add a “ Recent files ” stack to the Dock by entering the following in your terminal :
defaults write com.apple .dock persistent - others - array - add ‘{ “ tile - data ” = { “ list - type ” = 1 ; } ; “ tile - type ” = “ recents - tile ” ; }’ killall Dock
Open -With Defaults
If you want a certain file to open in a certain program , right - click on a file of that file type and select “ Get info , ” which will bring up a box with all sorts of information about the file .
We ’re interested here in the “ Open with ” section , where you can choose its default program .
Once you ’ve selected the proper program , click the “ Change All ” button to make it the default program for all files of that file type .
One suggestion : make TextEdit your default program for .doc and .docx files : it opens them much faster than Word or OpenOffice .
Software
While the software library on the Mac pales in comparison to the one on Windows in terms of sheer volume , it does have quite a bit of polish .
This polish , however , often does n’t come without a price .
Free software for the Mac does exist out there , but it ’s not nearly as widely available as you ’re probably used to with Windows .
That being said , there are quite a few apps , both free and paid , that you should install on your Mac to make the experience much more enjoyable and productive .
Here are a few to get you started :
Multimedia
Flip4Mac Install the free version to play WMV with QuickTime .
Perian Every codec you ’ll ever need for QuickTime .
VLC
The de facto media player for the Mac .
Not only does it eliminate the need for the two pieces of software mentioned above , it provides more features than you ’ll probably ever care to use .
Use VLC instead of the built - in DVD player as well .
VLC integrates nicely with OS X , and you can even use your Apple remote with it .
Just download it .
Connect360
If you want to stream movies , pictures and music to your Xbox 360 , this is a great solution for the Mac ; some claim it works better than Microsoft ’s implementation .
Transmission
A very lightweight and solid bit torrent client for the Mac .
It fits in very well with OS X , style - wise .
Songbird
Not everyone wants to use iTunes to manage their music collection .
Many prefer Songbird , the much - loved open - source alternative .
System and General Purpose
Growl
If having uniform system - wide notifications for all your applications sounds intriguing , you ’ll want to check out Growl .
It works with a vast array of software and is extremely customizable .
Some notifications you ’ll receive let you know when new email , instant messages or Twitter messages arrive , when your downloads are complete , when your computer has been unplugged and when a new song is playing on Last.fm ( complete with artist and details ) .
Growl has a myriad of useful plug-ins and uses .
Take , for instance , the growl notification that tells you when your tests have passed in your Web application : a must for any Mac user .
Unplugged http://unplugged.en.softonic.com/mac/download ( unplugged )
Quicksilver
While OS
X does have the “ Spotlight ” feature , which allows you to quickly find files and launch applications , it pales in comparison to the snappiness and customizability of the application - launcher Quicksilver , which is very similar to Firefox ’s Ubiquity .
Much like Growl , you can install tons of useful plugins to tailor the experience to your needs .
When you start using Quicksilver regularly , you ’ll find yourself going to the Dock less and less to launch and interact with your applications .
It ’s lightening fast and quite powerful .
Imagine hitting a keyboard shortcut , typing “ email , ” “ tab , ” “ compose , ” , and “ enter ” to send a quick email to somebody .
Another must have .
Fluid
If you ’re anything like me , you spend a lot of your computer time interacting with Web applications rather than client - side applications .
You may miss the neatness of applications existing independently of your Web browser , too .
If you do , then Fluid is the solution .
It takes any Web page you specify and contains it within its own Mac application , complete with icon and windowing preferences .
Imagine having a dedicated app for your Google documents , Facebook , your favorite Twitter client , your Web analytics and more .
It draws on the same idea that Adobe is pushing with Air. Fluid is as extensible and customizable as Growl and Quicksilver .
The Unarchiver
You ’re going to want a program that can handle StuffIt , RAR , ZIP and other compression file types with ease , and the Unarchiver is it .
Free and straightforward .
smcFanControl
Macs tend to be a bit more of a walled garden than other computers , but that does n’t mean they have to be .
With the right amount of research , you can usually find a piece of software or terminal hack that bends the Mac to your will .
smcFanControl is one such application , made for those who want to control just how hot their laptops get .
Carbon Copy Cloner
If you ever need to transfer your hard drive to another machine , and you will , Carbon Copy Cloner is truly the best solution to the problem .
It ’s rock solid , simple to use and makes the whole process extremely pain free .
Communications
Adium Adium is the de facto chat client for the majority of high - end Mac users out there .
It covers more networks than are worth listing here .
This is another must - have app .
Colloquy Probably the best IRC client for the Mac .
Well designed and extremely extensible .
Thunderbird A great alternative to the default Mail application .
Productivity
Gimp
Because the Mac does n’t come with built - in image editing software of any kind , Gimp , the open - source alternative to Photoshop , is a handy install .
Textmate Probably the most popular text editor for the Mac .
It ’s a hefty $ 50 but worth every penny .
Sketchbox
An improvement to OS X’s Stickies .
Conclusion
So , there you have it , some configurations , hacks and applications that will make your transition easier .
As you make your way on your journey switching over , remember to seek out other Mac users , specifically other switchers , when you have questions or need advice .

Researchers from the US and Russia have shown how it is possible to measure the diode properties of a single molecule and how the orientation of the molecule between two electrodes can be controlled .
The findings are a significant advance in the expanding field of molecular electronics , which seeks to construct electronic circuits from molecular - scale components , opening the prospect of a new generation of devices that are immensely powerful and efficient yet tiny .
Diodes act as electronic ’ check valves ’ in a circuit , permitting current to flow in one direction only through a process known as rectification .
In a molecular circuit , single molecules acting as diodes would form a key component , and ensuring that the diode faces the right way is crucial .
Ismael D?ez - P?rez from Arizona State University and his colleagues selected as a candidate molecular diode an asymmetric linear molecule consisting of a pair of pyrimidinyl rings covalently linked to a pair of phenyl rings .
The bipyrimidinyl moiety is electron - deficient , while the biphenyl block is electron rich .
To measure the diode properties of the molecule the researchers attached either end to a gold electrode .
One electrode consists of a flat gold substrate while the other is the gold - coated tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope ( STM ) .
The link between the molecule and the gold is made through a thiol group .
To ensure that the molecule is placed in the correct orientation , the thiol group at one end of the molecule is protected by a cyanoethyl group , while the other end is protected by a trimethylsilylethyl group .
The molecule is first exposed to the substrate and one of the protecting groups removed so that only one end of the molecule attaches ; once in place the second protecting group is removed to enable attachment of the STM tip to the other end of the molecule .
Measurements of current at the STM tip showed both that contact was made with a single molecule and that the molecule caused a significant rectifying effect .
According to team member Nongjian Tao , ’ A general implication is that any molecule with asymmetric electronic properties should have a rectification effect . ’
Another member of D?ez - P?rez ’s team , Luping Yu , adds , ’ The molecules are designed such that we can sequentially assemble them in a controlled direction .
It is like a physical diode device [ where ] you have mark one end as positive another negative .
The difference is that we used chemistry to do that . ’
Richard Nichols , an expert in molecular electronics at the University of Liverpool in the UK , is impressed by the study .
’ It is a very nice piece of work , ’ he says .
’ They have used a combination of theory , STM and single molecule measurements and have found a way to orient an asymmetric molecule at the junction .
Using this strategy it is possible to place things the right way up within a molecular circuit , which is a key consideration . ’

IT WAS the sort of welcome usually reserved for royalty .
Early yesterday , excited Dimboola residents rushed around town for the best vantage points , undeterred by the dark and the chill .
But this was not the Queen coming to town , this was something far more important : the return of the Wimmera River .

Five years since it last flowed into this part of western Victoria , the head of the Wimmera has finally reached Dimboola , home of the district 's annual rowing regatta for 121 years .
Strong rains have combined with strategic releases of environmental water to revive some parts of the river , which still rates as one of Victoria 's driest and sickest .
Twenty years ago , Douglas Coupland was at work when he sneezed .
It was December , he recalls , and snowing hard , and it was the biggest sneeze he'd ever had in his life .
" And there was this thing , like an entity , in my hand – the size , colour and shape of a really big green grape .
And I freaked – what the fuck is that ?
It had veins on it , like it was an evil alien . "
He went to his doctor , who had a look inside Coupland 's nose and said , " Oh well , it 's not inside of you any more .
It seems all clear up there now . "
But what was it ?
" I do n't know .
But something got ripped , and after that , well it 's been 7,000 sleeps since 1989 , and I have to use earplugs every single night .
I 've never been able to focus sound since then .
It 's not so much the noise as the directionality of the noise ; it 's this weird , quirky thing . "
We are sitting in the drawing room of a rather grand , central London hotel – a spacious , hushed room that we have almost to ourselves .
But moments earlier , outside in the distance , some builders began work – and Coupland 's face had frozen into a tableau of pain .
" It 's like someone starting to use those saws you hear at the beginning of Meat is Murder , " he winces .
" Is that the Meat is Murder saws going outside ? "
When a mobile phone in a far corner of the room sets off a twinkly ring tone , he freezes again .
" Oh , sometimes I really do n't like 2009 .
Use your indoors voice , not your outdoors voice ! " he exhorts under his breath , as the phone 's owner begins to talk .
A pair of guests pass by on the landing , talking quietly together as they walk ; Coupland tenses , then relaxes in relief .
" That 's good , " he murmurs approvingly .
" They 're using their indoor voices .
Good . "
Coupland is not exaggerating when he describes himself as " sensitive " to noise .
He speaks so softly himself , in a low gravelly half - whisper , that it can be quite hard to make out what he is saying .
At 48 he looks older than his years – silvery grey hair and solemnly statesmanlike , with an introspective bearing that adds to the air of stillness around him – and were it not for his problem with noise , he might appear forbidding .
But the freezing and wincing at every background noise makes him seem unexpectedly vulnerable – not intolerant but , rather , touchingly defenceless .
The condition may also , more importantly , help to explain the novelist 's famously singular and highly unusual way of looking at the world .
" The whole episode with the grape , " he explains , " got me interested in how we sense things .
I think synaesthesia is the word everyone uses – how senses overlap with one another .
With the grape thing , it was n't wiring that got ripped out , but some new link that was established .
I think a whole lot of wires are going the wrong way . "
Only the day before we meet , he had been in a branch of Paperchase when a sheet of multi-coloured hexagonal wrapping paper so mesmerised him that , after a while , staff had to approach the spellbound novelist , taking him for some sort of crazed drifter .
As he is telling me this , his eyes feast on the colours of the drawing room .
" I do n't know if you get this , " he rasps softly , " but I feel like I can just stare at a recently opened bucket of paint for minutes , just . . . yeah . "
For the colour or the smell ?
" Well , when the paint 's wet in the can , it 's just so – it 's optical , but it 's edible as well . "
He gazes into space for a moment , looking dreamily blissed out .
" You think , ooh , what would it feel like to eat ? "
It is at this point that I quietly put aside all the questions I 'd prepared , and surrender to an entirely different register of conversation .
The conventional interview arrangement , whereby a subject broadly answers questions , is so far removed from the way Coupland interacts with the world as to be almost comically hopeless .
The very concept seems meaningless to him ; instead , we digress along conversational pathways that lack any discernible logic or direction .
But the freeform ruminations are not , I think , some kind of writerly affectation .
It really is as if his mind is wired quite differently from most people 's – and once you succumb to its idiosyncratic rhythm , it becomes strangely beguiling .
Coupland is in London to promote his latest novel , Generation A – a darkly humorous but eerie tale set in the near future , about five protagonists leading unconnected but recognisably globalised lives in disparate parts of the world .
It is a world in which bees have become extinct , but when all five are mysteriously stung , they find themselves drawn together into a vaguely Orwellian narrative .
Weaving stories within stories , the novel consciously evokes echoes of Coupland 's first novel , Generation X – the classic 1991 bestseller that introduced us to slackers employed in McJobs , and conferred on its author the reputation of a futuristic visionary .
Coupland , however , seems charmingly indifferent to the duties of a publicity tour , and happy to forget about the new book .
Instead , he talks about his current art projects .
A graduate of art school in his native Canada , as well as Italy and Japan , he more or less fell into writing by accident in the late 80s as a way to fund his art work , and still sees no distinction between the forms .
" People say if you 're doing an art project , that 's different from a book , but I honestly do n't see it .
I try and try , and I just do n't . "
He tells me about the towers of empty food tins – " like consumer minarets " – he 's been building , and another project that involves collecting plastic lids .
" We 're taking the caps , putting resin in them to make them stable , then drilling through them and making these really tall , skinny , beautiful towers .
It works out about $ 5 [ £ 3 ] an inch .
I do n't sell them , I keep them . "
Where does he keep them all ?
He laughs .
" Well , my house .
It 's kind of eccentric .
It 's two decades worth of accumulated personal projects .
Yeah , it is pretty dense in my house . "
Coupland lives in the woods near Vancouver , and can never discard a project , he explains , " because an object is interesting because it 's the crystallisation of a good idea .
And I like being surrounded by good ideas .
Every single time you walk past something you like , you get a blast of happy chemicals to the brain , and I like that . "
Moments later , he mentions that things have got so crowded at home that he has had to buy the house behind his , just to have somewhere for people to come for dinner without banging their heads .
" A different person would probably have bought a bigger house , " he adds , almost as an afterthought .
" But I 'm too bonded to the place .
I could never sell . "
And thus , quite by accident , we appear to have stumbled on what has always felt like the great paradox at the heart of Coupland 's work .
He always describes himself as " pro future " – or a " futurist " – and his reputation as a techno - cultural soothsayer , established by Generation X , was confirmed by later bestsellers such as Microserfs , the first literary work to recognise the power of Microsoft .
He is even said to greet old friends by reference to technological innovations – " Hey , I have n't seen you since the iPhone was invented , " and so on .
And yet the protagonists of Generation X were already nostalgic for the past era of Eisenhower plenty , and the future depicted in Generation A is a dark conflation of recession , climate change , globalisation and lonely alienation .
Surely , I say , a man who predicts a future like that – and wo n't even sell a house he has outgrown – has to be more of a nostalgist than a futurist ?
He smiles slowly .
" Well , the phrase I would use now is that I 'm quite open about the future .
I 'm curious .
In my mind I 've always checked out in 2037 ; that 's always been my expiration date .
I 'll be 75 .
And I just go fucking nuts not being able to know what comes after that . "
Coupland 's past has always been somewhat opaque ; the second of four sons of a medic in the Canadian air force , he was born on a Nato base in Germany , grew up in British Columbia , and credits his parents with providing a " blank slate " for a childhood that he describes as happy , if unremarkable .
About his present he is also quite private ; he publicly came out only three years ago , and does not mention a partner .
But his life in the Vancouver woods , surrounded by art projects as he works on his 14th novel , sounds pretty content .
If the world in 2038 really does resemble the one he foretells in Generation A , I ask if that could truthfully feel to him like progress .
He considers .
" Hmmm .
I remember the 70s really well , and the thing about the 70s was everything was just decaying , nothing worked , either politically or in any other way .
And the only technological changes were that phones went from rotary to push - button .
Then in the 80s there were a few more things , and in the 90s there was email , but even if you had it there were n't many places to go with it .
" And then , suddenly , collectively , since 2000 , we 've had Google , Ebay , Facebook , social media , the digitisation of the world 's economic system , the iPhone .
My friend 's got an iPhone you can point at a sudoku puzzle in a news - paper , and it recognises the numbers and builds you a new electronic one , and then it solves it for you in about three seconds .
It 's just voodoo , it 's totally spooky . "
It certainly feels like that to me , I agree – but then , I 'm a nostalgist .
How does it feel to him , watching " voodoo " develop ?
" It 's kind of like watching David Blaine levitate or something .
I do n't mind it .
The world just continues to be incredibly interesting , and not just in the Chinese curse sense . "
Coupland speaks slowly , and gives the appealing impression of thinking as he goes along , rather than rolling out thoughts with which he is already long familiar .
" I am pretty good at extrapolating from the present , " he continues .
" But I think if you talk about the future too much , which I guess is what I do , people just think you 're a cheerleader for it .
And I 'm not a cheerleader for it .
But if everyone 's doing something , I wo n't judge them .
I mean , I think half the people who get married now have met online .
If I think about all the people in my life who married – they met online , online , online .
And it makes sense if you think about it , because you fill out this form of 35 things that really define you and – bam – look , you 've got two people who match .
It works .
It is kind of robotic though , " he laughs .
Then he adds , " This friend of mine who 's a hotel bartender , he says he can always tell the internet dates when they come in .
The first person comes in with a certain kind of furtiveness , then the other person arrives , and apparently it either happens within three microseconds or it's just like this was a horrible mistake , nice to meet you , bye .
Literally , three seconds .
It 's instantaneous .
There 's still that body - to - body typing thing . "
You see , I laugh – that 's a nostalgist 's argument , is n't it ?
But Coupland just smiles an enigmatic smile , before volunteering another example of what sounds like the opposite of enthusiasm for the future .
" Now that optical recognition technology has come in , Google could take a book , put it on a scanner , and the computer turns it into a digital file that you can search .
There 's a frightening amount of information suddenly ; in a year , kids will be scanning all my books , the menu of what they ate for lunch – all they 'll have to do is point and click and it turns everything into a file , so the entire planet becomes searchable .
I do think that is very spooky , and I do n't like it at all . "
You see , I pounce again – the future is a terrible place !
In the end I never really understand what Coupland feels about the future , but he does n't seem to mind .
Apart from noise , nothing seems to trouble him terribly ; he expresses limitless curiosity rather than opinions , and when I suggest it 's a value - free kind of curiosity , he agrees at once .
" Yes , it is apolitical , that 's it .
Adding judgment , I 've always thought , will muddy my ability to see the things I enjoy looking at .
I 'm not a monster , " he adds quickly , grinning .
" I 'm sure we pretty much agree on everything , but my new curiosity is , will judgment cloud my view ?
" I like it that people are smarter , that every - one can find facts quicker , and it does make people more interesting .
But what happens – and this is the thing I 'm not really sure about – when it comes to the point where people do n't actually do anything any more ?
They just cut and paste from things that happened in the past .
You can't download getting your hands dirty .
Younger people do n't think that way , they would n't mourn the passing of a manual universe – it's just ridiculous to even think about for them – so they 'll miss something you and I have experienced .
But they 'll have something else they 've experienced too , so , um . . . "
He tails away , lost in thought .
" You 've got me in this loop now , about whether I should be moral about being amoral – which is the crisis of modernism in one sentence . "
A friend asked him recently , if he had the choice would he go back to the 90s ?
He might as well have suggested returning to the middle ages ; Coupland was horrified .
" No !
Because I would miss the sense of frontier that we have right now .
Soon it wo n't be the internet any more , it 'll just be like air , like somehow they 'll integrate the internet into the air .
And God 's name will have ended up being Google , because that 's the way it worked out .
" It could have worked out that God 's name ended up being Yahoo , of course , " he adds .
" But they lost out . "

Mother 's pride :
First lion cubs born at London Zoo in 10 years make their debut
Two rare lion cubs who were born at London Zoo took their first steps in their new enclosure today , as their mother looked on with pride .
The 10 - week - old un - named cats are the son and daughter of Lucifer , six , and Abi , 10 , who was the last Asian lion to be born at the zoo .
Malcolm Fitzpatrick , curator of mammals at ZSL London Zoo , said the little lions have already started to form their own personalities .
On feline form :
The tiny lion cubs make their debut at London Zoo today with mother Abi
He said : ' Left to their own devices these two youngsters would be running all over the place .
The young male is especially adventurous . '
Like many siblings the mischievous pair squabble , and their keepers have spotted them playing tug - of - war with their food .
As they roamed around their new moated paddock , their mother was ever - watchful .
' Their mother Abi is very protective , ' said Mr Fitzpatrick .
' Like any new mother , she is very careful . '
Keepers came up with their father 's unusual name when he arrived at the zoo in 2004 .
His registration number at his previous zoo was 666 , the Devil 's number .
Double trouble :
The 10 - week - old cubs have already started to develop their own personalities
Lucifer has not been introduced properly to his cubs yet , having only met them through a mesh .
The curator said : ' He wants to be in there with his offspring , but we wanted to make sure the youngsters were vaccinated and had a chance to explore the enclosure before we introduced him . '
Fewer than 300 Asian lions remain in the wild , and just 90 live in captivity around the world .
Paws for thought :
Abi cleans one of the tiny cubs as it takes its first steps into the public eye ...
... then warns the other cub from straying too far with a nudge of her nose
They are classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and captive breeding is key to their survival .
London Zoo is part of the European Breeding Programme for lions .
Asian lions once ranged from Greece , across the Middle East to India , but persecution has virtually wiped the breed out and they now can only be found in the Gir Forest , north west India .

Curious and curiouser :
The male and female Asian lions explore their new home
They have smaller manes than African lions , making their ears more visible , and they have a pronounced fold of skin along the belly and thicker hair on the tail and elbows .
Unlike African lions , male and female Asian lions seldom associate except to mate .
Their typical prey is chital deer , but they also attack livestock which brings them into conflict with local people .

Unless we choose to go hairy , most of us — men especially — can't escape shaving as a necessary evil .
And the razor industry knows all about it , so they always give us something new to " need " with constant one - upmanship .
I mean , really , who truly needs a razor with five blades , various strips of rubber and moisturizers , and batteries that make it vibrate , no less ?
( See also : 5 Beauty Products I 've Learned to Live Without )
Do you also find it curious that nowhere on your package of razors or razor blades does it state how long a razor blade should last ?
Although the shaving company might argue that a razor 's longevity is predicated on how it is used , I might argue that they do it because people do n't tend to keep razor blades as long as they could .
Here are some ways you can save money on shaving with these razor tricks .
1. Dry the Razor
One of the most popular theories about the life of a razor blade is that dullness is a result of oxidation , not use .
When water sits on the razor blade between shaves , corrosion will make the metal flake off , and the blade itself can become either blunt or jagged .
Exactly how people choose to dry their razors varies , and there are even products on the market to help you ( but if you have to buy something to dry your razor and make it last longer , you are probably not being frugal ) .
Here are the most popular and effective methods of drying a razor :
Blow Dryer
Although it is a pig on power , using a blow dryer will help you to ensure that even the spaces between and behind the blades get dry .
Towel
You can also blot the razor dry on a towel .
Be careful of cutting or otherwise wrecking the towel — or your hands — in the process though .
Be sure not to rub the razor ; just blot dry .
When using either of the above methods , first give the razor a rigorous shake to eliminate all the excess water .
2. Coat the Razor
Not only water , but oxygen in the air plus the salt from your skin will contribute to a razor 's quick demise .
So not only drying but also coating your razor can protect it from the water , oxygen , and corrosion that dull the blade .
Soak vs Dip :
Some people advocate soaking the razor in a cup or vial filled with the substances below and storing it this way between shaves , while others indicate that a quick dip will do everything necessary to coat the blades and preserve the razor 's shelf life .
Alcohol ( e.g. , Rubbing Alcohol )
This dissipates the water , encourages drying , and sanitizes the razor for an extra benefit ( especially if you are prone to acne problems ) .
Oil
There are a number of oils you can use depending on preference , availability , and cost :
Mineral Oil —
This seems to be one of the most effective oils to use , as it is also good for your skin .
Grape seed / Almond Oil —
The cost - conscious might want to use a mixture of these oils instead of mineral oil , which can fetch a specialized price .
Baby Oil —
I read about a fellow who actually used baby oil after running out of mineral oil ( in an attempt to save money ) , and apparently even baby oil works well .
Barbicide
This is a purpose - driven anti-rust formula used by hairdressers and barbers for their scissors , combs , and razors .
A little bit can go a long way .
Vinegar
Yes , vinegar is even good for your razor .
It 's also great at eliminating any mineral build - up on the razor over time .
Gotta love the stuff !
Hybrid Approach — Alcohol and Oil
Some people like to dip the blade in alcohol to get the water off , then dip it in oil to protect the razor against the elements between shaves .
3. Get an Old Pair of Jeans
This razor trick works likely as a function of being an effective way to dry the blade .
But from my research , users are very happy using this technique , and have made a disposable razor last up to a year , so there may be some additional benefits to this strategy .
Simply run the razor along the entire leg of an old pair of jeans 20 times in each direction .
Apparently the cross-fibers of the jeans do a bang - up job of either drying and / or sharpening the blades to keep them pristine .
4. Shave Products and Techniques
You may be able to extend the life of your razor by using different shave products or changing your style .
For example , some argue that the acid content in shaving cream can do more harm than good for your blade .
Here are some razor - saving shaving techniques :
Shaving Soap
In lieu of using shaving cream , some people find that using a shaving soap and nice brush is more luxurious and helps get a better shave .
A block of shaving soap can go a very ( very ) long way too .
Hair Conditioner
Hair conditioner is a great lubricant , and is has the added benefit of softening your hair .
The razor then wo n't have to work as hard to cut your hair , making it last longer ( the razor , that is ) .
Soften the Hair
To take the above theory to the next level , you can apply a moisturizer or conditioner a few minutes prior to shaving .
Also , after you apply your shaving soap / gel / cream , leave it on for a few minutes before shaving to allow further softening time .
5. Store the Razor
The last step in this money - saving razor - longevity equation is in how to effectively store your razor .
Since water is the antithesis of all things sharp in the razor world , your bathroom — being the most humid room in the house — is not a good place to store your razor .
If you must , keep it in a resealable bag inside a closed drawer or cabinet .
Or , simply keep the razor in a drier room of the house .
Added Benefits of these Razor Tricks
If you want to start soaking or coating your razor , you 'll quickly find that the gimmicky razors with " moisturizing strips " and other such add - ons wo n't be necessary , and in fact will hinder your razor - life - extending experience .
So go on — buy a cheap razor , and see how long it lasts .
I 'm gunning for a year myself between razor blade changes .

LOS ANGELES -- Southern California tailback Stafon Johnson is unlikely to play again this season after a falling weight bar crushed his neck and larynx .
The senior who scored the No. 7 Trojans ' go - ahead touchdown against Ohio State two weeks ago was bench - pressing when the bar slipped from his right hand and fell onto his throat .
Johnson was in critical but stable condition late Monday night after more than seven hours of surgery , said Katreena Salgado , a spokeswoman for California Hospital Medical Center .
He was treated for crushing injuries to his neck as well as severe injuries to his larynx , said the hospital 's trauma medical director , Dr. Gudata Hinika .
Stan Johnson , the player 's father , told ESPN 's Shelley Smith that his son needed a tracheotomy to enable him to breathe .
According to the Los Angeles Times , a source close to the family said surgeons worked to realign Johnson 's larynx in hopes he will be able to use his voice .
It 's unlikely Johnson will be able to play again this season , but his prognosis is good and doctors expect him to make a full recovery , Hinika said in a statement released by the hospital .
" It hit him with a lot of force , and it hurt him , " coach Pete Carroll said after the Trojans ' brief practice Monday night but before the surgery was finished .
" No broken bones as far as I understand , but he 's got some damage in there somewhere , and they 're working it out , trying to figure out what it is .
...
It is serious .
He did get hurt , so we do n't know exactly what it is , and they 're not going to know until they go through the surgery . "
Immediately after the accident , Johnson was coughing up blood , a source close to the USC football program told ESPN's Smith .
Carroll said Johnson " was OK , " but could n't speak , when he left the weight room for California Hospital Medical Center .
Johnson 's family and friends gathered at the hospital on Monday to await word on his surgery .
Carroll tweeted his concern later Monday evening .
" Please keep Stafon Johnson in your thoughts and prayers ... still in throat surgery after weights accident this AM , " it read .
Earlier , Carroll said that weight room incidents are not entirely uncommon .
" That happens sometimes when you 're doing bench presses , but this one just hit him wrong , " Carroll said .
" You can miss the rack or something .
This was right at the end of his set , and he was n't putting the bar down on the rack yet . "
An assistant strength and conditioning coach was standing over Johnson at the time of the accident .
" I 've seen players have the bar slip and fall onto their chest , but never in my 25 years of coaching have I heard of someone dropping a bar on their throat , " said head strength and conditioning coach Chris Carlisle , who was standing 10 feet away at the time of the accident .
" We 're fortunate he was being spotted . "
Johnson , a 5 - foot - 11 , 210 - pound senior from Compton , Calif. , is the Trojans ' second - leading rusher and goal - line specialist .
He 's rushed 32 times for 157 yards this year and leads the team with five touchdowns .
He entered the season with 1,395 rushing yards and 14 touchdowns .
Johnson 's absence likely means more carries for 235 - pound junior Allen Bradford or perhaps 225 - pound sophomore Marc Tyler when USC plays California on Saturday .
Information from ESPN.com Pac -10 writer Ted Miller and The Associated Press was used in this report .
In a Valley Independent article entitled “ Homicide charge shocker , ” writer Jeff Pikulsky provides what I find to be a shockingly sensationalist , biased , and legally deficient report about a self defense shooting case .
A summary of the facts , some background on the basic principles of law at issue , and my responses to that anti self defense article are below :
The self defense shooting
According to police , 25 year old James MacFarlane and 25 year old William Eyles conspired to rob Joseph Gallic at his Monongahela , PA home by luring him outside then attacking him .
MacFarlane allegedly went to Gallick ’s home at about 2:50 a.m. to lure him out of the house by coming to the door and falsely saying that someone was burglarizing his vehicle .
Police say Gallick grabbed his self defense gun and stepped outside to investigate , at which point Eyles , who was waiting in ambush , hit Gallick over the head with a baseball bat .
Gallick fired two shots in self defense , fatally wounding Eyles and saving himself from that life threating attack .
MacFarlane is said to have fled the scene , and Gallick was treated at a local hospital for his injuries .
When police interviewed MacFarlane , he allegedly confessed to the conspiracy to lure Gallick from his home , attack him , and rob him .
The charges against MacFarlane
MacFarlane reportedly faces one count of criminal homicide , one count of criminal attempt , two counts of criminal conspiracy , and one summary charge of criminal mischief .
The criminal complaint reportedly states that the homicide charge was filed because MacFarlane “ did conspire to commit a robbery , and assault with another , during which time a co-conspirator was shot and killed by the victim of the robbery . ”
No charges were filed against Gallick for his self defense actions .
Why the charges against MacFarlane are reasonable
MacFarlane was charged with homicide in the death of his alleged co-conspirator because of the felony murder rule .
Simply put , this longstanding rule of law makes any participant in a dangerous felony criminally liable for any deaths that occur during or in furtherance of that felony .
This rule rightfully imposes liability upon criminals who choose to commit a dangerous crime that ends up resulting in a death , since those criminals knew that their crime could result in a death , yet chose to commit it anyway .
The felony murder rule ensures that the criminals who plan out and execute a crime that leads to a death are held accountable .
Some states , including PA , apply the felony murder rule against one co-conspirator when another co-conspirator is killed in self defense by the crime victim .
I find myself in complete agreement with this longstanding rule of law .
When two or more criminals set out to commit a crime , they both understand that their victim may kill one of them in self defense .
When one of the co-conspirators is killed in self defense , the fact that the dead criminal appreciated this risk should n’t relieve the surviving criminal of liability , since to do so would run contrary to some of the most basic principles of law as well as common sense .
For example , it is well settled that dueling is illegal , and the victor in a dueling match cannot escape liability for the death of the other dueling participant by claiming that the other participant agreed to take the risk of being fatally shot .
Nor can those involved in street racing escape liability for the other racer ’s death by claiming that they both undertook the risk of street racing .
Getting back to the felony murder rule , as a matter of policy , the rule also makes sense :
It ensures that the most culpable party ( a criminal ) is held liable when a death takes place during a felony , and provides an additional deterrent effect against criminals who are considering committing a violent crime .
My responses to Jeff Pikulsky ’s anti self defense article
Below I quote and respond to what I find to be some of the more sensationalist , biased , and legally deficient aspects of Mr. Pikulsky ’s anti self defense newspaper article .
Leaving the courtroom Friday , Paul and Laurie MacFarlane were shocked that their son had been charged with homicide in the shooting death of his friend .
The the sensationalism and bias begins in the first sentence of the article .
Mr. MacFarlane was charged with being part of a conspiracy to ambush , violently attack , and rob another man .
Referring to self defense shooting death of his alleged co-conspirator as “ the death of his friend ” portrays MacFarlane as a victim who lost his friend , rather than an alleged violent criminal whose alleged accomplice was shot in self defense by the victim of that crime .
MacFarlane ’s parents argued that their son is being wrongfully charged [ and reportedly stated that ]
“ They ’re making it look like Cole [ MacFarlane ] pulled the trigger , and he got shot at , ” Paul MacFarlane said .
“ He ’s lucky he ’s still alive .
He was completely unarmed .
He did n’t hurt anybody . ”
Here , Pikulsky quotes MacFarlane ’s parents .
While there is nothing inherently wrong with quoting the parents of the accused , providing those individuals with a means of broadcasting their factually and legally inaccurate statements , without any rebuttal or clarification , strikes me as unreasonable .
Most people are n’t lawyers , and do n’t understand the felony murder rule , making it likely that they will take as truth the ever - so - inaccurate statements that are quoted .
I certainly believe in free speech , but at the same time I believe that newspaper journalists should take it upon themselves to provide as unbiased and objective reports as possible , given their important role in our society .
Effectively turning the newspaper into a publicity agency for the accused strikes me as a breach of that duty .
Moving on to the substance of MacFarlane ’s parents ’ statements , the law clearly does not require that MacFarlane pull a trigger to be liable for the crime .
In fact , the whole purpose of the felony murder rule is to impose liability upon a person other then one that actually pulled the trigger , for the reasons discussed above .
Note that the imposition of liability upon a person other than the one who complete the overt act is a longstanding principle of law that extends through our legal system .
For example , the getaway driver in a robbery is just as liable as the robbers who enter the bank .
Similarly , the lookout for the arsonist is just as liable as the person who sets the fire .
The rational is that a criminal who serves as lookout or getaway driver is furthering the crime .
Indeed , in cases where one criminal lures another into an ambush , that criminal who performed the luring made the entire crime possible in the first place .
In such situations , the legal system properly imposes liability upon that criminal , who is just as at fault as the person who completed the ambush .
The MacFarlanes said they do not know if Gallick will be charged .
“ They said the investigation is ongoing , ” Laurie MacFarlane said of police .
“ They ’re not saying a whole lot .
“ I just want to make sure things are fair here .
This guy [ the victim who fired in self defense ] is just walking away , and he needs to know that you just do n’t shoot people . ”
These statements defy all credulity , and I ’m amazed that a newspaper would quote them .
Simply put , Mrs. MacFarlane ’s statements do not reflect the law .
Here we have a man who was in his home late at night when a pair of men allegedly conspired to rob him , lured him from his home , waited in ambush , and attacked him with a deadly weapon .
That is about as clear a case of self defense as I can imagine .
Based upon the reported facts , Gallick was entirely within his rights to defend himself with deadly force , and should n’t be charged with any crime .
Instead , it seems as though he should receive a commendation and a parade , for successfully defending himself and at the same time also making the community a bit safer .
“ He was my friend too , ” Paul MacFarlane said .
“ I do n’t think he should have been killed .
I ’ve had altercations with people in the street , and I ’ve never had to shoot them .
According to the Merriam - Webster dictionary , an “ altercation ” is “ a noisy heated angry dispute . ”
It conjures to mind a situation where two or more people engage in generally mutual exchange of words or possibly blows .
It most certainly does not include a situation where one person is lured out of their home in middle of the night and hit over the head with a baseball bat , by a person who was waiting in ambush .
That situation is an unprovoked deadly threat to the victim ’s life , and as discussed above , that victim is legally and morally entitled to use deadly force to stop that attack .
[ Paul MacFarlane is further quoted as saying ]
“ Whatever happened to shooting someone in the leg ?
You get away with anything down here . ”
Shooting to wound is almost never appropriate .
Those who are not knowledgeable about guns and human anatomy will suggest that a citizen shoot a criminal in the leg , rather than aiming for the criminal ’s chest , so as to avoid killing the criminal – even when the citizen ’s life is threatened .
That is bad advice .
The only way to reliably stop a violent human right away is to disrupt the brain , spine , heart , or certain other vital organs .
Even severe bullet wounds to the lung (s ) generally wo n’t stop an attacker right away , as there is enough oxygen in the blood stream that they can keep up their attack for about 30 seconds .
The law strongly disfavors shooting to wound , and it as often seen as evidence that the citizen was not in reasonable fear of suffering death or grievous bodily harm .
Finally , I would note that and any gunshot can be fatal , so it is not possible to truly shoot only to wound .
Even if , just for the sake of argument , shooting to wound were a viable option , it is just not reasonable to expect a crime victim facing a deadly threat to try and aim for the leg .
A leg is a smaller target , which is more difficult to hit than an attacker ’s chest .
When the crime victim has adrenaline rushing their body , and they are facing a deadly threat for what may be the first time in their life , one cannot reasonably expect that crime victim to engage in such a marksmanship contest .
This is even more true when the crime victim in question has just suffered a blow to the head from a baseball bat , and is likely disoriented as a result .
It is simply unreasonable to value the life and safety of a violent attacker over their victim , by insisting that victim further risk their own life by trying to avoid harming the attacker when acting in self defense .
Regarding Paul MacFarlane ’s statement that the crime victim is “ getting away ” with shooting his baseball bat wielding attacker , I am yet again amazed that a newspaper would print this gross misstatement without at least providing some sort of rebuttal .
As I ’ve discussed at length above , each of us has the legal , moral , and basic human right to defend ourselves against the sort of unprovoked attack that Mr. Gallick suffered .
Mr. Gallick is the true victim here – not the violent criminal he shot in self defense , nor the alleged accomplice who lured Gallick from his home so that the bat wielding attacker could strike .

Huge news in the world of social media today : Facebook has acquired online activity aggregator FriendFeed .
According to the release , " all FriendFeed employees will join Facebook and FriendFeed ’s four founders will hold senior roles on Facebook ’s engineering and product teams . "
To -date , FriendFeed has served as an inspiration for many Facebook features ( to say the least ) , adding the ability for users to import activities from third party services like YouTube , Flickr , and Del.icio.us , plus features like commenting and " liking " items in user feeds .
However , though much - hyped in early adopter circles , traffic at FriendFeed has remained more or less flat this year , while Facebook and Twitter have exploded in popularity .
While Facebook indicates that FriendFeed 's storied team will be joining the world 's top social networking site , it 's unclear what exactly the future holds for the product .
On FriendFeed 's blog , co-founder Bret Taylor is rather coy , writing only that " FriendFeed.com will continue to operate normally for the time being .
We 're still figuring out our longer - term plans for the product with the Facebook team . "
Combined with the significant overlap between the two products , what exactly will remain of the FriendFeed we know today is at this point still very much in question .
The full release from Facebook is below :
utilised
Not to be divisive or anything , but I think it is important to at least notice that the ideological ( I hesitate to say ' intellectual ' ) motifs that the far right are currently utilising have been prepared over the last eight years by pro-war apologia .
I say the far right havethese mythemes because it would be grossly misleading to imply that fascists and the belligerati share the same agenda , the same tactics , or the same ideology .
Still , having written about the lib imps for some years now , the overlapping strategies for justifying racism cannot but be obvious to me and to many of you - so apologies to those who are already familiar with the material I am about to cite .
And given the rise of fascism across Europe , now would surely be an excellent time for some of those who bought this Islamophobic scaremongering to consider how it has galvanised these barbaric political forces .
For example , I see that the English Defence League 's strategy of arguing about Islam comes straight from the ' war on terror ' playbook .
It starts with hostility to ' extremism ' - we are not against Muslims as such , but ' Islamic extremism ' .
It proceeds to conjecture that Islam itself is ' extreme ' , and that there is no such thing as a ' moderate ' Muslim believer .
The next step is to denounce ' Islamic imperialism ' , worry about the Muslim birth rate , and tacitly disclose that one is , after all , against Muslims as such .
This was necessary because warmongers had to deny that Muslims had any legitimate grievances against Euro - American states that might lead them to be hostile to , say , an American - led conquest of Afghanistan or Iraq .
The most ebullient of these Islam - baiters was initially Christopher Hitchens , who began by diagnosing an ancient psychic malady inherent in Islam , a " triumvirate of self - righteousness , self - pity , and self - hatred " .
No policy could alleviate this , since " the gates of Vienna would have had to fall to the Ottoman jihad before any balm could begin to be applied to these psychic wounds " .
In other words , the grievance was that Islam had not conquered the world .
Later ,
Hitchens complained bitterly of those apparently ' moderate ' Muslims who were in fact " mainstreaming " what he called - in language borrowed directly from the Israeli right - " Islamic imperialism " .
This " Islamic imperialism " was deeply connected with the immigration of Muslims to Europe , resulting in ' Islamified ' geographical spaces - hence , Hitchens ' deployment of the term " Londonistan " , a twin of Bat Ye'or 's " Eurabia " and a not - very - distant descendant of " Jew York " .
He later concurred with the neoconservative author Mark Steyn that the Muslim birth rate in Europe was potentially disastrous .
But this trajectory was much more widespread than one contrarian author .
Sam Harris , the respected atheist writer , commented that " ‘ Muslim extremism ’ is not extreme among Muslims " .
He averred that the basic thrust of Islam was to " convert , subjugate , or kill unbelievers ; kill apostates ; and conquer the world " , and that those " who speak most sensibly about the threat that Islam poses to Europe are actually fascists . "
Again , starting from hostility to something called ' extremism ' , there is a rapid progression to denouncing Islam as such , to regarding it as an inherently imperialist ideology , and to then seeing it as a threat to Europe .
Similarly , Martin Amis , beginning with an attack on Islamism as a " creedal wave that calls for our own elimination " , went on to draw broad conclusions about Islam ( citing Hitchens , Berman , Naipaul and others ) .
He would later froth about his urge to make the whole " Muslim community " suffer : " What sort of suffering ?
Not letting them travel .
Deportation – further down the road .
Curtailing of freedoms .
Strip - searching people who look like they ’re from the Middle East or from Pakistan . . .
Discriminatory stuff , until it hurts the whole community and they start getting tough with their children . . .
They hate us for letting our children have sex and take drugs – well , they ’ve got to stop their children killing people . "
If he later disavowed the practical recommendations as merely a confession of a temporary sentiment , he did not stop believing that Islam itself was a threat .
Influenced by Mark Steyn 's neoconservative polemic , he wondered if " feminism " had " cost us Europe " by permitting the European birth - rate to slow .
The complaint was that women , by using contraceptives and having abortions , were not playing their part in the survival of the race - a very Old European idea , it must be stressed .
The belief that Islam itself contained the institutions and energies that produced ' extremism ' was repeated by the social democratic columnist Will Hutton , who asserted that " many Muslims want to build mosques , schools , and adhere to Islamic dress codes with ever more energy .
But that energy also derives from the same culture and accompanying institutions that produced British - born suicide bombers .
The space in which to argue that Islam is an essentially benign religion seems to narrow with every passing day . "
I cite these examples , being intimately familiar with them , but am conscious of having been exposed to hundreds more like it - often in shrill polemics by American authors .
Even oppressed groups themselves were not immune to this hysteria .
Writing in the magazine of the Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association , the organisation 's secretary George Broadhead wrote :
" What does a moderate Muslim do , other than excuse the real nutters by adhering to this barmy doctrine ? "
This was not , to be fair , tied to any expostulations about what should be ' done ' to Muslims , or any programme demanding that Muslims be repressed in any way .
But it did identify Muslims as a particularly threatening and dangerous out - group , and thus as an appropriate target for abuse and stigma .
This tendency is not marked by support for fascism .
Indeed , its most volubly self - proclaimed attribute is its hostility to fascism - that is , its tendency to anathematise a bewildering variety of ideologies and movements as ' fascist ' .
Yet it has been deeply complacent about the impact of war not only on its immediate victims but on the societies whose governments are waging it .
It has also been insensible as to the racist nature of its statements on Islam , and about the ways in which these helped normalise what have proven to be toxic ideas .
That complacency might once have been comprehensible , if not defensible , but is now at the point of being culpable .
If people do n't break decisively with this Islamophobic rubbish , they make themselves alibis - witting or witless - of barbarism in Europe .
As if having supported the carnage in Iraq and Afghanistan was n't already bad enough .
Gary Rohan will be encouraged to reflect on what he has done for Geelong in big games this year and not on unflattering finals record ahead of clash with Port .
Add to shortlist
Practically every day , a new video is circulating on the internet showing severe examples of police misconduct .
As the police become increasingly militarized and brazen in their violent attacks — for example , see this story on a Baptism party in a private backyard broken up for excessive noise , ended when cops tasered a grandfather and a pregnant mother ( who has been perversely charged with “ assaulting a police officer ” ) — cameras may be our best hope in preventing the emergence of a full - blown police state .
The police killing of Oscar Grant at the Oakland BART station on New Years Day was made famous and prosecutable because it was caught on so many cellphone cameras .
Even government cameras give a glimpse into police corruption and criminality , such as with this recent footage of multiple officers agreeing to frame a woman to cover up a car accident caused by one of their own .
I used to think that police brutality was becoming much more commonplace , but maybe it ’s only more visible now because of technology ?
I would guess it ’s a combination of both factors at play .
Of course , government wants to monitor what we do , but keep everything it does secret .
This is why Obama has gone so far as to push for an amendment to the Freedom of Information
Act purely to prevent photos depicting torture of detainees , and has blocked the release of documents pertaining to the destruction of videos revealing torture in interrogation .
But the technology is there , and the surveillance state is n’t going away , so as long as cameras advance and proliferate , I say : Turn them against the state .
It may be one of our best checks on government power .
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
A weeklong blaze that has charred more than 84,000 acres in southern California was started by a cooking fire in a drug trafficking operation , investigators said .
The La Brea fire originated at an illegal marijuana camp believed to be run by a Mexican drug organization , the Santa Barbara County Sheriff 's Narcotics Unit said in a news release Saturday night .
More than 2,000 firefighters are fighting the blaze , which is 35 percent contained , authorities said .
Some homes around the Los Padres National Forest have been evacuated .
Narcotics investigators have secured the area after working for the past month to eradicate marijuana operations in the remote and steep terrain , the release said .
" It is also believed that the suspects are still within the San Rafael wilderness trying to leave the area on foot , " officials said .
Anyone with further information is urged to contact local law enforcement agencies .
All About California • Wildfires
The effective prosecution of any war requires a load of decisions at all junctures .
Many times , commanders will blunder through misinformation , faulty intelligence , or a misreading of the tactical or strategic situation .
We , safely ensconced here in the future can play Monday morning quarterback with the decision of the past often without acknowledging the fact that the commanders in question lack our brilliant hindsight ; however , some decisions are simple unconscionable .
One has to think that someone , somewhere had to look at this choice and say “ God , this is stupid ! ”
This list represents , in chronological order , ten of what I consider to be the dumbest decisions anyone ever made .
Each of these decisions either resulted in tremendously unnecessary loss of men and materiel or it resulted in the ultimate loss or needless prolonging of the war in which it took place .
10 Invading Russia Napoleon Bonaparte ( June 1812 )
The only motivation I can fathom behind this idiotic blunder by a military genius is sheer boredom .
To this point in his military career , Napoleon has known nothing but victory after victory .
He ’s conquered pretty much all of Europe that refused to ally with him and suddenly he was sitting around with the largest army ever gathered in Europe up until then with nothing to do .
So Napoleon looks west , to Mother Russia .
We all know how it turned out but you have to think someone in that huge army knew it was a bad idea .
In any event , he did n’t say anything and the rest is history .
Napoleon invaded Russia with three quarters of a million men and did n’t fight much of a battle .
The Russian retreated into the vastness of their country and burned everything in their wake .
Result ?
Napoleon gets to Moscow only to find smoking ruins .
Dejected at not getting to move his toy soldiers around on his big map , he turns the Grand Armee around and begins for home .
But then the real trouble began .
Constant harassment by tiny , mobile Russian units .
Constant hunger because the supply lines are cut in more places than Danish lace and , worst of all , winter sets in and the soldiers start freezing to death in droves .
Three quarters of a million went in , but less than one in three would made it out .
9 The Alamo Gen. Santa Anna ( February 1836 )
Someone has remarked that the Alamo seems to show up on nearly every military list .
Well , it ’s a great story .
Not the least great part about it was it was so totally unnecessary .
All the Alamo consisted of was a tiny adobe walled mission in the middle of a prairie .
Basically , Santa Anna , aka Napoleon of the West , decided the tiny garrison in the tiny fort had to be taught a lesson about Mexican politics by his great big army .
One just has to think that someone , some hard campaigning Sergeant in the Mexican force had to look around at the wide open prairie on both sides of the Alamo and think to himself , “ Why do n’t we just go around ?
We can even shoot at them as we go by , but let ’s get to the rebel capital and put down the rebellion . ”
Instead , mainly as a result of Santa Anna ’s pride , the main Mexican army spends days and days held up attacking this insignificant little outpost .
This needless delay gives the Texas government time to get organized , gives people time to flee , and gives the main Texan army time to get reinforced and into better position .
The end result was the Battle of San Jacinto where old Santa Anna got caught napping – literally – and the Republic of Texas was born .
8 Add Lard to Rifles Some British Bureaucrat ( May 1857 )
This one will be a little obscure to some , but in the grand scheme of things , it was a world - changing event .
The cartridge in question was for the new Pattern 3 Enfield rifle that was to be issued to all the Empire ’s troops and replace the older , less efficient models .
On the surface this does n’t seem like a big deal and to us , it probably would n’t be .
However , in 1857 , cartridges were n’t brass , they were paper , and to load them , one had to first BITE the end off the cartridge and pour the contained powder down the barrel of the muzzle loaded weapon .
Again , no big deal , until one realizes one singularly important fact .
The lubricating lard smeared on the cartridges was made from animal fat .
This fat could be obtained from either pigs or cows .
In and of itself , that does n’t present a problem until one realizes that the vast majority of foreign troops in the British Empire were either Muslim or Hindu , especially in India .
Now , pigs are unclean to Muslims and cows are sacred to the Hindus so the thought of putting a cartridge with lard into their mouths was anathema to both parties .
It did n’t help matters much that the political climate in India was becoming a powder keg , but the lard cartridges proved the final straw – the match that blew the keg , so to speak .
What resulted is known to history as the Sepoy Rebellion or the Sepoy Mutiny .
Basically , without going into the very involved , tense and delicate political situation , the Sepoys or Indian soldiers , refused to touch the cartridges which constitutes mutiny .
When the first few were seen being punished by the British colonial overlords , the rest rose up and began a bloody rebellion that lasted 13 months and saw tremendous bloodshed and cruelty on both sides .
The British severity in putting down the revolt – many leaders were tied to the mouths of cannon and blasted to bloody vapor — remained in the minds of the Indian people through the rest of the 19th century and through two world wars in the 20th .
In many ways , the Indian Independence Movement lead by Gandhi can trace its roots to this one monumentally boneheaded decision .
7 Losing Your Battle Plans Unknown CSA Officer ( September 1862 )
During the American Civil War , one of the qualities that made General Robert E. Lee of the Confederacy so effective was the mysteriousness with which he moved and operated .
His troops seemed to appear , fight , and melt away with uncanny speed .
Now in reality , this was nothing more supernatural than very detailed and well - executed battle plans .
Imagine what the Union generals could have done if they had only possessed a copy of one of Lee ’s battle plans .
In a wildly providential moment , that is exactly what happened on the eve of the Battle of Sharpsburg in September of 1862 .
Union General George McClellan ’s 90,000 - man Army of the Potomac was moving to intercept Lee , and occupied a campsite the Confederates had vacated just a few days before .
While setting up their tent , two Union soldiers discovered a copy of Lee ’s detailed battle plans wrapped around three cigars .
The order indicated that Lee had divided his army and dispersed portions , intending to bring battle near Antietam Creek .
Everything was there in writing .
It was a colossal blunder by some Confederate officer .
The outcome would have been even more disastrous for the Confederates had not McClellan waited about 18 hours before deciding to take advantage of this intelligence and reposition his forces .
As it was , the Battle of Sharpsburg ( or Antietam ) would be the single bloodiest day of combat in American history with 23,000 killed and countless wounded before the sun set .
All that saved Lee was McClellan ’s indecision .
Still , the battle sapped numbers of soldiers that the Confederacy could ill afford to lose .
More importantly , though , was the fact that England had been teetering on the fence of coming into the war to aid their cotton supplying Confederates , but with the outcome of Antietam , they decided to sit back for a little while longer , thus robbing the Confederacy of help it desperately needed .
A different choice of wrapping paper could have made all the difference in the world to the history of North America .
6 Not Following the Enemy Gen. George Meade ( July 1863 )
It sometimes looks like Lee did have some sort of guardian angel ; either that or the Northern generals before Grant were all monumentally stupid .
The former is more romantic , but the latter is easier to prove .
In any event , Meade ’s decision to let Lee slip back to Virginia is another example of Lee ’s luck and an opposing general ’s horrendous decision making ability .
The Army of Northern Virginia was done .
Three days at Gettysburg had reduced the proud rebels to a shell of their former strength .
Devil ’s Den , Little Round Top , the Peach Orchard , and , at the last , Pickett ’s Charge up Cemetery Ridge had produced the High Water Mark of the Confederacy .
With all his reserves spent , Lee was gathering his badly mauled forces and trying mightily to make it back to the relative safety of Ol ’ Virginy .
In his way was the rain swollen Potomac River .
On his flanks were the persistent if largely ineffectual Union cavalry pickets .
The roads were a quagmire of mud .
In all , the stage was set for the final crushing blow to be delivered by the Army of the Potomac , which had several reserves that had seen little if any fighting .
They would sweep down on the defeated boys in grey like an avenging blue tide .
The Army of Northern Virginia would be crushed and the Civil War would be all but over .
All that remained was for General Meade to give the order to attack .
Well , the order never came .
For reasons that , to this day , are unclear Meade was reluctant to follow Lee .
Instead , he gathered his forces in strength and waited .
No one is quite sure what he was waiting for , but when President Lincoln found out that Meade had literally allowed the end of the war to slip through his hands , Honest Abe was incensed .
It was largely Meade ’s indecision that resulted in General Grant being called east from Vicksburg and placed in command of the Army of the Potomac .
Had Meade attacked the defeated rebels at that opportune moment , the Civil War probably would not have drug on in a morass of attrition for nearly two more years .
Countless lives , Union and Confederate alike , could have been spared and the Reconstruction Period would likely have looked much different .
5 Ignoring the Gatling George A. Custer ( June 1876 )
It is generally held to be a good idea among most military men that , when the latest and greatest weapons are available , they should be used .
The newly patented Gatling Gun was the earliest machine gun and had completed its trials .
Custer had two to four of the guns and abundant ammunition available when he set out to uproot a “ small Indian village ” on the bank of the Little Bighorn River .
Custer ’s reasoning behind not using them was that the Gatling guns would impede his march and hamper his mobility .
More importantly , he also is said to have believed that the use of so devastating a weapon would “ cause him to lose face with the Indians . ”
Considering reports of Custer ’s vanity , this is not hard to believe .
These problems do not change the fact that the Gatling guns would have been a decided equalizer in the face of what turned out to be overwhelming Indian superiority , and that elsewhere in the Indian wars , the Indians often reacted to new army weapons by breaking off the fight .
Instead , Custer led more than 250 doomed men of the famous 7th Cavalry into the Montana hill country .
If he had taken the then greatly improved machine guns with him the outcome of the much - discussed Last Stand would surely have been very different .
What could have been going through Custer ’s mind as he stood , the breeze whipping his famous golden hair behind him , his loyal men dead all about him , and several hundred Sioux warriors galloping towards him intent on making him a human pincushion ?
Could it possibly have been , “ I really could use those Gatling guns right about now . ”
4 Invade Gallipoli Winston Churchill ( April 1915 )
By the start of 1915 , the Great War had ground to a halt .
The trench lines stretched from Belgium through Italy and neither side was making progress .
The war had devolved into mad suicide rushes across no man ’s land into the teeth of the new Maxim guns .
Predictably , casualties were mounting daily and the war that “ will be over by Christmas ” seemed to have no end in sight .
To make matters worse , Russia was getting their mess kits handed to them all up and down the Eastern Front and the tsardom was beginning to look shaky .
The German navy had cut all the usual supply lines to accessible ports and any port safe from the German fleet was either icebound or entirely too far away to be of any practical use .
Something had to be done and quickly .
Enter Lord of the Admiralty , Winston Churchill .
Now Churchill is well know for his personal bravery as well as his usually keen mind .
He is also known for being a fan of a good stiff drink and apparently , he ’d had several when he thought of this plan .
Churchill proposed that a third front be opened up in the western Mediterranean .
Specifically , he planned an attack on the Ottoman Empire held Dardanelles .
The attack on what he termed the “ soft underbelly of the Central Powers ” would open up a warm water resupply depot for Russia and effectively turn the flank of the vast trench network .
It was a great idea in theory and on paper .
The Gallipoli Campaign took place at Gallipoli peninsula in Turkey from 25 April 1915 to 9 January 1916 .
The intent was for a joint amphibian attack by British Empire and French forces up the peninsula to capture the Ottoman capital of Istanbul .
To put it mildly , the attempt failed miserably with heavy casualties on both sides .
The whole operation was botched from the beginning .
The planned invasion was tipped off to the Turks who reinforced the peninsula with heavy guns and additional troops .
Once the invasion began , it quickly stalled on the beachhead , thwarted by the Turkish occupation of the high ground .
To make a very detailed and long story short , the allied forces , the bulk of which were Australians and New Zealanders ( who ultimately had the highest number of dead per capita of all nations in the war ) , were essentially trapped on the beaches in the open for months .
No real progress was ever made inland despite several dogged attempts all around the peninsula .
Promised naval artillery support was cut short as soon as the Admiralty found out – by the sinking of two battleships – that German U - boats were in the waters .
The whole event was an unmitigated disaster .
Conditions were unreal .
In the summer , the heat was atrocious , which in conjunction with bad sanitation , led to so many flies that eating became extremely difficult .
Corpses , left in the open , became bloated and stank .
The precarious Allied bases were poorly situated and caused supply and shelter problems .
A dysentery epidemic spread through the Allied trenches .
Autumn and winter brought relief from the heat , but also led to gales , flooding and frostbite .
In the end , Churchill was sacked as Lord of the Admiralty , several generals saw their careers ended but most of all ; tens of thousands of men on both sides were killed for absolutely no gain whatsoever .
To this day , Gallipoli is remembered as ANZAC Day in Australia and New Zealand in honor of all the brave ANZACs who gave their lives for a stupid decision .
3 Soviet Invasion Adolf Hitler , ( September 1941 )
Honestly ?
See item 10 .
Replace “ Napoleon ” with “ Hitler ” , “ Russia ” with “ Soviet Union ” , and “ Le Grand Armee ” with “ Wermacht ” and you have the gist of the story .
Operation Barbarossa was , without a doubt , the worst case of someone who failed to learn from history being doomed to repeat it .
Adolf Hitler proved that it ’s not only teenagers who think , “ It ca n’t happen to me . ”
2 Micromanaging the War Lyndon B. Johnson ( August 1964 )
Wars are best run by the professionals .
Lyndon B. Johnson was President , but he was not a professional soldier by any means during the Vietnam War .
That did not stop him from blowing what was a small insurgency with American “ advisors ” into an all out “ police action ” that would claim the lives of nearly 60,000 American soldiers , sailors , and airmen before it ended two Presidents later .
Johnson expanded American involvement on the ground in Vietnam as soon as he took office after JFK ’s assassination .
Unfortunately for the troops , LBJ watched opinion polls and it is hard to fight a war if you watch opinion polls .
Basically , field commanders could n’t attack certain high value targets without Johnson ’s say - so and , given the distances and the time it would take to brief the President on each given situation , the men were fighting one step behind at all times .
He also took fire from the press who said he was too cozy with the defense businessmen and the war was justification for increased defense spending to make these businesses rich .
That speculation , like Johnson ’s supposed involvement in JFK ’s assassination , is better left to the conspiracy theorists .
What is a fact , however , is LBJ ’s insistence on being a hands - on Commander - in - Chief seriously handicapped American efforts in the jungles of Vietnam .
Ultimately , his decision to try running a war based on opinion polls proved his undoing and he dropped out of the 1968 Presidential elections .
1 Invading Afghanistan Yuri Andropov ( December 1979 )
For centuries , countries outside of Afghanistan – from the Indian Mughals , to the British Empire , to the Islamic fundamentalists – have tried to impose their will upon the Afghan people .
As a result , the Afghans are a hardy bunch and they can fight like devils .
The are experts at guerilla warfare and it is always a safe bet to assume that whoever is invading them has enemies all to willing to supply the natives with effective weaponry .
That is over 1200 years of history totally lost on the Soviets in 1979 when they sent in a massive number of troops to prop up the unpopular communist government in Kabul .
What followed was a ten year blood bath of death among the rocks .
For years , Soviet Hind helicopters would hunt in the valleys for any of the Afghan fighters .
Upon finding them , the guerillas would be mown down by cannon fire from the craft they called “ The Crocodile ” .
Then the CIA saw a chance to return the favor the Soviets had played on the United States during its involvement in Vietnam and began supplying the Afghan fighters with Stinger surface to air missiles .
So much for Soviet air superiority .
Stingers shot down 333 Soviet helicopters in the course of the ten year war .
The saddest part is the Soviets had just witnessed the USA ’s horrific ten year quagmire in Vietnam , but , like other groups in history , they figured it could n’t happen to them .
They were wrong .
The Soviets lost 15,000 men and billions of rubles worth of equipment to Afghanistan and they got nothing in return .
For the Afghans , the country was left devastated and ripe for a group called the Taliban to take over .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Public health officials are investigating the death of a University of Chicago researcher who studied plague bacteria and was found to have the microbe in his blood , university officials said on Monday .
Malcolm Casadaban , who died on September 13 , was researching a weakened strain of the plague bacteria Yersinia pestis .
Because it is missing key proteins , the strain is not normally harmful to people .
Medical center spokesman John Easton said Casadaban had the laboratory strain of Yersinia pestis in his blood , suggesting he had a form of the infection known as septicemic plague , which can kill even before the symptoms begin .
“ This organism has been studied in the lab for 40 - plus years .
This is the first time this has happened , ” Kenneth Alexander , an infectious diseases expert at the University of Chicago Medical Center , said in a telephone interview .
Public health officials have tracked down about 100 people who had contact with the researcher , and are giving them antibiotics as a precaution , but said there is no public health threat .
“ Nobody else is getting sick .
The incubation period is two to 10 days .
We ’re already at the outer limits of when it should rear it ’s head if it were there , ” Alexander said .
He said investigators plan to study the genetic sequence of the bacterium in the scientist ’s blood to see if it had somehow mutated , although early tests suggest it had not .
The most likely explanation , Alexander said , is that the researcher had an underlying genetic susceptibility to the bacterium , such as an excess of iron in the blood , that may have allowed the infection .
There are about 20 cases of plague in the United States each year , mostly in parts of California , Colorado , Utah , Arizona , Nevada and New Mexico .
It is carried by fleas that live on rodents such as prairie dogs and rats .
The last known case of person - to - person transmission of plague in the United States was in 1924 .
Plague is still a problem in the developing world , where about 3,000 cases are reported each year .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The White House is quietly talking about drafting formal health care legislation after allowing Congress to work on its own for months , CNN has learned .
President Obama has asked representatives what they mean when they call for a " robust " public option .
Multiple sources close to the process told CNN on Friday that while the plan is uncertain , the administration is preparing for the possibility of delivering its own legislation to Capitol Hill sometime after President Obama 's speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday .
One source called the possibility of new legislation a contingency approach if efforts by Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus , D - Montana , to craft a deal fall through .
Two sources familiar with the " Gang of 6 " bipartisan talks say Baucus could distribute a proposal to the other five negotiators as early as Saturday .
Democratic sources said Baucus is well aware that with the president 's Wednesday speech looming and the White House already looking at other avenues to pass a health - care bill , time is virtually up for this group , which had been negotiating intensely all summer .
A big open question is whether two Republicans , Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa and Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming , will support the bipartisan proposal .
White House and Democratic leadership sources have said for some time they do not think Grassley and Enzi will sign on .
Baucus is hoping to find the answer to that question by distributing a proposal this weekend , ahead of the group 's meeting Tuesday .
The White House emphasized Friday that no formal bill has been written .
" The president has been reviewing all of the various legislative proposals , but no decision has been made about whether formal legislation will be presented , " said Dan Pfeiffer , deputy communications director .
A source close to the White House said the administration is leaning toward dropping the public option , and continues to zero in on persuading Republican Sen. Olympia
Snowe to come on board .
Snowe has long pushed for a trigger option .
Watch why Obama faces dilemma on health care bill »
The source said the bill that would be presented to Snowe would leave out a public option but include a trigger provision that could lead to the introduction of a new government - run insurance plan under certain circumstances .
The legislation would cover most , though not all , of the 46 million uninsured Americans .
It would also include popular insurance reforms , such as ending the insurance industry practice of using pre-existing conditions to deny coverage .
This Democratic source also said that if the deal comes together , the key will be to successfully address the pushback from disaffected liberal legislators and congressional leaders .
President Obama took an initial step in that direction Friday afternoon , holding a conference call with some of the most liberal members of the House , who say they wo n't vote for a bill without a government - run insurance option .
Two congresswomen on the call said the president questioned them about how entrenched they are , even asking them to define what they mean when they call for a " robust " public option .
" I think he would like to convince us that there is something sort of that could lead to a public option that would satisfy us , and guess what ?
It doesn't , " Rep. Lynn Woolsey , D - California , said in a telephone interview after the conference call .
Woolsey , the chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus , insisted that the president did not explicitly warn them that he may have to give up a so - called public option in order to pass a bill through the more moderate Senate , but it seemed he was laying the groundwork .
Woolsey and Rep Barbara Lee , D - California , the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus , said they told the president point blank that they do not believe a health care proposal without a government run option is real reform .
" All of our caucuses are very unified about a robust public option , and that is essential in health care reform efforts , " Lee said in a separate phone interview after the conference call .
A Democratic source close to the process told CNN Friday that the White House was very conscious of the potential congressional fallout : " How do you [ get the deal passed ] without a revolt in the House ?
It can be done , but very delicately . "
The bottom line , said the source , is that the president would have to " move to the center " on the issue eventually , " and it 's not a bad thing to have liberals screaming at him . "
That development will help sell the deal to Americans and " convince them it's a good , moderate deal , if liberals are mad . "
CNN 's Jessica Yellin , Gloria Borger , Ed Henry and Dana Bash contributed to this report .
All About Barack Obama • Health Care Policy
Israel is correct that identifying combatants in a heavily populated area is difficult , and that Hamas fighters at times mixed and mingled with civilians .
But that reality did not lift Israel ’s obligation to take all feasible measures to minimize harm to civilians .
Our fact - finding team found that in many cases Israel could have done much more to spare civilians without sacrificing its stated and legitimate military aims .
It should have refrained from attacking clearly civilian buildings , and from actions that might have resulted in a military advantage but at the cost of too many civilian lives .
In these cases , Israel must investigate , and Hamas is obliged to do the same .
They must examine what happened and appropriately punish any soldier or commander found to have violated the law .
Unfortunately , both Israel and Hamas have dismal records of investigating their own forces .
I am unaware of any case where a Hamas fighter was punished for deliberately shooting a rocket into a civilian area in Israel  on the contrary , Hamas leaders repeatedly praise such acts .
While Israel has begun investigations into alleged violations by its forces in the Gaza conflict , they are unlikely to be serious and objective .
Absent credible local investigations , the international community has a role to play .
If justice for civilian victims cannot be obtained through local authorities , then foreign governments must act .
There are various mechanisms through which to pursue international justice .
The International Criminal Court and the exercise of universal jurisdiction by other countries against violators of the Geneva Conventions are among them .
But they all share one overarching aim : to hold accountable those who violate the laws of war .
They are built on the premise that abusive fighters and their commanders can face justice , even if their government or ruling authority is not willing to take that step .
Pursuing justice in this case is essential because no state or armed group should be above the law .
Western governments in particular face a challenge because they have pushed for accountability in places like Darfur , but now must do the same with Israel , an ally and a democratic state .
There 's the " official " unemployment rate , based on claims for unemployment benefits - and the more accurate U - 6 , which looks at discouraged workers who have stopped looking :
They were left out of the latest unemployment rate , as they are every month : millions of hidden casualties of the Great Recession who are not counted in the rate because they have stopped looking for work .
But that does not mean these discouraged Americans do not want to be employed .
As interviews with several of them demonstrate , many desperately long for a job , but their inability to find one has made them perhaps the ultimate embodiment of pessimism as this recession wears on .
Some have halted their job searches out of sheer frustration .
Others have decided it makes more sense to become stay - at - home fathers or mothers , or to go back to school , until the job market improves .
Still others have chosen to retire for now and have begun collecting Social Security or disability benefits , for which claims have surged .
[...]
The official jobless rate , which garners the bulk of attention from politicians and the public , was reported on Friday to have risen to 9.7 percent in August .
But to be included in that measure , which is calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics from a monthly nationwide survey , a worker must have actively looked for a job at some point in the preceding four weeks .
For an increasing number of people in this country who would prefer to be working , that is not the case .
It is difficult to assign an exact figure , because of limitations in the data collected by the bureau , but various measures that capture discouragement have swelled in this recession .
In the most direct measure of job market hopelessness , the bureau has a narrow definition of a group it classifies as “ discouraged workers . ”
These are people who have looked for work at some point in the past year but have not looked in the last four weeks because they believe that no jobs are available or that they would not qualify , among other reasons .
In August , there were roughly 758,000 discouraged workers nationally , compared with 349,000 in November 2007 , the month before the recession officially began .
The bureau also has a broader category of jobless it calls “ marginally attached to the labor force , ” which includes discouraged workers as well as those who have stopped looking because of other reasons , like school , family responsibilities or health issues .
But economists agree that many of these workers probably would have found a way to work in a good economy .

A three - judge panel today required Republican Norm Coleman to pay Democrat Al Franken $ 94,783 to cover court costs in the seven - week U.S. Senate trial .
The ruling , by the panel that heard the trial , approves an administrative decision last month by the Ramsey County clerk 's office .
Franken 's team had sought $ 161,510 , but a deputy county clerk rejected a request that Coleman pay Franken for his cost of obtaining public records that made up many of the exhibits in the trial and some other expenses .
Also not included are $ 16,000 in attorneys fees that Franken wants Coleman to pay for sanctions the panel imposed after Coleman 's lawyers failed to disclose information about Republican election judge Pamela Howell before her testimony .
Coleman will also have to pay interest on the $ 94,783 until the debt is paid .
Coleman 's lawyers once argued that payment of the court costs should be delayed pending the outcome of their appeal to the Minnesota Supreme Court .
But they did n't object when the administrative decision came out in May and did n't exercise their right to a court hearing on the matter .

That 's odd ... there are 2^30 ^ possible output lines , but when I tried to generate 1000 random ones , I only got 60 distinct outputs .
Why did that happen ?
One might think this is due to poor initial seeding of the random number generator ( due to the time not changing very much during the test ) , but this is not the case .
Attached is a fancier version of the program which reads an initial seed from / dev/ urandom ; it exhibits the same behavior .
This phenomenon is not too hard to explain .
It is ultimately due to a poor interaction between mkStdGen and split .
First , we need to know a bit about the design of System .
Random ( some statements simplified slightly for this discussion ) .
The state of the RNG consists of two Int32 s , s1 and s2 .
s , and .
The initial state produced by mkStdGen almost always has s2 equal to 1 .
( Extremely rarely , it might have s2 equal to 2 .
We 'll ignore this as it does n't affect the argument . )
equal to 1 .
( Extremely rarely , it might have equal to 2 .
We 'll ignore this as it does n't affect the argument . )
To generate a random 0 or 1 , we first generate a new state using some simple functions s 1 ' = next1( s1 ) , s 2 ' = next2( s2 ) .
( Note that s1 and s2 " evolve " independently . )
The random value returned is the lowest bit of s1 ' minus s 2 ' .
, .
( Note that and " evolve " independently . )
The random value returned is the lowest bit of minus .
Splitting the generator ( s1 , s2 ) yields the two generators ( s1+1 , next 2 ( s2 ) ) and ( next1 ( s1 ) , s2 - 1 ) .
Our program functions as follows .
Initialize the generator stored in the StdGen ( s1 is some varying value a , s2 is 1 ) .
( is some varying value , is 1 ) .
Repeatedly split the generator , replacing it with the first output , and use the second output to generate a 0 or 1 .
If we watch the StdGen while our program runs , we will see that s1 is incremented by 1 at each step , while s2 follows the fixed sequence 1 , next 2 ( 1 ) , next2 ( next 2 ( 1 ) ) , etc .
The 0 or 1 we output at the k th step is thus the lowest bit of next 1 ( next 1 ( a+ k - 1 ) ) minus b , , k , , , where b , , k , , is some fixed sequence .
And as k varies , next 1 ( next 1 ( a+ k - 1 ) ) turns out to be just an arithmetic sequence with fixed difference modulo a fixed prime so its lowest bits are extremely predictable even without knowing a .
This issue can be fixed to some extent , without breaking backwards compatibility , by adding another method ( besides mkStdGen ) to create a generator , which does not have predictable s2 , and using it to initialize the system RNG .
Last week the United Nations issued a report painting the Israelis as major violators of international law in the three - week Gaza war that began in December 2008 .
While many find the conclusion a bit unsettling or even bizarre , the report 's conclusion may be largely correct .
This says more about international law , however , than it does about the propriety of Israel 's conduct .
The rules of international law governing the use of force by victims of aggression are embarrassingly unjust and would never ...
I keep wondering what kind of dumbosity people associated with the Texas Board of Education can come up with next , and I keep being surprised at the depths of teh stoopid .
And this time it 's not creationism !
It 's NASA .
According to Houston Chronicle blogger Eric Berger , there 's a proposal to remove Neil Armstrong 's name from social studies textbooks .
Yes , you read that correctly .
The proposal was suggested by teachers and parents reviewing materials , because Armstrong " is not a scientist " .
Wha wha whaaaa ?
I could argue that technically that 's correct , since Armstrong 's an engineer , which is different than a research scientist .
Still , he did do some modicum of science when he walked on the frakking Moon .
I think maybe he should be given the benefit of the doubt on this one *
Plus , his foot was the first planted on another world , and maybe we 're not being too tough on students to know that .
And the irony that this is Texas !
They have a big city there called Houston which has some NASA ties , as in " Houston , Tranquility Base here .
The Eagle has landed . "
So , to the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills review team , this one 's for you :
Tip o' the ten gallon hat to BABlogee Earl Ware [ Update : the comments below are raging , and many people seem to have missed my point .
it has nothing at all to do with whether Armstrong is a scientist or not .
The point I am making is that he was the first person to walk on another world !
That 's why I bolded that phrase in the article above .
Leaving him out of the history book is madness , scientist or engineer or otherwise .
And another point : I understand history books cannot cover everything that ever happened ever .
But leaving this particular person out is -- stop me if you 've heard this before -- madness , especially when the people thinking of leaving him out are from Texas in the first place . ]
^* I 'll note , however , that Carl Sagan 's name will be left out of the textbook as well , though he was in fact a scientist , and a good one .
On the other hand , without knowing his relevance to the issues discussed in the textbook I 'm not too concerned about this -- it 's just that the BoE 's excuse for Armstrong strikes me as a little weak given this .
Washington , D.C. —
Family health care premiums rose an estimated 7.2 times faster than earnings for Ohio 's workers from 2000 through 2009 , according to a new report .
In that 10 - year period , family health insurance premiums rose by 84.1 percent , while median earnings rose by only 11.7 percent .
The report was issued by Families USA , a nonprofit organization for health care consumers that advocates for high - quality , affordable health care .
It is based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau , the U.S. Department of Labor , and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services .
Among the report 's findings are :
• The average annual health insurance premium for family coverage provided through the workplace ( employer and worker share of premiums combined ) rose from $ 6,596 to $ 12,145 .
• Between 2000 and 2009 , the median earnings of Ohio's workers rose from $ 25,017 to $ 27,936 .
And while the costs of premiums climbed , the coverage employees got was often reduced , offering fewer benefits and sometimes coupled with higher deductibles , copayments , and co-insurance .
Other employers have cut costs by placing limits on which employees are eligible for coverage or by eliminating coverage for spouses and children of employees .
" Rising health care costs threaten the financial well - being of families in Ohio and across the nation , " said Ron Pollack , executive director of Families USA .
" If health care reform does
not happen soon , more and more families will be priced out of the health coverage they used to take for granted . "
Medical debts were also a key contributor to families seeking bankruptcy protection .
The report found that prior to filing for bankruptcy , families attempt to balance budgets by dropping phone service , trimming food costs , and going without needed medical or dental care .
But more than half of all bankruptcies are related to medical costs .
The study also noted that companies were impacted by rising costs .
The percentage of U.S. companies that offered coverage to employees dropped from 69 percent to 63 percent .
Small businesses were the most likely to drop coverage .
Among other findings :
• For family health coverage in Ohio , the employer 's portion of annual premiums in the 2000 - 2009 period rose from $ 5,132 to $ 9,339 — an increase of $ 4,208 , or 82 percent .
• For family health coverage , the worker 's portion of annual premiums rose from $ 1,464 to $ 2,805 — an increase of $ 1,341 , or 91.6 percent .
• For individual health coverage , the employer 's portion of annual premiums rose from $ 2,064 to $ 3,408 — an increase of $ 1,343 , or 65.1 percent .
• For individual health coverage , the worker 's portion of annual premiums rose from $ 510 to $ 939 — an increase of $ 429 , or 84.2 percent .
Pollack said the report illustrates the need to reform health care coverage .
Without reform , " it will mean that businesses have a harder time staying competitive , and more and more families have to cope with stagnant wages and the loss of affordable health coverage . "
Correction 10 September 2009 : Since the Lost Land of the Volcano programme was broadcast on Tuesday 8 September , we 've learnt that this parrot may have been mis-identified .
Ornithologist Dr Jack Dumbacher now believes the parrots filmed may be yellow - capped pygmy parrots ( Micropsitta keiensis ) , not buff - faced pygmy parrots ( Micropsitta pusio ) .
At an average height of 9 to 9.5 cm , the closely - related yellow - capped pygmy parrots are slightly taller than buff - faced pygmy parrots .

The world 's smallest parrot has been filmed in the wild for the first time .
The tiny bird , which is not much bigger than an adult person 's thumb , is smaller than some of the insects with which it shares the forest .
An expedition team filming in Papua New Guinea for the BBC programme Lost Land of the Volcano caught two of the buff - faced pygmy parrots on camera .
Another adult , which weighs less than half an ounce , was also trapped by the expedition team 's bird expert .
On average , buff - faced pygmy parrots ( Micropsitta pusio ) stand less than 9cm tall and weigh 11.5g ( 0.41oz ) .
They are found across the northern lowlands of the island of New Guinea from the west to the southeastern tip , up to an altitude of around 800 m .
Males and females look similar , but females have less prominent markings on the head .
The birds have green feathers with yellowish plumage on their underparts ; while their cheeks , face , and crown are more buff - coloured , hence their name .
BBC wildlife cameraman Gordon Buchanan first discovered a tiny nest belonging to two parrots deep within pristine rainforest .
The birds nest in termite mounds , using their beaks and claws to dig their way in before laying eggs in the hole created .

Advertisement Buchanan staked out the nest from within a camouflaged hide , and was rewarded after a long wait when two birds returned .
He filmed the pair at their nest entrance , as the male and female reinforced their bond by rubbing against one another .
Later , another parrot was trapped unharmed by Dr Jack Dumbacher , an ornithologist from the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco , US , who had accompanied the BBC expedition team .
Buff - faced pygmy parrots do not eat fruit and nuts but lichen and fungi .
However , so little is still known about their dietary habits that it has proved difficult to rear the birds in captivity .
During the expedition , the team also managed to sight a rare Salvadore 's duck ( Salvadorina waigiuensis ) , a bird that is adapted to living in fast jungle streams .
The Salvadore 's duck , or Salvadore 's teal as it is also known , is the only duck species endemic to the island of New Guinea .
The International Union for the Conservation of Nature lists the bird as Vulnerable , and its total population may be slowly declining .
Other birds sighted included fruit doves that were completely naive to people , suggesting they had never been hunted in the past , and a king bird of paradise , with its crimson feathers , violet - coloured feet and a pair of tail streamers each ending with an emerald disc .
Broadcast of The Lost Land of the Volcano series will begin on BBC One on Tuesday 8 September at 2100 BST .

While the Internet may know no borders , the U.S Government does .
At it happens , numerous export controls from the Commerce and Treasury departments cast a long shadow over the software industry , but Mozilla has secured a critical exemption that could have a broad impact on the open source movement .
" We really could n't accept the notion that these government rules could jeopardize the participatory nature of an open source project so we sought to challenge it , " Mozilla General Counsel Harvey Anderson told InternetNews.com .
" We argued that First Amendment free speech rights would prevail in this scenario .
The government took our filing and then we got back a no-violation letter , which is fantastic . "
Anderson explained that there are export and sanction rules that prohibit the export and sharing of certain technologies .
Vendors with normal software containing encryption are required to file for a license exception , but that regulation offers an exemption to open source vendors .
However , that exemption is nullified if the source code is distributed to any of the countries on the U.S embargo list , such as Cuba , Iran or North Korea .
Under the open source export exemption , the project is n't supposed to have knowledge of distribution to any of the embargoed countries , Anderson said .
During a recent Firefox download event , Mozilla posted a map on its
Web site showing where downloads were occurring .
Anderson said it became clear that a substantial number of downloads were coming from Iran .
Mozilla then had knowledge that it was exporting to Iran , which could have put it in violation of the U.S export regulations , exposing the firm to criminal and financial penalties .
At that point , Mozilla made a voluntary disclosure to federal authorities in the hopes of securing a no-violation letter .
" What it really came down to is that these regulations could cripple the way an open source project works , " Anderson said .
" At its very heart , open source is participatory and if the ruling went against us it would limit participation , and that would be a terrible consequence . "
Anderson said that the no-violation letter , which affirmed that Mozilla 's disclosures are permitted under U.S. rules , is a win for both the firm and the larger open source movement .
" What I think it means is that the government made the right decision by respecting free speech rights and open source projects and the value that they provide , " Anderson said .
" So the government bought into our argument that writing code is free speech , which really means that people around the world can engage in this kind of speech through open source projects . "
Other options
Short of the no-violation letter , Mozilla could have gone a few different routes to get around the export regulations .
Mozilla potentially could have simply blocked users from the embargoed countries from downloading Firefox .
It also could have put the download servers in a different country .
But for Mozilla , those were not attractive options .
" We thought that would be a terrible outcome to block users based on where they are , " Anderson said .
" When we look out at the world we do n't see nationals of one country or another .
We see a community and a user base .
The notion of blocking by IP was offensive .
That 's a brute force way to solve the problem . "
For Mozilla , the root of the issue is about participation , inviting people anywhere in the world to contribute to an open source project .
Free speech
While Mozilla 's disclosure to the U.S government was limited to Firefox , Anderson believes that the no-violation letter has broader implications .
" I would interpret this no-violation to apply to Mozilla Thunderbird and other open source projects , " Anderson said .
" Obviously folks should get their own legal counsel , but I think that there is a broader legal principle here .
That is if you really are open source , participation by individuals around the world -- irrespective of where -- they are does not create a violation . "
That said , Anderson added that there are certain things that he remains cautious about .
Whereas the distribution of source code appears to have won a regulatory exemption , direct commerce with nationals in embargoed countries that are subject to U.S sanction rules is a different issue .
In Anderson 's view , the U.S export rules still apply to open source organizations .
It 's just that they do n't prohibit the specific activities that surround the open source exchange of information and technology .
Even though the no-violation letter is important to Mozilla and the open source community , Anderson does not see it as a precedent in a legal sense .
" This is an application of the regulations and case law that gave us a result , " he said .
" ' Precedent ' is a pretty big word that is heavily weighted .
But it 's a good result that is telling . "

Stop chatting and start innovating ( Image : Solent News / Rex Features )
IT ’S a dirty job , but someone ’s got to do it : for innovation to thrive on the internet , we must break up the very social networks that the web has made possible .
Previous research has shown that certain patterns of social interaction make radical innovation more likely .
Bold ideas are typically incompletely formed when first conceived and easily shot down by criticism .
Hence , they emerge more readily in communities in which individuals work mostly in small and relatively isolated groups , giving their ideas time and space to mature .

It is not unusual during a full season of racing to hear about a pro cyclist or two breaking a clavicle or other bone in a multi- rider pile - up .
But is there something inherent to cycling that increases your risk for developing a break when you hit the pavement hard ?
A growing body of research indicates that being fit through cycling training alone does not guarantee optimal bone density .
Cycling only may be bad for your bones .
Low bone density is a serious health concern .
Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass and deterioration of bone tissue over time .
This leads to fragile bones and increased risk of fracture of the hip , spine , and wrist .
Osteopenia , or sub-normal bone density , precedes osteoporosis .
This lower bone mass can increase your risk of getting a fracture .
Even if you put in plenty of hard training on the bike , recent studies point to the nature of cycling , such as lack of weight bearing exercise , as being the culprit .
Bone Building tips Add - in weight bearing exercise such as resistance training or running to your training program year round .
Aim for at least 1,000 mg calcium daily .
Foods and portions providing300 mg daily :
Milk , 8 ounces ;
Yogurt , 8 ounces ;
Swiss cheese , 1 ounce 200 mg daily :
Cheddar cheese , 1 ounce ;
Colby cheese , 1 ounce ,
Mozzarella , 1 ounce ,
Broccoli , 1 cup cooked ;
Collard greens , 1 cup cooked ,
Bok choy , 1 cup cooked 100 mg daily :
Cottage cheese , 1 cup ;
Dried beans , 1 cup cooked ;
Orange , 1 large
If you cannot consume 1,000 mg daily from food , consider adding fortified products such as calcium - fortified orange juice .
Check labels of products consumed regularly such as recovery drinks and energy bars for calcium content .
Add in a calcium supplement of 500 mg daily if your food intake is not adequate or if you need higher amounts of calcium due to existing low bone mass .
Increase intake of food sources of vitamin D such as fortified milk and fatty fish .
Most cyclists can safely soak up 15 min of direct sunlight three times weekly to produce vitamin D from sunlight , but consider a supplement during the winter months or year round .
Aim for 800 IU daily .
Cigarette smoking and excess alcohol intake can negatively affect bone mass .
Hormone status can affect bone mass .
It is established in female athletes that inadequate caloric intake can negatively affect hormone levels , while more data is needed on male athletes .
Earlier research has measured that adult male cyclists have lower bone mineral density than age - matched controls , particularly in masters racers with a long history of exclusive training in cycling ; adolescent male cyclists also have lower bone density than expected .
Besides the immediate consequence of traumatic bone fractures , cyclists with low bone mineral density put themselves at risk for osteoporosis at a young age .
These outcomes and a growing body of evidence should convince male cyclists to pay attention to training and nutrition strategies that maximize bone mass .
The data
One recent study from the University of Oklahoma compared the bone mass of competitive club and professional male road cyclists , most in their late 20 ’s to early 30’s , to men that matched them in age and body mass and who exercised recreationally .
DEXA bone scans indicated the cyclists had lower bone density in the spine compared to controls .
About one - fourth of the cyclists had bone density scores classified as osteopenia , while 9 percent had the more severe osteoporosis .
Researchers could not relate these results to testosterone levels ( a bone regulating hormone in men ) or calcium intake , which was actually higher in the cyclists than in the controls , and averaged about 1,500 mg daily , well above recommended guidelines for men .
Lower bone density was not seen at the hip site , possibly because cyclists experience greater mechanical loading at the hip than the spine .
Another recent study from the University of Colorado also produced concerning results .
Researchers measured bone density in fourteen competitive male cyclists for one year to determine how bone mass may change over the course of a season devoted exclusively to cycling .
Similar studies with triathletes and track and flied athletes have generally found no change or positive changes in bone mass in 6 to 12 months of training and competition .
Bone mass was found to decrease significantly from the pre-season to off - season in several locations , including the hip , femur , neck , and lumbar spine .
Bone mass remained below starting levels in the 3 month off - season period , suggesting that years of competitive cycling can result in progressive bone loss .
Calcium supplements are ineffective
As a sidebar to this study , the cyclists were supplemented with either 1500 mg or 250 mg of calcium citrate daily to augment their daily calcium intake of 700 to 800 mg or so .
The 1,500 mg dose was selected to maintain a positive daily calcium balance .
While it is above the recommended amounts for men , skin losses of calcium via sweat are estimated at 124 mg / hour of exercise .
Potentially , calcium sweat losses over a four - hour ride could exceed 500 mg , contributing to calcium imbalance .
However , this supplementation did not affect the rate of bone loss between groups indicating that risk factors other than nutrition played a role .
Data on subjects from the study also indicated that blood 25 - OH , vitamin D levels were at 30 ng / ml or less , indicating that vitamin D status , a vitamin essential to calcium absorption , may have been less than optimal .
The low impact of cycling exclusively , with no other cross- training can increase your risk for developing low bone density .
One study that compared the bone density of cyclists , runners , and weight lifters , found that cyclists had lower bone density than the other two groups .
Triathletes have been found to modestly increase bone mass over the season .
It ’s all about cross-training .
“ Cyclists should be aware that repetitive impact activity is very important for maximizing bone mass , ” said Kevin Shea , MD of Intermountain Orthopedic in Boise , Idaho .
“ They should consider adding weight training and running to their program , and do these activities year round , not just during the off - season . ”
Low bone density does increase your risk of getting a fracture , so if you have any concerns about your bone mass , consider getting a bone density scan to establish some baseline data .
If you have a slighter build or a family history of low bone density , your risk is increased .
Older cyclists may have even lower bone density and a higher risk of fracture even without the trauma of a crash .
Female cyclists are at even greater risk of developing low bone density , and bone scans can be important in identifying this early on .
Cyclists heavily focused on their race performance also spend many hours on the bike sweating .
Sweat contains a number of minerals other than the more obvious sodium , including calcium .
Your calcium sweat losses could add up to several hundred milligrams ( mg ) over a long ride and increase your calcium requirements .
Men are typically advised to obtain 800 mg daily and women about 1,200 mg , though cyclist with low bone mass or at risk could increase their intake calcium intake from food and supplements to 1,500 mg daily .
Vitamin D is essential to bone health , and while sunshine is an excellent source , wise use of sunscreen can block vitamin D production and food sources are limited .
Many multivitamins contain anywhere from the daily value of 400 International Units ( IU ) up to the more likely effective and appropriate dose of 800 to 1,000 IU daily .
Recommendations for these two important bone building nutrients need to be individualized to each cyclist ’s current bone mineral density and risk factors and blood vitamin D status .
Body mass may also play an important role .
Many cyclists , despite churning out hundreds or thousands of miles each year , watch their caloric intake closely in hopes of staying light and lean for climbs .
Subpar energy intake could have an impact on bone loss in men , just as it can in women , through an impact on the particular sex hormones that affect bone mass in each gender .
More research on men is needed , though low testosterone levels have been measured in male endurance athletes .
When the US Copyright Office first heard about the proposed Google Books settlement , it found the idea a " positive development . "
Then , after reading the fine print , it changed its collective mind , deciding instead that Google was really out to rewrite US copyright law through the courts .
Marybeth Peters , the Register of Copyrights , today explained to Congress ( PDF ) her office 's objections to what Google hoped to do :
But as we met with the parties , conversed with lawyers , scholars and other experts , and began to absorb the many terms and conditions of the settlement — a process that took several months due to the length and complexity of the documents — we grew increasingly concerned .
We realized that the settlement was not really a settlement at all , in as much as settlements resolve acts that have happened in the past and were at issue in the underlying infringement suits .
Instead , the so - called settlement would create mechanisms by which Google could continue to scan with impunity , well into the future , and to our great surprise , create yet additional commercial products without the prior consent of rights holders ...
Allowing Google to continue to scan millions of books into the future , on a rolling schedule with no deadline , is tantamount to creating a private compulsory license through the judiciary .
This objection from the top US copyright authority certainly does n't help Google 's chances of legalizing its massive book scanning project .
Peters does n't like the fact that the proposed settlement covers far more than Google 's past behavior — it covers all books published before January 5 , 2009 , whether they have already been scanned or not .
In addition to covering past behavior , then , the settlement would allow the company to continue scanning for decades , if that 's how long it takes to digitize every volume published before 2009 .
To Peters , this essentially creates a compulsory copyright license for all books published before this year ; though there is an opt - out mechanism , the presumption is that Google can scan any book and that it is protected from liability for doing so .
Such a compulsory license for books is n't necessarily a bad thing ; Peters told Congress that it was " an interesting proposition . "
But she also said that it was Congress ' call to make and always had been .
Creating such a default right to all existing books went beyond what was proper for the judiciary and was an end run around Congressional authority .
This was a charge that Google 's David Drummond was at pains to rebut .
He spoke repeatedly in his testimony about preserving " Congress 's role in setting copyright policy . "
" The suggestion that the settlement usurps the role of Congress to set copyright policy because the suit took the form of a class action is flatly wrong , " he added , pointing out that Congress had creating the class action system and arguing that this was a proper application of it .
Drummond 's remarks were also peppered with the sort of idealistic talking points about " access to knowledge " and freeing " trapped " information and concluding that " something far greater for human knowledge is at stake . "
Hearing his remarks with no previous knowledge of the company , one would be hard - pressed to realize that it was one of the largest Internet behemoths in the world .
" We are a new entrant , starting with zero market share " in the bookselling world said Drummond , before chalking up corporate opposition to a fear of competition rather than anything more principled .
Still , Google announced a concession today to ease concerns of its rivals over the settlement : allowing other companies to sell access to Google 's scanned works .
" Google will host the digital books online , " said the company , " and retailers such as Amazon , Barnes & Noble or your local bookstore will be able to sell access to users on any Internet - connected device they choose .
Retailers can also pursue their own digitization efforts of out - of - print books in parallel . "
A Starbucks employee prepares a drink for a customer in their store on Sao Paulo 's Alameda Santos June 11 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Rickey Rogers
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Coffee chain Starbucks Corp , which for years raised prices without any customer pushback , said on Thursday that it is cutting prices for the first time on some drinks while boosting prices on others .
The company , which announced in April that it would join other restaurant operators in fine - tuning pricing amid weak consumer demand , will cut the price of popular beverages like small coffees and lattes by 5 to 10 cents in every market , spokeswoman Valerie O’Neil said .
Prices for large , complex drinks such as frappuccinos and macchiatos could go up by as much as 25 cents in some markets , but on average prices will increase between 10 and 15 cents , O’Neil said , without naming specific markets .
The changes are effective in some markets on Thursday and will be rolled out to the remainder of the United States in coming months .
Starbucks pricing varies from market to market .
Starbucks expanded rapidly during the housing boom and has been closing stores , cutting costs and introducing discounts to offset falling traffic .
At the same time , hamburger chain McDonald ’s Corp has begun focusing on coffee drinks as part of a wider beverage expansion .

What do you say to a man widely blamed for beating you , stealing your job and trying to have you thrown out of a 10th - floor window ?
Morgan Tsvangirai , prime minister of Zimbabwe , insists that he is now able to joke with his long - time opponent , President Robert Mugabe .
" Over a long period of time you start to develop some chemistry , " he says , leaning forward in a black armchair in his ministerial office .
" That 's where you can't just go in and talk about business , you actually have to talk about personal issues .
Sometimes it 's helpful to unlock the barriers that may exist between people . "
The democrat and the dictator are six months into southern Africa 's most curious marriage of convenience .
Their power - sharing agreement followed a bitterly contested election that robbed Tsvangirai of victory and left scores of his supporters dead .
Their two parties continue to fight , but Tsvangirai describes the odd couple 's meetings as " cordial … not acrimonious " .
He explains : " There are certainly many areas where we differ , but we agree to differ .
We communicate , we talk , we discuss , we do n't believe that there 's anything insurmountable to discuss … I 'm very free .
I 've decided that I will not keep anything to myself .
I will express it and express it forcefully if it affects my own constituency , my own party and the general thrust of the inclusive government . "
Recently , for example , Mugabe made a populist speech to assert Zimbabwe 's disdain for western help , in direct contravention of the policy agreed with Tsvangirai .
The prime minister used humour to defuse the tension by remarking : " Well , your statement was quite predictable . "
Mugabe , apparently , laughed it off .
Tsvangirai has proved doubters wrong simply by still being here and holding together the fragile compromise .
The unity government has rescued the economy from the brink and slowly put schools and hospitals back in some semblance of working order , though the headaches that remain are legion .
Plenty of sceptics believe the president , who retains the " hard power " over the army , police and law courts , is bending the prime minister to his will .
Tsvangirai insists , however , that the man who has ruled Zimbabwe with an iron fist for 29 years is no longer the main obstacle to democracy .
" This is a perpetual suspicion of Mugabe , " he says .
" It 's a template .
People can't believe that Mugabe has any capacity to change .
It 's an inherent mistrust and it's nothing to do with what we are trying to build . "
So does Mugabe , even at 85 , have the capacity to change ?
" I have no doubt he himself is committed to see this through .
I have no doubt that perhaps there could be people in his own party or other elements who have reservations about it , but so far I think we are moving to achieve those incremental gains . "
He continues : " You must understand Mugabe 's political character has always been a character of denial , shifting blame for his own shortcomings .
But it 's always good to have a legacy , and I 'm sure that for him , it is the positive aspects of his life that he wants to take , not to be reminded about the negative aspects . "
Last year , it is estimated that about 200 of Tsvangirai 's supporters in the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) were murdered in violence perpetrated in the name of Mugabe 's Zanu - PF .
And more than 200 people were massacred when troops seized control of diamond fields in the eastern Marange district .
Yet Mugabe apparently tries to laugh off his global infamy .
" He jokes about it .
He says , ' People say I 'm a tyrant . '
So what do you think of yourself ?
He says , ' I 'm not a tyrant . ' …
We do n't ignore what has happened .
Sometimes those things are facts on the ground which have characterised him . "
Tsvangirai himself was once almost hurled from a 10th - floor window by men thought to be from Zimbabwe 's secret service .
He has faced three more attempts on his life and been repeatedly beaten and arrested .
It is widely considered that Mugabe stole the elections from him in 2002 and again in 2008 .
How , then , does the 57 - year - old bring himself to now sup with the devil ?
He replies : " What is reconciliation without that ?
Reconciliation is a measure of tolerance across the very serious political divide that has existed in this country .
How can we stand up as leaders and call for national unity when between us we do n't relate to each other ? "
Tsvangirai admits that Zanu - PF 's influence over the judiciary remains problematic but dismisses fears that continuing arrests of MDC MPs will threaten the party 's parliamentary majority , saying that he will simply put up more MPs in their place .
He is equally sanguine about the threat of assassination , despite his finance minister , Tendai Biti , having received a 9 mm bullet in the post last month .
" Those threats I do n't think will go overnight .
There are people who feel threatened by the very existence of the inclusive government : it threatens their patronage , it threatens their benefactors , so naturally they react . "
Conspiracy theories continue to swirl around the car crash , less than a month after he became prime minister , in which Tsvangirai was hurt and his wife , Susan , was killed .
He insists it was an accident .
Tsvangirai 's conciliatory attitude has led to criticism , not least from within his own ranks , that he has conceded too much ground to Mugabe , sacrificing change for the facade of unity .
Sceptics prophesy that , come the next election , violence will flare up again and the power - sharing agreement will be worthless .
Tsvangirai vehemently rejects the charge .
" I 'm not bending over backwards .
This is a shared compromise .
It has never been meant to be winner takes all …
It 's not a perfect marriage .
It 's a marriage that is meant to ensure that this country moves forward and so , yes , frustrations will be there .
" But let 's not miss the goal … We will keep our eye on the ball until such time as we are going to have an election which is free and fair . "

Presentar� ma�ana la SHCP , como parte de su paquete econ�mico , una propuesta para captar recursos adicionales que se canalizar�n en programas sociales
Ciudad de M�xico | Lunes 07 de septiembre de 2009

La Secretar�a de Hacienda y Cr�dito P�blico ( SHCP ) prev� incluir un " Impuesto contra la pobreza " en el paquete econ�mico 2010 que presentar� este martes a la C�mara de Diputados , el cual permitir�a captar recursos adicionales que se canalizar�an a programas sociales .
De acuerdo con diputados federales y senadores de varios partidos , �sta es una alternativa al Impuesto al Valor Agregado ( IVA ) en alimentos y medicinas , ya que gravar�an diversos productos de consumo b�sico , pero tambi�n se incluir�a una " canasta " de 15 o 20 productos , exentos del gravamen .
La propuesta tributaria buscar�a gravar con el 15 por ciento a los alimentos procesados como frijoles enlatados , sopas instant�neas , comida precocida , jugos envasados , entre otros productos .
Los legisladores confiaron que el nombre final de este nuevo gravamen a�n no se define .
Pero en esencia el gobierno federal buscar�a que la recaudaci�n que se obtenga sea " etiquetada " para el combate a la pobreza y que sea una opci�n tributaria para hacer frente a la ca�da de los ingresos petroleros y de otros impuestos .
El diputado federal del Partido del Trabajo ( PT ) , Mario Di Costanzo , consider� que esta propuesta busca revivir el llamado " IVA copeteado " que fue propuesto en el sexenio de Vicente Fox y el cual fue rechazado en su momento por la C�mara de Diputados .
" Adem�s de esta propuesta fiscal , se prev� que el proyecto econ�mico para 2010 que elabor� la Secretar�a de Hacienda incluya aumentos a productos como la gasolina , el gas y la electricidad " , a�adi� Di Costanzo en entrevista .
A su vez , el presidente de la Comisi�n de Hacienda del Senado , Isabel Trejo , perfil� diversas modalidades tributarias , pero entre los par�metros m�s importantes se encuentra la posibilidad de que el Ejecutivo federal proponga un d�ficit fiscal de entre 1 por ciento y 1.2 por ciento para 2010 .
El legislador del Partido Acci�n Nacional ( PAN ) expuso que las proyecciones del gobierno federal se ubicar�an en un crecimiento de la econom�a en alrededor de 2 por ciento para el pr�ximo a�o .
Reconoci� que prev� un " incremento muy peque�o " en el precio de servicios y productos p�blicos y una revisi�n a las tasas de diversos impuestos como IVA , ISR , IETU , IEPS e IDE .
En relaci�n al llamado " Impuesto contra la pobreza " , Trejo coment � que lo que debe privilegiar es que la recaudaci�n adicional que se obtenga por cualquier modificaci�n tributaria debe estar " etiquetada " para fortalecer el combate a la marginaci�n , a programas sociales y a la generaci�n de empleos .
De acuerdo con el diputado federal del Partido Revolucionario Institucional ( PRI ) , Jorge Carlos Ram�rez Mar�n , se prev� que la Secretar�a de Hacienda presente el paquete econ�mico el martes por la tarde , es decir , una vez que haya concluido la sesi�n ordinaria en San L�zaro .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. health officials strengthened their recommendations for seasonal flu vaccines on Friday , saying all children aged 6 months to 18 years should be immunized -- especially because of the H1N1 flu pandemic .
The seasonal vaccine provides little or no protection against H1N1 swine flu , but immunization will help prevent people from being infected with both at once and can help minimize the effects of the pandemic on schools , workplaces and the economy in general , health experts say .
“ Vaccination against seasonal influenza should begin as soon as vaccine is available and continue throughout the influenza season , ” Dr. Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told reporters in a telephone briefing .
“ At this point , 83 percent of the population is recommended to get an annual flu vaccine , ” she said .
“ Unfortunately , only about 40 percent of the U.S. population received the flu vaccine last year . ”
Last year the CDC “ encouraged ” all children to be vaccinated .
Now it “ recommends ” this -- advice that does not have the force of law but that can affect what states and insurers do .
On Thursday U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials said they would work with companies and the National Institutes of Health to quickly test experimental H1N1 vaccines , with the aim of getting a vaccination plan underway as soon as possible .
Schuchat said H1N1 was still circulating .
“ We are continuing to see transmission here in the United States in places like summer camps , some military academies and similar settings where people from different parts of the country come together , ” she said .
“ I think this is very unusual to have this much transmission of influenza during the ( summer ) and I think it ’s a testament to how susceptible people are to this virus . ”
TIP OF THE ICEBERG
The CDC said 43,771 cases of H1N1 influenza had been officially confirmed , with 302 deaths .
“ But ... that ’s really just the tip of the iceberg , ” Schuchat said .
“ We believe there have been well over 1 million cases of the new H1N1 virus so far in the United States . ”
She said the CDC would no longer report cases and was working on better ways to estimate how many people had been infected .
The pandemic spread globally in less than two months and has infected people in 160 countries , killing 800 people , the World Health Organization said .
The WHO numbers do not include the latest CDC count .
Schuchat said there is no indication the virus is any worse in one country than another .
“ There are differences in reporting .
In some places , we ’re hearing about only the severe cases .
In other places , we ’re hearing about illness that ’s in the community , ” she said .
She declined to call the pandemic “ mild ” and noted that people had died and many others had spent weeks in hospitals , sometimes on ventilators .
She said the CDC was also watching for more cases of seizures .
The agency reported on Thursday on four children who suffered seizures from H1N1 infection but who recovered .
Schuchat advised against summer camps offering the antiviral drug oseltamivir -- Roche AG and Gilead Sciences Inc ’s Tamiflu -- to prevent infection among children .
“ At this point we ’re strongly recommending them for treatment rather than for prevention , ” she said .
To prevent flu , the drugs should be reserved for people at high risk of complications who have been in close contact with a known case , she said .
Here ’s a letter Barrack Obama wrote pack in February of 2008 .
It shows a lot of promise that contradict what is happening now .
What happened to our rights ?
Thoughts ?
As your President , I will use the bully pulpit to urge states to treat same - sex couples with full equality in their family and adoption laws .
I personally believe that civil unions represent the best way to secure that equal treatment .
But I also believe that the federal government should not stand in the way of states that want to decide on their own how best to pursue equality for gay and lesbian couples — whether that means a domestic partnership , a civil union , or a civil marriage .
Unlike Senator Clinton , I support the complete repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) – a position I have held since before arriving in the U.S. Senate .
While some say we should repeal only part of the law , I believe we should get rid of that statute altogether .
Federal law should not discriminate in any way against gay and lesbian couples , which is precisely what DOMA does .
I have also called for us to repeal Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell , and I have worked to improve the Uniting American Families
Act so we can afford same - sex couples the same rights and obligations as married couples in our immigration system .
Equality is a moral imperative .
That ’s why throughout my career , I have fought to eliminate discrimination against LGBT Americans .
In Illinois , I co-sponsored a fully inclusive bill that prohibited discrimination on the basis of both sexual orientation and gender identity , extending protection to the workplace , housing , and places of public accommodation .
In the U.S. Senate , I have co-sponsored bills that would equalize tax treatment for same - sex couples and provide benefits to domestic partners of federal employees .
And as president , I will place the weight of my administration behind the enactment of the Matthew Shepard Act to outlaw hate crimes and a fully inclusive Employment Non-Discrimination
Act to outlaw workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity .
I ’m running for President to build an America that lives up to our founding promise of equality for all – a promise that extends to our gay brothers and sisters .
It ’s wrong to have millions of Americans living as second - class citizens in this nation .
And I ask for your support in this election so that together we can bring about real change for all LGBT Americans .
The next president must also address the HIV / AIDS epidemic .
When it comes to prevention , we do not have to choose between values and science .
While abstinence education should be part of any strategy , we also need to use common sense .
We should have age - appropriate sex education that includes information about contraception .
We should pass the JUSTICE Act to combat infection within our prison population .
And we should lift the federal ban on needle exchange , which could dramatically reduce rates of infection among drug users .
In addition , local governments can protect public health by distributing contraceptives .
We also need a president who ’s willing to confront the stigma – too often tied to homophobia – that continues to surround HIV / AIDS .
I confronted this stigma directly in a speech to evangelicals at Rick Warren ’s Saddleback Church , and will continue to speak out as president .
That is where I stand on the major issues of the day .
But having the right positions on the issues is only half the battle .
The other half is to win broad support for those positions .
And winning broad support will require stepping outside our comfort zone .
If we want to repeal DOMA , repeal Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell , and implement fully inclusive laws outlawing hate crimes and discrimination in the workplace , we need to bring the message of LGBT equality to skeptical audiences as well as friendly ones – and that ’s what I ’ve done throughout my career .
I brought this message of inclusiveness to all of America in my keynote address at the 2004 Democratic convention .
I talked about the need to fight homophobia when I announced my candidacy for President , and I have been talking about LGBT equality to a number of groups during this campaign – from local LGBT activists to rural farmers to parishioners at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta , where Dr. Martin Luther King once preached .
Just as important , I have been listening to what all Americans have to say .
I will never compromise on my commitment to equal rights for all LGBT Americans .
But neither will I close my ears to the voices of those who still need to be convinced .
That is the work we must do to move forward together .
It is difficult .
It is challenging .
And it is necessary .
Americans are yearning for leadership that can empower us to reach for what we know is possible .
I believe that we can achieve the goal of full equality for the millions of LGBT people in this country .
To do that , we need leadership that can appeal to the best parts of the human spirit .
Join with me , and I will provide that leadership .
Together , we will achieve real equality for all Americans , gay and straight alike .

Advertisement Poland has been holding a day of commemorations to mark the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II .
Leaders from 20 countries laid candles during a ceremony near Gdansk .
Earlier , Polish President Lech Kaczynski criticised the former Soviet Union over responsibility for the war .
His words added to an ongoing row with Moscow , although Russian PM Vladimir Putin said he hoped the two countries could settle their differences .
Mr Kaczynski said Poland had received a " stab in the back " from the former Soviet Union when it invaded and occupied the east of the country as the German army was advancing westwards .
He again criticised the non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany in the early years of the conflict , saying it was about dividing Europe .
ANALYSIS Jonny Dymond
BBC News , Gdansk
There was , of course , talk of heroism in the speeches of the Mayor of Gdansk , President Lech Kaczynski and Prime Minister Donald Tusk .
But for Poland , perhaps more than any other nation on earth , World War II was nothing but a catastrophe .
By the war 's end , 5 m - 6 m Poles had been killed - a greater proportion of its population than any other country .
Poland remembers its catastrophe Mr Kaczynski recalled the Katyn massacre in which 20,000 Polish officers were killed by Soviet forces , saying it was an act of chauvinism and in revenge for Polish independence .
But he also praised the Soviet Union 's sacrifice against Nazi Germany .
Speaking at the ceremony on Westerplatte peninsula , Mr Putin highlighted that nearly half of the estimated 50 million people who died during the war were from the Soviet Union .
The Russian prime minister said all pacts that European states agreed with Nazi Germany were " morally unacceptable " , including the 1939 Soviet accord .
He added that Russia accepted its mistakes of the past .
Occupation Differing historical interpretations of events at the start of the war though have caused a strain in relations between Poland and Russia .
Turning his attention to that controversy , Mr Putin said : " We seriously hope that Russian and Polish relationships will rid themselves of the layers of the past . "
Earlier , a dawn ceremony had marked the time when a German battleship fired the first shots on a Polish fort in 1939 .

The day began with Mr Kaczynski and his Prime Minister Donald Tusk joining war veterans beside a monument to the heroes of Westerplatte at 0445 ( 0245 GMT ) .
The ceremony marked the exact time on 1 September 1939 when the German battleship Schleswig - Holstein opened fire at point - blank range on the fort .
At the same time , the German Wehrmacht invaded Poland from east , west and south .
The attacks triggered Britain and France 's declaration of war against Germany two days later .
Just two weeks later , in mid-September 1939 , the Soviet armies occupied eastern Poland .
Speaking at the dawn ceremony , Mr Kaczynski said : " On 17 September ...
Poland received a stab in the back ...
This blow came from Bolshevik Russia . "
He added : " Glory to the heroes of Westerplatte , glory to all of the soldiers who fought in World War II against German Nazism , and against Bolshevik totalitarianism . "
In his address , Mr Tusk said the lessons of history should not be forgotten .
" We remember because we know well that he who forgets , or he who falsifies history , and has power or will assume power will bring unhappiness again like 70 years ago , " he said .
At the time of the attack by the Schleswig - Holstein - which was moored in the Polish harbour on a friendship visit - Gdansk was known as the free city of Danzig .
The 182 Polish troops defending the Polish fort were expected to resist for about 12 hours .
Despite coming under fire from the air , sea and land , they held out against a force of more than 3,000 Germans for seven days .
According to a survey published on Monday , Westerplatte is the most important symbol of Polish resistance in the whole of the war .
Two weeks after the German invasion , the Red Army invaded and annexed eastern Poland under terms agreed in the secret protocol of a Nazi -Soviet pact .

Pact that set the scene for war UK service to mark evacuations
In early 1940 , the Soviet secret services murdered more than 20,000 Polish officers in the forests around Katyn .
For 50 years Moscow blamed the Nazis and only admitted responsibility for the crime in 1990 .
Russian courts have ruled that Katyn cannot be considered a war crime and Moscow is still refusing to declassify documents about the massacre .
The temperature was raised further this week with accusations broadcast on Russian state TV which implied the USSR was justified in its invasion of Poland because Warsaw had been conspiring with Hitler against Moscow .

Some on the left see them as
radical and infinitely more dangerous
than the birthers .
As one leftwing blogger put it , " They are the fringe [ among ] the Birthers , the Teabaggers , the Tin Hatters , . . . the Racists , the Psychos , and just the plain ignorant . "
Who are the dastardly people who are now unhinging the left ?
They are the " Tenthers , " those who believe the 10th Amendment -- reserving to the states and the people all powers not delegated to the federal government nor prohibited to the states -- is n't dead letter .
America is seeing a reawakening of interest in the Constitution , particularly how it should limit government power .
People realize there is some foundational flaw with what 's happening in Washington , and are tired of feeling helpless .
When the President exceeds his powers , what 's to countermand him ?
When Congress succumbs to special interests , what can people do ?
When the courts create rights not found in the Constitution , and deny ones that exist , what 's the solution ?
When all three branches abdicate their role of providing checks and balances , what 's to stop the corruption that flows from authoritarianism ?
Americans view the Bill of Rights with an almost sacrosanct reverence of what is good and special about America .
The 10th Amendment is key to a structural view of limited federal government .
People are now beginning to realize it as a vital Amendment .
That it may be stale or dormant does not make it meaningless .
Liberals are just in their beginning phase of denigrating the conservatives and independents who now realize one reason why we have problems with abusive , corrupt government is that the 10th Amendment has been neglected .
But what 's to say one of the first ten Amendments is dead letter , as some on the left suggest for ideological reasons , yet be able to deny that weakening one Amendment weakens all of them ?
If that 's the ideological debate in which the left wants to engage , I say , bring it on .
As with nearly any ideological debate involving the Constitution , the left engages in hypocrisy .
As Michael Boldin of the Tenth Amendment Center does point out , some lefties have used 10th Amendment arguments for their causes .
September 25 , 2009 - The National
NAZARETH //
A local authority in Israel has announced that it is establishing a special team of youth counsellors and psychologists whose job it will be to identify young Jewish women who are dating Arab men and " rescue " them .
The move by the municipality of Petah Tikva , a city close to Tel Aviv , is the latest in a series of separate � and little discussed � initiatives from official bodies , rabbis , private organisations and groups of Israeli residents to try to prevent interracial dating and marriage .
In a related development , the Israeli media reported this month that residents of Pisgat Zeev , a large Jewish settlement in the midst of Palestinian neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem , had formed a vigilante - style patrol to stop Arab men from mixing with local Jewish girls .
Hostility to intimate relationships developing across Israel�s ethnic divide is shared by many Israeli Jews , who regard such behaviour as a threat to the state�s Jewishness .
One of the few polls on the subject , in 2007 , found that more than half of Israeli Jews believed intermarriage should be equated with " national treason " .
Since the state�s founding in 1948 , analysts have noted , a series of legal and administrative measures have been taken by Israel to limit the possibilities of close links developing between Jewish and Arab citizens , the latter comprising a fifth of the population .
Largely segregated communities and separate education systems mean that there are few opportunities for young Arabs and Jews to become familiarised with each other .
Even in the handful of " mixed cities " , Arab residents are usually confined to separate neighbourhoods .
In addition , civil marriage is banned in Israel , meaning that in the small number of cases where Jews and Arabs want to wed , they can do so only by leaving the country for a ceremony abroad .
The marriage is recognised on the couple�s return .
Dr Yuval Yonay , a sociologist at Haifa University , said the number of interracial marriages was " too small to be studied " .
" Separation between Jews and Arabs is so ingrained in Israeli society , it is surprising that anyone manages to escape these central controls . "
The team in Petah Tikva , a Jewish city of 200,000 residents , was created in direct response to news that two Jewish girls , aged 17 and 19 , were accompanying a group of young Arab men when they allegedly beat a Jewish man , Leonard Karp , to death last month on a Tel Aviv beach .
The older girl was from Petah Tikva .
The girls � involvement with the Arab youths has revived general concern that a once - firm taboo against interracial dating is beginning to erode among some young people .
In sentiments widely shared , Mr Hakak , a spokesman for Petah Tikva municipality , said " Russian girls " , young Jewish women whose parents arrived in Israel over the past two decades , since the former Soviet Union collapsed , were particularly vulnerable to the attention of Arab men .
Dr Yonay said Russian women were less closed to the idea of relationships with Arab men because they " did not undergo the religious and Zionist education " to which more established Israeli Jews were subject .
Mr Hakak said the municipality had created a hotline that parents and friends of the Jewish women could use to inform on them .
" We can�t tell the girls what to do but we can send a psychologist to their home to offer them and their parents advice , " he said .
Motti Zaft , the deputy mayor , told the Ynet website that the municipality was also cracking down on city homeowners who illegally subdivide apartments to rent them cheaply to single Arab men looking for work in the Tel Aviv area .
He estimated that several hundred Arab men had moved into the city as a result .
Petah Tikva�s hostility to Arab men mixing with local Jewish women is shared by other communities .
In Pisgat Zeev , a settlement of 40,000 Jews , some 35 Jewish men are reported to belong to a patrol known as " Fire for Judaism " that tries to stop interracial dating .
Unusually for a settlement , Pisgat Zeev has attracted a tiny but growing population of Arab families , both from East Jerusalem and from inside Israel .
Because Pisgat Zeev sits within Jerusalem�s municipal borders , Arabs with Israeli residency rights can live there as long as Jewish settlers are willing to rent to them .
One member , who identified himself as Moshe to the Jerusalem Post newspaper , said : " Our goal is to be in contact with these girls and try to explain to them the dangers of what they �re getting themselves into .
In the last 10 years , 60 girls from Pisgat Zeev have gone into [ Palestinian ] villages [ in the West Bank ] .
And most of them aren�t heard from after that . "
He denied that violence or threats were used against Arab men .
Last year , the municipality of Kiryat Gat , a town of 50,000 Jews in southern Israel , launched a programme in schools to warn Jewish girls of the dangers of dating local Bedouin men .
The girls were shown a video titled Sleeping with the Enemy , which describes mixed couples as an " unnatural phenomenon " .
Haim Shalom , head of the municipality�s welfare department , is filmed saying : " The girls , in their innocence , go with the exploitative Arab . "
In 2004 , posters sprang up all over the northern town of Safed warning Jewish women that dating Arab men would lead to " beatings , hard drugs , prostitution and crime " .
Safed�s chief rabbi , Shmuel Eliyahu , told a local newspaper that the " seducing " of Jewish girls was " another form of war " by Arab men .
Both Kiryat Gat and Safed�s campaigns were supported by a religious organisation called Yad L�achim , which runs an anti-assimilation team publicly dedicated to " saving " Jewish women .
According to its website , the organisation receives more than 100 calls a month about Jewish women living with Arab men , both in Israel and the West Bank .
It launches " military - like rescues [ of the women ] from hostile Arab villages " in co-ordination with the police and army .
" The Jewish soul is a precious , all - too - rare resource , and we are not prepared to give up on even a single one , " says the website .

The Great Depression had a silver lining : During that hard time , U.S. life expectancy actually increased by 6.2 years , according to a University of Michigan study published in the current issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Life expectancy rose from 57.1 in 1929 to 63.3 years in 1932 , according to the analysis by U - M researchers José A. Tapia Granados and Ana Diez Roux .
The increase occurred for both men and women , and for whites and non-whites .
" The finding is strong and counterintuitive , " said Tapia Granados , the lead author of the study and a researcher at the U - M Institute for Social Research ( ISR ) .
" Most people assume that periods of high unemployment are harmful to health . "
For the study , researchers used historical life expectancy and mortality data to examine associations between economic growth and population health for 1920 to 1940 .
They found that while population health generally improved during the four years of the Great Depression and during recessions in 1921 and 1938 , mortality increased and life expectancy declined during periods of strong economic expansion , such as 1923 , 1926 , 1929 , and 1936 - 1937 .
The researchers analyzed age - specific mortality rates and rates due to six causes of death that composed about two - thirds of total mortality in the 1930s : cardiovascular and renal diseases , cancer , influenza and pneumonia , tuberculosis , motor vehicle traffic injuries , and suicide .
The association between improving health and economic slowdowns was true for all ages , and for every major cause of death except one : suicide .
Although the research did not include analyses of possible causes for the pattern , Tapia Granados and Diez Roux offer some possible explanations about why population health tends to improve during recessions but not expansions .

" Working conditions are very different during expansions and recessions , " Tapia Granados said .
" During expansions , firms are very busy , and they typically demand a lot of effort from employees , who are required to work a lot of overtime , and to work at a fast pace .
This can create stress , which is associated with more drinking and smoking .
" Also , new workers may be hired who are inexperienced , so injuries are likely to be more common .
And people who are working a lot may also sleep less which is known to have implications for health .
Other health - related behaviors such as diet may also change for the worse during expansions . "
In recessions , Tapia Granados noted , there is less work to do , so employees can work at a slower pace .
There is more time to sleep , and because people have less money , they are less likely to spend as much on alcohol and tobacco .
In addition , economic expansions are also associated with increases in atmospheric pollution which has well - documented short - term effects on cardiovascular and respiratory mortality .
Other reasons that periods of economic expansion may be bad for health could include increases in social isolation and decreases in social support that typically occur when people are working more .
The researchers noted that their study examined the relation between recessions and mortality for the population as a whole , and not the effect of becoming unemployed on an individual person .
In fact , their results show that downturns in economic activity may have overall beneficial effects on the population , even if becoming unemployed has adverse health consequences for a given person .
" Social science is not physics , " Tapia Granados said .
" But regularities in the past allow us at least some confidence in forecasting the future .
Historical experience tells us that no particular deterioration of mortality is to be expected as a consequence of a recession beyond an increase in suicides which , although clearly important , is of small magnitude compared to the reduced number of fatalities from other causes . "
Other studies suggest that the relationship between population health and business cycles may be weakening , at least in the U.S. and in Japan , where the phenomenon of karoshi— sudden death from overwork among Japanese salarymen — dramatically illustrates the dangers of life in economic boom times .
Still , Tapia Granados hopes that a better understanding of the beneficial effects of recessions on health may perhaps contribute to the development of economic policies that enhance health and minimize or buffer adverse impacts of economic expansions .
And he cautions that the findings also suggest that suicide prevention services — often the casualties of budget cuts during economic downturns — are more important during bad times than ever .
The stretch of Fifth Avenue outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art  thronged by tourists but without a restaurant in sight  could be the most coveted location for selling a hot dog in New York .
The city once earned more than half a million dollars a year in vending rights from two hot dog carts in front of the museum .
Then , two years ago , a third vendor , Dan Rossi , nosed his cart onto the property , saying that as a disabled veteran , he had the right to be there without paying the city a dime .
Mr. Rossi has held his ground , but he has also inadvertently prepared the way for other veterans .
So this summer , visitors spilling out onto the plaza beneath the museum ’s soaring Corinthian columns have stumbled into not two or three carts , but a small flotilla .
On Friday , eight were drawn up around the broad stone steps , and not one of them was paying to be there .
Almost everyone knows that Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world .
Climbers from everywhere travel to Everest hoping to earn the distinction of climbing the " World 's Highest " .
The peak of Mount Everest is 8,848 meters ( 29,028 feet ) above sea level .
This high elevation gives Mount Everest the distinction of being the mountain with the highest altitude .
But not many people know about Mt Chimborazo in Ecuador with an altitude of 6,310 meters ( 20,703 feet ) , which is less than Mount Everest ; however , Chimborazo has the distinction of being the highest mountain above Earth 's center .
This is because Earth is not a sphere - it is an oblate spheroid .
As an oblate spheroid , Earth is widest at its equator .
Chimborazo is just one degree south of Earth 's equator and at that location it is 6,384 kilometers from Earth 's center or about 2 kilometers farther from Earth 's center than Mount Everest .
Ecuadorians find pride in this interesting fact .
Nonetheless , Chimborazo cannot compare in difficulty , lack of oxygen , nor in fame , to Mount Everest .
The Pittsburgh Pirates lost today , clinching a losing record this season .
That 's a sentence the good folks of Pittsburgh have read all too often this time of year .
Here 's a new sentence , then : The Pirates just set a record for futility .
The Pirates clinched their 17th consecutive losing season , breaking the record set by the Philadelphia Phillies from 1933 - 48 .
And it 's not just baseball : No NFL , NBA or NHL team ever has had 17 consecutive losing seasons .
The last time the Pirates had a winning season , in 1992 , their left fielder was the NL MVP .
Guy by the name of Barry Bonds , listed in the Pirates ' media guide that year at 6 - feet - 1 and 185 pounds .
In Bonds ' final season , in 2007 , the San Francisco Giants ' media guide listed him at 6 - 2 and 238 pounds .

MOSCOW , Russia ( CNN ) -- U.S. President Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev concluded a series of agreements Monday -- including one on nuclear arms reduction -- as part of a broader effort to strengthen ties between the one - time Cold War rivals .
President Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev met in Moscow on Monday .
The summit in Moscow was needed to help " reset " a relationship that , according to Obama , " has suffered from a sense of drift " in recent years .
" Too often , the United States and Russia only communicate on a narrow range of issues or let old habits within our bureaucracy stand in the way of our progress , " Obama said .
" President Medvedev and I are committed to leaving behind the suspicion and the rivalry of the past , so that we can advance the interests that we hold in common . "
Relations between Russia and the United States do not currently " correspond to their potential , " Medvedev said , which is problematic given the two countries ' " special responsibility for everything that is happening on our planet . "
On the most immediate challenge , working out an arms control agreement to replace the START I treaty which expires December 5 , the two presidents signed a joint understanding for a follow - on agreement to START that commits both parties to a legally binding treaty that will reduce nuclear weapons .
Watch Obama discuss arms control pact »
The joint understanding commits the United States and Russia to reduce their strategic warheads to a range of 1,500 to 1,675 , and their strategic delivery vehicles to a range of 500 to 1,100 .
Under the expiring START and the Moscow treaties the maximum allowable levels of warheads is 2,200 and the maximum allowable level of launch vehicles is 1,600 .
Russia has insisted on linking the arms control agreement to the controversial issue of a proposed U.S. missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic .
The presidents dealt separately with that issue , instructing their experts to work together to carry out a joint threat assessment , analyze ballistic missile threats in the world and prepare appropriate recommendations .
They also announced plans to conduct a joint review on possible cooperation to monitor the development of missile programs around the world .
Obama said the two leaders are discussing holding a global nuclear summit next year .
Watch Obama 's full opening statement in Russia »
Obama and Medvedev also pledged to strengthen cooperation to curb nuclear proliferation and prevent acts of nuclear terrorism .
In a joint statement on cooperation in Afghanistan , Russia agreed to allow up to 4,500 flights carrying U.S. military equipment and personnel through Russia for supplying U.S. troops in Afghanistan .
The two leaders also agreed on a work plan for resuming military - to - military cooperation , and agreed on a framework for the U.S. - Russia joint commission on prisoners of war and missing in action .
The United States and Russia also will create a bilateral presidential commission , headed by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov , to provide better structure to the bilateral relationship .
It will have a number of working groups on subjects as diverse as nuclear energy , drug trafficking , health and education .
The presidents also agreed to cooperate in the field of public health and medical science .
At their joint news conference , Obama said the two leaders had " frank discussion " on Georgia , with Obama telling the Russian president the territorial integrity of Georgia must be respected .
Obama said he trusts Medvedev to listen , negotiate and follow through on agreements .
Asked by an American correspondent " who is in charge in Russia ? " Obama said " his understanding " is that Medvedev is the president and Vladimir Putin is the prime minister .
He said his interest is in dealing with his counterpart , Medvedev , but also to reach out to all parts of Russian society .
He said he has a strong impression that Putin and Medvedev and are working closely together .

The AA says private parking enforcement is " out of control "
The practice of clamping cars parked on private land should be made illegal in England and Wales , according to the AA .
The motoring group claims one in 10 drivers has been clamped or fined by private enforcers , with no independent arbitration process .
It argued government proposals for greater self - regulation would not work .
Trade body the British Parking Association said the AA had not come up with a " credible " alternative but it would welcome working with the group .
The government has said it accepts that tougher rules are needed and new legislation will be introduced in 2010 .
Wheel clamping is already banned altogether in Scotland , while in Northern Ireland only unlicensed vehicles can be clamped .
' Money - raking '
The AA said the prevalence of " bad and immoral practices " among private parking firms in England and Wales was " shocking and unacceptable " , with some people being charged more than £ 500 to retrieve a towed car .
It cited the case of one woman who it said had pulled up in her car for just a few seconds only for it to be clamped while she sat in it with the engine still running .
It is so easy for private enforcers to use the DVLA 's vehicle database to obtain a car owner 's name and address that " anyone can now set themselves up and start to cash in " , the organisation said .
The public have absolutely no protection if a private parking firm acts unfairly
Paul Watters , the AA
Send us your comments
" The lure of uncontrolled money - raking is so great that some companies offer DIY packs , with signs that can be printed off the internet . "
Increasingly the punishment meted out to drivers was " frightening and often borders on criminality " , the AA said .
Paul Watters , the AA 's head of public affairs , said : " Private parking enforcement is big business generating millions of pounds and no - one notices and acts when the rules are broken .
" The public have absolutely no protection if a private parking firm acts unfairly - it is a civil matter and no - one is interested in helping . "
Mr Watters said one of the most serious problems was the lack of an independent arbitration process for people who believed they had been clamped or fined unfairly .
Code of practice
The AA said there were few rules governing the industry and new proposals put forward by the government would not work .
Under a suggested new government system - one of a series of proposals put out to consultation - all wheel - clamping businesses would be forced to register with an approved trade association ( ATA ) and be bound by a code of practice .
Only then would they be granted a licence to clamp and remove vehicles .
Our scheme is not perfect and we would welcome working with the AA further on the concerns they raise
Patrick Troy
British Parking Association However , the AA said the only ATA , the British Parking Association , was not truly independent and did not have the powers to regulate an " out of control " industry .
Patrick
Troy , chief executive of the BPA , said its code of practice for member companies was " a good first step to improving standards " , but conceded more government action was needed .
" Our scheme is not perfect and we would welcome working with the AA further on the concerns they raise in their consultation response as we are sure positive solutions can be found by working together , " he said .
But he added : " We have invited them to join our board which oversees the scheme but they have resolutely refused to do so .
" The AA has not produced a credible plan to address these issues . "
The government has suggested other measures to regulate wheel clamping , including setting a maximum amount that companies can charge and a minimum amount of time before a clamped car can be towed away .
A Home Office spokesman said : " That consultation has now ended and we are considering the responses .
We will publish the findings later in the year . "

The news coming out of Orange County today about a steamy affair between Heidi DeJong Barsuglia and Assemblyman Michael Duvall will probably wreck both of their careers , but it 's not all bad .
There 's a bit of education to be gained from all of this , such as the lesson that any would - be politicians should be careful about bragging about extramarital sexual exploits into a live microphone .
As broken by the OC Weekly , in July of this year , Michael D. Duvall , Orange County 's 72nd Assembly District representative , sat in a public hearing and graphically described the lobbyist , Heidi Barsuglia , he was having an affair with .
Midway through his his verbal Penthouse letter , the microphone in front of him went live , and the Orange County Cassanova 's tale went live to the entire dias .
Unaware , Duvall continued to tell his colleague , " She wears little eye - patch underwear .
So , the other day she came here with her underwear , Thursday .
And so , we had made love Wednesday - - a lot !
And so she 'll , she 's all , ' I am going up and down the stairs , and you 're dripping out of me ! '
So messy !
" Do n't believe us that a politician could be so indiscreet ?

Gun found on obese inmate after 5 searches 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
A felony suspect who tipped the scale at more than 500 pounds carried an unloaded 9 mm pistol into city and county jails beneath flabs of his skin even though law enforcement officers repeatedly searched him , authorities said Thursday .
George Vera , 25 , was released on $ 10,000 bail after being charged with possessing or selling unlabeled recordings and possession of a firearm in a correctional facility .
Harris County District Attorney 's spokeswoman Donna Hawkins said both charges are third - degree felonies , punishable by two to 10 years in prison upon conviction .
Police arrested Vera on Sunday after he was spotted selling apparently bootlegged compact discs out of the back of a sport utility vehicle parked at Hollister and Pitner , Hawkins said .
Police spokesman Victor Senties said Vera was searched three times by police personnel : once at the scene , again , more thoroughly , when he arrived at the city jail , and a final time before he was transferred to the Harris County Jail .
Vera was subjected to an additional search at the county lockup .
City and county law enforcement spokespeople said inmates at both the city and county jails are not required to pass through a metal detector or undergo wand searches .
Vera 's possession of the firearm came to light Monday when he approached a county guard during a shower break and admitted having smuggled the weapon , authorities said .
The incident came just days after the county lockup at 1200 Baker passed a surprise inspection by the Texas Commission on Jail Standards .
The review found that deficiencies cited after an April inspection — malfunctioning intercoms , broken toilets and crowded holding cells — had been successfully addressed .

" Today it is an amazing , if unexpected , legacy of Star Wars that so many gifted writers are contributing new stories to the Saga .
This legacy began with Splinter of the Mind 's Eye , published less than a year after the release of Star Wars . "
― George Lucas [ src ]
Splinter of the Mind's Eye , formerly subtitled From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker , is a Star Wars Legends novel written by Alan Dean Foster .
It acts as a sequel to Star Wars : Episode IV A New Hope , which Foster wrote the novelization of , and it was the first installment of the Star Wars Expanded Universe .
The novel was first published by Del Rey on February 12 , 1978 .
Set in 2 ABY , Splinter of the Mind 's Eye follows Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa to the planet Mimban , where they seek out the powerful Kaiburr crystal and encounter Darth Vader .
Contents show ]
Publisher 's summary Edit
As a young but already seasoned fighter pilot , Luke Skywalker expected trouble when he volunteered to accompany Princess Leia on a diplomatic mission to Circarpous to enlist their Rebel Underground in the battle against the Empire .
But the former farm boy from Tatooine had n't counted on an unscheduled crash - landing in the swamplands of Mimban …a landing that destroyed their ships .
Nor had he counted on any of the things they would find on that strange planet .
First , unknown to anyone , a secret base of Imperial Stormtroopers was thriving on Mimban .
As if that were n't trouble enough , there was the Kaiburr crystal , a mysterious gem that would give the one who possessed it such powers over the Force that he would be all but invincible .
In the wrong hands , the crystal could be deadly .
So Luke had to find the Kaiburr crystal , and find it fast .
Accompanied by Artoo Detoo and See Threepio — his two faithful ' droids — Luke and the Princess set out for the Temple of Pomojema and for a desperate confrontation deep beneath the surface of an alien world with the most fearsome villain in the galaxy !
Plot summary Edit
Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia , accompanied by R2 - D2 and C - 3PO , are traveling to Circarpous IV for a Rebel Underground meeting .
Their ships encounter an energy storm that forces them to crash - land on Mimban , a swamp planet .
The group searches for a way to get off the planet .
They find a mining town , and Leia discovers that the Empire has a secret energy mine there .
Luke and Leia find disguises and enter the facility .
A suspicious Imperial begins to question them , so Luke slaps Leia , claiming that she is his servant girl .
An old woman named Halla comes over and quietly talks to Luke and Leia .
Halla identifies
Luke as one who is strong with the Force .
She reveals a splinter , a shard of the Kaiburr crystal , which magnifies Force powers .
Halla is in search of the entire crystal , and she enlists Luke and Leia 's help , agreeing to get them off - world when they find it .
They all exit together .
Outside the facility , Leia admonishes Luke for slapping her and calling her his servant girl .
Luke falls off the walkway and into the mud , and he pulls Leia down with him .
They begin playfully fighting as some miners emerge from the building .
They claim that fighting in public is against Imperial law , and they all get into a brawl .
Imperial stormtroopers take everyone , except for Halla , C - 3PO , and R2 - D2 , who all hid in the shadows , to the local jail .
They are questioned by Captain - Supervisor Grammel , who discovers and confiscates Luke 's lightsaber and the crystal shard .
Luke and Leia are placed in a cell with two drunken Yuzzem , Hin and Kee , while Grammel reports the incident to Governor Essada .
Halla shows up in the jail cell 's window , and she uses the Force to open the cell .
The two Yuzzem go on a rampage against the Imperials and reclaim the confiscated weapons .
The four prisoners escape .
They meet up with Halla , who steals a vehicle , and begin making their way to where Halla believes the Kaiburr crystal to be , the Temple of Pomojema .

Sometime later , Luke , Leia , R2 - D2 , and C - 3PO set out with Halla into the mists of Mimban , ready to continue their adventures .
Development Edit
" I incorporated the crystal from the story to provide a focal point for the cover .
You 'll see that in the finished painting Leia is reaching for Luke 's lightsaber . "
― Ralph McQuarrie , on painting the novel 's cover
Splinter of the Mind's Eye was written by author Alan Dean Foster , who had previously ghostwritten Star Wars : From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker , the novelization of the 1977 film Star Wars : Episode IV A New Hope .
It was based on story discussions with George Lucas , and it was written while Star Wars : Episode IV A New Hope was still in production .
According to Starlog magazine , Foster 's Star Wars contract allowed for Splinter of the Mind 's Eye to be filmed .
The character Han Solo is notably absent from the novel ; unlike actors Mark Hamill ( Luke ) and Carrie Fisher ( Leia ) , actor Harrison Ford had not yet been contracted for film sequels . [ 3 ]
Continuity Edit
Splinter of the Mind 's Eye was the first Expanded Universe novel . [ 1 ]
The Kaiburr crystal that appears in Splinter of the Mind 's Eye was based on the " Kyber crystal , " a Force - focusing artifact mentioned in early drafts of Star Wars : Episode IV A New Hope . [ 4 ]
In the current Star Wars canon , kyber crystals are the power source for lightsabers . [ 5 ]
The planet Mimban , which was created for Splinter of the Mind 's Eye , appears in the 2018 film Solo : A Star Wars Story . [ 6 ]
In the 2020 comic book The Rise of Kylo Ren 4 , by Charles Soule , an artifact called the " Mindsplinter " is mentioned as being from the Minemoon of Mimban . [ 7 ]
Legacy Edit
A four - issue Splinter of the Mind 's Eye comic - book adaptation was published by Dark Horse Comics in 1995 . [ 8 ]

Welcome to glick , a runtime - less application bundle system for linux
Glick is an application that lets developers easily create application bundles of their applications .
An application bundle is a single file that contains all the data and files needed to run an application , so all the user has to do is start it .
There is no need to install it , and if you do n't like it you can just remove that file and the whole program will be gone .
There are some interesting aspecs of the glick implementation of application bundles :
There is no specific runtime that needs to be installed on the target systems .
As long as fuse is correctly installed an set up on the system just should not need anything but the bundle .
The application installed in the bundle does n't have to be relocatable .
Glick uses a trick with the / proc / self magic link to find its files via an absolute pathname ( / proc/ self / fd/1023 ) .
This means that you do n't have to modify applications to work with glick , just build then with " configure -- prefix / proc / self / fd/1023 " .
You can embed icons and desktop files into the target program file .
These are stored as separate ELF sections and are very easy to extract .
For more information on how to use glick , see the README file in the sources .
ChangeLog
Fix a problem in the fuse filesystem that only allowed you to open 10 files .
Fix argument order in the README example

When New York University freshmen start class Tuesday , among their course selections will be , “ Guitar Heroes ( and Heroines ) : Music , Video Games and the Nature of Human Cognition . ”
It ’s a freshman honors seminar about how video games help us learn .
Dr. Gary Marcus , renowned expert on childhood learning and the instructor of the course , told the New York Post , “ Video games are an understudied area .
People dismiss them unfairly , but Guitar Hero is a good tool for teaching and I ’m interested in the nature of learning . ”
No word on what it is that Guitar Hero teaches .
Regardless of any merits the course may have , some parents are scandalized .
“ I just wrote a big check here , ” Glen Jackson , father of an incoming freshman , grumbled to the Post .
“ I ’m not paying for him to study video games . ”
Well , there ’s always a one - in - a- million shot that Guitar Hero expertise could lead to gainful employment : a North Carolina 16 year - old dropped out of school last year to play the game professionally .
Among the questions the course will consider is , “ why are human beings so passionate about music and so easily sucked in by video games ? ”
The goals of the Freshman Honors Seminars Program are “ to introduce [ students ] to important subjects [ and ] to challenge them intellectually through rigorous standards of analysis and oral and written argumentation . ”
For the more traditional honors freshman , there are also seminars on Galileo , Hobbes and de Tocqueville .
Other NYU course choices this fall include “ The Poetics of Television ” and an undergraduate science class , “ Can Exercise Change Your Brain ? ” which begins each class session with an hour - long aerobic workout .

Do you remember way back in the early 1800 ’s when we were all waiting for the first Android Phone to be announced and the entire universe was hoping that it was one of HTC ’s new pieces of kit in the “ Touch ” line ?
Check the archives – for several months people were persistently suggesting that an Android - based Touch Diamond , Touch Pro or best of all – Touch HD – would be the ultimate Android hardware .
Soon it could be a reality .
( This is the original Touch HD with WinMo 6.1 for reference purposes )
Several sources are reporting that the original HTC Touch HD running Windows Mobile 6.1 will be injected with pure nirvana and will become the Android - based HTC Touch HD 2 .
While the HTC Android ’s now run 528MHz processors the Touch HD 2 will be hooked up with a 628MHz version of the Qualcomm chip .
Not exactly Snapdragon speed but certainly an upgrade that should quell concerns of OS lag .
Other rumored goodies include 3.8 - inch touchsreen and 480×800 display according to the leaked info .

No one in my family ever made garlic mashed potatoes .
No one had ever even heard of them until I started making them over a decade ago .
Mashed potatoes were simple things in my childhood : russet ( or all purpose white ) potatoes , peeled and cut into chunks , boiled until they were soft , then drained , then mashed with the following three ingredients : butter ( or , alas , margarine ) , salt and milk ( or evaporated milk . )
That was it .
No pepper even–pepper was to be added to taste at the table .
And the truth was , those mashed potatoes were plenty good .
It is n’t like I turned my nose up at them or anything .
And there were slight variations on these .
Gram would often prefer to use red-skinned boiling potatoes rather than russets or all - purpose potatoes .
Because of the waxy structure of thier starch the red - skinned potatoes , when boiled and mashed , turned into a creamier , more dense end product that had a slightly sweeter flavor than the usual fluffy and slightly dry mashed russets .
Gram also mashed her potatoes by hand with an implement that I proudly use to this day while Grandma used her Sunbeam stand mixer and my Mom used her hand mixer .
I liked the texture that the hand - mashed potatoes had better than the ones done with mixers ; however Grandma ’s made with Grandpa ’s homegrown Irish Cobbler or Kennebec potatoes with margarine and evaporated milk had the most amazing fluffiness –they were light and airy and amazing , and tasted very strongly of earthy potato .
But I liked Gram ’s too , with the little lumps and their natural creaminess–and their amazing tastiness from all the real butter Gram used .
( When Gram ’s mashed potatoes were perfectly smooth like Mom ’s or Grandma ’s we knew she had cheated and opened a box of potato buds . )
See , potatoes were a big deal in my family , and none more so than mashed potatoes .
Fried potatoes , boiled potatoes with butter or with butter and dried parsley , or baked or scalloped or served au gratin , or made into delicious potato salad ( my Mom was the Potato Salad Princess of our family –everybody loved hers best , and they still ask her to make it after all these years ) all of these were good , but mashed potatoes were the queen of the dining room table .
Everybody loved them .
I would say that we ate mashed potatoes at least twice a week , sometimes three times a week .
We certainly ate potatoes in some form every day–it has to do with growing up poor , I suspect .
Both my Mom and Dad grew up “ on limited budgets ” ( let ’s be real , they “ was po ' ” as they say in Charleston ) , and both sets of grandparents had lived through the Depression and World War II , so to all of them , potatoes were a necessity .
Our house never had fewer than twenty pounds of potatoes in the ‘ tater bin , and Grandma and Grandpa–geez , they grew hundreds of pounds of them and had a special root cellar where they kept them all in the cool dark through the long winter months .
( I loved the smell of the root cellar–all earthy and good , with a tinge of sweetness from the bins of apples and a tang from the kraut crock . )
So potatoes–it was all about potatoes , especially mashed .
Which is not to say that every dish of mashed potatoes brought to the table in my childhood was fantastic .
Most of them were , true , but now and again , strange things would happen to the potatoes and the cook would be mystified and distressed .
Sometimes ,
Mom would miss a bit of potato and there would be sizable lumps in her usually fluffy russets .
Or , worse , now and again , Grandma ’s potatoes were turn out runny , even if she put the same amount of evaporated milk as usual in them–they would , instead of standing up in proud peaks and swirls , go plop on the plate in a sad ploopy pool of pathetic potato .
Or the worst –sometimes Mom ’s potatoes would turn inexplicably gluey and sticky –the texture would go all unpalatable and icky , and on those days they would have to be drowned in gravy just so I could get them down , because the texture would make my stomach go all squiffy and jello - like .
It turns out that the reasons behind these mashed potato misfires are simple and have to do with the structure of the potato starch or their native moisture content or the fact that sometimes quickly draining boiled potatoes and then sort of shaking them in their colander for a few seconds is not enough to remove sufficient water from them in order to get properly fluffy mashed potatoes .
The gluey mashed potatoes come about if you overbeat or overwhip boiled russets .
The dry starch will go all sticky and gluey and wallpaper - pasty and really no one wants that .
The solution is to very carefully not over beat them , especially if you are using a mechanical mixer .
( And it is really easy to overbeat them if you do n’t pay attention as you go along .
My Mom , when she was distracted , would not watch the potatoes as they whipped and within seconds , they would go from light and fluffy and delightful to ick .
And she never figured out why .
( When I found out why this happened from reading one of Julia Child ’s cookbooks , I told her , and since then , she has had very little trouble with wallpaper paste potatoes . )
I have found that if you mash your potatoes by hand , you run a much lower risk of having the starch go awry .
In general , I figure your arm will get tired long before the glue gets working .
Grandma ’s runny potatoes came from not drying the potatoes thoroughly enough .
When she would let them sit in the colander for a few minutes , they would usually dry out enough , but especially if the potatoes were young and had plenty of inherent moistness to them , even that was n’t enough .
I learned from a Julia Child episode years later how to avoid that –pop the drained potatoes back in the pot , set them back on the stove and stir those suckers around until you get a little hazy film of potato starch on the bottom of the pot .
That was the sign that your potatoes were sufficiently dried out for successful mashing .
So , now that I have given you a treatise on potatoes and a bit of cultural history as to the Fisher / Perks families ’ dietary habits in regards to the beloved spuds , let us get down to business and make some delicious garlic mashed potatoes .
My method is simple , and results in the most delicately flavored and perfumed garlic mashed potatoes you can imagine .
I do n’t use roasted garlic , and I do n’t saute it or even simmer it in butter as some folks do .
I simply put peeled garlic cloves into the pot with the potatoes and boil them together and when the potatoes are done , I mash the garlic in with them .
That is it .
And they are the best garlic mashed potatoes ever .
Folks like my garlic mashed potatoes better than Julia Child ’s version , where she simmers the garlic in butter and then mashes them in and uses the butter in the potatoes .
Her way lacked flavor , but that is n’t surprising .
Julia did n’t love garlic as much as I do .
I use butter when I mash my potatoes , of course , and cream .
Milk is good , too , but I like butter and cream best .
For non-garlic mashed potatoes , I use butter and sour cream or butter and Greek yogurt instead of the butter and cream .
And when I really want to go freakishly rich on everyone , I have been known to mash potatoes with a bit of butter , a bit of cream and a good bit of Brie cheese ( with the rind cut off , obviously . )
The Brie potatoes get fresh thyme leaves and fresh minced rosemary leaves stirred into them right before serving , and they are wickedly delicious .
Oh , and one more thing you should know about mashed potatoes .
If you have a pressure cooker , you can go from peeled and cut up potatoes to boiled in about three minutes .
( Put the potatoes in the pressure cooker , with enough water to barely cover them , bring to a boil , lock the lid , bring to full pressure , cook for three minutes , then quick release pressure . )
Then , you drain them , dry them and mash them –that takes about five minutes , which means you can have real , honest to God mashed potatoes in about eight minutes flat .
( I timed myself doing it once . )
That is slow food done fast–bite that , potato buds !
Garlic Mashed Potatoes
Ingredients :
5 pounds russet potatoes , peeled and cut into 1/2 ″ thick chunks
1 head garlic , cloves peeled , but left whole
4 tablespoons butter
1/4-1/3 cup heavy cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
Aleppo pepper and freshly snipped chives for garnish
Method :
Put the potatoes and garlic in a pot and cover with cold water .
Bring to a boil and turn heat down to a merry simmer , and cook until the potatoes are fork tender .
( Which means a fork goes into them and then comes easily back out again –no sticking . )
Or taste a potato chunk to see if it is properly done .
They should be something that you could melt some butter over and eat without mashing –underdone potatoes make awful mashed potatoes .
Simply awful .
Do n’t go there .
Drain your potatoes–allow them to sit in the colander for at least two minutes , shaking them now and again .
While the potatoes are draining melt the butter and cream in the microwave until they are melty and warm .
Then , pop the potatoes back in the pot , and stir them over medium heat until a film of potato starch forms on the bottom of the pot .
Remove from the heat , and mash by hand .
( Come on , you can do it .
Get yourself a potato masher and have at it .
I do it all the time .
I even mashed 20 pounds of potatoes by hand using Gram ’s masher in a huge pot for the Toyota Farm to Table event .
If I did that , you can do five pounds for real .
Besides , it builds up great forearm muscles . )
When potatoes are pretty well halfway to mashed , pour in the melted butter and cream , and mash until most of the lumps are gone .
Then , using the masher , beat the potatoes a bit , going in big circles around the pot .
Sprinkle in the salt and pepper and beat them a little bit more .
At this point , they should be fluffy and delicious .
Garnish with Aleppo pepper flakes and snipped bits of fresh chive , and if you must , a bit more melted butter .
You know , just to make it pretty .

Ms. De La Cruz also began contacting heart transplant centers to determine whether she could pay for the operation with donated money .
Because Nevada has no heart transplant center , she contacted several medical centers in California and was told that without insurance , her brother would need to post a deposit of at least $ 150,000 to be evaluated and placed on a waiting list .
The total cost for the transplant and subsequent hospital care , as well as antirejection drugs , would be nearly $ 1 million , payable in advance .
To exert public pressure and raise money , Ms. De La Cruz began sending out messages on Twitter , with daily tweets about her brother ’s health , his dog , Chance , and the red tape she was trying to cut .
She gained a following of more than 6,300 people , whom she began calling Eric ’s Twitter Army .
The troops included Trent Reznor of the band Nine Inch Nails , which said it would award donors backstage passes and time with the band ; the famed Tony Hawk auctioned autographed skateboards .
Supporters bombarded Nevada legislators with calls , faxes and e-mail .
The Medicare hearing was rescheduled , and by June , Mr. De La Cruz had won his long - awaited coverage , opening the door to a heart transplant center .
Elated , Ms. De La Cruz contacted U.C.L.A.
Medical Center ’s heart transplant program , but now the hospital insisted that her brother get a secondary insurance policy  even though Mr. Reznor told me the band raised nearly $ 1 million in less than two weeks .
A hospital spokeswoman declined to comment on the case , citing patient privacy , but said the hospital “ had been working with ” the family .
Eventually , Ms. De La Cruz arranged for her brother to be seen by doctors at the University of Southern California Medical Center .
There , he spent a week on the “ high - priority transplant ” list .
But his condition had deteriorated so much that he soon became too sick for the procedure .
On July 4 , Eric De La Cruz died , at age 31 .
Ms. De La Cruz says a surgeon told her he could have helped her brother , but he arrived “ two years too late . ”
If not for all the delays and denials , she says , her brother would be alive today .

The auth token on Hacker News now changes per link , so the description below is of historical interest only .

There was a problem with Hacker News that allowed vote faking by constructing a special link .
The vote links looked something like this :
http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=814958&dir=up&by=jsteele&whence=news
It was possible to fake votes by tricking the user to enter their Hacker News username into a form .
To fix the problem , a new auth parameter was added to every vote link .
Now the vote links look like this :
http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=814958&dir=up&by=jsteele&auth=YQ6UDAAP&whence=news
The auth parameter is a per-user random token .
If a user votes and the auth token does n't match the server 's auth value for that user , the vote is ignored .
The token value , as it turns out , is also used as the value of the user authentication cookie :
( def vote - url ( user i dir whence ) (+ " vote ? " " for= " i!id " &dir= " dir ( if user (+ " &by = " user " &auth= " ( user - > cookie* user ) ) ) " &whence= " ( urlencode whence ) ) )
If an attacker can get a logged - in Hacker News user to share a vote link , the auth parameter can be used in a cookie to act as the Hacker News user on the site .
That means the attacker can vote , add comments , submit stories , change personal info , etc .
How to get a user to share that link ?
One way is to entice them with pretty pictures .
Here 's one possible approach :

After you submit your vote link , you 'll get a pretty picture like this :
My experience with the vote faking suggests that many people are willing to try something like this .
One way to fix this problem is to generate a different signature for each vote link .

Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez talks to media during a news conference with Ecuador 's President Rafael Correa in Caracas October 7 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Carlos Garcia Rawlins
CARACAS ( Reuters ) - Venezuela ’s socialist leader Hugo Chavez said on Sunday that U.S. President Barack Obama had done nothing beyond wishful thinking to earn the Nobel Peace Prize .
Chavez , who has mixed praise for Obama personally with criticism of his government ’s “ imperialist ” policies , said he thought it was a mistake when he read the U.S. leader had won .
“ What has Obama done to deserve this prize ?
The jury put store on his hope for a nuclear arms - free world , forgetting his role in perpetuating his battalions in Iraq and Afghanistan , and his decision to install new military bases in Colombia , ” Chavez wrote in a column .
“ For the first time , we are witnessing an award with the nominee having done nothing to deserve it : rewarding someone for a wish that is very far from becoming reality . ”
Chavez said giving Obama the Nobel award was like giving a baseball pitcher a prize simply for saying he was going to win 50 games and strike out 500 batters .
Although mild compared to some of the virulent rhetoric he often uses against the United States , Chavez ’s criticism contrasted with the assessment of his mentor , Fidel Castro .
The former Cuban leader said it was “ a positive measure ” that implied criticism of the “ genocidal ” policies of Obama ’s predecessors in the White House .
Though Caracas and Washington have hostile political relations , the United States remains the main buyer of oil from the OPEC member nation .

Laser Cows .
Just like real cows .

Do you think you have a sound apprehension of the fundamentals of the topic of live poker ?
On condition that you do , in that case you are ready to benefit from the article that appears before you .
To those of you who already understand the fundamentals of how to play poker , but aren`t really certain about participating in netpoker – here is a short tutorial to assist you to know a little more about the both the clear and unobvious differences and in which way they may affect your gameplay .
Playing at pokercardgame on the internet web - site isn`t really different from playing in a gambling room or your friend`s home on a weekend .
The most evident distinctions of course are :
You only virtually sit with other players at the poker table .
They`re living people – but you`ll have to count more on their gameplay behavior than any physical `tells` to determine their poker strategies , since you can not really see the player .
You aren`t able to cheat at netpoker .
At least , you can`t cheat at pokergame on the net without help .
Collusion is a possible problem ( that is commonly handled quickly even online ) , however if you only win every time when you participate in internetpoker with your buddies because they are not looking at your deal ( or you`re peeking at their cards ) , you most likely will not fit in too good .
After the following of the instructions at Poker Online , no players are allowed to cheat and win at the room .
The use of the skills and information is done to increase the bank balance .
The number of bonuses and rewards are high when there is availability of the correct strategy and approach .
You`ll have a bigger choice of the places at which to play and also how much you may play for .
Together with your pals or at the gambling hall , you are generally not given a lot of options like to whom you`ll be playing poker with and also where to be seated at the table .
With internetpoker game on line however , if you are able to allow yourself to sit at an open game table , just sit down .
Particular internetpoker on the pc rooms will even permit you to arrange individual rooms to play in together with pals .
Asides from this , the hands are the same , the poker games are similar , and also the regulations are similar as in any usual Poker room .
Surely , you aren`t able to lay cold - hard cash on the board at time you play a game of poker , therefore the procedure requires you perform a deposit with the cyber pokeronline game venue in order to buy your chips before you actually start the game .
Of course , you can take out the chips the moment you`re done playing ( supposing you didn`t play really bad and have few of them absent that is ) .
Each real net pokeronline website would have its own different possibilities for performing a payin at their internetpoker web - site .
Most sites will let you employ Visa card , MasterCard , NETeller , Firepay , checks and bank wires ( for more serious pay ins ) .
Similar to in most casinos , you make that cash in at the `cashier` .
When you`re prepared to cash in , you just go to the software`s `cashier` again and exchange your chips into money like a cheque , cable , et cetera .
Once more – withdrawal options alter dependant upon where you participate in real onlinepoker virtualgame , but a cheque is perhaps the most ordinary route intended for gamer cash - outs .
You don`t have to let the migration to pokercardgame on the internet have an effect on your game - play style , nevertheless , you mustn`t take the pot either .
Some simple facts you are supposed to keep in mind when you`re playing on the Internet :
Bluffing is shown in bets , not expressions .
At a 1 normal` poker game , bets are the main way a bettor makes use of to bluff opponents at the board , and the way the gamers try to determine if a player has high cards or not .
All at once however , the way a bettor acts and / or seems as playing his / her hand can in addition send out signs regarding whether or not they factually have a good poker cards .
That is not the same with computerpoker .
As bettors may chat by means of messages , each face can be a ` Poker face` on line .
That might outcome in additional gamers bluffing and additional bettors calling at some stage in online gameplay .
It consumes a long period in order to have a repute with computer onlinepoker .
Just as can go on to different game tables , and so are other gamblers , so you can`t suppose that you would be playing against similar gamers for long time periods .
Actually , it`s not unusual for aggravated gamers to change their place after only a few hands in case they`re not happy with your or additional gambler`s game styles .
This can from time to time prevent you from establish yourself as a `kind` of pokergames on the web player .
Getting caught with a number of bluffs deliberately may set the tone for a evening of Poker as you are playing against the same gamblers , but if other participants are constantly sitting down they may not have realized your earlier play .
Try to play for the short term – in case you sit in the same internetpoker game on line venue for a long time players start to recognize you , but this can take a long time .
Microsoft Corp. has suggested in recent years that companies using the Linux computer - operating system might be violating Microsoft patents .
Now , in an effort to avert any legal threat that might discourage the adoption of Linux , a group of Microsoft rivals is about to acquire a set of patents formerly owned by the software giant .
Linux is a free open - source operating system that has gained ground against Microsoft 's Windows software among business users , especially in servers , the big back - office computers inside companies ....
WASHINGTON 
It was just one line in a campaign manifesto , and it hardly seemed the most significant or contentious .
As a presidential candidate , Barack Obama said he would “ establish a new public insurance program ” alongside private health care plans .
That proposal took on a life of its own , but it now appears to be dying , a victim of an ineffectual White House strategy , the president ’s failure to argue passionately for the “ public option ” and all - out opposition by the insurance industry and much of the health care industry .
In the campaign , Mr. Obama said the public plan would compete with private insurers on the price and quality of care , thus benefiting consumers .
What Mr. Obama did not foresee is that , to some people on the right and the left , it would become the most important issue in the debate over health care , touching off a battle over the role of government in one of the nation ’s biggest , fastest - growing industries .
Once in office Mr. Obama and his advisers have sent conflicting signals about how critical a government - run health plan would be .
He prefers a public plan but is open to other ideas .
When our broadcasts leave Earth , they slowly travel into space .
There is , however , a sizable delay between what we watch and what distant aliens watch .
This convenient chart shows us what TV various stars are receiving today .

Iran and the major world power are to start talks on the stand off over its nuclear programme , which stands in violation of United Nations resolutions , on Oct 1 .
Mr Obama 's offer to talk to Iran without pre-conditions has made Israel nervous that Tehran will use detente as a cover to complete its drive for an atom bomb .

Samoan motorists have been driving on the right for years Protesters in the South Pacific nation of Samoa have lost a legal bid to stop a change in road rules that will force motorists to drive on the left .
The switch has led to demonstrations and sparked fears of chaos when the changes happen in a week 's time .
Safety experts warn that the new measures will put lives at risk .
The new rules have survived legal challenges in the Supreme Court , while large protests have failed to convince the government to back down .
Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele says that church bells will help to usher in the changes in the early morning in his quiet corner of the South Pacific .
" We do n't have that many cars in Samoa and we do not have that many people in Samoa too , " he said .
" I would envisage at 0550 we will have a kind of speech through the television and then exactly at six the call will go out , sirens and church bells will ring . "
Economic aims
The government has said there are sound economic reasons for the changes .
It wants to end the importation of expensive left - hand - drive cars , particularly big , thirsty American models .
Instead it is hoped that expatriate Samoans living in Australia and New Zealand will increasingly send used right - hand - drive vehicles home to their relatives .
It has been argued that smaller cars that are cheaper to run would boost the development of poorer parts of the country , which has a population of about 180,000 people .
Critics , though , are furious at such upheaval .
They have insisted the new road rules will cause mayhem and could trigger a rash of accidents .
The changes will coincide with a special two - day public holiday designed to keep the confusion to a minimum .

MARTINS FERRY , Ohio —
It was big news in this town of 7,200 in June when Sarah Jessica Parker and her husband , Matthew Broderick , came here to see a surrogate mother give birth to their twin daughters .
A steady stream of fans flocked to East Ohio Regional Hospital , hoping to catch a glimpse of the two movie stars .
But that was topped on July 31 , when two local police chiefs were arrested on charges of conspiring to break into the surrogate ’s house , stealing items and offering to sell them to photographers for tabloid magazines .
“ People are still talking about it , ” said Harold Schwender , 66 , a retired steel worker .
“ Everyone ’s been pretty excited by it , but they ’re all waiting for Act II — the trial . ”
The two police chiefs — Barry P. Carpenter , 39 , the chief here , and Chad M. Dojack , 29 , the chief in nearby Bridgeport , have pleaded not guilty , as has a third man charged in the case .
All are free on bond , and both chiefs have been suspended .

SEVENTEEN Uncle
Sams were seen begging on the streets of Washington , DC , this week .
They were a sad sight , with their slightly bedraggled red , white and blue hats and their cardboard signs with the hand - scrawled plea : “ I want YOU to give me $ 12 trillion . ”
It was a publicity stunt , of course , staged by DefeatTheDebt.com , a fiscally hawkish pressure group .
But it captured something important about the national mood .
Unemployment is nearly in double digits .
Most Americans think the economy will recover next year , but only 2 % think it will make a complete recovery .
And many are worried about Uncle Sam 's ongoing borrowing binge .
Has all that money averted disaster and eased the pain of the recession , as Barack Obama insists ?
Or did it merely postpone the pain ?
DefeatTheDebt.com 's television commercials leave no room for doubt .
A classroom full of children stand as if to recite the pledge of allegiance , but the words are different : “ I pledge allegiance to America 's debt , and to the Chinese government that lends us money , and to the interest , for which we pay , compoundable , with higher taxes and lower pay , until the day we die . ”
Many Americans think much of this money might as well have been tied up in bundles and burned .
On average , according to Gallup , Americans believe that 50 cents of every dollar the federal government spends is wasted .
This is an outlandish figure .
Not even the Department of Agriculture is that profligate .
Yet even Democrats , who are supposed to believe in big government , guess that 41 cents of every federal dollar is wasted .
Republicans think it is 54 cents , and independents , whose votes Democrats will sorely need at the mid-terms next year , are if anything slightly more cynical , putting the number at 55 cents in the dollar .
The hyperkinetic Mr Obama is trying to fix everything from car firms and banks to Chicago 's Olympic bid .
Yet a poll last month found that most Americans would rather their government did less .
Some 57 % said it was doing too many things that were better left to individuals and businesses .
Only 38 % thought it should do more .
The proportion who believe that government over - regulates private businesses has also risen from 38 % to 45 % in a year .
And despite the attention lavished on Michael Moore 's new movie excoriating capitalism , only 24 % of Americans think firms are under -regulated .
Arthur Brooks , the head of the American Enterprise Institute , a conservative think - tank , feels that the real culture war in America today is not about gay marriage or abortion , divisive though those issues are , but about capitalism .
Everyone agrees that Wall Street messed up last year , but many are disturbed by the expansion of government that followed the crash .
Voters particularly dislike the way the state is using their money to reward deadbeats , says Mr Brooks .
They themselves work hard and live within their means .
They see their neighbour , who borrowed more than he could afford to buy a fancy house , getting a bail - out to save him from the consequences of his own poor judgment .
They see reckless bankers getting bailed out too , and the ill - managed carmakers of Detroit likewise .
And they resent it .
There is some truth in Mr Brooks 's analysis .
The bank and car bail - outs were indeed unpopular .
And the fear that the Democrats aim to make government too big , too expensive and too intrusive set off a wave of “ tea - party ” protests that is still rolling .
Democrats have tried to dismiss the tea parties as motivated by racism , because Mr Obama is black .
But racism cannot explain why the president 's approval rating has fallen this year .
As Mr Obama observed : “ I was actually black before the election . ”
Some of the critics of big government are a bit hysterical .
Glenn Beck , a talk - show host , foments panic and then urges listeners to buy gold from a company he endorses .
Michelle Malkin , a blogger , has written a bestselling book about the Obama administration called “ Culture of Corruption ” .
This is silly , but the rabble - rousers are popular because their audience has genuine grievances .
Many working - class men have lost their jobs .
Those who are still employed have seen their wages stagnate and their pensions shrivel in the stockmarket crash .
Their health insurance is insecure , but they do n't trust Congress not to make it worse .
Working for the man
Meanwhile , they can see that one group of Americans has been practically unaffected by the recession : government employees .
Their hours have not been cut , their benefits are gold - plated and they are almost impossible to sack .
In good times , few Americans notice these things , but in bad times , the disparity grates .
Cops and firefighters can retire in their 40s and draw defined - benefit pensions for life .
With overtime , one tenth of the police in Massachusetts made more than the governor 's annual salary in 2006 , according to the Boston Globe .
Including benefits , the average employee of New York City makes more than $ 100,000 , according to Forbes , while some Californian prison guards “ sock away $ 300,000 a year ” .
And what do taxpayers get for their generosity ?
The bad bargains get all the publicity .
Union contracts force the postal service to pay thousands of unneeded workers to do nothing .
In New York , public - school teachers who can't be trusted to teach but can't be sacked either are paid to sit and do crosswords .
One should not overstate the rage of taxpayers against public servants .
Most Americans admire firemen , teachers and cops .
They like receiving government benefits , too .
And roughly half of them will pay no federal income tax at all this year .
The problem is that this is not sustainable .
During his election campaign , Mr Obama promised not to raise taxes on anyone except the rich , but with the deficit so vast , the question is not whether he will break this promise but when .

The film depicts aliens living in a South African shanty town Nigeria 's government is asking cinemas to stop showing a science fiction film , District Nine , that it says denigrates the country 's image .
Information Minister Dora Akunyili told the BBC's Network Africa programme that she had asked the makers of the film , Sony , for an apology .
She says the film portrays Nigerians as cannibals , criminals and prostitutes .
An actor from the film said that it was not just Nigerians who were portrayed as villains .
The Malawian actor , Eugene Khumbanyiwa , plays a gang leader with the nickname of Obasanjo , also the surname of former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo .
The film is about alien refugees who set up home in a South African shanty town called District Nine .
It is a loose allegory about apartheid and recent violence by South Africans against foreigners .
It 's not like Nigerians do eat aliens
Actor Eugene Khumbanyiwa
Ms Akunyili said it clearly took aim at Nigerians .
" We feel very bad about this because the film clearly denigrated Nigeria 's image by portraying us as if we are cannibals , we are criminals , " she said .
" The name our former president was clearly spelt out as the head of the criminal gang and our ladies shown like prostitutes sleeping with extra-terrestrial beings . "

The information minister said she had ordered the Nigerian film and video censors ' board to ask all cinemas to stop showing the film and to confiscate it .
" I have also formally written to Sony Pictures Entertainment , the company that produced this film , demanding an unconditional apology for this unwarranted attack on Nigeria 's image , " she added .
She also said she had asked them to review the film with a view to remove " all offending portions that injured our image as a nation " .
Ms Akunyili said said Nigeria was now hitting back with a policy of " rebranding " , after allowing the international community to define the country based on the behaviour of " [ a ] few criminals " .
She said that Nigeria 's Nollywood film industry was also being pressed to help portray Nigeria in a better light .
But Mr Khumbanyiwa said Nigerians in the cast did not seem worried by the portrayal of their country .
He suggested that the film , which depicts people wanting to eat aliens to gain the superhuman powers , should not be taken too literally .
" It 's a story , you know , " he said .
" It 's not like Nigerians do eat aliens .
Aliens do n't even exist in the first place . "

A giant Cold War bomber gently lifts into the air after rumbling down the runway at a packed air show .
Trouble is , it was n't meant to fly at all - and crowds had to run for cover as the beast suddenly lurched to the left and headed towards them and a nearby housing estate .
But hero pilot Bob Prothero saved the day by wrestling the Victor bomber away from the terrified spectators and back on the ground during nine seconds of mayhem .
The 75 - ton aircraft took off 150ft in the air after an engineer in the cockpit accidentally pushed open the throttle .
Quick - thinking Bob , who last flew a Victor in the 80s , told how he grappled with the controls as the jet banked steeply , threatening to plunge into the ground .
He said : " I was petrified .
There was n't time to think about anything .
Everything was pure instinct on that day .
It all happened extremely fast .
I was shouting at the co-pilot to pull the throttle back .
" For some reason he never did and I saw the nose rise into the air .
I thought ' Oh God , how are we going to get out of this one ?
" So I had to make a snap decision : ' Do I try to land the plane or do I fly round in a circle and land properly ' ? '
" Because of the crosswind I noticed we were not over the runway .
" Thankfully , I managed to pitch the plane back towards the runway and away from any spectators .
My only concern was getting the plane down as quickly as possible .
It was the most terrifying nine seconds of my life . "

The bomber , nicknamed Teasin Tina , was meant to do a taxi for fans to take pictures at the Cold War Jets day at Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome , Lutterworth , Leics .
An official report into the incident said the engineer " froze " when Bob , of Portsmouth , Hants , ordered him to shut the throttle and he opened it instead .

The recession has led to identity crises for all the political parties .
Labour cannot decide whether it stands for investment or cuts .
The Conservatives revert to Thatcherite economic policies while claiming to be progressive .
In a curious way the Liberal Democrats have been thrown into turmoil , too .
The curiosity arises from the obvious fact that their Treasury spokes - man , Vince Cable , is the star of the recession , a figure so popular that he can write a book on economics and turn it into a bestseller .
And of course the adulation is partly deserved .
The Liberal Democrats led the way on the need to nationalise Northern Rock and supported a fiscal stimulus during the recession .
They have been more forthcoming in where they might cut compared with the other two bigger parties and have gone into a little more detail about their tax plans .
But this is where their problems begin .
For the Liberal Democrats , even more than the bigger two parties , policies relating to " tax and spend " are about symbolism rather than reality .
Nick Clegg will not be Prime Minister next year and Cable is unlikely to be Chancellor .
But their policy pronouncements give them an opportunity to show the voters where they stand as a party and also to influence the wider debate .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Over recent days the message has not been clear .
Clegg began the week by pledging " savage " cuts .
In doing so he risked legitimising the Tories ' position even though Clegg and Cable regard David Cameron 's view that public spending should be cut during the recession as crazy .
By yesterday , Clegg 's message had moved on to one about a new tax on homes worth a million pounds .
Spending cuts and taxes on the wealthy are not necessarily contradictory and are , in some ways , complementary .
Any party that wins the next election will have to cut some spending and put up taxes .
But tonally the message was blurred .
In between those two pronouncements a policy detail came into view .
As the Conservatives are discovering , those wretched policy details can get in the way of the joyful machismo around the issue of cuts .
Many in the shadow cabinet want to launch policies that at first will cost more money .
Similarly , Clegg came under pressure at the weekend to give an example of a savage cut .
He highlighted the party 's commitment to scrap tuition fees .
At which point the former leader , Charles Kennedy , spoke for many here in Bournemouth when he intervened to insist that the pledge to scrap tuition fees should stay .
Similar tensions surfaced within seconds of Clegg floating the end of universal child benefits .
" Unfair and unworkable " is the brief summary of Steve Webb 's response .
Webb is another senior MP who is also an economist .
The Lib Dems are short on firepower but they have a lot of economists in their parliamentary party , not always an advantage for leaders seeking to float a few vaguely thought through ideas .
Their most famous economist popped up yesterday to clarify matters .
Cable declared that he and Clegg supported the abolition of tuition fees , but the policy would not be a priority .
Given that the Lib Dems can only win limited power in a hung parliament I would not like to be the equivalent of one of their low - priority policies .
But Cable 's contortion shows how they have to stretch awkwardly in order to convey their chosen message of savage economic prudence and social justice .
Perhaps the internal tensions and blurred message are the unavoidable consequence of a party taking on Labour in the north of England and the Conservatives in the south .
As ever there is much talk in Bournemouth about their strategic conundrum .
One senior Liberal Democrat MP described it to me as the party 's paradox : it wants a hung parliament and yet its best hope is to gain seats from Labour .
In gaining seats from Labour it makes the chances of an overall majority for the Conservatives more likely .
What is increasingly clear is that if there is a hung parliament , the Liberal Democrats will not join either of the other parties in a formal coalition , although some at the top would be tempted .
On Sunday David Cameron wrote an article claiming common cause with the Liberal Democrats on many issues .
Once again , Cameron was copying Tony Blair .
In the run-up to the 1997 election , Blair wrote an article at the start of the Liberal Democrats ' conference urging their supporters to " come home " to Labour .
As with Blair , Cameron 's article had nothing to do with the Liberal Democrats and everything to do with his aim to claim the centre ground , quite a challenge given his approach to public spending , tax and Europe .
On all three policy areas , especially Europe , the Liberal Democrats would not work with the Conservatives in a hung parliament , as a briefly ubiquitous Kennedy made clear at the weekend .
There is not much point in the Liberal Democrats or the rest of us speculating about a hung parliament .
Probably there will not be one .
I suspect the reasons for the confused messages at the conference are anyway less to do with their tactical conundrum .
The Liberal Democrats would go mad trying to solve tactical dilemmas because there is no solution .
The real explanation for the awkward projection is more mundane .
First , it is extremely difficult forming pre-election economic policies that are credible and popular in a recession .
We will discover this at the Labour and Conservative conferences , too .
Second , Clegg , like previous Liberal Democrat leaders , is desperate to be heard , as if being heard is an end in itself .
Sometimes he shouts too loudly in order to get a headline , when he does not always have to do so .
In the end he will be heard because he occupies a distinctive space .
Clegg was at his best at a fringe meeting yesterday lunchtime on the environment when he spoke with unscripted passion .
The issue links many of his genuine interests , with climate change demanding action at a European level and locally .
He dismissed the Tories ' " fake green rhetoric " , exposed by their alliance in Europe with parties that do not believe in climate change , but also cited co-operatives in Denmark as an example of what people could achieve locally , irrespective of what is decided at a European level .
On tax the Liberal Democrats are the most boldly redistributive of the parties , or at least they were when I last checked .
Their tax and spend plans are subject to frequent revision , the single advantage of the lack of media attention .
They can make changes without any one noticing .
There is nothing as vivid and accessible as their opposition to Iraq in their current policy agenda , but enough to be going on with .
Their more complex challenge comes after the election and not before .
The environmental issue explains why as it symbolises a wider theme .
At yesterday 's fringe Clegg pleaded for the green forces to unite behind the Liberal Democrats .
They will not do so .
His party will attract support but some environmentalists will vote Green , others will opt for Labour .
Some might back the Tories .
The progressive forces are fractured and while they remain so the party Clegg described as the fake greens have the space to win big majorities as it did in the 1980s .

Straight Inc. My ( Brother 's ) Story
Thanks to the wonderful folks who started and worked at Straight Inc. , and the Seed , such as Mel Sembler , Mark Foley , Mel Riddile , Paul Bishop and more , my brother is dead today .
Yes I blame them completely .
Even if my brother was messed up when he went in , they only made him worse , they did NOTHING to help him , he was abused along with thousands of other children .
Many who are just coming to terms with it now , some 20 + years later .
Straight no longer exists but it 's offspring does .
They are named : Pathway Family Center , The Seed , SAFE Inc. , Kids Helping Kids , Growing Together .
Many of these " Wilderness " programs are extremely abusive as well .
Betty and Mel Sembler ( ambassador of Australia and Italy appointed by both Bush 's ) stared the Drug Free American Foundation , after Straight Inc. was finally shut down .
It 's a bad organization run by bad people .
Now they are trying to push their agenda on the world through the The Journal of Global Drug Policy and Practice .

Please leave your own comments , questions etc .
Let us know you stopped by !
1 . Do NOT put your child in any facility that will not let you speak to your child anytime you want to , period !
2 . Do NOT put your child in any facility that does not allow your child the human right , that even prisoners have , to contact outside council if there is any abuse that takes place .
Also please read How to Find the Best Drug Treatment for Teens by Maia Szalavitz , and consider picking up a copy of Maia 's book Help at Any Cost , before placing your child anywhere .
If you do n't follow these two rules then you really do n't have your child 's best interest at heart .
Ultimately you should consider finding an outside source , an abitrator , if you will , to sit down with you and your child to help decide the best course of action if you do n't feel you can handle your child on your own .
But please , consider every and any alternative before sending them away .
Why have a child just to shove the responsibility on someone else .
If you truly feel you have no choice , it is your responsibility as a parent to make sure the treatment is compassionate and founded on love , not TOUGH love .
Tough love is a crock of shit , especially for a child that does n't volunteer to be treated that way .
And it is your responsibility to keep your child safe and out of harms way .
Now on with my brother 's story .
Please understand I wrote this from the heart , so the grammar and what not may not be perfect , I just wrote it as it came to me , I did it for my brother and all those who are not here to testify about their experience in Straight Inc .
My brother , Steve ( click here and here to view some pictures ) had such a beautiful spirit .
He was extremely talented , he could sing , draw , he was very artistic and introspective .
He started messing with drugs as a young kid with his friends .
My parents tried putting him in military school and that did n't work .
They got wind of Straight Inc. through a Tough Love group .
Only $ 4,000 a year , my brother was there for 2 1/ 2 years .
Mind you Straight did n't advertise it 's evil ways .
They let you know there was a WAR going on , a Drug war .
They let you know your child was a victim of this war and they were your last resort .
My parents decided to put him in Straight Inc. Straight Inc. was a very intensive , family program .
Meaning the family is involved as well .
At age 13 , I had to go to what they call " Open Meetings " every Monday and Friday and then sibling meetings on Saturday .
Ca n't say I enjoyed it .
The open meetings on Monday were n't too bad but on Fridays they lasted up to 3 hours , then we had to break out into a sibling meeting which COULD last another 2 - 3 hours .
We were usually there from about 6 pm until midnight or 1am .
When kids get put into straight they are put on phase 1 .
On phase 1 you stay at someone else 's house .
You are stripped of all your rights , you can wear no shoes , or belt and are led around by the back of your pants ( belt loop ) where ever you go .
Ca n't even SHIT or SHOWER alone .
You had ZERO privacy , you were NEVER alone .
You could not read ( except for the Bible , those hypocrites ) anything , could not watch tv , could not listen to music .
While staying at your host home ( a home of a family who had a child on a higher phase ) you were basically locked in .
All the doors were locked , the windows were barred , in the bedroom the locks were reversed so you could n't leave and the " oldcomer 's " bed was usually pushed up against the door .
My brother spend 2 1 / 2 of his 3 years on phase 1 .
You would think these kids had committed murder or something , most of them smoked a few joints and drank a few beers , if that .
We are n't talking junkies were talking 12 - 15 year old kids who liked to experiment and party , for the most part .
While on first phase you could earn
Talk with your family that occur after the open meetings .
When someone got a talk they would get to come meet with their family and talk to them for 5 minutes , being lead by the seat of their pants , of course , unless they were lucky enough to earn Talk & Responsibility which meant no one had to grab your ass while you were talking to your family .
I think it took my brother over 3 months to earn his first one .
When he did it was extremely emotional for all of us .
Considering my brother was on first phase for 2 1 / 2 years you can imagine how little we got to communicate with him , the TALKS after open meetings are the ONLY communication you get while they are on first phase .
Straight had this philosophy that 90 % of all teenagers were druggies or potential , eventual , druggies .
All druggies who started with beer , pot or mild drugs would eventually turn to more extreme drugs .
All druggies would be unsuccessful and probably wind up dead .
I did drugs , mostly pot , and I consider myself VERY successful today , no thanks to Straight .
My brother is dead and it was n't drugs that killed him .
They convinced parents their kid would die without help and they were good at it .
Dead , insane or in jail , they would say .
On 2nd phase you got the privilege to come home at night .
EVERY DAY ( unless in school ) from about 7 am until about 9 pm ( sometimes much later ) you were at the Straight Inc. building .
During that time you could NOT talk to anyone else , nor make eye contact with anyone , other than who was talking .
You had to sit up straight for over 12 hours or be kicked in the back frequently if you did n't comply .
If you were caught day dreaming or even thinking about something else and not paying attention you could easily be set back a phase or even body slammed to the ground .
Imagine a kid with A.D.D. in this program .
In the building ( a revamped warehouse ) there were basically no windows , florescent lights , peanut butter sandwiches for lunch every day .
You had to get permission to go to the bathroom , no real medical care , absolutely NO real therapy or counceling by licensed therapists .
On first phase , you were taken out of school and / or any job you held .
Once you got to 3rd phase you got to go back to school and 4th phase you could hold a job .
On 5th phase you actually could go out on an outing with friends like a movie , WOW .
Finally comes graduation , something my brother never saw .
There were kids in Straight Inc. who had never done drugs ( they signed a confession eventually after hours and hours of intimidation ) , kids with mental problems and eating disorders , as if an abusive experience like this is going to help someone with a mental disorder .
That is criminal .
They used mental intimidation to get some kids to admit to problems they never had so they could fill their fucking pockets !!
My brother was in the program for 3 years ( from age 15 to 18 ) and ran away SEVEN TIMES !
( that should be a hint ) .
Now before I go further let me say I do n't lay full blame on my mom she was ignorant as to what was happening .
They sold a great package !
Only recently have I told her what Steve went through , and I know it is and was hard for her to hear .
She ultimately feels responsible .
For 15 years I was pissed off at my brother for taking his life and leaving his family .
Then I learned the truth , and to be honest I can't say I would n't have done the same .
I do n't know if I could have handled 3 years in that place .
Let me give you some examples of the abuse he had to suffer .
Nightly they had to write " Moral Inventories " , better known as MI's .
My mom saved these and recently I asked her if I could have them .
I put them all in order and started reading .
On his 60th day in straight he stated that he was very proud because he finally had a day where he was n't physically restrained .
One got physically restrained for not raising their hand .
It 's not like he was trying to beat people up or run away on a daily basis , he just was n't complying .
That 's my brother , he was a fighter .
And when I say restrained , imagine four big guys or girls , throwing you to the ground and sitting on you so you could hardly breath for 30 - 60 minutes .
People got broken fingers , hands , arms , ribs , etc , often .
They were told to make a list of all the bad " sexual " things they did when they were young .
Many kids had n't really done anything yet but they were hounded so severely kids actually made things up .
And then of course it was used against them as ammunition to remind them what sluts and whores they all were .
Druggies were losers , and people who went back to using drugs were useless losers who would never succeed .
Yeah that 's the way to cure someone , make them feel like total shit about themselves for a problem they may or may not have .
They were not allowed to talk about anything much beyond themselves .
Meaning if there were severe family problems going on , that might even have attributed to the drug use , so what .
The problem was drugs , not that " you were molested as a child " .
These kids were severely brainwashed into thinking they were complete losers and everything was their fault .
A very popular phrase " SPIT THERAPY " comes from this program too ... think about it .
Many of these kids had problems such as depression , or were bi-polar yet got ZERO therapy for any problems , NO psychiatric counceling .
The counceling for the most part came from KIDS ( brainwashed kids ) who had already graduated the program , that way these greedy fuckers did n't have to PAY for real help .
Before my brother could come home on phase 2 , Straight Inc. told my dad he had to get rid of the alcohol in the house , because it would be tempting .
My mom and some friends thought it might be a good idea to have an intervention for my alcoholic father ( he is a true blue alkie ) .
They had the intervention at the Straight building ( Straight loved to be in control ) , they did n't plan on putting my dad in there , the intervention just took place there .
Of course if you have ever experienced an intervention you feel cornered and will usually back down and comply because of all the " friends and family " that are there .
So , my dad agreed to go into a 3 week program at Fairfax Hospital to stop drinking .
As we all know you wo n't stop abusing ( drugs , alcohol , whatever ) until YOU are ready , my dad was n't ready .
He left the program and came up with the GREAT idea that he would move out so my brother could come home .
NICE DAD !
So now my brother saw my dad as choosing his BOTTLE over him .
Again my dad had to be ready to quit but DAMN what a slap in the face that was for me and my brother .
My dad cared more about getting his buzz on then his own god damned family .
I still harbor resentment today about it .
Then , while in Straight we found out my dad had cheated on my mom with MANY different women and had another child about 7 years before .
My brother got wind of this in Straight , of course a senior staff member at Straight told him , they just would n't let him talk about it .
EVERY TIME he tried to talk about it they would tell him to focus on HIS problem .
As if DRUGS are EVER the problem .
Something is always behind it .
So basically they told him just to FUCK with him , not to help him .
It breaks my heart that my brother was put through this .
He was made to think he was worthless and useless and had nothing going for him .
Every time he ran away he was brought back FORCEFULLY to Straight .
Even punched a window out in hopes of severing his hand so he could go to the hospital instead of Straight , no such luck .
I was around a few times when they got him at our house , it was always VERY physical ( my brother was 6 ' 3 " ) , with friends and neighbors helping to restrain him .
Granted none of them knew of the horrors of straight , but the one problem I do have is that if a kid runs away 7 times then the PROGRAM ISN'T WORKING , move on !
Get him OUT !
But that did n't happen .
Looking at it from the perspective I now have , it really breaks my heart .
Because every time my brother ran it was as if he was escaping a concentration camp , and they brought him back to that hell hole 7 times .
He actually jumped from a moving car on one occasion risking his life in order not to go back .
I can't imagine what he had to endure each time he came back , I would not have survived that .
The sibling side of straight was odd as well ( siblings of course being the brothers and sisters of those in the program ) .
We would go to sibling meetings ( Monday nights , Friday nights and practically all day Saturday for THREE YEARS ) and have to talk and share ( yuck ) but I got into it at the time , as if I had a choice .
If you do n't go then they warn your parents you are probably on drugs too .
I actually had an interview 2 years into straight because a straightling saw me try snuff in school and reported me .
They thought I was on drugs , thank GOD I was n't put in there .
The folks in Straight were pretty much brainwashed into narking on anyone seen doing anything suspicious .
Many kids who never TOUCHED drugs went into that program and the parents were of course told they were druggies since the counselors grilled them enough to admit it in writing .
In siblings we had to write MI 's too , we had to sing these stupid mother fucking songs , although I preferred that to sharing .
When we wanted to talk we have to MOTIVATE .
Meaning raising both your hands in the air and shaking them like a god damned gorilla or something .
The kids in the program would get restrained for not doing this .
Straight was very " God " oriented * how fucking hypocritical * , they were against ROCK music and premarital sex .
I still remember friends of mine in siblings that were just BLASTED for going to a rock concert or having sex at the age of 17 .
I mean BLASTED .
Oh it makes me sick to think about .
And that was NOTHING compared to what went on to the kids INSIDE Straight .
My brother turned 18 in September of 1985 and withdrew himself from Straight .
He asked my mom if he could come live at home and she said only if he goes to AA .
At the time I did n't understand why he said no .
But now I do .
He had been a prisoner with NO rights for 3 years ( keep in mind he was on FIRST PHASE for 2 1 / 2 of those 3 years ) and was n't about to be told what to do .
He left Straight homeless and alone and somewhat brainwashed .
He was still in contact with his highschool buddy Corey , who I recently contacted .
Corey was probably his only TRUE friend , him and Craig and Bubba * grin * .
I saw my brother once before he died working at the Mobil gas station .
He looked good but sad , I wanted to cry , wanted to go give him a big hug , but even our relationship had been affected , we had hardly seen each other in 3 1/2 years .
I could tell he was happy to see me but did n't know how to react .
Finally on June 30th 1986 my brother checked himself into the Econo Lodge in Springfield Virginia .
Wrote a note to Corey , took some cocaine for courage , and jumped from the 4th story window .
He hit his head on the concrete .
He was without oxygen to the brain for over 10 minutes , which of course caused his brain to die .
He was put in the hospital and kept on life support until July 3rd when we decided to pull the plug .
I recently got to read my brother 's suicide note for the first time .
It confirmed everything for me .
My brother never really had a self defeated attitude yet the entire note talked about what a fuck up he was and how he would never amount to shit .
Straight did a WONDERFUL job of drilling this into his head for 3 years .
Imagine hearing for 3 years straight that if you ever smoke another joint or drink another beer you are a loser who WILL wind up dead .
That is exactly how he viewed himself .
I did n't deal with his death for the first 15 years , hardly cried and rarely spoke of it .
One day , back around 2001 , I decided to do some research on the net about Straight .
Oh my god the shit I found blew my mind .
It goes so much deeper then what I express in this letter .
Being that I was not with my brother in straight I could only share things that he went through that others shared with me .
But if you visit some of the links below you will gain a better understanding of what really occurred .
It was absolutely horrific and it's STLIL GOING ON TODAY !
I will never forget in 1986 Nancy Reagan and Princess Diana came to Straight in Northern Virginia , I was in the open meeting that they came to .
And then afterward publicly gave their support to the program , completely CLUELESS as to it 's horrors and treatment of these kids .
I was told there were certain " trouble makers " who were taken to back rooms and gagged so they would n't make a peep while the first lady and the Princess were there .
That breaks my heart .
Many people I have since talked with are just NOW ( 15 - 20 years later ) coming to terms with this abuse .
Many completely lost themselves and their personality and have had to rebuild .
Brainwashing is REAL and no joke .
It 's a tried and true practice and they used techniques in Straight that have been used globally .
Definitely a Clockwork Orange meets Full Metal Jacket type situation , and very very sickening to me .
Thank you for taking the time to read this information .
If you were unaware of these atrocities before , my hope is it 's angered you enough to at the minimum , spread the word , tell one person .
Knowledge of the truth is powerful , and we have the power to end these crimes !
In the meantime , I feel it 's extremely important to get this information out .
Parents have NO EXCUSES anymore when it comes to sending their kids to these programs .
The information is out there for them to gain FREELY , if they only do the research .
I think the most important thing is to realize that drug treatment needs to be REAL therapeudic treatment and it needs to be voluntary .
I do n't care if a kid is 15 years old no child should be FORCED to do something like that .
If you do your research , you will see , that children have less rights in this country then ANIMALS or prisoners of war , and when it comes to private rehabs they have no rights .
At the very least if you were ever faced with putting your child in a facility that was not voluntary , make sure their rights are covered by the law , meaning as much as I hate to say it , a government run institution is bound to the law and it's much harder for them to get away with these crimes then in a private rehab .
If a parent does n't love their kid enough to do the research before sticking them somewhere like that , they need to rethink the whole parenting thing .
And believe it or not there are parents out there who would much rather throw their kid in a rehab then be a parent .
I know that is n't the case in most situations , but it does happen and therefore the child needs the right to speak out if they are put in an abusive facility .
Straight Suicides :
This is a partial list of people who committed suicide while in straight or after they got out .
Many others TRIED to take their lives .
I left last names out purposely for those who wish to maintain privacy .
There are several others that have died reasons not disclosed .
No doubt this list will continue to grow over time .
These people did not die in vain and we are not going away until all these abusive facilities are shut down and the people responsible are held accountable !
* Denotes death but suicide unconfirmed .

Dan H. Note : According to statistics from the National Center for Health Statistics , in 1987 the Tampa Bay area ( Hillsborough , Pasco , and Pinellas Counties ) had the highest suicide rate in the country .
It 's not just because of the large number of retirees there .
The juvenile suicide rate in Pinellas County rose 130 % between 1980 and 1986 .
A 1992 study found that 1 out of 4 girls in neighboring Pasco County attempted suicide in 1991 ( national average was 10 % ) .
And in neighboring Hillsborough County the juvenile suicide rate rose from 3 in 1980 to 9 by 1987 .
19 youths committed suicide in Pinellas / Hillsborough Counties in 1989 [ up to nine of these were gay . ]
Straight operated its founding center , Straight - St Pete , in Saint Petersburg , Florida in Pinellas County from 1976 to 1993 .

The animal abuse charge carries a maximum of five years in prison and $ 125,000 fine .
According to court documents , the victim told police the couple had recently separated , but Fite showed up and kept talking about wanting to get back together .
The victim said she told Fite she had plans that night , and they did n't include him .
He became angry and violent , shoving her against the bathroom wall , and grabbed her hair and threw her into the bathtub , according to the court affidavit .
The victim was able to flee her apartment and called 9 - 1 - 1 .
When she returned , she found her fish in the middle of the floor with a knife through it .
Fite admitted to police after his arrest that he killed the fish , and that it was a stupid thing to do .
According to a court affidavit , Fite told an officer , " If she can't have me , then she can't have the fish . "
Fite , who is being held at the Multnomah County Detention Center , is due back in court Aug .

Rating : 5 stars I love this dish , and it 's become my signature Thanksgiving dish .
I do consistently have a problem though with the milk curdling when I steep the ginger in it .
In fact , I buy double the amount of ginger because I almost always have to do this step at least twice .
I 'd love some insight on why this happens !

This looks difficult , but it 's actually really really easy and is visually stunning .
Definitely more of a dessert than a side dish ( which is how I originally intended it ) .
Def a show stopper at any dinner party and fun to eat too .

As a practicing psychiatrist in the U. S. A. , it is my job to get to the root of my patients ’ ‘ irrational behavior . ’
There is always an explanation , rooted in the patient ’s past , why a patient behaves the way he does .
But the patient is not aware of it .
Making the patient aware of the reason behind his current irrational behavior often changes his behavior , provided he is an open - minded person capable of developing a trusting relationship with the doctor .
For example , a woman does not know why she breaks up with men who become seriously interested in her .
Once she realizes that this has to do with her irrational fear of rejection , rooted in her childhood rejection by her father , she could learn to trust men once again .
Delusions are beyond reason
Some irrational behaviors are based on delusions , and are not amenable to reason .
For example , one cannot reason with a man who believes that for the past three years Mafia has been trying to kill him , by telling him , “ If the Mafia really wanted to kill you , it would take only three minutes to do so . ”
This person has a fixed irrational belief , which serves him a specific purpose .
Likewise , you ca n’t reason with a deluded Jihadist that the seventy - two women he hopes to meet in heaven after achieving martyrdom cannot be virgins in view of the fact that several thousands of brainless Jihadists like him have preceded him there .
Like individuals , every society on earth has its own set of irrational beliefs and behaviors .
Some of these behaviors are universal , namely , they are shared by all societies on earth .
A common example is religion .
Most people on earth swear allegiance to one religion or another , one god or another .
The degree of irrationality in religious beliefs varies from religion to religion .
In one religion , people meet for prayer once a week , sing together , socialize and go home .
On the other extreme , in another religion , people dance in trance - like state , holding poisonous snakes in their hands .
Sometimes they die from snakebites .
Irrational thinking is culture - specific
Very often , irrational thinking is culture - specific .
For example , insisting that the guest eat and drink something at the host ’s house before leaving , is a type of irrational behavior widespread in India , but not in America .
In India , a guest refusing food or drink would certainly make the host very angry .
Almost all Indian hosts are beyond any reasoning in this matter .
Even if the guest says that he is so full that if he ate even one piece of sweetmeat he would vomit , would make no difference in the behavior of Indian hosts .
Few Indians know how this irrational behavior started .
Here is the true reason :
For thousands of years , there was always food shortage in India .
The guests did not want to strain the host ’s food supply and the hosts did not want the guests to go hungry .
So , both of them played this little mind - game : guests pretended to refuse food and hosts insisted they eat .
Now , in the twenty first century , food is aplenty .
Besides , everybody has weight problem .
Yet , the mindless forcing of the guests to eat continues unabated .
The host neither listens to nor believes what the guest says .
His own agenda is to prove what a wonderful host he is .
He is least bothered if the guest drops dead after eating at his house .
Customs are nothing but dead habits
In India as well as in America , even the most educated and accomplished Indians behave in irrational manner like this .
I can give you thousands of examples of mindless behaviors in Indians , all of which had a very good reason in the beginning .
The only problem is that that reason has no relevance to the current reality .
Let me give you a few examples :
It is a custom in a certain family to put a cat under a basket during the Ashtami Pooja ceremony .
Just before the Pooja , the family would borrow a cat from a neighbor for the purpose .
When asked about this irrational behavior , the head of the house said that it was a custom the family had followed from as far back as he could remember .
An elder in the family knew how this custom started .
Some fifty years ago the family had a cat , which ate the sweetmeat meant for the idol .
So they had to put the cat under a basket till the Pooja ceremony was over .
Now , the brainless householder felt compelled to continue this irrational tradition even if it meant borrowing a neighbor ’s cat for the purpose .
After the death of the eldest brother in the family , the surviving brothers and their children met to decide in whose house the annual Ganesha Pooja ceremony should be held .
None of them wanted to take the responsibility for the ceremony , but all of them expressed great concern for their own welfare if one of them did not perform the annual ritual .
All the people involved were highly educated people , but were belaboring under the irrational fear that something terrible would befall them if they did not perform the Pooja as per the family tradition .
In other words , they thought that Ganesha would be angry with them for failing to continue this mindless tradition .
Their befuddled mind , under the weight of irrational fear , did not understand that performing this ceremony without the mental commitment , merely to protect themselves from Ganesha ’s wrath , was worse than not performing it at all .
These people had no idea whatsoever about the fundamental idea of god .
Obviously , they thought that god would be pleased even if they performed the Pooja without their heart in it and out of fear of punishment !
A man goes to the local temple , circles the idol seven times and falls on the ground before the stone idol .
When asked , where is his god , he shouts , “ God is here , there and everywhere ! ”
If you asked him , “ If he is everywhere , why do you go to the temple ?
Can you not pray at home ? ” he would reply , “ My father did this before me .
I have done this for fifty years .
I do n’t feel good if I did n’t do it now . ”
Obviously , this man is a creature of his habit .
Even though he said that God is everywhere , he did not mean it at all as evidenced by his behavior .
Currently clueless
In all these and thousands of other examples , the following factors become evident :
All current irrational behaviors are based on a good reason sometimes in the remote past .
Both these were reinforced by an authority figure such as a parent , a priest , a Swami or a Guru .
These authority figures had vested interest in perpetuating these behaviors even though these behaviors were irrelevant now .
The person indulging in the irrational behavior does not have a clue as to why he is behaving in this way .
In fact , he does not think of his behavior as irrational at all even though he cannot explain the rationale for it .
He has now become a mindless creature of dead habit , incapable of independent thinking and rational behavior .
Trapped in the ancient mindset
Let us now see how these observations can be applied to Hindu fundamentalists who are attacking women in the restaurants , Christians in the churches and Muslims women in schools :
These people are acting on their irrational belief that Hindu religion is under attack and so they need to protect it .
This irrational fear is rooted in the history of India .
Over the past two thousand five hundred years , Buddhism , Islam and Christianity continually threatened Brahmanism , the decadent Dharma that pervades every atom of present day Hinduism .
During the post - Vedic period of 500 B. C. E to 600 A. D. , most major kingdoms of India ignored Brahmanism and promoted Buddhism .
During the medieval period , Islamic kingdoms attacked Brahmanism and supported Islam .
And during the last three centuries , European colonial governments ignored Brahmanism and supported Christianity .
So now they do not trust the Indian Constitution to support or promote Brahmanism .
So , they think , they need to attack those who are violating the values of their Dharma , attack those of other Dharmas , and attack anyone seen as supporting the people of other Dharma .
Here let the reader remember that right - wing Hindu fanatics assassinated Gandhi for “ siding with Muslims . ”
Obviously , these religious fanatics are living in India of the past two thousand five hundred years .
They do not realize that the Dharma they should protect now is the Constitution of India .
The ancient term , “ Dharmo Rakshathi Rashathah ” means “ The Law protects him who protects Law . ”
These fanatics have no idea that in the modern world this means , “ The Constitution protects him who protects the Constitution . ”
To them , whose allegiance is to Brahmanism , it is impossible to conform their behavior to India ’s Constitution .
If we tell them that the Indian Constitution , the Dharma of modern India , considers their behavior as anti-social and treasonous , they would not believe us .
They all consider themselves as pukka patriots .
To make matters even worse , these ignoramuses have no knowledge of either the origins of Brahmanism three thousand five hundred years ago or its fundamental tenets .
So they depend on what their equally ignorant religious leaders and political supporters tell them what Brahmanic Dharma is .
And based on their faulty knowledge and irrational belief , they act in a manner detrimental to the nation .

Copenhagen
Dozens of demonstrators tried to shield the Iraqis from police Danish police have used force to evict 17 Iraqi men from a Copenhagen church where they had sought refuge .
Five protesters from a crowd who tried to prevent the police moving in were also arrested during the operation .
Clashes broke out between the protesters and police on Wednesday night as the Iraqis were put on a bus outside Brorson 's Church .
Danish media say Denmark and Iraq have established a legal framework for the repatriation of failed asylum seekers .
An Iraqi delegation is to visit Denmark later this month to help identify the evicted Iraqis , who had been sheltering at the Protestant church in the capital 's Noerrebro district since May , the Politiken news website reports .
Arguments rage Denmark 's former Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen accused police of having " ignored human decency " by raiding the church to oust the Iraqis .
Police used batons to clear protesters from the scene But Justice Minister Brian Mikkelsen , quoted by Politiken , defended the police action .
" I think we would have preferred not to have to use force , " he said .
" But we happen to live in a democratic society which is built on people abiding by the country 's laws and rules and there 's no special treatment just because you occupy a church . "
Besides the 17 arrested in the church , two more Iraqis - apparently connected to the group - were arrested later when they turned up at a police station .
The Iraqis and their families have been denied asylum in Denmark .
They are to be returned to Iraq , but were hoping to avoid that by hiding in the church .
About 30 Iraqis had settled in the basement of the church , but were woken up by the police banging on the church door at night , demanding it be opened .
" Within 30 seconds , 30 officers or so had entered the church and blocked all the exits , " said 28 - year - old Misja Krenchel .
She spent the night there as a volunteer for the organisation Church Asylum , which supports the Iraqis ' fight to stay in Denmark .
" People were panicking as the police entered the church , " she remembered .
Tense confrontation
The Iraqis gathered around the altar holding chairs and candlesticks , hoping to defend themselves against the police .
I am shocked by what has happened ...
It is a violation of our sacred room
Pastor Per Ramsdal of Brorson 's Church " Our intention was to find a peaceful solution to the situation , " said Flemming Steen Munch , spokesperson for the Copenhagen police .
For two hours , the atmosphere in the church was tense , but fighting was avoided .
Ms Krenchel and another Dane staying with the Iraqis tried to calm the situation down , but at least one of the Iraqis threatened to commit suicide .
Eventually , the Iraqis gave in , crying and saying goodbye to their wives and children .
All 17 men were arrested and taken from the church to an asylum centre .
Denmark 's Minister of Refugee , Immigration and Integration Affairs , Birthe Roenn Hornbech , says an agreement has been struck with the Iraqi authorities over returning more than 250 Iraqi citizens - even if it is against their will .
However , Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki denies that such an agreement exists .
The UN Refugee Agency ( UNHCR ) and Amnesty International have criticised the Danish government 's plan to send the Iraqi refugees home .
They argue that the situation is still too unstable in several regions .
Nevertheless , the first six Iraqis were sent back to Iraq in late June and another seven followed on Thursday .
According to Pastor Per Ramsdal of Brorson's Church , this is the first time the Danish authorities have entered a church to arrest people .
His church has been left in a mess - and he is in shock .
" I am shocked by what has happened - and by the way it has happened .
It is a sad day for our country , the society and the Danish church .
It is a violation of our sacred room , " he explained .
In Copenhagen , a demonstration is taking place on Thursday evening in sympathy with Iraqis .
A huge crowd is expected .

WASHINGTON 
In what may become the most talked - about moment of President Obama ’s speech to Congress on health care , Representative Joe Wilson , Republican of South Carolina , pointed his finger and shouted , “ You lie ! ”
It was an angry retort to Mr. Obama ’s statement that illegal immigrants would not benefit from proposed health care legislation .
And while other points in Mr. Obama ’s speech were debatable , this one was not .
The legislation approved by three House committees clearly states that only lawful residents will qualify for new health insurance subsidies .
“ Nothing in this subtitle , ” it says , “ shall allow federal payments for affordability credits on behalf of individuals who are not lawfully present in the United States . ”
But Mr. Obama did repeat some assertions he had made about the proposed health care overhaul that are not so easily defended .

Ludwig Wittgenstein believed that the proper task of philosophy was to make the nature of our thought and talk clear .
The problems of philosophy were illusory , he believed , and arose as a misunderstanding about language .
While I think he greatly overstated the case , I think Wittgenstein was on to something important .
Many problems not only in philosophy but in other areas result from the imprecise use of language .
I must confess that my own muddled use of language often contributes to this problem .
When communicating with those who do not share my basic religious and political presuppositions , I often forget that we may not be using language in quite the same way .
This can be particularly true when , like the mission of this magazine , attempting to advance a religiously informed public philosophy .
To even begin to understand what religiously informed means requires answering a more basic question :
What exactly is a religious belief ?
In order to define the term in such a way that it is neither too broad nor too narrow , we must list all of the features that are true of all religious beliefs and true only of religious beliefs . *
While this may appear to be an obvious point , we are often surprised to find what has been pruned when a definition is stripped to its essential components .
Imagine , for instance , trying to define the concept of tree in a way that is limited to what is true for all trees but only true of trees .
Paring the explanation down in such a manner would not only be difficult but would leave us with a curious , and likely unsatisfying , definition .
What is true of trees will be equally so for religious beliefs .
After we cut away the foliage and underbrush that are features of specific religious beliefs we are likely to be unimpressed by the bare , slender reed that remains .
We should also expect to find that a minimally precise definition will have exposed the fact that some beliefs that we might have considered to be religious really are not , while finding that others are actually more religious than we might have imagined .
Nevertheless , while we might be surprised , unsatisfied , or unimpressed , the important point is that we have defined the term correctly .
Let us begin by examining to features that are commonly ( though mistakenly ) believed to be essential to religious beliefs :
Religious beliefs require a belief in God or gods 
One of the most common misconceptions about religious belief is that it requires a belief in God or a supreme being .
But such a feature would be too narrow because it would exclude polytheistic religions that do not recognize a supreme being .
In fact , we cannot include the concept of god or gods at all since some religions ( e.g. , Brahmin Hinduism , Theravada Buddhism ) are literally atheistic .
Religious beliefs are beliefs that induce worship or worship - related activities 
This feature is also defeated by the counterexamples of Brahmin Hinduism and Theravada Buddhism , neither of which practices worship .
The same is true for the religious beliefs of some ancient Greeks such as Aristotle and later the Epicureans who thought the gods neither knew about nor cared about humans .
They certainly felt no obligation to worship such apathetic beings .
Having excluded gods and worship from our definition , we are left with very few features that all religious beliefs could possibly share in common .
As philosopher Roy Clouser asks ,  What common element can be found in the biblical idea of God in Judaism , Christianity and Islam , in the Hindu idea of Brahman - Atman , in the idea of Dharmakaya in Mahayana Buddhism , and the idea of the Tao in Taoism ? 
The answer , he argues , is that every religious tradition considers something or other as divine and that all of them have a common denominator in the status of the divinity itself .
While many religions disagree on what is divine , they all agree on what it means to be divine .
The divine is simply whatever is unconditionally , nondependently real ; whatever is just there .
By contrast , everything nondivine ultimately depends for existence ( at least in part ) on whatever is divine .
This idea of nondependence or its equivalent is the shared feature in all religious beliefs .
Clouser uses this common element to formulate a precise definition : A belief is a religious belief provided that it is ( 1 ) a belief in something as divine or ( 2 ) a belief about how to stand in proper relation to the divine , where ( 3 ) something is believed to be divine provided it is held to be unconditionally nondependent .
The conclusion we can draw from this definition is that everyone holds , consciously or unconsciously , a religious belief .
For many of us , this will be as obvious as finding that our entire lives weve been speaking in prose .
Others , though , will have a reaction similar to those who argue that while everyone else may speak with an accent , they themselves do not .
Although it may be true that not everyone has a religion ( a system of religious beliefs , practices , and rituals ) , it would be rather absurd to believe that there is anyone who does not have a religious belief .
This can be shown by focusing on a theory or belief that many people mistakenly believe to be the reverse of religion : materialism .
Although the idea of materialism has been around since at least the ancient Greeks , it has only recently been considered to be a non-religious idea .
This is rather odd considering that it explicitly claims that matter ( or some other physical entity ) is unconditionally , nondependently real and draws conclusions about nature and humanity based on that belief .
Materialism , in fact , fits the definition more closely than some related beliefs , such as atheism .
Just as monotheism claims that the number of gods is one and polytheism holds the view that the number is more than one , atheism simply claims the number of gods is zero .
Because it merely takes a position on a nonessential element of religious belief , it would be erroneous to claim that atheism is inherently a religious belief .
Materialism , on the other hand , fits the definition in a categorical and clear - cut manner .
Clousers definition is neither too broad nor too narrow , is applicable to every known religious tradition , and is logically forceful .
Still , I dont suspect materialists to bend to its logic and admit that they too have a religious belief .
When pressed on this point many materialists tend to resort to special pleading or wrangling over the semantics of using the term religious . 
But as Clouser says ,  If you insist that whatever you believe to be divine is nt religious for you , youll have to admit that for those of us who hold such a belief and admit its religious character , your belief is going to appear to be religious for reasons that are far from arbitrary . 
In other words , call the belief what you want it certainly looks like a religious belief .
* The definition , ideas , and general explanation of concepts in this post are derived from the work of Roy Clouser .
I have , however , filtered it through my own interpretation and sprinkled in some of my own thoughts on the question .
Anything coherent , obvious , reasonable , and logical should be attributed to Clouser .
Anything incoherent , absurd , unreasonable , and illogical should be credited solely to me .
A man wakes up to find himself literally alone in the world , and goes about trying to find other survivors , as well as to find out what happened .
He suspects that a government research project he was involved in had something to do with the disappearance of everyone .
Eventually he finds several other people , and once they begin to trust each other they try to figure out why they were left on earth .

Senate Finance Committee members have been notified that the committee 's health reform bill was filed today .
S. 1796 weighs in at 1,502 pages , according to a Senate Republican leadership source .
It 's still not up yet on the Finance Committee website or Thomas.gov .
We 'll post a link as soon as we get one .
UPDATED :
Read the entire 1,502 page Finance bill .
Read a document outlining the concerns of Sens.
Kerry , Schumer , Menendez , Stabenow and Rockefeller that the tax on high - end plans will hit plans that are not overly generous .
Read Sen. Rockefeller 's expanded views on reform .
UPDATE 2 : The Senate Finance Committee filed its sweeping health care reform bill Monday and its release served largely to highlight the divisions among Democrats over the direction of reform .
The massive , 1,500 page bill is expected to serve as the backbone for Democratic reform efforts going forward and five senators expressed concerns about one of its main provisions , a 40 percent tax on high - end insurance plans .
The tax is designed to pay for reform and lower costs by making the so - called Cadillac plans less attractive for insurers to offer .
Under the bill , a plan that costs an individual more than $ 8,000 and a family more than $ 21,000 annually would be subject to the tax .
But Democratic Sens. John Kerry , Chuck Schumer , Robert Menendez , Debbie Stabenow and Jay Rockefeller are concerned that the threshold that defines a Cadillac plan is too low and will whack middle - class people .
“ We remain concerned that the thresholds are too low and will impact plans that are not overly generous and that in 2019 far too many plans will be impacted by the excise tax .
We plan to continue to work with Chairman Baucus on this issue to ensure that provision bends the cost curve , but not at the expense of middle - income Americans , ” the senators wrote in a one - page “ additional views ” document that was released with the bill .
The document is reminiscent of a dissent that is filed with the majority opinion in a court case .
Rockefeller filed his own 13 - page additional views document that spelled out his concerns , many of which he aired during the eight - day mark up of the bill .
The West Virginia Democrat remains concerns that the bill does not contain a public option ; that it does not uniformly apply insurance market reforms and that state - based exchanges designed to help people buy insurance will not be as effective as a single national one .
UPDATE 3 : It 's important to remember that the bill wo n't exist in this form for long .
Senate Majority Leader Reid and Sens. Max Baucus and Chris Dodd along with senior White House aides are merging the Finance and Health Committee legislation into one bill that will be considered on the floor of the Senate .
The behind - closed - doors dealings have drawn criticism from Republicans , particularly because President Obama had promised a transparent process and pledged to negotiate the health care bill on C - SPAN .

The top brass at the University of California say it's " nothing more than a publicity stunt " and a " tantrum " - and they might be right .
But when labor unions representing about 70,000 UC employees said Thursday that 96 percent of staff and faculty at all 10 campuses had signed a vote of no confidence in UC President Mark Yudof , the message was clear : Employees at the public university are angry .
" We do not have confidence in the current leadership , " said Tanya Smith , an editor at UC Berkeley and a spokeswoman for the University Professional & Technical Employees , one of a half - dozen UC labor unions that organized the no-confidence vote .
" The decisions they 've made have been very detrimental to UC . "
The vote of no confidence is just one sign that employees are unhappy .
Faculty members from every campus except UCSF are also calling for a systemwide walkout on Sept. 24 , when most of UC returns to school , to draw attention to California 's disinvestment in public universities .
The cash - strapped state is cutting its contribution to UC by $ 813 million , and what 's happening at the university is a microcosm of what 's happening across the entire economy :
At UC , prices are also rising while services are diminishing .
Pay has been cut .
Employee furloughs imposed .
People are losing their jobs .
At UC , Yudof is seen by many employees as sitting firmly on a goldmine that could wipe the troubles away : a $ 19 billion budget , of which just $ 3 billion comes from the state .
Yudof has said he is unable to use non-state funds - which come mainly from research grants and medical fees - to fill the budget gap because the money is legally committed to purposes other than salaries and general academic needs .
But many employees remain skeptical .
And when the governing Board of Regents approved raises for some campus administrators on the same day in July when they approved a furlough plan , their blood boiled .
" That money could be used to lower tuition and save jobs , " said Katherine Renfro , who works at the law library at UC Berkeley 's School of Law and represents the Coalition of University Employees .
" It 's upsetting . "
On Thursday , the union leaders tried to deliver their no-confidence statement to Yudof at his office at 111 Franklin St. in Oakland but were barred from entering the building .
" Basically , these are antics .
Nothing more than a publicity stunt , " said Dwaine B. Duckett , a UC vice president , as the employees chanted " Lay off Yudof ! " outside .
Duckett said that many employees had expressed support when Yudof was trying to formulate a fair furlough plan earlier this summer .
He said their suggestions helped create a graduated plan with those earning the most money , including Yudof , taking a 10 percent pay cut , and those earning least a 4 percent cut .
" We think it 's fair , " he said .
" You can throw a tantrum , or you can help solve the problem . "
By Robert Samuelson - September 7 , 2009
WASHINGTON --
The first Labor Day , held in New York City in 1882 , was less a celebration of the dignity of work than a demonstration in favor of the eight - hour day , down from the prevailing 10 to 12 hours .
Compared to then , American workers have come a long way .
Congress made Labor Day a national holiday in 1894 , and over the years , it evolved into a day off rather than a moment to reflect on the state of labor , broadly defined and extending beyond unions .
Well , not this year .
It 's the bleakest Labor Day since at least the early 1980s ( unemployment in September 1982 : 10.1 percent ) .
With the unemployment rate at 9.7 percent in August and expected to go higher , cheery news is scarce .
The Economic Policy Institute , a liberal think tank , has painted a statistical portrait of today 's labor market .
Here are some lowlights :
-- Since the recession 's start in December 2007 , the number of lost payroll jobs totals 6.9 million .
A third of today 's jobless have been unemployed more than six months , almost double the share a year ago and a post - World War II high .
-- Wage growth has slowed dramatically .
In the first half of 2007 , all private wages and salaries rose at an annual rate of 3.7 percent ; in the first half of 2009 , the increase was 1.3 percent .
-- The unemployment and " underemployment " rate is 16.8 percent -- this includes the officially unemployed plus all part - time workers who'd prefer full - time jobs , as well as discouraged and demoralized job - seekers who have stopped looking for work .
Job anxiety has also increased sharply , according to opinion surveys compiled by Karlyn Bowman of the conservative American Enterprise Institute .
A Gallup poll in August found that 31 percent of workers worried about being laid off , up from 15 percent a year earlier ; 32 percent thought their wages might be cut , up from 16 percent ; and 46 percent feared fringe benefits might be reduced , up from 27 percent .
What 's most ominous is not today 's job market ; it 's the outlook .
After the 1981 - 82 recession , unemployment dropped steadily from an annual average of 9.7 percent in 1982 to 7.5 percent in 1984 and 5.5 percent in 1988 .
The descent this time is expected to be much slower .
In 2014 , the unemployment rate will still average 7.6 percent , forecasts IHS Global Insight , which predicts a peak of 10 percent early next year .
Reducing unemployment requires an economic expansion fast enough to absorb today 's jobless plus the natural growth of the labor force .
Most forecasters expect a tepid recovery will only gradually dent unemployment , despite slowing labor force growth .
" The 1982 recession was largely caused by the desire to break the back of inflation , " says economist Nigel Gault of IHS .
" Once the ( Federal Reserve ) was comfortable it had broken inflation , it lowered interest rates , and economic growth took off . "
Interest - sensitive sectors -- autos and housing -- propelled recovery .
By contrast , today 's slump results from financial crisis , Gault says .
The Fed has already cut interest rates , which will probably go up .
As overborrowed households repay debt , their spending will be sluggish .
The weak recovery then retards new jobs .
The implications of prolonged high unemployment -- should it materialize -- have n't been fully explored .
People without work do n't acquire on - the - job skills .
Young college graduates are already having trouble getting work .
High unemployment could depress wage gains for years .
It could foster protectionism and long - term poverty .
" In a tight economy like the late 1990s , firms are more willing to take chances on more disadvantaged workers , " says Harvard economist Larry Katz .
EPI 's Lawrence Mishel thinks the effects on low - income families would be devastating ; the child poverty rate could jump from 18 percent in 2007 to 27 percent , he says .
Of course , today 's bleak economic forecasts could be wrong -- just as upbeat forecasts before the financial crisis were wrong .
Some economists are warming to greater optimism .
" Global manufacturers cut output too deeply , " says David Hensley of JPMorgan Chase .
" People thought we might be headed into another Depression . "
Here and abroad , he says , companies are reversing previous cutbacks .
" Businesses overshot .
They 'll snap back ( in hiring ) ; that will fuel consumer spending . "
One good omen :
In August , an index of online job vacancies rose 5 percent , reports the Conference Board .
Job creation has been an historic strength of the American economy .
Its capacity to remain so will increasingly frame the economic debate : between those who want more government and those who want less ; between those who fear budget deficits and those who favor more economic " stimulus " ; between those who see meager wage gains as impeding recovery and those who see them as encouraging hiring .
On Labor Day 2009 , future jobs are the nation 's gigantic question mark .
The likelihood of a huge ramp up in imports from Canada seems remote .
Canadian exports to the US require continued imports to the East Coast of Canada .
If imports of oil to Canada decline as world exports decline , US oil imports from Canada may also decline , because ramped up production from oil sands may not be enough to offset declines in production and imports elsewhere .
This inspired me to put together a few other somewhat related graphs , relating to oil exports and US imports .
Since Canada is such a tiny piece of world exports , but seems to be mentioned as a possible major source of future US imports , I have looked at it separately as well .
Matt Mushalik from Australia was good enough to send me this graph of world oil exports , calculated from new oil data provided by the EIA .
The major thing we note from Figure 1 is that the peak in oil exports seems to be in 2005 , with recent exports down less than two percent .
If oil production in 2009 is down , it is likely there will be a bigger drop off exports than in prior years .
The two major exporting countries are Saudi Arabia and Russia .
The graph seems to indicate that at least thorough 2008 , exports are relatively level for the two large exporters .
Figure 2 . US Net Oil Imports , based on EIA data .
* 2009 is partial year average .
In the US graph , the peak in imports is also in 2005 , with a much steeper downward slope than in the world export graph .
This would suggest that the US is being outbid elsewhere on imports .
On Figure 2 , I have shown US imports separately for the largest US sources .
The most consistent of the exporters over the period ( up until 2009 ) was Saudi Arabia .
Mexico 's exports have been declining , as have those of Venezuela .
The only country whose exports to the US have been increasing is Canada .
But if a person looks back at Figure 1 , Canada is only a thin light green line near the top of the graph , with relatively little net exports .
How can it be ramping up exports to the United States ?
I decided to look at this a bit further .
If one looks at Canadian data , using a combination of EIA and CAPP data , one discovers that Canada 's sources of oil look like this :
Figure 3 . Canada 's sources of oil , including its own production ( split between Oil Sands , Conventional , and other liquids ) and oil imported on the East Coast of Canada .
The way that Canada can be a major exporter to the US , even though it does n't produce a whole lot more than it consumes , is by importing oil on Canada 's east coast .
I have n't seen any exhibits showing where this is from , but various comments usually seem to suggest that this is mostly oil from the Middle - East .
Because of geography , it works out that Canada ends up consuming most ( or all ) of the imported oil itself .
The oil it exports to the US it exports in pipelines from Canada 's west , that come down the middle of the US , as shown in Figure 4 .
The way the current pipelines are configured , the US is almost a captive market for oil exports from Canada ( although it is possible to get oil back up to Montreal , for example ) .
Proposed pipelines would take oil to the West Coast of Canada , for export to China and the Far East .
Figure 5 . Canada 's total oil ( including imports from the East ) divided between Canadian consumption and Exports to US , based on EIA data .
The above graph takes the total oil available to Canada , including imports from the East Coast and divides it between Canadian consumption and net US exports .
It is clear that US exports have been growing more rapidly than Canadian consumption .
We can also break Figure 5 out to show how Canada 's imports affect what is available .
Figure 6 splits exports to the US ( from Figure 5 ) into two pieces -- those that are indirectly supported by Imports on the East Coast of Canada , and those corresponding to Canada 's net exports .
Figure 6 . Canada 's total oil ( including imports from the East ) divided between Canadian consumption and Net Exports , and Imports from the East Coast , based on EIA and CAPP data .
From Figure 6 we can see that more than half of US imports are available because of Canada 's East Coast imports .
Both Canada 's East Coast imports and its net exports have been increasing in recent years .
So what is likely to happen in the future to Canada 's oil production and exports ?
The Canadian Association of Oil Producers ( CAPP ) puts out some quite high estimates of future oil sands production .
Other types of Canadian petroleum production are expected to decline , partially offsetting the increase .
Cambridge Energy Research Associates ( CERA ) recently made forecasts of Oil Sands production .
( Their report is available free with registration at this link ! )
Figure 8 . CERA forecasts of Oil Sands production , from report cited above .
CERA 's two lower forecasts are below the one made by CAPP .
The " Barreling Ahead " forecast seems to be somewhat above the CAPP forecast .
My own view is that is technology and price will be the biggest determinants of the extent to which oil sands production is expanded .
Necessary price to expand production will depend on whether a carbon tax is imposed , and also on whether royalties remain at the current level or increase .
Both of these suggest that necessary price is likely to be quite high - likely $ 80 to $ 100 barrel or more , in the absence of technology improvements .
If the necessary price for expansion is quite high , I would expect that one of the two lower CERA projections would be most likely .
If there are big improvements in technology , production costs might be lower , and output might be higher .
Assuming production is in the range of CERA 's two lower projections , I put together a very rough forecast of what Canada 's sources of oil in the future might look like .
Figure 9 .
My rough estimate of Canada 's future sources of oil .
In this forecast , I show East Coast imports decreasing by 5 % a year ; conventional production decreasing by 3 % a year ; and other liquids decreasing by 2 % a year .
Oil sands production is assumed to increase by 6 % a year , so that by 2020 , it is 2.4 million barrels a day .
In this scenario , the total oil available to Canada stays more or less flat , dipping somewhat between now and 2020 .
If Canadian consumption continues to rise , the amount available for US exports will decline .
In Figure 10 , I show what US exports might look like , if Canadian consumption increases by 1.5 % per year , and the US gets the balance as exports .
Figure 10 .
A rough guess at what might be available for exports .
Figure 10 shows that even with Oil Sands expansion , there is a significant that chance that imports of oil from Canada will decline between now and 2020 .
One thing I should point out is that as I read Canadian commentary about Canadian oil , there seems to be growing unhappiness about NAFTA and the United States having almost a monopoly on oil produced in Western Canada .
Some of the comments I have read include the following .
( See for example Tar Sands by Andrew Nikiforuk ) .
• Why should Canada run the risk of a sudden decline in imports , and the US get secure oil ?
• The price the US pays is artificially low , because of the pipeline structure .
China would probably pay more .
• Oil sands producers should pay more in royalties than they are ( even with the recent increase ) .
• The US takes the oil Canada exports , and sells gasoline for $ 2.50 a gallon .
Canadians now pay $ 1.00 a liter at the same time US citizens pay $ 2.50 a gallon .
It is n't fair that Canadians are taxed to keep consumption down , but the US is n't .
• When Canadians export oil to the US , the Americans get all of the refining jobs .
If Canada kept the oil in Canada , it could keep the refining jobs for itself .
• Why should Canada get hit with a charge in our carbon emission calculations for oil it sends to the US ?
If Canada is going to be charged for the emissions , it should at least be using it itself .
I expect these beliefs will become more widespread , as Canadians begin to understand the peak oil situation .
Even now , there is a fair amount of writing indicating that if Canadians had their way , they would keep the oil they are producing for themselves , or sell it elsewhere .
If the US decides because of greenhouse gasses that it does n't want Canadian oil , it seems to me that that decision would have little bearing on whether Canada produces oil from the oil sands .
Many Canadians would be more than happy to get rid of us as competitors for their oil .
The result would be that we would get less oil piped to us in the mid-section of our country .
Canada might import less oil from abroad , and we theoretically would be able to buy that oil directly ourselves .
One issue might be logistics , though .
Pipelines from Canada serve the Midwest .
A shortfall in oil would likely hit the ends of the pipelines ( and trucked supply lines ) in the Midwest .
I would expect that the ones hit disproportionately would be Midwestern farmers .
It is not clear that it would be easy to get alternative petroleum supply to the farmers .
It seems like oil piped up from the Gulf Coast would likely be inadequate as a substitute for a shortfall .
This would especially be the case if an overall shortfall occurred because of a hurricane .
It seems to me that we are likely looking at a reduction of imports from Canada in the next ten years , even under the best of circumstance ( unless a huge improvement in technology allows a big ramp up of production from the oil sands , and we decide we can live with the CO2 emissions ) .
If a reduction in Canadian imports in likely , we should probably be thinking now about rationing schemes that would protect the farmers from loss of diesel fuel , if there is an overall shortfall in supply .
The Wicks report on Energy Security recently published in Britain gives a very different impression about oil sands exports .
The Wicks report paragraph 2.27 says
It is expected that over half of all the oil consumed in the world in 2030 will be traded across national borders .
. .
In contrast North America becomes much less dependent on imports , dropping by almost a half , as production from Canadian oil sands increases .
If the authors would sit down and look at all of the pieces , I doubt that they would come to any such conclusion , in the absence of a dramatic change in technology .
CERA 's two lower forecasts are showing 2030 oil sands production to be similar to 2020 production .
If oil sands production is similar , and other pieces in Figure 9 are lower , Canada 's total oil available will drop by further by 2030 .
If its consumption continues to rise , as in Figure 10 , the amount available for export in 2030 will be lower yet than I am forecasting for 2020 ( which in turn is lower than now ) .
In 2008 , oil sands production was 1,213,000 barrels a day , according to CAPP .
I am forecasting it to approximately double by 2020 .
Production would have to ramp up a whole lot more than this to make a meaningful difference to North American oil use .
If you 're a Sidekick user who has been waiting out the past week 's data outage in hopes of a happy ending , you 're not going to like the joint press release that Microsoft and T - Mobile put out on the matter this past Saturday .
The release contains a line that no service provider ever wants to see in print with their name attached to it : " Regrettably , based on Microsoft / Danger 's latest recovery assessment of their systems , we must now inform you that personal information stored on your device — such as contacts , calendar entries , to - do lists or photos — that is no longer on your Sidekick almost certainly has been lost as a result of a server failure at Microsoft / Danger . "
Ouch .
Any of your data that 's on Microsoft 's servers is just gone , and the only possible backup of it is whatever 's cached in your device 's local memory — so do not allow your device to lose power , T - Mobile and Microsoft / Danger warn in the press release 's headline , or you 'll never see your data again .
As a make - good for the inconvenience of denying you service for seven days and then losing your data due to a failure to back it up properly , T - Mobile is offering customers one month of free data usage .
If the irate response on various bulletin boards is any indication , T - Mobile could 've just given customers the finger and it would 've had the same effect .
Of course , it 's not clear what could possibly be done as a make - good for a blunder of this magnitude , since what customers really want is not free data but their data , restored back to their accounts .
This outage and subsequent data loss is just the latest , and probably the most dramatic , black eye yet for " cloud computing , " since users falsely assumed that if data was " in the cloud " then it was stored with enough redundancy and fault tolerance to render such a massive data loss impossible .
Of course , most of the affected Sidekick users will probably fault the responsible service providers , and not " the cloud , " but Sidekick users are n't the demographic with whom the cloud 's reputation needs the most help .
What probably has execs at HP , Sun , Intel , IBM , Rackspace , Amazon , Google , and the rest of the growing list of cloud infrastructure and service providers slapping their foreheads in frustration this weekend is the fact that cloud services already labor under a stigma of unreliability with potential enterprise customers .
In a number of cloud computing threads in the Ars Server Room , and in the handful of webinars that we 've done on the topic in recent months , reliability is the number one knock that IT pros have against anything " cloud " - related .
Part of the issue is that the IT function has a natural distrust of any systems that it does n't own and control , especially when those systems present themselves as a black box on which IT will build something for internal use .
But , anecdotally , these periodic , high - profile service disruptions seem to loom fairly large in enterprise perceptions of the cloud 's reliability , which is why this latest data loss is likely to translate into a revenue loss for more than just T - Mobile and Microsoft / Danger .
It 's also likely that having Microsoft 's name attached to this blow - up exacerbates the damage .
There 's a fairly standard tradeoff between agility and reliability that 's presumed when evaluating cloud services .
If your developers opt to live on the bleeding edge by using new cloud services from unproven providers , they 'll have to be able to tolerate some downtime ; it just goes with the territory .
But Microsoft 's is not a new name in computing , and basic contact , calendar , and messaging are n't cutting - edge cloud services .
Data loss of this scope just was n't supposed to be possible .
So it 's easy to imagine that other blue - chip names will have to work extra hard in the coming months when pitching their cloud services to skeptical IT decision makers .
Angeles National Forest , in the hills outside of Los Angeles currently has several wildfires tearing through it , the largest of which - named the Station Fire - has so far burned over 140,000 acres , destroyed nearly 100 structures , and claimed the lives of two firefighters whose vehicle fell from a road into a steep canyon .
Evacuation orders are in place for thousands in communities around the city , and residents of Los Angeles itself are contending with thick smoke and ash hanging in the air , causing air quality to drop to unhealthful levels in many parts .
Currently , the Station Fire is estimated to be 22 % contained , and favorable weather appears to be aiding the efforts of the firefighters .

Native American activist Leonard Peltier has been in prison for more than 12,226 days , more than 33 years .
His is one of the longest ordeals of any political prisoner in human history .
With him , our souls have suffered .
Our bodies ache for his freedom .
Today , July 28 , 2009 , Peltier goes before the Federal Parole Commission in Lewisburg , Pennsylvania .
All over the world , beginning in the wee hours of the morning in the South Pacific , prayer vigils , peace marches , ecumenical gatherings , group chantings and all forms of individual meditation accompany this hearing .
It is one of the most important tests of the new Obama Administration .
Peltier was charged more than a third of a century ago with the murder of two FBI agents .
The circumstances of the prosecution , and the legal history of the case , involve thousands of pages of missing evidence , compromised witnesses and procedures so twisted as to stagger the imagination and leave any sense of fair play and reasonable jurisprudence buried in the dust .
Through it all , Peltier has maintained his dignity and strength with astonishing grace .
He will be 65 years old in September , having spent more than half his life behind bars .
His body is wracked with prison - related ailments .
He has great grandchildren he has never seen .
Yet his writings remain politically astute , spiritually compelling and unfailingly compassionate .
Supporters believe the time is “ favorable ” for his release .
The four - member Parole Commission that will weigh his plea is chaired by Isaac Fulwood , Jr. ( http://www.usdoj.gov/uspc/fulwood.htm ) originally appointed by George W. Bush , elevated to the chair in May by Barack Obama .
Obama himself has the power through various legal means to end Peltier ’s torture and make him a free man .
Peltier ’s defense attorney , Eric Seitz , has expressed optimism that the Commission will grant Peltier his freedom , especially given Leonard ’s exemplary behavior in prison , the utter collapse of the case against him , his health , age and other factors , not least of which may be a changed political and cultural climate .
But Seitz has warned in an interview with Amy Goodman on Democracy Now of prior disappointments ( http://www.democracynow.org/2009/7/27/parole_hearing_to_be_held _tuesday ) .
Millions of supporters worldwide have suffered with Leonard over the decades as with no other political prisoner .
His case stands as an emblem of the tortured relationship between the US Government and the Native American community , says Tony Gonzalez ( of the Comca ' ac - Chicano tribe ) of the American Indian Movement ( http://www.aimovement.org ) founded , he says , 41 years ago today .
Meaningful steps toward healing that relationship will be very hard to take until Leonard Peltier is free to re-join his family .
This is a critical moment in the Obama Era .
Bill Clinton was thoroughly briefed by numerous people very close to the Peltier case , but did not free him .
Constitutional scholar Barack Obama is also well aware of this horrific imprisonment .
Peltier ’s freedom marks a monumental corner that must be turned .
For those millions who have ached through the terrible injustice and sheer physical and spiritual pain of this imprisonment , it is a moment of liberation that must come .
Only a strongly supportive political climate can guarantee it happens .
Call your Senators and Representatives as well as the White House and Parole Board , newspapers and radio shows , web friends and neighbors down the street .
Meditate , pray , march , dance , sing , shout , laugh , cry …. do whatever you can to help move this man out of his jail cell and into the open air after 33 hellish years .
This imprisonment must end .
Rarely has it been more true that freeing a single human being will help free us all .

Obama chooses John Brennan , who was at the heart of Bush 's intelligence effort , to play a key role in interrogation policies .
Bush CIA insider key to Obama plan
President Barack Obama has tried to distance himself in every way from Bush - era interrogation policies , stripping the lead role in questioning detainees from the CIA and banning the harshest tactics critics have decried as torture .
But now , Obama has chosen a man who was at the heart of Bush ’s intelligence effort to play a key role in overseeing the new administration ’s own interrogation policies : John Brennan , a 25 - year CIA veteran who was privy to the extreme tactics Obama has declared off limits .

The White House on Tuesday refused to discuss Brennan ’s exact role in the new interrogation policy .
But a former CIA official familiar with the situation said Brennan — Obama ’s top counterterrorism adviser — will head up a National Security Council team overseeing a new Justice Department interrogation corps , specifically chosen to interrogate the most important terror detainees .
The new interrogation unit will be led by the FBI , with the CIA in a supporting role .
This is n’t the first time Brennan has drawn controversy .
When Brennan ’s name was floated as a leading candidate for CIA director during Obama ’s transition , liberal activists loudly questioned the possible choice , and Brennan later withdrew .
Brennan himself has defended his role in an administration that has repeatedly distanced itself from the Bush - era tactics — saying he objected to the use of waterboarding on terror suspects , both in his time at the CIA and today .
“ I personally was always opposed to waterboarding and certain types of techniques , and I think there were people who supported me in that and were able to acknowledge that I was a critic of that while I was in the agency , ” Brennan said earlier this month in an interview for an ABC News podcast .
Several former CIA officials said Brennan , a former senior aide to CIA director George Tenet and later head of a national center to coordinate intelligence , was clearly in the loop when the so - called Enhanced Interrogation Techniques were approved in 2002 .
At the time , Brennan served as the CIA ’s deputy executive director .
Brennan ’s critics contend assigning him to oversee future interrogation policy is the wrong approach for an administration trying to signal a clear break from the previous White House ’s approach .
“ He supported everything with great enthusiasm — apparently he did make claims in house … against waterboarding , but he was defending detentions , defending extraordinary renditions , enhanced interrogation techniques and secret prisons , ” said Melvin Goodman , a former intelligence analyst who spent 20 years at the CIA .
“ Giving it to him shows that Obama is politically deaf or does n’t care … Everything about this is wrong . ”
A former FBI terrorism agent , Jack Cloonan , said Brennan ’s presence at the top ranks of the CIA during the extreme interrogations will impact his role in the new apparatus .
“ I think everyone understands he has a cloud over his head … .
He clearly knew at least part of what was going on .
I think that is a concession maybe to the Agency , ” Cloonan said .
However , he said he still supports the new arrangement and believes the prominent role for the FBI will ensure that future interrogations do n’t go too far .
But a former colleague said he thinks Brennan , who knows Arabic and also served as a CIA station chief in Saudi Arabia , is a good fit to oversee future interrogation efforts .
“ He ’s a good choice to do it , ” the ex-official said .
“ At some point , someone has to stop taking people out of play just because they were somewhere near this program .
That ’s just not right . ”
White House spokesmen did not respond to requests to interview Brennan for this article , nor would they say whether Brennan was interviewed for the 2004 CIA Inspector General ’s report which examined the Bush - era interrogations .
The report was released Monday .
Former CIA officials and others say Brennan was never in a decision - making role in regards to which interrogation tactics to use , but as the deputy to the agency ’s executive director from 2001 to 2003 , was in the midst of the discussions about which tactics to use and what to do with the intelligence gained .
“ You know a lot in that role .
Lots of stuff goes through your office , ” a former CIA official said .
“ He was privy to or aware of every policy that was carried out but was not in a policymaking role on detainee matters , ” another former CIA executive said .
Obama aides are stressing that the role of the National Security Council in future interrogations will be limited and supervisory in nature .
“ The White House is not going to be involved in any of the tactical , operational decisions that are made , ” a senior administration official said Monday during a telephone briefing on the new interrogation unit .
From 1999 to 2001 , Brennan was chief of staff to CIA Director George Tenet .
Brennan then moved into the deputy executive director slot before becoming the first director of the Interagency Terrorist Threat Integration Center in 2003 .
He retired in 2005 and went to the private sector before joining Obama ’s NSC earlier this year .
Brennan has said his past opposition to some of the tactics is lost on his critics .
“ It has been immaterial to the critics that I have been a strong opponent of many of the policies of the Bush administration such as the pre-emptive war in Iraq and coercive interrogation tactics , to include waterboarding , ” Brennan wrote .
While Brennan ’s opposition to waterboarding was known to some in CIA circles , his attitude at the time toward other enhanced interrogation practices , such as sleep deprivation and confinement boxes , is more murky .
In the recent ABC interview , Brennan said he was in agreement with Obama ’s decision to limit future interrogations to the techniques listed in the Army Field Manual , but the ex-CIA official stopped short of saying he has always subscribed to that view .
“ The president has decided that none of these enhanced interrogation techniques will continue , ” Brennan said .
“ My views , I believe , are entirely consistent right now with where the president is on that issue . ”
The White House said Monday that Obama will leave in place the ban he ordered in January on the enhanced techniques but continue renditions and transfers of terrorist suspects for detention abroad .
In a 2007 interview with the New Yorker , Brennan seemed to defend the aggressive interrogations .
“ Would the U.S. be handicapped if the CIA was not , in fact , able to carry out these types of detention and debriefing activities ?
I would say , yes , ” he said .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) -
The future of wind farms and hybrid cars may well hinge on what happens to a 55 - acre ( 22.3 - hectare ) hole in the ground at the edge of California ’s high desert .

The open - pit mine at Mountain Pass , California , holds the world ’s richest proven reserve of “ rare earth ” metals , a family of minerals vital to producing the powerful , lightweight magnets used in the engines of Toyota Motor Corp ’s Prius and other hybrid vehicles as well as generators in wind turbines .
Seeking to replace China as the leading supplier of these scarce materials , Colorado - based Molycorp Minerals LLC plans to reopen its long - idled quarry to resume extracting and refining thousands of tons of rare earth ore in the next few years .
Last month , Molycorp reached a joint venture deal with Arnold Magnetic Technologies Corp. of Rochester , New York , to make “ permanent ” magnets from rare metals at Mountain Pass .
Backed by hundreds of millions of dollars from equity investors , including Goldman Sachs , Molycorp aims to avert a looming rare - earths supply crunch that threatens to muffle the green - technology boom .
“ The world has been looking for an alternative to these rare - earth permanent magnets for over 20 years , and one has not been found , ” Molycorp chief executive Mark Smith said .
“ What Molycorp is proposing as a business strategy is to fill that supply chain and go all the way from mining to magnets . ”
Success hinges on Molycorp ’s ability to operate the mine and its processing facilities much more efficiently than in the past .
At the peak of its operations two decades ago , the mine produced 20,000 tonnes of rare earth oxides a year , accounting for the entire U.S. supply and about a third of the world ’s total .
Most of the rest came from China .
CHINA FACTOR
But as Chinese production and exports grew through the 1990s , rare earth prices worldwide plunged , undercutting business for Molycorp , then owned by oil company Unocal .
Mountain Pass operations came under further pressure after a 1996 wastewater spill .
Mining there ceased in 2002 when Molycorp ’s old permit expired .
“ Most companies that were in the business stopped producing because it was n’t profitable anymore , ” said James Hedrick , a rare earths specialist for the U.S. Geological Survey .
Refinement of previously extracted ore at Mountain Pass resumed on a small scale in 2007 , two years after Unocal was acquired by Chevron Corp .
Last year , Molycorp was sold to a group of private investors .
Chinese rare earth production , meanwhile , has swelled to about 97 percent of global supplies , or 139,000 tonnes of refined material in 2008 , experts say .
Output is expected to reach 160,000 tonnes a year by the middle of the next decade .
But global demand is climbing faster , driven by the clamor for clean energy and clean cars , leading to projections of a 40,000 - tonne annual shortfall by 2015 .
“ We ’re reaching a crunch point , ” said Jack Lifton , a commodities analyst and leading authority on rare metals .
Rare earths go into hundreds of gadgets and consumer goods , usually in minuscule amounts .
Some products use more .

The electric motor in Toyota ’s market - leading hybrid car , the Prius , requires 1 kilogram ( 2.2 lb ) of neodymium , the key component in the alloy for permanent magnets .
And each Prius battery uses 10 to 15 kg ( 22 - 33 lb ) of another rare earth , lanthanum , according to Lifton .
“ The Prius automobile is the biggest user of rare earths of any object in the world , ” he said .
CRUNCH POINT
With China seen sharply curtailing its rare earth exports to feed rapid expansion of its own industries , the projected global shortage will only grow more acute .
Looking to meet the challenge is Molycorp , with a new 30 - year mining plan given final approval in the summer of 2004 following a 15 - year regulatory review .
Smith said his company has since been perfecting an advanced extraction process that will allow Molycorp to nearly double the amount of rare earth metals it can pull from the bastnaesite ore it mines .
“ It means I do n’t have to extract as much ore from the surface pit to have the equivalent amount of material for sale to a customer , ” he said .
“ It lowers our costs tremendously . ”
Plans call for mining to resume at Mountain Pass by 2012 , at the rate of about 1,000 tons of ore a day , enough to produce 20,000 tonnes of rare earth oxides for sale each year .
Smith said the mine has approval to double that volume in time .
“ If we put our facilities into the fully permitted production rates , we could come very close to meeting the needs of most of the rest of the world , ” he said .
But Molycorp first needs to drain some 95 million gallons ( 360 million litres ) of water that has filled the pit ’s bottom and remove surface rock covering the ore , a two - year process .
Mountain Pass is considered the world ’s richest reserve of its kind , with ore deposits averaging a concentration of rare earths above 9 percent .
Most deposits around the world outside China report ore grades under 5 percent , Smith said .
It ’s also the largest outside of China , estimated to hold 20 million to 47 million tonnes of ore .
The mine is further blessed with negligible traces of uranium and thorium -- two radioactive elements often found together with rare earths that can make recovery of them more costly .
Mountain Pass , not far from Las Vegas , first opened in the 1940s , when rare earths were mined for use in tracer ammunition for the military and the flints of cigarette lighters .
With the advent of color television in the 1960s , Mountain Pass became the world ’s only supplier of europium , used to produce red picture tones .
By the 1980s , lanthanum , neodymium and other rare earths were being mined for new discoveries in batteries and magnets .
Molycorp is ahead of the game but not alone .
A number of companies are seeking to develop rare earth deposits elsewhere , including two promising sites in western Canada and two more in Australia that have attracted Chinese interest .

One of my staff ’s biggest fears about going out of town and leaving us is what happens if the house catches fire ?
This is probably a big concern of yours too !
Pugsley are I are not dumb .
If the house caught fire , we would call 911 .
DUH .
( They just do n’t give us enough credit , do they ? )
But , if for some reason we could not get to the phone , it would be nice to know that when the Fire Department does come , they would know we were inside !
So , we ’ve added Emergency Pet Rescue Window Decals to our Rescue Store .
Before we did this , though , we did some research to see if they are really worthwhile .
Some people say that Firefighters rarely pay attention to this but there are so many stories of rescues made because the Firefighters knew there were furry friends inside .
So I asked a couple of real Firefighters to tell me what they thought of the window stickers and both of them agreed that they were very helpful so they knew to be on the look out for pets .
Whew !
As a side note , some departments even have pet - sized oxygen masks to help once the pets are rescued .
Here is a nice story about Michigan businessman , Harold Bruns of Invisible Fence of Southwest Michigan , who donated oxygen masks to his area fire stations .
What a nice , caring man .
So if you do n’t have one of these window stickers or need a new one , check them out !
Proceeds go to the rescue organization of the month so it goes to helping your pets and helping many other pets in need !
Thanks to everyone who has purchased magnets and stickers so far .
We are so excited to have this additional fundraising channel for the FURPOWER organizations .
Let us know if you have any ideas for other Rescue Store items .

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has urged students in the Democratic Republic of Congo to speak out against the country 's deadly civil conflict .
On the latest leg of her seven- nation African tour , she said students could write a new chapter in history .
Violence flared in the country 's mineral - rich east last year , raising fears of a return to civil war .
She said people must condemn the mass rapes reportedly carried out by rebels and government troops there .
Congo has been wracked by violence since a 1998 insurrection led by rebels linked to Rwanda and Uganda that has left more than four million people dead .
The attacks have increased since January when an offensive was launched by Congolese troops with support from the United Nations peacekeeping force .
This year alone , an estimated 600 civilians have been killed , 800,000 forced from their homes and thousands of women and girls raped by rebels and government forces .
Speaking in the Congolese capital Kinshasa , Mrs Clinton urged students to put pressure on the authorities to take action .
" You are the ones who have to speak out .
Speak out to end the corruption , the violence , the conflict that for too long have eroded the opportunities across this country , " she said .
On Tuesday Mrs Clinton will meet President Joseph Kabila in the eastern town of Goma , where she will push the issue of ending human rights atrocities including mass rapes .
Basketball philanthropy
She faced a variety of questions .
Basketball star Dikembe Mutombo runs a charitable foundation
At one point a student inquired about the views of her husband , former president Bill Clinton , about a Chinese loan to DR Congo .
She replied : " My husband is not the secretary of state , I am . "
On her arrival in Kinshasa , Mrs Clinton visited a hospital , founded by an American basketball star , Dikembe Mutumbo , who is Congolese by origin .
The BBC's East Africa correspondent Will Ross says the modern facility is in stark contrast to the rest of the country 's dilapidated health system .

Clinton helps South Africa bloom
Send us your comments
Our correspondent says the US and the rest of the international community realise that if stability can be brought to DR Congo it could have a positive impact on a vast swathe of Africa .
The country borders eight other nations , and its conflicts have frequently spilled over its borders .
The US is a major aid donor and has helped the country in some of its recent successes like the elections of 2006 and the thawing of relations with Rwanda .
Mrs Clinton arrived in Congo from Angola , where she met President Jose Eduardo dos Santos .
She said Mr dos Santos had pledged to hold long - delayed presidential elections as soon as this could be done .
Mrs Clinton has already visited South Africa and Kenya as part of the trip - her longest foreign tour since taking office .
She is also due to visit Nigeria , Liberia and Cape Verde .

Actor Nicolas
Cage gestures during the news conference for the film " Bad Lieutenant : Port Of Call New Orleans " at the 34th Toronto International Film Festival in Toronto September 15 , 2009 .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Actor Nicolas
Cage filed a $ 20 million lawsuit against his former business manager on Friday , accusing him of negligence and fraud that sent the “ National Treasure ” star “ down a path toward financial ruin . ”
Cage claimed that his recently - fired business manager had failed to pay taxes when they were due and had placed him in speculative and risky real estate investments “ resulting in ( the actor ) suffering catastrophic losses . ”
In a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court and first obtained by celebrity web site TMZ.com , Cage said he had now been forced to “ sell major assets and investments at a significant loss ” because of the actions of his business advisor and accountant over the past seven years .
The lawsuit said the advisor had also failed to alert Cage to the fact that his money was running out , and had over - extended his lines of credit with banks .
The former business manager , Samuel Levin , could not be reached for comment on Friday .
Cage , 45 , is one of Hollywood ’s most prolific actors with more than 50 movies to his name , including an Oscar - winning role as an alcoholic in “ Leaving Las Vegas ” and action movies such as “ Face / Off ” and “ Gone in Sixty Seconds ” .
Cage earned some $ 40 million last year according to Forbes.com and has six movies expected to hit theaters in the next two years .
He was recently hit with a claim for $ 6.6 million dollars in back income taxes , interest and penalties by U.S. authorities .
Cage said he did not realize the extent of his problems until September 2008 when he hired a new business manager .
He asked for $ 20 million in damages , saying that his reputation has been “ irreparably tarnished . ”

In the past couple weeks , two major online service providers , Blogger and Flickr , announced improvements to their DMCA takedown policies .
EFF had a hand in both : Blogger contacted us to discuss their improvements , and we contacted Flickr to raise some concerns we had .
We 're glad to see these improvements , which make the process more transparent for users and minimize the collateral damage to free speech that can sometimes be the result when a copyright owner sends a takedown notice .
Blogger 's improvements came in response to complaints from MP3 bloggers , who sometimes saw entire blog posts disappear thanks to one allegedly infringing link .
These bloggers were unable to determine which links in their blog posts drew the takedown notice ( many of the links were sent by record labels seeking exposure ) , and thus unable to edit and restore their posts .
Blogger has responded by unveiling a forms - based takedown process that should make it easier for the service to parse what , exactly , in a blog post is allegedly infringing .
Also , the move to electronic takedowns will speed up Blogger 's ability to forward notices to Chilling Effects , where users can review them .
Most importantly , rather than deleting the entire blog post in response to one link , Blogger now puts the post into " draft " mode , thereby allowing the user to edit out the link and restore the remainder of the post .
These are all good steps toward minimizing the " collateral damage " caused by a DMCA takedown notice aimed at links , rather than other original content .
( We remain concerned , however , that Blogger still is n't directly forwarding the takedown notice to the user -- it seems odd to force them to rely on Chilling Effects . )
Flickr also introduced a number of improvements to the DMCA takedown process , motivated by the recent controversy surrounding the Obama - Joker image posted by Flickr user Firas Alkhateeb .
Most importantly , when a photo is removed , its title , description , comments , tags , and notes will remain available ( YouTube could learn from this example ! ) .
This is an important improvement that preserves the discussion about the allegedly infringing material , something that a copyright owner is not entitled to censor with a DMCA takedown notice .
Flickr will also restore the original image to its original context in response to a DMCA counter - notice , another important improvement .
Too often , takedowns are sent for illegitimate censorial reasons , and if the user elects to submit a counter - notice , she should be able to restore the material to its original location , complete with its original context .
Kudos to Blogger and Flickr for taking the concerns of their users seriously , even as they comply with the DMCA takedown notices that they receive from copyright owners .
Their actions raise the bar for other service providers , hopefully encouraging users to vote with their feet and abandon services that are sloppy about handling DMCA takedown notices .
Terry Herbert says he plans to buy a bungalow with his share of the reward Discovering the UK 's largest haul of Anglo - Saxon treasure has been the highlight of Terry Herbert 's 18 - year hobby .
" People laugh at metal detectorists , " said the unemployed 55 - year - old , who stands to make a fortune .
" I 've had people go past and go ' beep beep , he 's after pennies ' .
Well no , we are out there to find this kind of stuff and it is out there . "
He made the find in a field near his Staffordshire home with a detector he bought in 1995 .
Experts have said the collection of 1,500 gold and silver pieces , which may date back to the seventh century , was unparalleled in size .
One has suggested the find was the hobbyist 's equivalent of uncovering Tutankhamen 's tomb .
" I just flushed all over when he said that .
The hairs on the back of my neck stood up , you just never expect this , " Mr Herbert said .
Lucky touch Mr Herbert , from Burntwood , said he dug up so much gold over five days in July he was seeing the precious metal in his sleep .
He bought his first metal detector for £ 2.50 in a car boot sale .
A member of of Bloxwich Research and Metal Detecting Club , he is known for having a lucky touch .
Hundreds of gold artefacts were discovered buried in the field
But he said the find went far beyond past triumphs .
" My mates at the metal detecting club always say if there is a gold coin in a field I will be the one to find it .
" I dread to think what they 'll say when they hear about this . "
The financial worth of the hoard may take months to assess , but its market value will eventually go to Mr Herbert and the owner of the farmland where it was found .
" It 's been more fun than winning the lottery , " Mr Herbert said .
He plans to spend some of his share of the Crown 's reward on a bungalow .
" I have this phrase that I say sometimes ; ' spirits of yesteryear take me where the coins appear ' , but on that day I changed coins to gold , " he said .
" I do n't know why I said it that day , but I think somebody was listening and directed me to it . "

An accounting problem in the way some greenhouse gas emissions are calculated could critically hobble efforts to reduce them in coming years as nations move to combat global warming , scientists warn in a new report .
The accounting irregularity even gives the impression that clearing the world ’s forests , which absorb and thereby diminish heat - trapping carbon dioxide , is good for the climate , the scientists write in an article published Friday in the journal Science .
The problem boils down to this :
In emission calculations , all fuel derived from plants and other organic sources  including ethanol  is generally treated as if it has no effect on carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , even though though biofuels do emit carbon dioxide when burned .
This might make sense if the source of the fuel were , say , a crop of corn grown on barren land specifically for use as fuel , because the crop would have absorbed carbon dioxide as it grew , offsetting what it emits when ultimately burned .
UNITED NATIONS ( CNN ) --
Drawing on 2006 remarks in which he compared former U.S. President George Bush to the devil , Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , speaking at the United Nations Thursday , said , " It does n't smell like sulfur anymore . "
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez spoke highly of President Obama at the United Nations on Thursday .
In a rambling speech at the U.N. General Assembly , Chavez spoke highly of current President Obama , saying he is an " intelligent man " and comparing him to President John F. Kennedy .
" I hope God will protect Obama from the bullets that killed Kennedy , " he said .
" I hope Obama will be able to look and see , genuinely see , what has to be seen and bring about a change . "
Three years ago , Chavez spoke at the gathering the day after Bush spoke , and said the lectern " still smells of sulfur . "
But on Thursday he looked around the podium and said , " It does n't smell of sulfur .
It 's gone .
No , it smells of something else .
It smells of hope . "
He did , however , criticize some U.S. policies , questioning whether there are " two Obamas . "
Watch Chavez speak at the U.N. General Assembly »
Chavez accused the Pentagon of being behind the ousting of Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya in a military - backed coup in June .
" American soldiers knew about the coup and supported it , " he said .
" Hence the contradiction that Obama has to face .
Are there two Obamas ?
Obama spoke here yesterday .
Does he have a double ?
...
Let 's hope the one we heard yesterday will prevail .
Let us hope .
That 's what the world needs . "
The United States and Brazil have said they support dialogue between Zelaya and de facto President Roberto Micheletti , centered on the San Jose Accord brought about through the mediation of Costa Rican President Oscar Arias and the Organization of American States mission .
That deal calls for Zelaya to be restored to office .

" The U.S. government , and this is strange , has not recognized the fact that a military coup d'etat has occurred , " Chavez said .
" There is some friction between the State Department and the Pentagon . "
He said the coup was engineered by the Honduran bourgeoisie , " four or five wealthy , powerful families . "
Chavez also called for the United States to lift what he called the " savage , murderous blockade " on Cuba , and was critical of plans to open U.S. military bases in Colombia , saying what the nation needs instead is aid to lift itself out of its civil war .
In addition , Chavez criticized capitalism and extolled the virtues of socialism , saying it is " the road to salvation for this planet . "
He spoke for almost exactly an hour , less than the hour and 36 minutes Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi used on Wednesday .
The Venezuelan president joked that he would not speak as long as Gadhafi , but said he planned to speak as long as Obama .
Asked to expand on his " two Obamas " comment at a news conference after his speech , Chavez said , " I think that one of the serious failures of the United States has been that , for a long time , it has underestimated and undervalued Latin America and the Caribbean .
... I hope that Obama turns around the vision of the White House and the Department of State of Latin America .
They cannot continue to mistreat us . "
He said one Obama spoke about peace in addressing the General Assembly , yet has seven U.S. military bases in Colombia .
" There 's a double somewhere , " he said .
Asked by a reporter about the closures of television stations in Venezuela , Chavez said it was " a big lie " and asked her to provide an example .
She asked about RCT , or Radio Caracas Television .
Chavez told her the station broadcasts every day , but that a contract , or concession , had expired for its " open signal " and was not renewed .
" Never in Venezuela do we have as much freedom of expression as we do now , " he said .
But , he asked , " What would happen here in the United States if CNN and other stations supported a coup ?
Not only would they be shut down , but their owners would have been taken to the electric chair . "

" Is this a joke ? " splutters one of the comments underneath the YouTube video of a new 30 - second TV advert that has started being aired in a handful of US states over the past few days telling viewers that " CO2 is green " .
Sadly not , it seems .
In a slick attempt to undermine the US Environmental Protection Agency 's recent ruling that CO2 should now be classified as a pollutant because rising levels of the gas in the atmosphere will " endanger public health or welfare " , a former oil industry executive has stumped up some of his cash to pay for these adverts to be shown in Montana and New Mexico .
The ultimate aim of the advert , though , is to derail the forthcoming vote in the Senate on the Waxman - Markey cap - and - trade bill , which now appears as if it might even impact on vital UN climate talks in Copenhagen this December .
So who 's behind " CO2 is green " and this advert ?
One of its founders is H Leighton Steward who , until his retirement in 2000 , was the vice chairman of Burlington Resources , a Houston - based oil and gas company bought by ConocoPhillips in 2006 .
Steward received the American Petroleum Institute 's Gold Medal for Distinguished Achievement in 2001 and remains an honorary director of the oil industry lobby group .
In other words , we can conclude that this man boasts a particular pedigree within the oil industry .
The Washington Post ( which admits it has taken a half - page advert from the " CO2 is green " group ) is reporting that Steward , along with some associates , is now trying to establish the group as a charity :
Steward has joined forces with Corbin J Robertson Jr , chief executive of and leading shareholder in Natural Resource Partners , a Houston - based owner of coal resources that lets other companies mine in return for royalties .
Its revenues were $ 291 m [ £ 184 m ] in 2008 .
They have formed two groups – CO2 Is Green designated for advocacy and Plants Need CO2 for education – with about $ 1 m .
Plants Need CO2 has applied for 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) tax status , so that contributions would qualify as charitable donations , said Natural Resource Partners general counsel Wyatt L Hogan , who also serves on the group 's board .
The advert ( which varies slightly depending on the state ) is really something to behold .
Here 's a transcript :
Congress is considering a law that would classify carbon dioxide as pollution .
This will cost us jobs .
There is no scientific evidence that CO2 is a pollutant .
In fact , higher CO2 levels than we have today would help the earth 's ecosystems and would support more plant and animal life .
Please take action .
Contact your senator and congressman today and remind them CO2 is not pollution and more CO2 results in a greener earth .
Go to CO2isgreen.com , because we all need CO2 .
The advert is ripe for spoofing .
It 's certainly tempting to laugh it off .
( For extra merriment , visit the " CO2 is green " website and read the " Why do people believe these myths ? " section : " They have been misinformed by people that benefit financially from propagating the myth . "
Oh , the irony . )
But the advert is also a juddering reminder there are still powerful , influential forces straining every last sinew and dollar they possess to deny that rising CO2 levels are a problem .
That such efforts should so easily be traced back to oil industry operatives is not wholly surprising , but sobering nonetheless .
Far more depressing , though , is the fact that they have produced this " Plants need CO2 " website to better inform the public about the " positive effects of additional atmospheric CO2 and help prevent the inadvertent negative impact to human , plant and animal life if we reduce CO2 " .
A word of caution before you click on the link : prepare yourself to be " educated " .
THE United States government is borrowing money like never before .
The national debt rose by more than a third over a one - year period , far more than it ever did at any time since World War II .
In the past , when the government became a heavy borrower , there was talk about crowding out private borrowers .
But this time , interest rates have remained low and no one seems to be worried about that .
The reason is simple : Rather than crowding out the private sector , Uncle Sam is now standing in for it .
Much of the government borrowing went to investments in financial institutions needed to keep them alive .
Other hundreds of billions went to a variety of programs aimed at stimulating the private economy , including programs that effectively had the government pick up part of the cost for some home buyers and some auto buyers .
This week , the Federal Reserve published its quarterly report on debt levels in the economy .
While Uncle Sam borrowed more , others borrowed less .
The accompanying chart shows that total domestic debt  the amounts owed by individuals , governments and businesses  climbed just 3.7 percent from the second quarter of 2008 through the second quarter of this year .
That is the smallest increase since the Fed started these calculations in the early 1950s .

LinuxCon : Keeping open source open
This article brought to you by LWN subscribers Subscribers to LWN .

Keith Bergelt , CEO of the Open Invention Network ( OIN ) , described the circumstances which led the company to recently purchase 22 Microsoft patents , as part of a talk at the first LinuxCon .
While the circumstances surrounding that purchase were quite interesting — and indicative of Microsoft 's patent strategy — he also described the mission of OIN as a protector of Linux from patent trolls .
Because patents are likely to be a threat to Linux for a long time to come , organizations like OIN are needed to allow Linux development to continue with as few patent impediments as possible .
Linux Foundation ( LF ) executive director Jim Zemlin introduced Bergelt by noting that OIN had done a great service for the Linux industry and community by purchasing those patents , which otherwise would have gone to " non-operating " companies — essentially patent trolls .
Bergelt caught wind of the sale and headed off what might have been a potent attack against Linux , Zemlin said .
OIN was started by six companies ( Sony , IBM , NEC , Red Hat , Philips , and Novell ) four years ago to anticipate and preempt these kinds of patent sales , Bergelt said .
It is a " very unusual entity " and when he was approached to be the CEO , it took some time to understand the " active benevolence " that was the mission of OIN .
The members put a " very significant amount of money " into OIN , which means that , unlike a pledge fund , the capital is available , allowing Bergelt the autonomy to make decisions about how to deploy it .
OIN licenses its patents for use by others , with the proviso that those companies not assert their patents against Linux .
It is , essentially , a defensive patent pool for the entire Linux community .
He sees the mission of OIN as allowing Linux to " be beneficial , at a macro level , to economic growth " , by reducing the patent threat .
The most recent patents were purchased from Allied Security Trust ( AST ) , which represents its 15 members ( including three that Bergelt named : HP , Ericsson , and IBM ) by buying patents , licensing them to the members , and then reselling the remaining rights on the open market .
Bergelt contrasted AST and OIN , saying that the latter is not just representing the six companies who are its members , but is , instead , " representing society " .
In his view , " patents will continue to exist " , so it is important to " ensure that they do n't have a negative impact on Linux in the future " .
Bergelt described Microsoft 's patent suit against TomTom as being a part of the software giant 's " totem strategy " .
By getting various companies to settle patent suits over particular patents , Microsoft can erect ( virtual ) totem poles in Redmond , creating a " presumption of patent relevance " .
According to Bergelt , Microsoft tends to attack those who try to create parity with it in some area , which TomTom did .
But , TomTom had overextended itself with a large amount of debt from their acquisition of mapping company Tele Atlas .
That made it an opportune time to put the squeeze on TomTom , which is exactly what Microsoft did .
But , Microsoft was surprised to find that TomTom had allies in the form of OIN and others .
Originally , Microsoft had asked for an " astronomical " sum to settle the suit , but after TomTom joined OIN and countersued Microsoft , the settlement number became much smaller .
In fact , it was small enough that it was not necessary to report the amount under Dutch securities regulations .
Because the cost to defend a patent suit — even successfully — could be upwards of $ 14 million , the TomTom board really had no choice but to settle .
But , patent suits are generally fairly high - profile , and there are other means to attack Linux companies more quietly .
One of those is to sell patents to " non-practicing " ( or " non-operating " ) entities who have no other business besides patent litigation .
These trolls do not have any products that could be the target of patent countersuits , which is a standard way of combating patent suits .
Bergelt said that $ 20 billion has been spent this decade by multiple organizations to acquire patents for trolling .
Companies with large patent portfolios have been pressured by investors to use those patents to generate revenue .
One way to do that is to sell them to trolls , which brings in money and insulates the company from actually bringing suit itself .
In some cases , this has led to patent trolls attacking the customers of the company who originally held the patents , Bergelt said .
Over the last three years , OIN has been one of the three largest patent acquirers , so it could not have been an oversight that Microsoft did not approach OIN about buying these patents .
The bundle of patents was expressly presented as being relevant to Linux , which has the effect of " pointing the troll in the right direction " , according to Bergelt .
He clearly indicated his belief that this was an attempt to attack Linux by proxy ; Microsoft would have " plausible deniability " because they could claim they were sold to a defensive patent pool such as AST .
But , AST is required to resell the patents it acquires , after licensing them to its members , within 12 months of purchasing them .
Normally it would sell them to trolls , but Bergelt was able to arrange a purchase by OIN .
He noted that if you wanted to get patents to trolls , but keep your hands " clean " , selling them to AST is the right way to do it .
Going forward , though , there is a patent treaty forming between AST and OIN , which should help alleviate this particular problem in the future .
The Data Tern / Amphion patent suit against Red Hat , which was based on a relational database patent , was also noted by Bergelt as a successful defense of free software from a patent threat .
Red
Hat settled the suit on behalf of the community as a whole , rather than allow further suits against free software to be filed .
Bergelt said that Data Tern / Amphion were " not anti-Linux " , in contrast to Microsoft 's intent , but were focused purely on the return on its investment in buying the patent .
Intellectual Ventures is an organization to keep an eye on , Bergelt said , as it has some 23,000 patents , more than any other non-practicing entity .
Three weeks ago , it started selling some of its patents — to patent trolls .
OIN is also approaching patent trolls to suggest that they contact OIN before suing Linux companies .
In some cases , OIN has averted lawsuits by acquiring patent rights from trolls .
The 22 patents in question are listed on the OIN website , but they are n't separated from the rest of the patents that OIN has acquired .
They were all issued to either Microsoft or SGI originally , though , Bergelt said , which should assist anyone wishing to study what the patents cover .
He noted that they are not the OpenGL patents , as some thought , because those are believed not to read on Linux .
In addition to acquiring patents , OIN has several other projects that are meant to reduce the patent problems for Linux .
Peer to patent and post - issue peer to patent are both meant to " crowdsource " the process of finding prior art for patents that are in process or those that have already been issued .
The former is meant to help the Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) so that bad patents do n't get issued , while the latter looks for bad patents so that they can be submitted to the PTO for re-examination .
Defensive publications are another strategy that companies can take to protect their ideas without patenting them .
OIN is advocating the use of defensive publication to create prior art , so that , in the best case , patents will not be granted covering those ideas .
Instead of the " negative right " that is created with a patent , defensive publication creates something that everyone can use , but no one can patent .
OIN 's lawyers will review defensive publication submissions for free , making any necessary changes and then adding them to the IP.com database which is used for prior art searches by the PTO .
Companies who want to patent their ideas can also use defensive publication by patenting the core idea and wrapping that core with published information .
This is happening more frequently because the cost of a patent application is becoming " prohibitive " .
OIN is encouraging the community to use defensive publications to protect its ideas as well .
Bergelt stressed that OIN is not set up as an anti-Microsoft organization , as they are focused on any entity threatening Linux with patents .
In the most recent case that was Microsoft , but his expectation is that " Microsoft will go through a painful transition " , but will eventually join the free software community .
The benefits of free software development will be too strong to resist .
In closing , both Zemlin and Bergelt mentioned the Linux Defenders project , which is a joint venture between OIN , LF , and the Software Freedom Law Center .
It is the umbrella organization for the peer to patent efforts along with the defensive publication initiative , but it also seeks to counsel companies who have been approached about patents that read on Linux .
Zemlin noted that the traditional approach is to get a potential victim to sign a non-disclosure agreement ( NDA ) before discussing the patents in question .
He stressed that companies should get in touch with Linux Defenders before signing the NDA , as that seriously limits what help it can provide .
In response to questions from the audience , Bergelt noted that there is some hope for patent reforms , which may " narrow the space " for trolls to work in .
Judges are starting to recognize the problem he said , but wholesale changes are not likely in the cards .
In addition , he noted that even defining " non-practicing entity " is difficult , pointing to Qualcomm as an example of a company that was not very successful using its patents in products , but quite successful in licensing them to others .
He also sees hope at the PTO .
Fewer poor patents are being issued and far fewer patents are being issued overall .
Things are changing , but they will never be as good as we want them to be , he said .

* This article was changed on August 12 , 2009 , removing inaccurate references to Export Development Canada .

His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
For the first time in decades , the world 's eyes are on Honduras , a tiny country many Canadians know for those little stickers on exported bananas and the surplus of coffee it floods onto the global market each year .
The world is less aware of the ongoing role that the Canadian government and Canadian mining companies play in pushing many Hondurans further into poverty .
Now that the world is watching , it 's a good time to reveal these secrets .
On Saturday , July 4 , at the impromptu meeting of the Organization of the American States , Canadian Minister of State of Foreign Affairs for the Americas Peter Kent suggested President Jose Manuel " Mel " Zelaya not return to Honduras .
It 's an interesting stance for Canada to assume , considering that most of the international community has condemned the coup in Honduras .
Moreover , following violent clashes between the military police and demonstrators awaiting Zelaya 's return this past Sunday , Kent held Zelaya responsible for the deaths of two demonstrators by the military government .
Prior to these comments , Canada had remained relatively silent on this issue .
But while most other counties have cancelled their aid to Honduras in protest of the coup , Canada has not .
Why is our democracy suddenly in the business of supporting a military coup ?
Capitalizing on hurricane devastation
The answer begins with Canada 's reaction to the last crisis in Honduras .
In 1998 , Hurricane Mitch swept through much of Central America and especially ravaged Honduras , where thousands of people were killed and millions were displaced .
Already the second poorest country in the Western Hemisphere , Honduras was now struck with over $ 3 billion in damages , a loss of social services such as schools , hospitals and road systems .
Seventy per cent of its agricultural crops were destroyed .
Nothing so devastating had ever hit Honduras .
Canada was quick to respond to the cries for help following Hurricane Mitch , with a ' long - term development plan ' .
Canada offered $ 100 million over four years for reconstruction projects .
These grandiose aid packages made Canada look like a savior .
However , attached to this assistance was the introduction of over 40 Canadian companies to Honduras to assess opportunities for investment .
This hurricane offered a strategic economic opportunity for Canadian investment in Honduras .
The Canadian government , as it officially stated this year , considers mineral extraction by Canadian mining companies one of the best ways to " create new economic opportunities in the developing world " .
Shortly after Hurricane Mitch weakened the Honduran state , Canada and the United States joined to establish the National Association of Metal Mining of Honduras ( ANAMINH ) , through which they were able to rewrite the General Mining Law .
This law provides foreign mining companies with lifelong concessions , tax breaks and subsurface land rights for " rational resource exploitation " .
' We have lost everything '
" They crave gold like hungry swine , " Uruguayan journalist Eduardo Galeano has written of multinational mining firms .
I thought of those words on a recent drive through the open pit San Andres mining project , recently sold by the Canadian company Yamana Gold to another Canadian company , Aura Minerales .
When I 'd finished my tour , I was convinced the social , economic , environmental and health costs of open pit mining practices far outweigh the supposed benefits , and that the resource exploitation practiced by certain Canadian companies is anything but rational .
I got chills driving through the abandoned village of San Andres .
What were once homes and schools had been bulldozed into mounds of crushed adobe and rock .
Where ancient pine trees stood , there now were deep craters , accessible by the nicest highways I had seen in Honduras .
But a local resident at the end of one of those roads told me : " We have lost everything . "
The mine had displaced him from his home , and he was now without clean water to drink or fertile land to sow . *
In February 2003 , nearly five hundred gallons of cyanide spilled into the Rio Lara , killing 18,000 fish .
The mine in San Andres uses more water in one hour than an average Honduran family uses in one year .
In that same year , mining companies earned $ 44.4 million , while the average income per capita in Honduras in 2004 was just $ 1,126USD .
Zelaya 's anti-mining stance : payment due
As the man at the end of the road tried to explain to me , mining is not development for people who live around these mines .
He speaks for thousands of others -- a base of support aligned with the ousted President Zelaya .
In 2006 , Zelaya decided to cancel all future mining concessions in Honduras .
Which would appear to explain , at least in large part , why Canada stands virtually alone in the hemisphere in supporting the Honduran military 's ousting of Zelaya .
The Canadian government , and its friends in the mining industry , are using the coup as an opportunity to plant their feet deeper into the Honduran ground .
In his role as minister of state for foreign affairs , Peter Kent once declared that " democratic governance is a central pillar of Canada 's enhanced engagement in the Americas . "
Apparently , his instructions from Ottawa have been revised .

The toys coined a new phrase – the " action figure " – that Lucas would borrow from for his lucrative Star Wars merchandising .
The cast is young , pretty and appalling , but they 're just doing what they 're told .
Most of the men are muscle - bound , the women stacked .
They are not selling a story so much as fantasy for recently pubescent gamers , or even younger kids .

Does May have a chance in Saanich — Gulf Islands ?
Short answer : Absolutely , yes .
She has a very good chance .
Long answer : Still probably yes .
However , if she runs her campaign the way she ran her candidacy “ announcement ” , then she could be in serious trouble .
Elizabeth May seems to have definitively chosen British Columbia ’s Saanich — Gulf Islands riding as her choice in which to run in the next federal election .
I have to admit that I am intrigued by May ’s decision to run there .
The circumstances around this move have been less than ideal for May and the Greens , however I do n’t think it ’s a bad move ( though the data clearly shows it probably was n’t the best move if you take “ best ” to mean “ highest chances of success ” ) .
This move possibly could very well end up paying off for the Greens ( more on that later ) , however the manner in which May has done this has been amateur hour at the comedy club .
First the downside for May and the Greens , then I ’ll end on an upbeat note .
In speaking to media earlier this month , May stated that there was still a variety of issues not yet resolved within the party regarding her candidacy in Saanich — Gulf Islands .
However , in the same breath , she said that Saanich — Gulf Islands was her choice for where to run .
I guarantee you May ’s political operatives cringed when she gave that quotation .
This raises several questions all of which reflect poorly on May :
If she comes out and states that this riding is her choice , then why is the Green Party senior organization still “ considering ” it ?
Has a rift broken out between Elizabeth May and the Green Party senior organization ?
Why is Elizabeth May announcing this while a process to decide which riding to select is still ongoing ?
Would n’t this announcement render such a process moot ?
Furthermore , the Greens already have an announced candidate in the riding who hails from the left flank of the party and does not appear willing to step down .
May ’s party is one of the most ideologically diverse in the country , and in such situations , it is generally important to keep all wings of the party happy .
May ’s hasty move now risks stoking the ire of the left wing of the Green Party which , when combined with the criticism May ’s been receiving from the right flank of her party , makes finding that winning dynamic that more difficult ( though not impossible ) .
May needs to learn that there ’s a reason why serious politicians do n’t give a solid answer to a question when the decision is not yet firm and all of the ramifications have not been fully itemized .
This is a pretty remedial lesson in political circles and it usually comes around the same time that political operatives learn that decisions do n’t get made in committees and that you never ask a question in front of a microphone to which you do not already know the answer .
Moving on to the good news for May and the Greens :
Despite all of this , the data still show that May has at least a decent chance of snatching this riding from the clutches of the Tories .
Greg Morrow over at Democratic Space has a post analysing whether Elizabeth May can beat Gary Lunn in Saanich — Gulf Islands .
Greg concludes that May does n’t have a chance against Lunn and that even the best possible outcomes have her loosing by several thousand votes .
I think Greg is a fantastic political analyst and I have a great deal of respect for him .
However I ’m going to have to respectfully disagree with his conclusion in this matter .
So far May has run in two elections ( London North Centre in a 2006 by - election and Central Nova in 2008 ) .
In the 2006 general election in London North Centre , the election results were as follows :
When May ran in the by -election in London North Centre , the results were as follows :
As you can see , May improved the Greens ’ showing by 20.3 % .
As for Central Nova , in the 2006 general election , the results were :
When May ran in 2008 , the results were :
As you can see , May improved the Greens ’ showing this time by 30.5 % .
From this data , we can extrapolate a few things .
When Elizabeth May runs in a riding , on average the following happens :
The Greens go up by 25.4 %
by 25.4 % The Conservatives go down by 1.3 %
by 1.3 % The Liberals go down by 5.3 %
by 5.3 % The New Democrats go down by 12.8 %
However , the overall Green vote increased in Atlantic Canada by just shy of 4 % between 2006 and 2008 .
So roughly 4 % of Elizabeth May ’s increase was n’t due to her presence but rather was due to an overall rise in Green Party fortunes in that region .
Because of this , we need to reduce her number ( 25.4 % ) by roughly 4 % to fully take into account just the amount that Elizabeth May ’s presence increases the Green vote in a riding isolated from other factors .
Doing this , we end up with the following data :
The Greens go up by 21.4 %
by 21.4 % The Conservatives go down by 1.3 %
by 1.3 % The Liberals go down by 5.3 %
by 5.3 % The New Democrats go down by 12.8 %
Now , we need to apply these numbers to last election ’s results in Saanich — Gulf Islands .
But before we do , there is one problem .
Last election in Saanich — Gulf Islands , the NDP candidate had to drop out after his skinny dipping incident came to light .
We know that whenever an NDP candidate drops out , it has an effect not just on the NDP ’s total numbers but also on the other progressive parties ’ numbers as the disaffected New Democrats “ park ” their vote elsewhere .
Thus , assuming that next time the NDP candidate in this riding is unlikely to become disgraced again , I will be using the 2008 election results for the Conservatives and the 2006 numbers for the Liberals , NDP and Greens .
( Note that , if anything , this will provide a slight bias in favour of the Conservatives as their vote total was slightly higher in 2008 than in 2006 ) .
So we have this as our base :
Applying the “ Elizabeth May change numbers ” to this base projection , we get :
Now that ’s still a win for the Conservatives ( and a safe one at that ) .
But …
Remember that we earlier stripped the change in the Green Party ’s vote between 2006 and 2008 out of Elizabeth ’s May ’s numbers .
So now we have to reintroduce the change in the Green Party ’s ( and the other parties ’ ) polling numbers but this time we have to do so looking at the region of British Columbia rather than Atlantic Canada .
It turns out that the Greens have an overall more favourable climate in BC than they do in Atlantic Canada and this is important .
Beginning from the “ raw vote projection ” just calculated above , we now will apply the changes to each party in order to obtain our final projections .
Now , I do not vouch for the exact vote totals appearing in these final two columns .
However , as a rough predictor of how probable an Elizabeth May victory is , I think this is a strong indicator that it is entirely possible .
* UPDATE :
Greg Morrow below noted that I forgot to take into account the fact of the change in each party ’s support between the polling data and the actual vote results .
I thank Greg for pointing this out because this is an important revelation considering that the Conservatives tend to do better in elections than in polls whereas the Greens tend to do much worse .
So , applying these changes to the above above projections , we get the following “ final final ” projections ( as best as we can given the sparse data available ) :
So we have a much tighter race in the Arithmetic projections here .
Furthermore , the race could definitely slide back into Gary Lunn ’s hands if the Conservatives can retain their 2008 vote / poll discrepancy rather than what they witnessed in 2006 .
The race could also slide back into Gary Lunn ’s hands if the Greens get closer to their 2008 vote / poll discrepancy rather than what they witnessed in 2006 .
However , my theory is that the vote / poll discrepancy for the progressive parties witnessed in 2008 was partly exaccerbated by the fact that the vote was held so early in the academic school year which meant that all young 1st year university students studying in a different town might not have yet received the two pieces of mail necessary to vote which thus put the hammer to the most important progressive demographic .
This year , it ’s looking like the vote will be in late October at the earliest ( rather than early - to - mid October ) which might help out the youth vote and make the discrepancy closer to that witnessed in 2006 .
I could , of course , be totally wrong about this , but that is my feeling talking with staffers on Parliament Hill from multiple parties .
I certainly would n’t want to wager a great sum of money on it , but I would argue that this analysis still nevertheless establishes that Elizabeth May does have at least a fighting chance of securing the riding .

Saudi Arabia practises a conservative form of Sunni Islam A leading Saudi cleric has called on Muslims not to pray for the destruction of unbelievers .
A supplication to that effect is often reiterated at the end of every Friday prayer in Arab countries , something critics say can radicalise youth .
Sheikh Salman al - Awda said such prayers were against Islamic sharia .
But he added they were permissible if the interests of Muslims were harmed , so his words may have little effect on radicals who oppose the US or Israel .
Reform issue
It is very common for the Friday prayer in Arab societies to end with the Imam calling for the destruction of the " kuffar " , the un-believers , to which the worshippers respond " Amen " .
Such public display of hostility to other cultures was picked up by critics as an example of how mainstream Islamic preaching contributes , perhaps inadvertently , to the radicalisation of Muslim youths .
The issue moved centre - stage in the debate about reform in Islam after the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington eight years ago by 19 Muslim men , most of whom came from Saudi Arabia .
The question of reform is more urgent for Saudi society , where a puritanical interpretation of Islamic faith encourages hostility to other faiths , including even Muslim sects , such as the Shias , who complain of severe discrimination in the predominantly conservative Sunni kingdom .
Limited impact Sheikh Salman is a respected cleric and a member of the International Association of Muslim Scholars , so his appeal should , at least in theory , should carry some weight .
He said praying for the destruction of the unbelievers runs against God 's law , or Islamic sharia .
However , he added that praying for their destruction should be allowed only if they were harming the interests of Muslims .
But in a climate where Muslims are widely perceived to be under attack in Afghanistan , Iraq and the Palestinian territories , Sheikh Salman 's appeal will have little or no impact on those who think that jihad against the Americans or the Israelis is a perfectly legitimate exercise .
For them the problem is not Islamic preaching , but rather an unjust world where Muslims are oppressed by foreign powers .

The global downturn was effectively declared over yesterday , with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) revealing that " clear signs of recovery are now visible " in all seven of the leading Western economies , as well as in each of the key " Bric " nations .
The OECD 's composite leading indicators suggest that activity is now improving in all of the world 's most significant 11 economies – the leading seven , consisting of the US , UK , Germany , Italy , France , Canada and Japan , and the Bric nations of Brazil , Russia , India and China – and in almost every case at a faster pace than previously .
Each of the 11 economies saw an improvement in July , the OECD said , with only France improving at a slower rate than in June .
The July figures are the most encouraging since the indices began ticking downwards during the first quarter of last year .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The OECD 's leading indicators are considered a key economic yardstick because they measure the sectors of countries ' economies that tend to react first to upswings and downturns .
As such they provide early evidence of the way in which the overall economy is progressing .
In the UK , the OECD said the leading indicators were pointing to a particularly strong recovery , with the measure showing a 1.3 per cent improvement during July , the British economy 's best performance so far this year on the organisation 's measure .
" The leading indicator first rose in February and the rate of improvement has picked up steadily since then , " said Howard Archer , the chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight .
" This reinforces belief that the UK is set to return to growth in the third quarter . "
The OECD data comes at the end of a week in which a series of economists havesignalled the end of Britain 's recession , with a string of indicators including retail sales , house prices and manufacturing output suggesting a marked improvement in economic performance .
The National Institute for Economic and Social Research said it believed the economy began growing again in May and that growth was 0.3 per cent over the three months to the end of August .
While some analysts have been cautious – notably former Monetary Policy Committee member David Blanchflower , who launched a savage attack on the Bank of England this week – the growing optimism was also helped by credit ratings agency Moody's .
It said it would maintain the UK's AAA rating , despite fears earlier this year that the parlous state of public finances might damage lenders ' views of Britain 's creditworthiness .
The stock market has also reacted positively to the growing economic feelgood factor , reaching levels not seen since the collapse of Lehman Brothers a year ago and the subsequent financial crisis sent share prices around the world into a tailspin .
Yesterday , the FTSE 100 Index broke back through the psychologically significant level of 5,000 , with share prices up 3 per cent this week alone .
The index has risen in three of the past four weeks and is now up by close to 50 per cent since its low - point in March .
While the improving economic outlook has prompted calls for the Government to begin reining back the fiscal stimulus programme it launched to prevent recession becoming depression , there has been little sign yet of any imminent rise in inflation .
Official statistics published yesterday showed that factory gate prices rose by just 0.2 per cent during the month of August , with the annual rate of inflation for manufacturers ' goods remaining negative , at - 0.4 per cent .
There is some concern , however , about a sharp increase in input prices , with the cost of raw materials up by 2.2 per cent in August according to the Office for National Statistics .
The rise reflects markedly higher oil prices , which could pose a threat to the sustainability of the economic recovery .

MIKE Leyland , one of the two legendary brothers whose quirky travel show ran for years on Australian television , has died at the age of 68 .
His family announced that Mike died of complications of Parkinson 's disease this morning .
Mike and Mal Leyland , explorers and documentary filmmakers , were best known for their television show Ask The Leyland Brothers .
The weekly show , which ran from 1976 to 1984 , was watched by more than 2.5 million people at its peak .
It featured the brothers in unusual or far - flung places around Australia which viewers had asked them to visit .
Mike was eight and Mal was five when they migrated with their parents in 1950 from England to Newcastle in NSW , where Mike lived for the rest of his life .
Mike Leyland is survived by his wife Margie , his daughters Kerry , Sandy and Dawn , his stepdaughters Sarah and Alison , and seven grandchildren .
( CNN ) --
She was 24 , a newlywed who moved to Orlando , Florida , with her husband just a few months before she vanished in May 1994 .
In the 15 years since , there have been no clues or signs of Melisa Brady Sloan , despite periodic searches .
Melisa Sloan has been missing since May 1 , 1994 .
Police in Orlando , Florida , are seeking the public 's help .
The native of Louisville , Kentucky , was close to her family and a devoted nurse working long hours at Orlando Regional Hospital .
She disappeared just 10 days before she was due in court to testify against her husband in a domestic violence case .
" She loved him and wanted to work things out with him , " says Melanie Brady Drury , Sloan 's sister .
It was a whirlwind romance , Drury said .
The two met in Louisville , where Melisa was a nurse and John Sloan was a night security guard at the same hospital .
He said he had just been discharged from the Army Special Forces .
They dated only a few months before marrying quickly .
Within weeks of the wedding , they moved to Orlando .
Her family was concerned about the move because they barely knew this new man in Melisa 's life .
" He was very controlling of her , and that 's when the physical violence between them began , " Drury said .
In early spring 1994 , Melisa Sloan called police , saying her husband had beaten her up at their home .
According to Drury , Melisa left him and went back to her family in Louisville , but returned a couple of weeks later hoping to work things out .

The first week of May , her mother tried calling Sloan but could not reach her for days .
On May 7 , she finally spoke with her daughter 's husband , who said , " She 'll call you when she 's ready , " Drury said .
It was then that the family grew worried and reported Sloan missing to police .
According to police , Melisa Sloan was with a good friend when she was last seen by anyone other than her husband .
She and the friend , a paramedic who worked at the hospital , left work together to go to a street fair , and Sloan did not return home until 2:30 a.m. , police said .
Watch for more details on the case »
The next afternoon , she was captured on a video surveillance camera withdrawing $ 20 from an ATM .
At the Sloans ' apartment , police found none of Melisa 's personal items , clothes or shoes .
The apartment looked as if she had never lived there .
All that was left was an old bathrobe , hung on the back of the bathroom door , and her beloved cat , police said .
" She would never leave that cat behind , that cat was like her baby , " said her sister , Drury .
As police searched the home , they found that one of the bedrooms was unfurnished , with only a rifle and knife propped against a wall , said Detective Andre Boren of the Orlando Police .
" We searched for days in the woods behind their apartment , " Boren said .
Three searches have been conducted over the years on the land behind the Sloans ' home .
The 1 - square - mile parcel is federal property .
Nearly 75 percent of the property has been searched , Boren said .
According to investigators , there was no activity on Melisa Sloan 's credit cards , bank accounts , Social Security number or driver 's license .
Her car was left parked in front of their home .
Police quickly focused on John Sloan and named him a person of interest in his wife 's disappearance .
The phone listed in Sloan 's name has been disconnected .
He did not respond to e-mails from CNN , or to messages sent through his father .
Police say John Sloan has not cooperated with them since the initial questioning .
When police first came to the Sloan 's home when she was reported missing by her family , he told police his wife had packed up and left with another man .
Since then he has refused to speak with police .
Last year , homicide detectives attempted to question Sloan in Bellingham , Washington , a city near the Canadian border where he now resides with his new wife and family , but he walked away without answering questions from police .
Forensic tests on the Sloan home and Melisa Sloan 's car were completed , but police found no evidence of foul play in the car .
However , they did find small blood stains in the Sloan home .
Investigators have requested DNA samples from Melisa Sloan 's family .
" We are not resting until we solve this case , and I believe the key to this case is her husband , " Boren said .
" We 've made contact with his current wife , who is now aware of the situation , and we hope she will shed some light for us . "
Anyone with information about the whereabouts of Melisa Brady Sloan is asked to call the Orlando Police Department at 321-235-5300 .

SUNGAI SIPUT , Malaysia ( Reuters ) - A Malaysian Muslim woman who will be caned next week for drinking beer has defiantly asked that the punishment be carried out in public in a case that is fueling debate about tolerance in this multi-racial country .
Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno gestures during an interview with Reuters at her father 's house in Sungei Siput , about 300 km north of Kuala Lumpur , in Malaysia 's state of Perak August 21 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Zainal Abd Halim
Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno will be the first Malaysian woman to be caned under Islamic laws applicable to Malaysia ’s Muslims , who account for 60 percent of the 27 - million population .
She said the 20 - month ordeal added to her distress , but she respected the law banning alcohol for Muslims and was determined to go through with the punishment -- six strokes of the cane .
The mother of two , who also paid a 5,000 ringgit ( $ 1,420 ) fine , asked for the punishment , usually carried out in a closed prison , to be done in public .
“ I never cried when I was sentenced by the judge .
I told myself , alright then , let ’s get on with it , ” Kartika , 32 , told Reuters in an interview at her father ’s house in a rural Malay village , about 300 km ( 186 miles ) north of Kuala Lumpur .
Islam is the official religion in this country that has a dual - track legal system , with Islamic criminal and family laws applicable to Muslims alongside civil legislation .
Opinions are divided about the punishment Kartika faces under Islamic laws some say are too severe and selectively enforced .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
Amnesty International criticized on Friday the punishment as “ degrading ” and said the caning comes at a time when the role of Islam in Malaysia is assuming greater importance .
One of the main opposition parties wants Malaysia , which has ethnic Chinese and Indian minorities who are not Muslim , to become an Islamic state with sharia laws on punishment .
SINGAPORE RESIDENT
Despite the prohibition , Muslims can be found consuming alcohol in bars and nightclubs openly in cities such as the capital , Kuala Lumpur , where attitudes are more relaxed .
Kartika , a Malaysian citizen married to a Singaporean , is a Singapore resident .
Religious authorities caught her drinking at a hotel in Kuantan , the state capital of the central Malaysian state of Pahang , on December 11 , 2007 .
Kartika said she had three glasses of beer before the hotel was raided in what she said was her second time drinking alcohol .
She and the other patrons were asked to provide urine samples .
Kartika , who said she has yet to receive any response to her request for a public caning , is due to be taken to prison in central Selangor state beginning on Monday for one week , during which her sentence will be carried out .
She will be fully clothed and kneeling and struck on the backside with a small thin cane using moderate force .
Four court appearances over the offence forced her to quit her full time hospital job and she has since had to rely on part - time modeling jobs .
“ I only declared that I was a model to protect my full time job ...
I felt very humiliated because people used my status as a part - time model to publicize my case , ” she said .

The U.S. Department of Agriculture is so fired up about local food economies that it ’s coughing up $ 65 million for a new program called “ Know Your Farmer , Know Your Food . ”
My first reaction : $ 65 million ?!
That ’s all ?!
At 3:45 central time a top USDA official is speaking at the event I ’m at in Chicago .
I plan to “ live Tweet ” that speech , so check my Twitter feed ( @tomphilpott ) or come back to this page .
The event I ’m at , btw , is the Chefs Collaborative national summit .

In the meantime , here ’s Ag Secretary Tom Vilsack ’s recorded video remarks about the program .

USDA Launches ‘ Know Your Farmer , Know Your Food ’ Initiative to Connect Consumers with Local Producers to Create New Economic Opportunities for Communities
WASHINGTON , September 15 , 2009 – Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Deputy Secretary Kathleen Merrigan today announced a new initiative – ‘ Know Your Farmer , Know Your Food ’ – to begin a national conversation to help develop local and regional food systems and spur economic opportunity .
To launch the initiative , Secretary Vilsack recorded a video to invite Americans to join the discussion and share their ideas for ways to support local agriculture .
The video , one of many means by which USDA will engage in this conversation , can be viewed at USDA ’s YouTube channel , http://www.youtube.com/usda .
Producers and consumers can comment on the ‘ Know Your Farmer , Know Your Food ’ YouTube playlist , as well as submit videos or provide comments on this initiative by e-mailing KnowYourFarmer@usda.gov .
“ An American people that is more engaged with their food supply will create new income opportunities for American agriculture , ” said Vilsack .
“ Reconnecting consumers and institutions with local producers will stimulate economies in rural communities , improve access to healthy , nutritious food for our families , and decrease the amount of resources to transport our food . ”
The ‘ Know Your Farmer , Know Your Food ’ initiative , chaired by Deputy Secretary Merrigan , is the focus of a task force with representatives from agencies across USDA who will help better align the Department ’s efforts to build stronger local and regional food systems .
This week alone , USDA will announce approximately $ 65 million in funding for ‘ Know Your Farmer , Know Your Food ’ initiatives .
“ Americans are more interested in food and agriculture than at any other time since most families left the farm , ” said Merrigan .
“ ‘ Know Your Farmer , Know Your Food ’ seeks to focus that conversation on supporting local and regional food systems to strengthen American agriculture by promoting sustainable agricultural practices and spurring economic opportunity in rural communities . ”
In the months to come , cross-cutting efforts at USDA will seek to use existing USDA programs to break down structural barriers that have inhibited local food systems from thriving .
Today , USDA announced a small initial group of moves that seek to connect local production and consumption and promote local - scale sustainable operations :
* USDA ’s Risk Management Agency announced $ 3.4 million in funding for collaborative outreach and assistance programs to socially disadvantaged and underserved farmers .
These programs will support ‘ Know You Farmer ’ goals by helping producers adopt new and direct marketing practices .
For example , nearly $ 10,000 in funding for the University of Minnesota will bring together experts on food safety and regulations for a discussion of marketing to institutions like K - 12 schools , colleges , universities , hospitals and other health care facilities .
* USDA ’s Food Safety and Inspection Service proposed regulations to implement a new voluntary cooperative program under which select state - inspected establishments will be eligible to ship meat and poultry products in interstate commerce .
The new program was created in the 2008 Farm Bill and will provide new economic opportunities for small meat and poultry establishments , whose markets are currently limited .
* USDA ’s Rural Development announced $ 4.4 million in grants to help 23 local business cooperatives in 19 states .
The member - driven and member - owned cooperative business model has been successful for rural enterprises , and bring rural communities closer to the process of moving from production - to - consumption as they work to improve their products and expand their appeal in the marketplace .
* USDA ’s Rural Development will also announce a Rural Business Opportunity Grant in the amount of $ 150,000 to the Northwest Food Processors Association .
The grant will strengthen the relationship between local food processors and customers in parts of Idaho , Oregon and Washington , and will also help the group reduce energy consumption , a major cost for food processors .
As the ‘ Know Your Farmer , Know Your Food ’ initiative evolves , USDA will continue to build on the momentum and ideas from the 2008 Farm Bill and target its existing programs and develop new ones to pursue sustainable agriculture and support for local and regional food systems .
A favorite question of mine — not that I ’ve worked on it , just that I think more people should be working on it — is whether we can prove the existence of a ( very weak ) one - way function .
I ’m interested in an unconditional result here , but I ’m willing to weaken the conditions significantly :
I only want the difficulty of inverting to be harder than the difficulty of computing ( measured in terms of , say , gate complexity ) , I do n’t care how much harder it is .
( The inversion problem is not immediately well - defined if is not a permutation , but one can define things appropriately or restrict to that are permutations . )
to be harder than the difficulty of computing ( measured in terms of , say , gate complexity ) , I do n’t care how much harder it is .
( The inversion problem is not immediately well - defined if is not a permutation , but one can define things appropriately or restrict to that are permutations . )
If it helps , we can look at hardness of inverting in the worst - case , rather than the average - case .
in the worst - case , rather than the average - case .
Even a non-constructive proof would be interesting .
We know , non-constructively , that there exist functions that are exponentially hard .
To the best of my knowledge there is no analogous result stating that there exist functions harder to invert than to compute .
Seems like a natural question , no ?
Yet the only work on this topic of which I am aware are the following two papers :
A paper by Hiltgen in Asiacrypt ’ 92 shows an explicit function which is ( provably and unconditionally ) about twice as hard to invert as to compute .
Followup work by Hirsh and Nikolenko shows some form of ( very weak ) trapdoor function , which is easier to invert ( by a constant factor ) with trapdoor than without .
I ’m especially surprised by the fact that there is no non-constructive existence proof .
Note that such a proof would not necessarily settle any outstanding complexity questions ( like P vs. NP ) , so there ’s no inherent reason to think it ’s impossible .
My guess is that people just have n’t looked at it much .
I was writing a long , interesting article about the Microsoft and Yahoo !
merger , with several interviews from insiders at both companies , but I ’m already sick to death of hearing about it .
So I quit !

VALLEY FALLS —
The young man was given three choices : get turned over to the police , go one - on - one in a fight with a seasoned war veteran , or be duct - taped to a flagpole for six hours with a sign around his neck identifying his alleged crime : flag burning .
It was the third option that would still have the small town buzzing a week after a 21 - year - old was hunted down and forced to endure a public humiliation with its roots dating to the Middle Ages .
Members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 1938 were incensed enough to tie up the man last Sunday after they accused him of setting the flag in front of their building on fire .
One in nine Americans uses food stamps
By Tom Eley
20 August 2009
One in nine Americans relied on food stamps in May , the highest proportion ever , according to recently released data from the US Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) .
In all , 34.4 million people used the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( SNAP ) , a federal program that provides assistance to low - income people , an increase of more than 2 percent from the previous month , and a staggering increase of 6 million over the past year .
May ’s increase was the sixth consecutive month that set a new record in food stamp use .
Government food assistance increased in every state , with Florida registering the sharpest gain at 4.2 percent .
The year - over - year percentage increase in food stamp use is more striking , with 13 states , representing every region of the country , registering a spike of more than 25 percent .
These were Utah ( 45.5 percent ) , Nevada ( 39 percent ) , Idaho ( 36.3 percent ) , Washington ( 34.5 percent ) , Florida ( 34.2 percent ) , Vermont ( 33.6 percent ) , Wisconsin ( 31.3 percent ) , Arizona ( 29.7 percent ) , Colorado ( 28.9 percent ) , Georgia ( 28.3 percent ) , Maryland ( 27.2 percent ) , Massachusetts ( 25.3 percent ) , and Oregon ( 25 percent ) .
“ Food stamp enrollment is rising because the economy is having a devastating impact on low - income families and they need this program to eat , ” said Stacy Dean of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said .
“ Every single state has been affected . ”
The food stamp program is largely funded by the federal government and administered by the states .
Historically , recipients could redeem stamps or coupons for food assistance at grocery stores , but in recent years paper stamps have been phased out in favor of a debit card system called Electronic Benefit Transfer .
The program aims to assist the desperately poor .
According to the USDA , the average gross monthly income of food stamp - receiving households was $ 640 , with nearly 80 percent of all benefits going to households with children .
The program provides an average of $ 133 monthly per person requesting food assistance .
By way of comparison , according to the USDA ’s own estimates , a “ low - cost ” monthly nutritional scheme for a single teenage boy requires a minimum of $ 220 spending on food per month .
Federal food assistance for the poor was a Great Society measure created during the the Lyndon Johnson administration ( 1963 -1969 ) .
Since the late 1970s , it has weathered round after round of cuts at the hands of both Democratic and Republican administrations and congresses , who claimed to be creating a “ culture of responsibility ” among the poor .
The most savage of these cuts came in 1996 , through Bill Clinton ’s “ Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunities Reconciliation Act , ” which eliminated eligibility for legal immigrants ( these restrictions have since been only slightly relaxed ) , limited stamp use for “ able bodied ” adults without dependents to three months during a 36 - month period , and substantially reduced maximum food benefits .
The result is a food stamp program that , even in more favorable economic conditions , fails to meet basic nutritional needs and shuts out the vast majority of the working class from any assistance whatsoever .
The economic crisis has laid bare the woefully inadequate character of the program and the “ social safety net ” as a whole .
In Texas , demand is such that in July the state was delinquent in processing nearly 40 percent of new requests .
Rachel Cavazos , who has four children , is jobless , and is in the midst of a divorce , applied for food stamps in April and has not yet heard back on her request .
“ It ’s very hurtful , especially when somebody does n’t give you the benefit of the doubt , ” the 32 - year - old Houston native recently told the Houston and Texas News .
“ The help is not for me .
It ’s for my babies .
I do n’t want my children to suffer . ”
Recently at a Dallas , Texas , food stamp office , a line of the desperate and hungry formed before 5 a .m .
“ I got a four , a five and a 15 - year - old .
And right now I got $ 2.27 .
So we ’re going to have some Ramen noodles tonight , ” Kenyadda Momanyi told a local news station .
A class action lawsuit has been filed against the state of Texas to force it to process applications more swiftly .
Mickey Warren , food directer of Christian Life Food Pantry in Knox County , Kentucky , recently went before the local Chamber of Commerce in a desperate bid for charitable contributions .
“ It ’s toward the end of the month and people are starting to look for more and more food , because by now the ones that draw food stamps , they ’re gone , the kids are hungry , ” he said .
“ Warren recalled [ recently watching ] a small girl rip open a whole pound cake package in the pantry parking lot , grasping it with both hands and eating it like a candy bar , because she had been hungry , ” the local TimesTribune.com reported .
In Wichita , Kansas , a grandmother summed up her plight in a word .
“ The most simple word would be we ’re hungry , ” Kathi Boggs told a local news station , as she sat with her 6 - year - old grandson , Alex , at a soup kitchen .
“ At the end of the day there ’s not enough for food . ”
“ People are desperate , ” said Gary Madden , a charity worker who assists people in gaining access to food stamps in San Bernardino County , California .
“ People calling now are saying things like ‘ I ’ve never asked for help in my life .
I do n’t know what I ’m going to do .
I ’ve lost my job and I ’m about to lose my home . ’
More men are calling .
Families are doubling up in homes . ”
“ Callers are saying , ‘ bank bailouts , auto company bailouts , where ’s my bailout ? ’ , ” Madden told BlackVoiceNews.com .

Dear Friend of Liberty ,
You may have heard today ’s prominent news stories about President Obama ’s military commander in Afghanistan , Stanley McChrystal , and his request to greatly increase the presence of U.S. armed forces there .
The Libertarian Party opposes this plan .
We want to end the war , not escalate it .
In September 2008 , the Libertarian National Committee adopted this resolution :
WHEREAS the government of the United States should return to its historical libertarian tradition of avoiding entangling alliances , foreign quarrels , and military adventures ; and WHEREAS the stability and security of Afghanistan lie outside the jurisdiction of the government of the United States ; and WHEREAS the Libertarian Party recognizes that the only legitimate role of the military is to defend America against direct attack or the imminent threat of attack ; THEREFORE , BE IT RESOLVED that the Libertarian National Committee calls on the government of the United States to withdraw the armed forces of the United States from Afghanistan , without undue delay .
Democrats often claim to oppose foreign wars .
But after eight months in total control of Congress and the White House , Democrats have done nothing to end the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
I hope you will support us in our efforts to oppose this war .
Sincerely ,
Wes Benedict
Executive Director
Libertarian National Committee

It is now official ; those looking for the latest GOP conspiracy theory , the latest mighty mental meltdown of the base , eagerly barked out by even the supposed leaders and purported respectable figures of the party , stroked and teased by conservative wings of the press that seem to have no pressing substance to deal with , anymore , compared to these small trinkets of insanity -- those looking for that latest race - tinged , conspiracy - riddled drama need look no farther .
We have it .
Obama is going to give a webcast speech directed at American schoolchildren about the importance of education .
As Jim Greer , Chairman of the Florida Republican Party put it :
" As the father of four children , I am absolutely appalled that taxpayer dollars are being used to spread President Obama 's socialist ideology .
The idea that school children across our nation will be forced to watch the President justify his plans for government - run health care , banks , and automobile companies , increasing taxes on those who create jobs , and racking up more debt than any other President , is not only infuriating , but goes against beliefs of the majority of Americans , while bypassing American parents through an invasive abuse of power . "
He is not alone ; it is the topic of nationwide , frantic email campaigns between stupid people , between exceptionally dumb bloggers and their compatriots , and ( of course ) on Fox News .
This , then , is the latest apocalypse .
We will all take a break from shouting down terminally ill people at town halls , and from wondering whether our president has a circumcised penis , and whether that would imply deficient citizenship on his part , if the answer was the wrong one .
We will pause , momentarily , in our efforts to declare that preventing sick people from going bankrupt and sending themselves and their families into lifelong poverty is , in fact , a slippery slope to communism , and from writing signs warning against the dangers of Facism and Markism , whatever those are .
No , this is the latest battleground , because America , its discourse and its governance has , to put it as tersely as possible , become all but enslaved to the stupidest , most uneducated , trashiest , most fanatic , most incompetent , most mentally unbalanced , most flat out fucking dumb set of people to ever manage to walk upright .
After a millennium of being led around by great leaders and not so great leaders , of great debates and petty ones , of steady marches towards freer and richer and more enlightened societies , we have apparently decided to chuck it all , because any pulsing mound of meat with the ability to work a magic marker will now be as a god to us .
Do American presidents sometimes give speeches to schoolchildren ?
Yes .
Yes , they do .
Sometimes they show up in the classroom to read books .
Sometimes they give extended presentations :
None of this is usually controversial , or at least , is seldom the stuff of frantic conspiracy fodder , calls of indoctrination , or part of an ongoing march to fascist - slash - communist brainwashing of little Billy and Tina Whitebread .
It is rare , indeed , to have parents outraged -- outraged I tell you !-- that the President of the United States of America is going to give a speech to their children about staying in school .
We have had presidential fitness programs , and presidential drug programs .
Talking to schoolchildren has been , over the course of our esteemed republic , one of the very least controversial things a president can possibly do .
It is less controversial than kissing a baby , which could get you branded a pedophile .
It is infinitely less controversial than inviting someone over for a beer , in which case the leader of the free world runs the risk of choosing the wrong beer , thus proving himself to hate America , or a given state in America , or to be on the wrong side of the decades - long battle between less filling and tastes great .
That said , America has a robust and colorful history of parents pulling their children out of school to prevent them from being exposed to a black person -- far more history of that than of being outraged - - outraged I tell you !-- at exposing children to their President .
It is unclear what , exactly , terrifies them so much .
From the level of drama , one can only presume that Obama will be reading passages from the fabled Negronomicon .
In order to guess at the next Republican white noise that will issue forth from their lips , a pattern is developing .
Take one part stuffy , lying Pravda , combine it with three parts of implausible satire from The Onion , a dash of fake and astroturfed populism , and mix it all together with a big heaping helping of good old fashioned , dumb - as - a - post American gullibility , the kind only the biggest and gruffest and loudest morons among us could possibly provide .
Never before has an American movement so giddily celebrated their own ignorance , or so proudly crafted their own alternate realities and then stuck to them despite any and all evidence to the contrary .
And yes , I am counting the Know Nothings , who knew more .
Via Dave Weigel , here is GOP stalwart Joe Scarborough , tweeting about the Stay - In - School Conspiracy and the intellectual decapitation of his own party :
Dear GOP , argue the issues and avoid the insults ... or just shut up .
Enough with the conspiracy theories .
Should n't our beliefs be enough ?
GOP leaders in my home state are accusing the POTUS of trying to " indoctrinate America ’s children to his socialist agenda . "
Seriously ?
WHERE ARE THE NATIONAL GOP LEADERS SPEAKING OUT AGAINST THIS KIND OF HYSTERIA ?
Indoctrination of socialism ?
The president as a racist ?
Death panels ?
Seriously ?
That 's all you 've got ?
If so , it 's time for you to go home I 'm just naive enough to believe that a party that shows restraint at home , restraint abroad and respect for the Constitution wins elections Perhaps that party just does n't exist .
Scarborough is as conservative as they come -- or at least he was , a scant few years ago , when " conservative " was something defined by something other than race - baiting and red-baiting paranoias and simple phoning - it - in lying as a staple of every speech .
What is notable about his short bursts is that they are , well , notable : within the broader Republican Party , these thoughts do not exist .
There is no pushback , from the party leaders ; the party leaders are the conspiracy mongers , as often as not .
In such an environment , where the more outrageous the claim , the more celebrated it becomes , the gullible will believe anything they are told : this has long been understood by vicious regimes and biting social critics , and at any point where it becomes political policy , politics itself collapses into valuelessness , into phantasmal nothingness .
Compare Scarborough 's momentary pique to Glenn Beck recently describing at length and in mid-panic why the imagery of various New York landmarks is , in fact , the stuff of communist indoctrination .
Then weep .
It is possible that if I were a truly gifted satirist -- a Twain , Mencken or the like -- I could find a more imaginative way of describing all of this .
If I were a Swift or a Hunter S. Thompson , I imagine I could pull it off .
Perhaps .
On the other hand , maybe none of those people lived in times quite like this .
Sure , they lived in ridiculous times , and among ridiculous people , and saw truly asinine things .
But this ridiculous , populated by people this stubbornly gullible , and this celebrated by their own leaders ?
I 'm no longer sure that it 's a given .
Perhaps we have managed to shoot the moon , to wrap around again to the point where uninformed , dribbling paranoia is now finally and permanently more respectable than actual governance .
Sarah Palin is , for a large part of the Republican Party , the closest thing to an intellectual voice that their version of know - nothing populism will allow , and that is very nearly the scariest thought to set itself down in the political landscape for a great many years .
Republican leaders have taken intelligence to the guillotine , and lopped its head clean off : from now on " the opposition is plotting to kill your grandmother " will have far more sway , in politics , than any actual realities of a healthcare system clearly and blatantly gone wrong .
We boo those with medical conditions .
We deny outright that the first non-white President of the United States is even a citizen of his own country , much less leader of it .
We still insist that an administration breaking the law is less divisive and controversial than daring to investigate it .
We put brick - stupid or malevolently selfish people on television , and feign outrage at anyone who points out their stupidity or selfishness .
And the President speaking to your children is the onset of communism , although perhaps barely a tenth of the population that utter it have any actual notion of what " communism " might actually be .
Honestly , at this point I wonder if we do not deserve every bit of what we get .
We worked very hard to erode the public - mindedness of our government , press and citizenry enough to get to this point .
Perhaps we should count ourselves lucky if future American generations can write their own names .
Following my last post , there were a couple of suggestions for events people would like me to look up in the Budget .
To satisfy the curiosity of those readers ( and hopefully others ) I will detail those briefly here , before going over my overall impressions of my time in Sugarcreek , and how I plan to move forward with the material I have gathered .
Tim Miller ( @brasseye ) asked me to check out any references to the JFK shooting in November 1963 .
Although the news took a week or two to get back to the Amish communities , the assassination is noted in a sizable number of scribes ’ letters , mainly expressing sympathy , but also appealing to church members to recognise a higher purpose in the event .
One letter from Farmerstown , Ohio said :
“ The news of the ruthless shooting of the President came as a great shock to everyone here , and also to the nation and the world .
I know that God permitted it , and I do n’t know why , but it did something to the nation , and I hope it was for the good . ”
This sympathy , combined with faith - based analysis , also features in letters written at the end of World War I and II .
One printed in 1945 following the end of WW2 reads :
“ Now that the war is over , it often comes to my mind what a western bishop said in his sermon …if the Christian people will not take this for a warning or chastisement and live better , some kind of epidemic or severe sickness will come . ”
Such responses to war and violence are born out of the Amish ’s status as a non-resistant , and also non-political people , and this is noted by other scribes :
“ During the recent period of war we have had a wonderful opportunity to exercise our spirit of non-resistance , but now that conditions are fast returning to normal again and restrictions are being lessened , we have even greater opportunities .
We will be able to promote a constructive program of Christian Service and in doing so we can emphasize ‘ The power of love to overcome Evil ’ . ”
Fellow Cardiff graduate Ruth Mosalski ( @ruthmosalski ) suggested trying to find references to the fall of the Berlin Wall .
I looked over quite a few issues from November and December 1989 , but failed to find any references , which I was surprised about .
The one factor I think might have something to do with this is that by 1989 , the local edition of the paper had stopped printing stories of national and international importance , narrowing it ’s focus as a local newspaper , but there may be other reasons I am unaware of .
And so after two weeks , my stay with the Budget has come to an end .
A highlights of my last week has been an overnight stay with an Old Order Amish family .
Spending an evening watching purple martins coming into nest rather than sitting in front of the television , and going to bed by gas and oil lamp was certainly an experience .
And the evening confirmed to me that despite the agriculture and family - orientated nature of the pages of the Budget ’s national edition , the Amish continue to get international news from somewhere .
Melvyn Hershberger , the 74 - year - old hardware store owner who hosted me for the evening was keen to know the British government ’s position on topics including health care reform , Israel , Iraq and Afghanistan .
But he remained completely loyal to the Budget as well – a scribe for 40 years , he at least skim reads every letter in the national edition , and pays closer attention to those places where he has friends or relatives – it ’s an easy and ( relatively ) quick way to communicate .
One of the young girls who works part - time in the Hershberger store , a 24 - year - old school teacher , said while she reads , she reads more selectively – she has friends in Montana , so she ’ll keep an eye out for those letters , mirroring the patterns of media consumption throughout the rest of the modern world .
As I found out talking to Keith earlier in the week , the Budget acknowledges that such habits among the youth are forcing them to adapt and change .
But it ’s pretty phenomenal that the circulation of a paper which has barely changed its format for more than 100 years has dipped by just 2,000 copies over the last 14 – something I would put down to having a staff which know the sensibilities of their audience inside out .
Some things I came to find out about I am yet to blog on .
This has partly been down to time , but also because when I write my final piece for the Welsh Livery Guild , I still want some of the material to be original .
I have spent a large amount of time looking into the development of the Budget ’s website , and am hoping to make this a substantial part of my finished article , but I will write a post on it when I get back to the UK .
As far as the Amish people are concerned , I ’ve found they are often misrepresented and misunderstood .
I have met Amish people who never use the phone , have no running water and no intention of changing .
But I have also met Amish men ( and women ! ) who have masters degrees , use the Internet , and have land line phones .
The variety is as great as in any other community , and just like all communities , they are not without their problems .
Although less prevalent , alcohol and drug abuse , unhappy families and financial desperation appear in the Amish too , and many told me they find it hard to deal with the idealised vision often promoted through the tourist industry .
If you ’re interested in these people , go to a reliable source – get a copy of the Budget ’s national edition if you can .
The reliability of citizen journalism is often questioned , but I would argue that in the case of the Budget , it can be an accurate reflection of life in Amish country .

The oft - delayed European Union report on the August 2008 Russo - Georgian
War is finally nearing release , according to officials , and it will conclude what a myriad of other reports in the interim have already concluded : that Georgia indeed fired the first shot .
In an effort to make the report more palatable to the eastern EU member states which have an axe to grind against Russia , the report will also accuse Russia of “ exploiting ” the conflict and will criticize them for distributing Russian passports to residents of the separatist enclaves of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , which declared independence after the conflict .
Georgia has officially reacted with outrage at every report regarding the war , insisting that Russia actually started it .
But even former Georgian officials acknowledge that President Mikheil Saakashvili was “ itching ” to do battle over South Ossetia , and test the high - tech military which was largely destroyed in the brief conflict .
President Saakashvili has vowed to reclaim the enclaves as parts of Georgia proper , and has US support in ensuring they will never be recognized as independent republics , though in practice both have been outside Georgian control for quite some time .
It 's one thing when a radio caller nicknamed " Crazy Eileen " commandeers a town hall meeting with her birth certificate in a baggie , but these are the musings of the leader of one of our two major political parties in the state that , as you may vaguely recall , decided the U.S. presidential election of 2000 .
This kind of whacked - out talk from a person with responsibility , chucking aside reason and logic to whip up voters who are angry and confused in a time of economic upheaval , is exactly what encourages those people who are far more unhinged than Jim Greer , who think it 's a good idea to bring a gun to a town hall meeting or pray for Obama 's death .
I also thought it was a nice touch to urge respect for the office of the presidency right before the comment about " Pied Piper Obama . "
THE SAGA of Nvidia ’s GT300 chip is a sad one that just took a turn for the painful when we heard about first silicon yields .
Nvidia ’s execution has gone from bad to absent with low single digit yields .
A few weeks ago , we said that Nvidia was expecting first silicon back at the end of the week , the exact date was supposed to be Friday the 4th plus or minus a bit .
The first bit of external evidence we saw that it happened was on the Northwood blog ( translated here ) and it was a day early , so props to NV for that .
That lined up exactly with what we are told , but the number of good parts was off .
The translation , as we read it , says there were nine good samples that came back from TSMC from the first hot lot .
That is below what several experts told us to expect , but in the ballpark .
When we dug further , we got similar numbers , but they were so abysmal that we did n’t believe it .
Further digging confirmed the numbers again and again .
Before we go there though , lets talk about what a good die is in this case .
When you get first silicon back , it almost always has bugs and problems .
First silicon is meant to find those bugs and problems , so they can be fixed in succeeding steppings .
By ‘ good ’ , we mean chips that have no process induced errors , and function as the engineers hoped they would .
In other words not bug free , but no more errors than there were in the design .
‘ Good ’ in this sense might never power on , just that the things that came out of the oven were what was expected , no more , no less .
Several experts in semiconductor engineering , some who have overseen similar chips , were asked a couple of loaded questions :
What is good yield for first silicon ?
What is good yield for a complex chip on a relatively new process ?
The answers ranged from a high of 50 % to a low of 20 % with a bunch of others clustered in the 30 % range .
Let ’s just call it one - third , plus or minus some .
The first hot lot of GT300s have 104 die candidates per wafer , with four wafers in the pod Nvidia got back a week and a half ago .
There is another pod of four due back any day now , and that ’s it for the hot lots .
How many worked out of the ( 4 x 104 ) 416 candidates ?
Try 7 .
Yes , Northwood was hopelessly optimistic – Nvidia got only 7 chips back .
Let me repeat that , out of 416 tries , it got 7 ‘ good ’ chips back from the fab .
Oh how it must yearn for the low estimate of 20 % , talk about botched execution .
To save you from having to find a calculator , that is ( 7 / 416 = .01682 ) , rounded up , 1.7 % yield .
Nvidia could n’t even hit 2 % , an order of magnitude worse than the most pessimistic estimate .
Ouch .
No , just sad .
So sad that Nvidia does n’t deserve mocking , things have gone from funny to pathetic .
At this point , unless there ’s a massive gain in yields on the second hot lot , there might not be enough chips to do a proper bring up and debug .
This stunningly bad yield could delay the introduction of the chip , adding to the current pain and bleak roadmap .
If there are n’t enough ‘ good ’ parts from the second hot lot , that might require running another set , adding weeks to the total .
Q1 ?
Maybe not .
It is going to be very interesting to see what Nvidia shows off at ‘ Not Nvision ’ in a couple of weeks .
Will it give the parts to the engineers to work on , or show them off as a PR stunt ?
We will know soon enough .
In any case , the yields as they stand are sub - 2 % , and the status of the GT300 is far worse than we had ever imagined .

Microsoft late last week said it wo n't patch Windows XP for a pair of bugs it quashed Sept. 8 in Vista , Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 .
The news adds Windows XP Service Pack 2 ( SP2 ) and SP3 to the no-patch list that previously included only Windows 2000 Server SP4 .
" We 're talking about code that is 12 to 15 years old in its origin , so backporting that level of code is essentially not feasible , " said security program manager Adrian Stone during Microsoft 's monthly post - patch Webcast , referring to Windows 2000 and XP .
" An update for Windows XP will not be made available , " Stone and fellow program manager Jerry Bryant said during the Q&A portion of the Webcast ( transcript here ) .
Last Tuesday , Microsoft said that it was n't patching Windows 2000 because creating a fix was " infeasible . "
The bugs in question are in Windows ' implementation of TCP / IP , the Web 's default suite of connection protocols .
All three of the vulnerabilities highlighted in the MS09 - 048 update were patched in Vista and Server 2008 .
Only two of the trio affect Windows Server 2000 and Windows XP , Microsoft said in the accompanying advisory , which was refreshed on Thursday .
In the revised advisory , Microsoft explained why it wo n't patch Windows XP , the world 's most popular operating system .
" By default , Windows XP SP2 , Windows XP SP3 and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition SP2 do not have a listening service configured in the client firewall and are therefore not affected by this vulnerability , " the company said .
" Windows XP SP2 and later operating systems include a stateful host firewall that provides protection for computers against incoming traffic from the Internet or from neighboring network devices on a private network . "
Although the two bugs can be exploited on Windows 2000 and XP , Microsoft downplayed their impact .
" A system would become unresponsive due to memory consumption ... [ but ] a successful attack requires a sustained flood of specially crafted TCP packets , and the system will recover once the flood ceases . "
Microsoft rated the vulnerabilities on Windows 2000 and XP as " important " on Windows 2000 , and as " low " on XP .
The company uses a four - step scoring system , where " low " is the least - dangerous threat , followed in ascending order by " moderate , " " important " and " critical . "
The same two bugs were ranked " moderate " for Vista and Server 2008 , while a third -- which does n't affect the older operating systems -- was rated " critical . "
During the Q&A , however , Windows users repeatedly asked Microsoft 's security team to explain why it was n't patching XP , or if , in certain scenarios , their machines might be at risk .
" We still use Windows XP and we do not use Windows Firewall , " read one of the user questions .
" We use a third - party vendor firewall product .
Even assuming that we use the Windows Firewall , if there are services listening , such as remote desktop , would n't then Windows XP be vulnerable to this ? "
" Servers are a more likely target for this attack , and your firewall should provide additional protections against external exploits , " replied Stone and Bryant .
Another user asked them to spell out the conditions under which Microsoft wo n't offer up patches for still - supported operating systems .
Windows Server 2000 SP4 , for example , is to receive security updates until July 2010 ; Windows XP 's support does n't expire until April 2014 .
Stone 's and Bryant 's answer : " We will continue to provide updates for Windows 2000 while it is in support unless it is not technically feasible to do so . "
Skipping patches is very unusual for Microsoft .
According to a Stone and Bryant , the last time it declined to patch a vulnerability in a support edition of Windows was in March 2003 , when it said it would n't fix a bug in Windows NT 4.0 .
Then , it explained the omission with language very similar to what it used when it said it would n't update Windows 2000 .
" Due to these fundamental differences between Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 and its successors , it is infeasible to rebuild the software for Windows NT 4.0 to eliminate the vulnerability , " Microsoft said at the time .
Auroras , like this one seen from Alaska , may be a sign that a planet can support life ( Image : Joshua Strang , United States Air Force / Wikimedia Commons )
THE discovery of extrasolar super - Earths – rocky planets about five to ten times the mass of Earth – has raised hopes that some may harbour life .
Perhaps it ’s a vain hope though , since it now seems that Earth is just the right size to sustain life .
Life is comfortable on Earth in part because of its relatively stable climate and its magnetic field , which deflects cosmic radiation capable of damaging organic molecules as well as …
Most travelers are looking for new experiences , but what about the TRULY unusual ?
For the adventurous travelers there are so many amazing places around the world that you can choose to see , some are man-made and others were formed by nature .
The 5 places below are all natural and are ( most definitely ) some of the strangest places and / or biggest mysteries in the world .
For hundreds of years scientists of all kinds have tried to uncover the mysteries of many of these places to no avail , and travelers seeking adventure have visited them to stare in amazement and take pictures of these odd places .
Enjoy learning a little bit about some of the most out of this world places on Earth , and maybe you will even be inspired to visit one of them yourself someday .
The Devil ’s Bath
This ominous looking pool is located in the thermal reserve of Wai - O - Tapu which is in The Bay of Plenty located in New Zealand .
The Devil ’s Bath is a pea shade of green and it is caused from many different mineral elements in the water .
Devil ’s Bath was created from heavy volcanic activity in the region and it is thought to date back approximately 160,000 years .
Heated streams run underneath the landscape throughout the area and there are many other amazing sites to see along the way .
Vale da Lua ( Moon Valley ) , Bolivia
The Vale da Lua , or Moon Valley is a place that will literally make you feel like you are on another planet , while walking around you may literally feel like an alien is gonna appear .
These rock formations were caused by water erosion over many years and along with the terrestrial landscape there are also natural pools throughout .
The rock formations seen are mostly quartz and crystaland they are among some of the oldest on Earth .
The Great Blue Hole , Belize
The Blue Hole in the ocean is just off the coast of Belize and this is one that is a great destination for brave scuba divers , and even on your way to Belize for vacation you may see the great Blue Hole as you fly over .
I mentioned scuba above and this is one of the top destinations in the world for experienced scuba divers because of how deep the Great Blue Hole is and because it s full of many different caverns and hideaways .
Scuba divers also get a close up view of the tropical fish and schools of sharks that inhabit the hole .
Nazca Lines
The Nazca lines are lines that were etched into the ground thousands of years ago by the Nazca people and they are located in the Nazca Desert of Peru .
Many of these are just lines but there are also many that resemble people and animals , and they most likely had to do with the religious beliefs of the tribe .
There have been many different theories about the lines though , including many about aliens .
The Nazca lines definitely make for a great place to visit no matter who you are , and their wonders can be appreciated by all .
Socotra Island
Socotra Island is located in the Indian Ocean about 200 nautical miles off the coast of Africa .
It is part of the Republic of Yemen but it is also one of the most isolated groups of inhabited islands in the world .
Socotra Island is full of all types of otherworldly vegetation and almost half of the flora and fauna found on the island is only native to the islands .
The islands are an amazing and strange place to visit and are a destination for people , especially those that love to se some of the most beautiful plant life in the world .
Like the Bank of England , we 're not above repeating ourselves .
So just where has all the money gone ?
IT SEEMS WE'RE NOT the only people trying to figure out where all the money went from this decade 's debt bubble .
" Where did all the debt go ? " asked Bank of England economist Spencer Dale in a speech last Thursday in Exeter .
Sadly for US and British households , however , let alone savers and investors , he had fewer answers than even us here at BullionVault .
" Household debt as a proportion of income increased from 100 % to 165 % in the 10 years to 2007 , " Dale noted of the United Kingdom . " [ Yet ] this big run up in debt was not used to finance a surge in spending , " he added , as if taking his cue from our essay of last Wednesday , Economic Dark Matter , and scribbling his speech the next morning as the train crawled through Reading .
" Where did it all go ? "
Where indeed ...?
Because as the chart shows , the surge in Britain 's household debt ratio starting 10 years ago coincided with a marked slowdown in consumer spending growth .
In the US , the same picture ... with personal indebtedness ticking higher from the same point in time , too .
Which hardly seems fair .
Just imagine !
Borrowing a record multiple of gross income – fully 120 % in the US by 2007 ... and a whacking 170 % by the start of '09 here in the UK – just to ease up on discretionary spending .
" In fact , there was no such boom , " Spencer Dale went on in this week 's speech , pretty much quoting yours truly .
But just like his policy - making predecessor , Stephen Nickell , five years before him , he thinks the missing billions – borrowed but not spent in the shops or malls – are explained away by " developments " in the housing market ...
" House prices trebled in the ten years to 2007 .
And mortgage debts were accumulated to pay for the housing that had become so much more expensive .
The conventional wisdom that the sharp increase in household debt was associated with the house price boom of the past decade is well founded . "
So far , so good .
The missing digit in our grand sudoku puzzle – that economic dark matter which forced consumers deep into hock without consumption soaring – lies in house prices .
Right ?
Not quite , says Dale .
" What is less often appreciated is that much of that rise in household debt was matched by a comparable increase in the value of financial assets held by households . "
Just like Nickell in late 2004 , the Old Lady 's man sees a matching asset to balance the debt .
Borrowing here must equal new savings there .
The volumes , though swollen , still equal each other .
Net - net , we all got richer by taking on debt .
That 's why economists call it a balance - sheet , stupid !
Says Dale , " The value of housing assets purchased by households did increase , through additions and improvements to the housing stock .
But the main counterpart to the rise in borrowing was increased saving . "
How much more saving ...?
" While households accumulated an additional £ 1 trillion of debt between 2000 and 2008 , they also acquired over £ 750 billion of financial assets over the same period . "
Huzzah !
Some £ 250 billion – a mere $ 400bn , equal to 25 % of both the total debt amassed over the period and also 25 % of average annual GDP – went missing in the UK debt - savings boom of the early 21st century .
Just think how bad the leakage would have got if no one was paying attention or understood what - in - the Simon Cowell was happening here .
Ah...ummmm ...
Two points :
Adding value to real estate is not an absolute act .
Measured against a dumb , useless lump of metal , for instance , the addition of electricity and clean running water to both the UK and US housing stocks did zilch between the Great Depression and the Great Inflation four decades later ( see US House Prices in Gold ) .
Granite work - tops surely count for much less ;
On the other side of the ledger – the one that fails to balance debt growth by 25 % remember – Dale does n't say what those amassed " financial assets " are .
Just like Nickell half - a- decade ago , nor does he cite his source for that grand figure ... then put at 15 % annually of net income ... now set at £ 750 bn over eight years .
Yet here , Dale notes , his figure for asset accumulation " does not include returns from these investments . "
Just what might that rate of return have been ?
Perhaps those assets consisted of simply more property ... now down by a fifth from the start of 2008 .
Or stock - market shares , perhaps ... still one - third off their level of 2000 and increasingly foreign owned ( 35 % in 2000 ; more than 40 % foreign - owned by end -2006 ) .
Government gilts would have made a half - decent home for the cash gains of those " older households , trading down within the housing market " ( as both Nickell and now Dale call them ) who apparently got rich from the next generation 's indebtedness .
But here , as with equities , foreign ownership has risen this decade , not fallen thanks to some crowding out by property profits recycled into government bonds .
So where , oh where , did the money go ?
Sitting here , four miles west of Threadneedle Street , we really do n't pretend to know what 's happened , happening , or will happen here .
All we can see at BullionVault is that the historic boom in household debt saw vast sums of money vanish from the data .
And a little like losing sight of a shark , that makes us uneasy .
Want to Buy Gold but unsure how best to do it ?
Make it simple , secure and cost - effective at BullionVault ...
Yoga originates from India and dates back some 5,000 years
High - security Ringerike jail near Oslo offered the classes to eight inmates on a trial basis earlier this year .
Prison warden Sigbjoern Hagen said some of the inmates became more irritable and agitated and had trouble sleeping .
He said the prison did not have the resources to treat emotions unleashed by the deep breathing exercises .
The yoga group expressed surprise at the prison 's findings .
It said the project had been tested successfully on some 100,000 prisoners in around 15 countries , the AFP news agency reported .
" The reactions we received from the prisoners who participated in the classes were very varied , ranging from completely positive to completely negative , " Mr Hagen reportedly wrote in a letter to the group .
On the negative side , the yoga had provoked " strong reactions : agitation , aggression , irritability , trouble sleeping and mental confusion " , he said .
The deep breathing exercises are an essential element of Yoga , which originated in India more than 5,000 years ago and aims to harmonise mind , body and spirit .
But such exercises could make inmates more dangerous by unblocking their psychological barriers , Mr Hagen was quoted as saying .
