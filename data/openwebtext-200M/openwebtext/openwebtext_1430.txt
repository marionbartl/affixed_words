IT HAS become an accepted response from pro-Israeli entities to label those opposed to the actions of the Israeli government as " anti-Semitic " or " anti-Jewish . "
This is a notion that must be dispelled outright and addressed for what it actually is .
It is imperative to allow those with legitimate objections to the actions of the Israeli government to have a platform from which to voice their objections without being labeled bigots or racists .
The idea that any person who criticizes Israel is naturally anti-Semitic is just dubious by its very nature , and anyone who puts it forward can certainly only be semi-conscious .
If being critical of the Zionist state of Israel automatically makes one an anti-Semite , then it stands to reason that that the members of movements such as Naturei Karta and countless other Jewish organizations that are opposed to Israel 's policies are anti-Semitic .
Naturei Karta consists of a group of American rabbis who are opposed to the policies of the Israeli government and are appalled at Israeli policies toward Palestinians in the name of their faith , Judaism .
So a rabbi who opposes Israel is anti-Jewish ?
I wonder .
Not to mention countless other prominent Jews like Professors Norman Finkelstein and Noam Chomsky who , despite efforts of the pro-Israeli propaganda machine to gag and defame them , have managed to speak out against what they believe to be crimes against humanity committed by Israel .
How can individuals such as these be anti-Semitic when they are Jews themselves ?
Professor Chomsky has the most Jewish upbringing one can imagine -- with a father who taught Hebrew at Jewish schools , and Professor Chomsky himself working in the Zionist movement as a youngster .
What of the countless Israelis who absolutely refuse to serve in the Israel Defense Force , citing their disdain for the policies of their very own country ?
Are all of these people anti-Semites , or so called self - hating Jews ?
The answer is clearly no .
But another question deserves examining here :
Why would a Jew be opposed to Zionism if it is , as Zionists would like the world to believe , an intrinsic part of Judaism ?
Israel is much more a Zionist state than a Jewish one .
Yes , the majority of its inhabitants are Jews by way of religion but it is the Zionist movement of the late 1800's that stirred a nationalist fervor in the Jewish Diaspora that led to the Balfour Declaration of 1917 that saw the pouring in of Jews from all over into Palestine .
The Balfour Declaration had absolutely no regard for the people who were living in Palestine for hundreds of years before the British stuck their noses in it .
These people were Palestinian Jews , Muslims and Christians who lived in relative peace for hundreds of years before the advent of Zionism .
To put it into context :
There was never any issue like what we see today between Muslims , Christians and Jews in Palestine until Zionism came into the picture .
Blaming this conflict on religion is completely unfair and intellectually dishonest .
Muslims and Jews have had a long history together from the time of the Islamic Empire that stretched from Constantinople to Andalusia , better known as present - day Spain .
The following quote from David Ben-Gurion , the first Israeli prime minister , sums up the Zionist attitude toward the non-Jewish Palestinians : " We must expel Arabs and take their places . "
Another quote from Yitzhak Shamir , former prime minister of Israel , speaks of the utter disregard Zionism has for the people whose land they are encouraging illegal settlements to be built on : " The settlement of the land of Israel is the essence of Zionism .
Without settlement , we will not fulfill Zionism .
It 's that simple . "
Mr. Shamir clearly had no regard for the fact that people were living on these lands he encouraged Israelis to " settle " on .
It does not take a theologian to tell you that racism and disregard for the rights of others of different faiths , creed or color has no place in Judaism .
The Jewish people have a past that is filled with loss and suffering and deserve to be admired for their ability to overcome the harshest of conditions .
They are of the most industrious , innovative and spiritually wealthy people and our world would be a much worse place without them .
Zionism has absolutely no business in this great religion and its ideologies are alien to and completely incompatible with Judaism .
Jews who have made the decision to oppose this ideology deserve to be commended for their courage and , better yet , supported in their endeavors to make the world aware of this destructive menace .
It is also worth mentioning that awareness of Zionist atrocities is growing quite rapidly in the United States .
American citizens should be commended for voicing their discontent for their government 's support for Israel .
The tide is turning from blind support to active protest and it is easily recognizable if you keep your ear to the ground with regard to this matter .
The days of funding Israel 's war machine by an average of $ 2 billion per year of the American taxpayer 's money will come to an end when American citizens start asking questions of their leaders .
Islam and Muslims face a very similar and real challenge in the form of Islamic extremism .
There is no doubt that terrorism is born from this very unhealthy interpretation of the teachings of the Koran .
I hang my head in shame when I hear of the burning of churches , the circumcision of infant baby girls and the sheer backwardness of people living in societies where Islamic extremism is the order of the day .
It is an indictment on Islam and thinking - Muslims and I count myself amongst those who speak out against it instead of condoning it with silence .
For far too long has the whims of man been allowed to hijack Judeo - Christian - Islamic values .
But to label the struggle of the Palestinians as " terrorist " is extremely dishonest and a notion only an armchair intellectual will allow himself or herself to be fooled into thinking .
Israel has a right to exist , but will never know the peace it so desperately yearns for if it does not ask itself some hard questions .
There is no doubt that the Palestinians need to do the same as their resentment can be a blinding factor in making the right decisions that will lead to some kind of resolution to this awful conflict .
But , as the clear aggressor and occupier , it cannot be denied that Israel has much more to answer for .

WEST VALLEY CITY --
Police have n't arrested the thief just yet , but they know his name and information -- all because he looked himself up on Salt Lake County Jail 's database .
The West Valley EZ Rent - to - Own at 2974 W. 3500 South usually gets honest customers looking to own .
This time , a man thought he'd skip the rent part and go straight to own -- by stealing .
Assistant store manager Cody Flippin was helping someone else when the thief walked in Dec. 10 .
The man told Flippin he just wanted to browse , but then he left with two laptops .
" When he bolted out the door , I was gone .
I was chasing right after him , " Flippin said .
" It seemed like he had it planned out .
He was in here the day previous , looking around .
He kind of scoped it out . "
Wow , you pulled up your own picture , your own name , your own information .
That helped me and saved me and the police a lot of time .
– Assistant store manager Cody Flippin .
And just like that , the man was gone .
A couple days later Flippin was able to see what the suspect was looking at on the Internet : his own mug shot .
" Wow , you pulled up your own picture , your own name , your own information .
That helped me and saved me and the police a lot of time , " Flippin said of the thief .
West Valley police say the thief is 41 - year - old Shane Ellis Caster .
EZ Rent - to - Own uses a software that can trace Internet actions on stolen computers .
In this case , Caster pulled up his previous mug shot on the jail 's website .
" That face just locked in my head , " Flippin said .
" Once I was viewing some pages I noticed the Salt Lake County .
I pulled it up and there was a picture of the gentleman . "
Detectives say Flippin was able to identify the man in a photo lineup .
According to jail records , Caster goes by several aliases , including Bobby Joe , Joseph Smith and Scrapyard .
All it took to figure out his ID was a simple software program .
Flippin is all gratitude .
" To make it that easy ...
Thank you . "
Tuesday , detectives filed an arrest warrant for third - degree felony theft .
They say Caster has a long record of stealing .

I sit here wondering where have I gone wrong , looking inside myself , thinking what did I do to lose you this way ...
As I try to sleep at night , my heart sings , reminiscing , longing for you , as the fond memories of us fill my mind , heart and soul .
It is true that without you I cannot be my true self , it is true that emptiness is all I feel around my shattered pieces of heart .
But I search for you again , I long for you again , to take me back into your arms and give meaning to my passions , to my life .
What have you been up to lately ?
what music do you sing ?
where does your heart go when you dream of a blissful existence ?
How come people do n't judge you anymore ?
What 's your secret ?
What 's your way ?
Teach me , get me back .
Take me , hold me back .
Show me that all I have gone through in your absence is meaningless , for you have not been there to witness it .
Drive me into your very being again , for I long for its warmth .
Let your exceptional being ignite my fire and build it effortlessly into its greatest forms , this fire I used to hold within myself .
Show me the journey I once led you to , show me how I can regain life in its perfect way again , for I need you back .
I had my dreams built with you , around you , but you took them for yourself .
You went away , so fast so swiftly you disappeared .
How are you doing ?
I 'd like to know .
How are your days passing ?
Do you dream of your heart reuniting to completeness ?
Where are you going ?
Why do you escape ?
I have dreamed of reaching you again , and oh did I try to touch your core again , but everyone around me is not helping , they separate us further away .
I cannot keep doing this without you .
Life has no meaning without you .
I need your heart to play with mine , I need your core to make mine whole .
Passions to flow back to me , like a little lost kid finding his mother , holding her tightly , loving her truly .
I need to be the tear that falls down a mother 's face , looking at her grown son establishing himself as a great being , pride filling up a father 's heart .
For I am lost without you , I am shattered without you , my true being needs you , is calling for you , is crying for you for I need you , my true lost self , I miss you .

When I was young , I enjoyed the romance of the garret .
Poverty , or relative poverty , became me .
I mastered arcane books and composed ambitious essays in the smallest apartment anybody ever saw in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
When you opened the door , it hit the bed , which of course led to some misunderstandings .
I rested my typewriter on a scarred wooden board that groaned every time I struck the keys .
When what I wrote was published , I took my earnings to an elegant clothing store on Newbury Street , in defiance of the disconnection notice in my briefcase .
( Balzac says somewhere that a student is a person who can afford only luxuries . )
I was often broke but never destitute .
Many years later Irving Howe used a phrase that described my state of happy indigence : “ a decent poverty , ” he called it .
Lately , however , I have been observing a high incidence of indecent poverty .
Many young writers and journalists I meet are close to penniless .
They have almost not a hope of supporting themselves in the pursuit of their calling .
A garret is no longer affordable .
Jobs are disappearing .
Internships are unpaid or barely paid , which has the consequence of corrupting a meritocratic system with the inequities of social class , as the fortunately born become the fortunately hired .
And when they publish what they write -- well , now we leave the honorable tradition of the struggling young writer for the unprecedented enchantments of the digital revolution .
Owing to its vastness and its velocity , no medium of communication and publication ever depended more desperately on “ content ” -- the lifeless business expression for words and ideas -- than the Internet .
Some people celebrate this as a historic breakthrough for literariness in its various forms .
They rhapsodize about the democratization of the writing life , about the demise of the “ gatekeepers ” and their institutions , about the pure and perfect autonomy of blogging and “ self - publishing . ”
Who needs
The New York Times if I can arrange for you to know what it is in my heart at this instant ?
Leave aside the question of the relation of blogging to writing , of posting to publishing .
I wish to emphasize what the love songs omit : the economic and professional consequences of the cheap entropy of the web -- its proletarianization of the writer .
I wonder if people outside the besieged walls of the profession understand how little is earned with contributions to websites .
The sums are scandalous .
And sometimes there are no sums at all .
Sometimes contributions to websites are produced for free .
Writers are the only people I know who are expected to work for next to nothing or nothing .
Without them , as I say , the intelligent regions of the Internet would not exist ; but even as their skills are increasingly in demand , they are treated increasingly as worthless .
You do not have to read the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts to recognize that this becomes an issue of dignity .
From the standpoint of the owners of these institutions , this “ business model ” may seem rational -- if they can save money on paper , printing , and postage , why not also save money on prose ?-- but theirs is not the only standpoint that matters in considering the future of our culture .
( Leave aside also the question of paper , and of its almost spiritual necessity for serious writing and its betterment of life . )
It is not the owners who make our culture , though some of them serve it admirably .
Indeed , an enlightened owner is a hero of culture .
And yet it is of no importance that the market will bear this immiseration of writers ; the history of the market is riddled with injustices of all kinds .
And what model of economic rationality is it that recommends the exertion of one ’s skills for little or no reward ?
I refer you to a report by James Rainey in the Los Angeles Times a few weeks ago about the reality of the contemporary freelancer : “ what ’s sailing away , a decade into the 21st century , is the common perception that writing is a profession -- or at least a skilled craft that should come not only with psychic rewards but with something resembling a living wage . ”
Is this really what we want ?
( About Rainey ’s article , one of the brats on Gawker - - see what insomnia can do to a man ? -- poignantly observed that “ it ’s a little disturbing that the job that pays my bills now may be helping to destroy the one that helped pay them when I was in college . ” )
And a similar indecency is taking place in book publishing .
Laud the Kindle all you want , but who will pay the advance for the novels and the histories that you will cop for $ 8.99 , without which they can not be written ?
Not Amazon .
A literary agent in New York was recently heard to remark that $ 30,000 is the new $ 100,000 , and it takes years to write a book .
Forward - looking thinkers explain that the money that the publishing houses , or their corporate proprietors , save by printing fewer physical copies will make up the difference ; but anybody who believes that those savings will be restored to the primary mission of the editors and the publishers does not understand a thing about the corporate temperament , especially in the aftermath of a panic .
No , nausea is in order .
In an interminable piece in The Atlantic , Michael Kinsley complains that newspaper articles are too long .
“ On the Internet , news articles get to the point , ” my friend declares , whereas “ newspaper writing ... is encrusted with conventions that do n’t add to your understanding of the news . ”
He follows this with a quantitative and semantic analysis of various examples of “ unnecessary verbiage ” ; and like much quantitative and semantic analysis , the results are clever and trivial .
I do not doubt that newspapers are not as linguistically efficient as they can be , except perhaps USA Today , that ur - website .
But Kinsley ’s worry about the financial costs of prolixity is silly : no newsroom budget will be rescued by cutting “ tag ” and “ context . ”
So may I say a word on behalf of necessary verbiage ?
Brevity may be the soul of wit , or lingerie , or texting , or quail eggs , but all subjects are not the same .
Efficiency of expression is in some realms a virtue and in some realms a vice .
Brevity is certainly not the soul of news , if by news you mean more than information .
“ The point ” is not always easy .
There is not always a “ takeaway . ”
Anyway , this is already an abbreviating age .
The forces of concision and distillation are winning .
After the death of waiting , I do not see the wisdom of preaching impatience .
A culture cannot thrive upon a fear of discourse .

There are several memorial services and events being planned for Howard Zinn whom The New York Times called a “ historian , shipyard worker , civil rights activist and World War II bombardier , when he passed away at age 87 late last month . ”
His legion of friends , students , admirers and colleagues will be out in force reminding the country about his impact as a civic leader , motivational teacher , author of the ever more popular book A People ’s History of the United States , and all around fine , compassionate , and level - headed human being .
Judging by similar gatherings for remembering other progressive activists and writers , the encomiums for Professor Zinn , who taught at Spelman College in the late fifties and early sixties ( two of his students were Marian Wright Edelman and Alice Walker ) and at Boston University until 1988 , will be heartfelt , wide - ranging and inspiringly anecdotal .
Receptions will follow and those in attendance will return to their homes , hoping that what Howard Zinn spoke and wrote and how he acted will serve as an example for those who follow his public philosophy of being and doing .
Mr. Zinn ’s legacy , however , needs more than sweet memories that carry forward the spirit of people .
His impact needs more than the adult and youth book version ( now in a television miniseries via the History Channel ) to continue inspiring what the Times described as “ a generation of high school and college students to rethink American history . ”
How about drawing on the large , national constituency whose lives he has informed honestly and helped improve to support the establishment of the Howard Zinn Institute for Advancing Peace and Justice ?
Thought and action in a seamless flow toward returning the definition of “ freedom ” back to the words of Marcus Cicero as “ participation in power . ”
When Senator Paul Wellstone and his wife , Sheila , died in a plane crash in 2002 , his children started “ Wellstone Action ! ” with contributions from all over the country , to train citizen organizers to help empower underrepresented communities to engage in civic life .
As a result , Senator Wellstone ’s progressive work to deepen our democracy continues in action year after year .
The life of Howard Zinn did not follow the usual pathways .
His experience as a manual laborer and organizer in New York City gave depth to his college and graduate years .
He entered New York University at the age of twenty - seven and completed his Ph.D. at Columbia University in his thirties .
Consider the origins of his views on war summarized in his own words :
War is by definition the indiscriminate killing of huge numbers of people for ends that are uncertain .
Think about means and ends , and apply it to war .
The means are horrible , certainly .
The ends , uncertain .
That alone should make you hesitate … .
We are smart in so many ways .
Surely we should be able to understand that between war and passivity , there are a thousand possibilities .
Back in World War II , Mr. Zinn was a bombardier in planes that dropped napalm including during a raid over a town in France called Royan .
After the war , his sensitivities horrified , Zinn returned to Royan on the ground and interviewed survivors , which included French civilians .
For sixty years , this Army veteran spoke out against all wars , from Vietnam to Iraq , and others , from the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan to Indonesian , African and Chinese assaults .
Howard Zinn did not choose his injustices .
No matter where they came from , he was in opposition .
In a poignant tribute of “ thank yous ” to his regular columnist , Matthew Rothschild , editor of the Progressive Magazine , wrote “ Thank you , Howard Zinn , for being a Jew who dared to criticize Israel ’s oppression of the Palestinians , early on . ”
MIT Professor Noam Chomsky , a long - time friend of Zinn , commented on his “ amazing contribution to American intellectual and moral culture , ” noting his “ powerful role in helping … the civil rights movement and the antiwar movement . ”
His two friends from Hollywood , Matt Damon and Ben Affleck , took Zinn ’s history of the downtrodden , the workers , farmers , women , slaves and other minorities , into popular culture , culminating in a television version of the book , The People Speak .
Perhaps , Boston Globe columnist James Carroll touched most personally on Zinn ’s magnetic persona to so many people .
“ He had a genius , ” Carroll wrote , “ for the practical meaning of love .
That is what drew legions of the young to him and what made the wide circle of his friends so constantly amazed and grateful . ”
Zinn explained himself in his autobiography You Ca n’t Be Neutral on a Moving Train .
His two greatest disappointments in the past two years were the loss of his wife Roslyn and the performance of Barack Obama .
In his last article on the Obama White House , he wrote , “ I ’ve been searching hard for a highlight . ”
Roslyn and Howard Zinn left two children , Myla and Jeff , and five grandchildren .
Together with his publisher , Dan Simon of 7 Stories Press , his editor , Matthew Rothschild , his interviewer , Amy Goodman , his associate , Anthony Arnove , and his innumerable writers and fighters for justice , for the principle that the truth is revolutionary , why not a well - funded and staffed Institute , organizing from the neighborhoods on up , as he urged so often , with horizons for all seasons , as befits his vision ?
Although the desire to remember is now intense , it is the willpower that implements the thought .
Jean Monnet , the great postwar French civic leader , put the legacy course on track when he asserted that “ without people , nothing is possible , but without institutions , nothing is enduring . ”

Editor 's Note :
All this week in our special series " Broken Government , " CNN is taking a hard look at our nation 's government ; the frustrating problems and the potential solutions .
Today , our Carol Costello reports on the growing struggles of the American middle class .
Tomorrow on American Morning , we look at why banks still are n't loaning and what the answer is for small businesses .
By Bob Ruff and Carol Costello
What does it take to be part of the American middle class ?
Here ’s the tried and true way :
Get an education , work hard , get a good paying job with benefits , raise a family , buy a house and a car or two and take a vacation once a year .
Put it all together and you ’re describing not just the dream , but the fulfillment of that dream by tens of millions of Americans during the last century .
But that was then , before the hard economic times following 9/11 , and this is now .
Meet the Bindners of Alexandria , Virginia .
“ I think the middle class , ” says Moira Bindner , “ is trying to get a handle on where their feet are because it feels like the rug has been totally pulled out , and it ’s really challenging on a day to day basis to accomplish everything with the paycheck coming in the door . ”
For example : “ You do n’t go to the dentist , you do n’t get your car repaired until it ’s desperate ... the retirement plan went out the window and our credit card debt went up , ” says Moira .
Moira works for a company that manages professional speakers .
Her husband , Michael , works in education .
Both have lost their jobs , and while they are now back to work , their combined salary is thousands less than it used to be .
Commerce Department statistics show that the Bindners are hardly alone .
From 1990 to 2008 , middle class incomes rose just 20 % , and most of that happened in the 1990s .
Since then , income has stagnated for people in the middle , yet home prices shot up 56 % , college costs 60 % .
As for health care , no one would be surprised to learn that it ’s up 155 % .
According to some , government has made the problem worse .
Jacob Hacker is a Yale University political scientist who just published “ The Great Risk Shift , ” a book about the decline of the American dream .
He says , “ there ’s a lot of pressure for politicians to appease those who have the most money in the system . ”
He ’s talking about big political donors and lobbyists who represent the rich and powerful .
Washington gets that there ’s a big problem with the middle class in America , says Isabel Sawhill of the Brookings Institution .
But “ none of them are willing to do the unpopular things , which means they ’re not willing to raise taxes , and they ’re not willing to cut spending .
So we ’re at an impasse now and it ’s getting worse day by day . ”
“ The only thing that has come out of Washington is more and more gridlock and more and more game playing , ” says Moira .
So , we asked her if government is broken ?
“ I would say , not broken , but bruised ... I think it ’s bruised . ”
Recently I wrote about one of the Google Code Jam challenges , where , perhaps surprisingly , the best answer — the most elegant and obviously correct answer , requiring the fewest lines of code , with virtually zero space overhead , and running the quickest — the very best answer was coded in C ++.
Why should this be surprising ?
C++ is a powerful language .
In my experience there is almost no limit to the damage that a sufficiently ingenious fool can do with C++.
But there is also almost no limit to the degree of complexity that a skillful library designer can hide behind a simple , safe , and elegant C++ interface .
— Greg Colvin , “ In the Spirit of C ”
Yes .
And yes !
But in this article I wanted to discuss something C++ ca n’t do .
Let ’s start with another challenge from the same round of the 2009 Google Code Jam .
Decision trees — in particular , a type called classification trees — are data structures that are used to classify items into categories using features of those items .
For example , each animal is either “ cute ” or not .
For any given animal , we can decide whether it is cute by looking at the animal ’s features and using the following decision tree .
( 0.2 furry ( 0.81 fast ( 0.3 ) ( 0.2 ) ) ( 0.1 fishy ( 0.3 freshwater ( 0.01 ) ( 0.01 ) ) ( 0.1 ) ) ) — Decision Trees , Google Code Jam 2009
The challenge goes on to describe the structure more formally , then steps through an example calculation .
What is the probability , p , that a beaver is cute ?
For example , a beaver is an animal that has two features : furry and freshwater .
We start at the root with p equal to 1 .
We multiply p by 0.2 , the weight of the root and move into the first sub - tree because the beaver has the furry feature .
There , we multiply p by 0.81 , which makes p equal to 0.162 .
From there we move further down into the second sub - tree because the beaver does not have the fast feature .
Finally , we multiply p by 0.2 and end up with 0.0324 — the probability that the beaver is cute .
The challenge itself involves processing input comprising a number of test cases .
Each test case consists of a decision tree followed by a number of animals .
A solution should parse the input and output the calculated cuteness probabilities .
def cuteness ( decision_tree , features ) : " " " Return the probability an animal is cute .
- decision_tree , the decision tree - features , the animal 's features , " " " p = 1.0 dt = decision_tree has_feature = features .
__contains__ while dt : weight , * dt = dt p *= weight if dt : feat , lt , rt = dt dt = lt if has_feature ( feat ) else rt return p
Calculating an animal ’s cuteness given a decision tree and the animal ’s features is n’t hard .
In Python we do n’t need to code up a specialised decision tree class — a nested tuple does just fine .
The cuteness ( ) function shown above descends the decision tree , switching left or right according to each feature ’s presence or absence .
The efficiency of this algorithm is proportional to the depth of the tree multiplied by the length of the feature list ; as far as the code jam challenge goes , it ’s not a concern .
>>> decision_tree = ( ... 0.2 , ' furry ' , ... ( 0.81 , ' fast ' , ... ( 0.3 , ) , ... ( 0.2 , ) , ... ) , ... ( 0.1 , ' fishy ' , ... ( 0.3 , ' freshwater ' , ... ( 0.01 , ) , ... ( 0.01 , ) , ... ) , ... ( 0.1 , ) , ... ) , ... ) >>> beaver = ( ' furry ' , ' freshwater ' ) >>> cuteness ( decision_tree , beaver ) 0.032400000000000005
No , the real problem here is how to parse the input data to create the decision trees and feature sets .
As you can see , though , the textual specification of a decision tree closely resembles a Python representation of that decision tree .
Just add punctuation .
Specification Python ( 0.2 furry ( 0.81 fast ( 0.3 ) ( 0.2 ) ) ( 0.1 fishy ( 0.3 freshwater ( 0.01 ) ( 0.01 ) ) ( 0.1 ) ) ) ( 0.2 , ' furry ' , ( 0.81 , ' fast ' , ( 0.3 , ) , ( 0.2 , ) , ) , ( 0.1 , ' fishy ' , ( 0.3 , ' freshwater ' , ( 0.01 , ) , ( 0.01 , ) , ) , ( 0.1 , ) , ) , )
Rather than parse the decision tree definition by hand , why not tweak it so that it is a valid Python nested tuple ?
Then we can just let the Python interpreter eval the tuple and use it directly .
A program ’s ability to read and execute source code at run-time is one of the things which makes dynamic languages dynamic .
You ca n’t do it in C and C++ — no , sneaking instructions past the end of a buffer does n’t count .
Should you do it in Python ?
Well , it wo n’t hurt to give it a try .
spec = '' '\ ( 0.2 furry ( 0.81 fast ( 0.3 ) ( 0.2 ) ) ( 0.1 fishy ( 0.3 freshwater ( 0.01 ) ( 0.01 ) ) ( 0.1 ) ) ) ''' tuple_rep = re.sub(r '( [ \.\d ] +|\ ) ) ' , r'\1 , ' , spec ) tuple_rep = re.sub( r ' ( [ a - z ] + ) ' , r' " \1 " , ' , tuple_rep ) decision_tree = eval( tuple_rep ) [ 0 ]
Here , we start with the input specification of the decision tree ( imagine this has been read directly from standard input ) .
The first regex substitution inserts commas after numbers , and right parentheses .
The second substitution quotes and inserts a comma after feature strings .
This turns the decision tree ’s specification into a textual representation of a nested Python tuple .
We then eval that tuple and assign the result to decision_tree — a Python decision tree we can go on and use in the rest of our program .
And that ’s the code jam challenge cracked , pretty much .
>>> from pprint import pprint >>> pprint ( decision_tree ) ( 0.2 , ' furry ' , ( 0.81 , ' fast ' , ( 0.3 , ) , ( 0.2 , ) ) , ( 0.1 , ' fishy ' , ( 0.3 , ' freshwater ' , ( 0.01 , ) , ( 0.01 , ) ) , ( 0.1 , ) ) )
( Minor wrinkle : you ’ll have spotted the final decision tree is the first element of the evaluated tuple .
That ’s because the regex substitution puts a trailing comma after the right parenthesis which closes the decision tree specification , which turns tuple_rep into a one - tuple .
The single element contained in this one - tuple is what we need . )
As you can see , it does n’t take much code to pull the decision tree in ready for use .
Python allows us to convert between text and code and to execute code within the current environment : you just need to keep a clear head and remember where you are .
Regular expressions may not have the first class language support they enjoy in Perl and Ruby , but they are well supported , and the raw string syntax makes them more readable .
Certainly , this code snippet is easier to put together than a full blown parser , but I think it will take more than this to convince a C++ programmer that Python is a powerful language , rather than a dangerous tool for ingenious fools .
It fails to convince me .
I ca n’t remember ever using eval or exec in production code , where keeping a separation between layers is more important than speed of coding .
That said , Python is a fine language for scripting , and speed of coding is what matters in this particular challenge .
Just for fun , what if there were a prize for brevity ?
Then of course Perl would win !
Code Jam golf , by gnibbler , Stack Overflow say ( " Case # $_ : " ) , $ _=eval " ' ' " .'.<>'x<> , s :[ a- z ]+:*(/ $ &\\s /? : g,s/\ ) \s*\(/):/g , eval " \$_= <>; say$_ ; " x<> for 1 ..<>
Note that this does more than simply parse a decision tree — it ’s a complete solution to the code jam challenge , reading trees , features , calculating cutenesses , and producing output in the required format .
Sadly that ’s all I can say about it because the details of its operation are beyond me .
Using Python to dynamically execute code may not generally be needed or welcomed in Python production code , and over - reliance on the same trick risks reinforcing Perl ’s “ write only ” reputation , but Python and Perl are n’t the only contenders .
The equivalence of code and data marks Lisp ’s apotheosis .
Take a look at a Lisp solution to the challenge .
This one is coded up in Arc .
( def r ( ) ( read ) ) ( for i 1 ( r ) ( prn " Case # " i " : " ) ( r ) ( = z ( r ) ) ( repeat ( r ) ( r ) ( loop ( = g ( n - of ( r ) ( r ) ) c z p 1 ) c ( = p (* ( pop c ) p ) c ( if ( pos ( pop c ) g ) ( c 0 ) ( cadr c ) ) ) ) ( prn p ) ) )
Which challenge does this solve ?
I meant the code golf challenge , of solving the decision tree problem using the fewest keystrokes .
At 154 characters this Arc program is nearly half as long again as the winning Perl entry , but it ’s hardly flabby .
What really impresses me , though , is that the code is ( almost ) as readable as it is succinct .
It ’s elegant code .
The only real scars left by the battle for brevity are the one character variable names .
Here ’s the same code with improved variable names and some comments added .
It ’s the ( read ) calls which evaluate expressions on standard input .
The ( for ... ) and ( repeat ... ) expressions operate as you might expect .
The third looping construct , ( loop ... ) initialises , tests and proceeds , much like a C for loop .
( for i 1 ( read ) ; Read N , # test cases , and loop ( prn " Case # " i " : " ) ( read ) ; Skip L , # lines taken by decision tree ( = dtree ( read ) ) ; and read the tree in directly ( repeat ( read ) ; Repeat over A , # animals ( read ) ; Skip animal name ; Read in the animal 's features and walk down the ; decision tree calculating p , the cuteness probability ( loop ( = features ( n - of ( read ) ( read ) ) dt dtree p 1 ) dt ( = p (* ( pop dt ) p ) dt ( if ( pos ( pop dt ) features ) ( car dt ) ( cadr dt ) ) ) ) ( prn p ) ) )
You could argue the elegance of this solution is due to the fact the input comprises a sequence of tokens and S - expressions .
If commas had been used to separate input elements and the text fields had been enclosed in quotes , then maybe a Python solution would have been equally clean .
Or if the input had been in XML , then we ’d be looking to a library rather than eval for parsing the input .
It ’s a fair point , but the equivalence of code and data counts as Lisp ’s biggest idea .
Where Python ’s eval is workable but rarely needed , Lisp ’s ( read ) is fundamental .
So , the most elegant answer to the code jam decision tree challenge would also be the quickest to write , and it would be written in Lisp .
Did code jam champion , ACRush , submit a Lisp solution ?
Absolutely not !
Another fundamental thing about Lisp is that it ’s straightforward to parse .
A C++ expert can knock up an input parser for decision trees and features to order .
ACRush brushed this round aside with a perfect score , taking just 45 minutes to code up working C++ solutions to this question and two others .
I ’ve reproduced his solution to the decision tree challenge at the end of this article .
It ’s plain and direct .
Given the time constraints , I think it exhibits astonishing fluency — the work of someone who can think in C ++.
In this article we ’ve encountered four programming languages :
Python
Perl
Lisp
C++
These languages are very different but they share features too .
They are all mature , popular and well - supported [ 1 ] .
Each is a powerful general purpose programming language .
But ultimately , the power of the programmer is what matters .
Here ’s another revision of the Arc solution , this time decomposed into subfunctions .
I found no complete formal documentation of Arc .
You ’ll have to read the source and follow the forum , and to actually run any code you ’ll have to download a an old version of MzScheme .
The official line is : by all means have a play , but expect things to change .
That said , the language looks delightful , practical , and quite onion free .
The tutorial made me smile .

; The input is a sequence of valid Arc expressions .
; Create some read aliases to execute these .
( = skip read decision - tree read n- features read n- tests read n-animals read ) ( def animal - features () ;
Get an animal 's features ( skip ) ; animal name ( n - of ( n - features ) ( read ) ) ) ( def cuteness ( dtree features ) ; Calculate cuteness from a decision tree and feature set ( = dt dtree p 1.0 ) ( while dt ( = p (* ( pop dt ) p ) dt ( if ( pos ( pop dt ) features ) ( car dt ) ( cadr dt ) ) ) ) p ) ;
Loop through the tests , printing results ( for i 1 ( n - tests ) ( prn " Case # " i " : " ) ( skip ) ; # lines the tree specification takes ( = dtree ( decision - tree ) ) ( repeat ( n- animals ) ( prn ( cuteness dtree ( animal - features ) ) ) ) )
Here ’s champion ACRush ’s C++ solution .

SALT LAKE CITY ( AP ) -- State agencies would be forbidden from further compliance with the federal Real ID Act under a measure the Utah House approved Thursday .
The move would do nothing to end hours - long waits at state drivers license offices , but could mean that Utah residents wo n't be able to board airplanes or enter federal buildings in the future .
The Real ID
Act was launched after the 2001 terror attacks to make driver 's licenses more secure , so that eventually all driver 's licenses would have several layers of security features to prevent forgery .
Opponents call the act an unfunded mandate that tramples on states ' rights .
A slew of states have already passed laws and resolutions saying they wo n't comply with any portion of it .
Those who do n't want Utah to comply contend the federal government wo n't stick to its threat of not allowing passengers with noncompliant drivers licenses to board airplanes if enough states join together in opposition , creating the possibility of gridlock at the nation 's airports .
Republican Gov. Gary Herbert 's spokeswoman , Angie Welling , said Herbert is among those who do not want Utah to comply with the federal act .
Utah came into partial compliance with the act this year by requiring residents to provide birth certificates and other documents to prove they 're in the country legally before getting a license .
This has led to wait times at driver license offices around the state increasing from about 20 minutes to more than three hours at some urban locations since the requirements took effect Jan .
1 .
State lawmakers and Herbert blamed the long waits on the Real ID Act , when in reality the change in state law was fully supported by legislators to make it harder for illegal immigrants to get licenses without any discussion about inconveniences it might cause for those in the country legally .
Rep. Stephen Sandstron , an Orem Republican sponsoring the plan , ensured in his bill that state agencies would continue to ask for the additional documentation Real ID requires .
One of his primary concerns about the act is that the federal government might use microchips to track where Americans travel , although drivers licenses in compliance with the Real ID act do n't include them .
House Bill 234 was approved 68 - 3 on Thursday .
It now advances to the Senate .

The group wants to shield petition - signers ' names from public release , saying it fears harassment by gay - rights supporters . "
Last September , as the campaign was in full swing , U.S. District Judge Benjamin Settle temporarily barred state officials from releasing the identities of those who signed the referendum .

There are legions of developers across the world who would like to shake the hand of the famously sleep - deprived Don Syme .
For he , along with his team of Cambridge - based researchers , has been the driving force behind the development of the F# language at Microsoft .
Smoothly combining the simplicity and power of its functional programming forebears ( ML , Ocaml ) with the object - oriented capabilities of the .NET framework , F# provides the much sought - after combination of type safety , performance and scripting .
According to many developers , it is the most original new face in computer languages since Bjarne Stroustrup developed C++ in the early 1980’s .
Starting with Microsoft in 1998 , Don also created Generics in C# and in the .NET Common Language Runtime .
He has been a functional programmer since 1989 .
Before this he was a PhD at the University of Cambridge , and before that grew up in a small country town in Australia .
RM :
I ’m sure it ’s a question everyone asks but how did the name F# come about ?
DS :
In the F# team we say ‘ F is for Fun . ’
Programming with F# really does make many routine programming tasks simpler and more enjoyable , and our users have consistently reported that they ’ve found using the language enjoyable .
RM :
Were there any particular problems did you have to overcome in the development of the language ?
DS :
Combining object - oriented and functional programming poses several challenges , from surface syntax to type inference to design techniques .
I ’m very proud of how we ’ve addressed these problems .
F# also has a feature called ‘ computation expressions , ’ and we ’re particularly happy with the unity we ’ve achieved here .
RM :
Good developers will always say that they would have done things differently in developing a language .
Is there anything you would have modified ?
DS :
In a sense , we ’re tackling this now .
Some experimental features have been removed as we ’re bringing F# up to product quality , and we ’ve also made important cleanups to the language and library .
RM :
F# is heavily rooted in OCaml but what elements have you borrowed from other languages ?
DS :
The aim of F# from the start has been to ensure that typed functional programming in spirit of OCaml finds a high - quality expression on the .NET framework .
These languages excel in tasks such as data transformations and parallel programming as well as general purpose programming .
As it developed , F# borrowed more ideas from other languages : Haskell was influential in many ways , from basic syntax elements such as the ‘ light ’ syntax , to rich constructs such as sequence expressions and computation expressions , which are ways of generating and composing data structures .
Python was also influential , and of course C# has had a huge impact on F# , since F# includes an object model that is closely aligned to that of C# .
RM :
Did it help that Simon Peyton Jones , one of the key designers of Haskell is just down the corridor from you at Microsoft Research at Cambridge ?
DS :
A lot !
Simon PJ has been a great help with F# , so I have a lot to thank him for .
He gave a lot of feedback on the feature called “ asynchronous workflows ” in particular , and also on “ active patterns ” , a form of user - specified pattern matching for F# .
RM :
Has the .NET framework played an important role in bringing the programming camps together ?
DS :
Overall the last 5 years has seen a lot of idea sharing in the language community , at conferences such as Lang.
NET .
The common vision of ‘ many languages , many niches , high level interoperability ’ has driven a wave of language research and excitement .
Furthermore , .NET has brought language researchers more directly in touch with the “ real world ” of applied programming , and allowed us to conduct experiments where more variables are controlled – e.g. we can test out new ways of expressing solutions to existing problems without changing the underlying libraries or runtime machinery .
RM :
What attracted you to functional languages in the first place ?
DS :
I ’ve worked with many languages , from BASIC to assembly code .
One of the last checkins I made when implementing generics for .
NET , C# and VB had a lot of x86 assembly code .
My first job was in Prolog .
I think programmers should learn languages at all extremes .
Functional languages attract me because of their simplicity even when solving complex tasks .
If you look through the code samples in a book such as F# for Scientists they are breathtaking in their elegance , given what they achieve .
A good functional program is like a beautiful poem : you see the pieces of a ‘ solution ’ come together .
Of course , not all programs end up so beautiful .
It ’s very important that we tackle “ programming in the large as well ” .
That ’s what the object - oriented features of F# are for .
RM :
Do you think it ’s good practice for all programmers to learn languages at all extremes ?
DS :
Yes , I do .
I think all programmers have a curiosity about different languages , and should be familiar with the basic alternative computational models : functional , procedural , relational .
However it ’s inevitable that programmers will concentrate on the tools they need for their immediate work , so what ’s more important is an open mind and a willingness and excitement to see problems in a different way when necessary .
RM :
Why did Microsoft decide to develop F# and how does it fit into Microsoft ’s overall strategy and philosophy ?
DS :
Microsoft ’s decision to invest in further F# is very much based on the fact that F# adds huge value to the .NET platform .
F# really enables the .NET platform to reach out to some new classes of developers , and appeal to some domains where .NET is not heavily used .
This is especially true in data exploration and technical computing .
We ’re also exploiting functional techniques in parallel programming .
RM :
What is the best program you ’ve seen written in F# ?
DS :
That ’s a good question !
I ’ll give several answers .
I ’ve mentioned the samples from F# for Scientists , which are very compelling .
For sheer F# elegance , I like Dustin Campbell ’s series of Project Euler solutions .
For commercial impact then the uses of F# in the finance industry have been very convincing , but probably nothing beats the uses of F# to implement statistical machine learning algorithms as part of the Bing advertisement delivery machinery .
I ’m intrigued by the potential to use F# to script data - oriented tools such as AutoCAD and ArcGIS .
These domains are well suited to functional programming , and F# can interoperate with these tools very nicely .
You can now use F# with the .NET APIs for these tools , which opens up many possibilities .
We ’ve recently really focused on ensuring that programming in F# is simple and intuitive .
For example , I greatly enjoyed working with a high - school student , who learned F# .
After a few days she was accurately modifying a solar system simulator , despite the fact she ’d never programmed before .
You really learn a lot by watching a student at that stage .
RM :
Why would a programmer choose to write apps in F# rather than C# ?
Do you think F# will take over the industry in much the same way as c++ has ?
Do you think there ’s a danger of F# becoming too ‘ expert friendly ’ in the same way that C++ has ?
DS :
Concurrency is increasingly important for many applications , and the shift to many core brings abundant parallelism to the desktop .
The web , Silverlight and distributed systems increase the demand for asynchronous solutions .
F# is a succinct and expressive typed functional programming language for the .NET platform that makes major contributions to productivity in parallel and asynchronous programming , making these both fun and easy .
Regarding C# and VB.NET , well they are clearly the elder statesmen of .
NET languages and it ’s hard to imagine a really major .NET project where these languages does n’t play a significant role .
So the approach we take with F# is that it is definitely complementary to C# .
We expect there will be many F# projects that incorporate C# components .
For example , the designer tools we use with F# emit C# code , and you then call your F# code from those the event handlers .
A working knowledge of C# is thus very useful for the F# programmer .
F# is a really simple language to use , especially if you ’re just implementing some data manipulation using an existing set of libraries .
Some people see it as a sort of strongly - typed Python , up to syntactic differences .
RM :
How do you think more programmers can write quality code ( as opposed to quantity ) and still keep their jobs ?
DS :
Many programmers choose to explore a problem in F# because it lets them focus more on the problem domain and less on programming itself .
That ’s a big benefit in some of the data exploration , algorithmic and technical computing domains , and so we ’ve seen a lot of interest in using F# here , where C# may not have been an obvious choice .
So to me the question is not just about quality code , but about code that solves appropriate domain tasks and problems .
For example quality algorithms , quality visualizations and quality data analysis .
RM :
How do you see the future for procedural programming languages ?
DS :
People thirst for simplicity .
People need simple solutions to the problems that really matter : data access , code development , deployment , cloud computing , web programming , parallel programming to name but a few .
One of the exciting things about working in the Visual Studio team is that there are world experts in all of these domains working in unison .
We wo n’t cover all of these bases with the first release of F# , but over time we ’ll be operating in all these domains .
At the language level , people say that languages are converging in the direction of mixed functional / OO programming .
However I expect many important developments from this base .
For example , we ’re seeing language oriented towards “ big , powerful data structures ” such as tables and OLAP - like data cubes , perhaps with support for transactions .
Merging these techniques into general purpose languages should bring great dividends .
RM :
Have you received much feedback of the language so far ?
If so , what has this been focused on ?
DS :
March 17 , 2010
For St. Patrick ’s Day , I wanted to do a special post about Irish beer .
I know for most people , myself included , the words “ Irish Beer ” immediately brings beers like Guinness , Smithwick ’s and Murphy ’s to mind , and styles like “ Irish Red ” – but is that all there is to Irish beer ?
Looking for answers , I decided I simply did n’t know enough about Irish Beer to post authoritatively about it .
I started to think about someone who could help me out and one person came to mind .
That someone is John , better known in the beer world as “ The Beer Nut “ .
I ’d like to thank John “ The Beer Nut ” for taking the time to share his thoughts ( and images ) on Irish Beer – Past , Present and Future .
When Scott asked me to do a piece on Irish Beer for The Brew Club , he asked if Irish Red was my favourite beer style , which is akin to asking an American if American Light Lager is theirs !
Both styles have a proud ancestry — British pale ale and Czech pilsner , respectively — but these beers have reached their present bland forms through the gradual downgrading of the product by large corporations seeking the lowest - common - denominator of the market .
The big brewing interests finally took control of Irish beer in the middle of the twentieth century .
The last of Dublin ’s independent stout breweries closed down and London - based Guinness completed their work of purging the very memory of the city ’s formerly vibrant brewing heritage .
The names that were once familiar to every drinker — D’Arcy , Watkins , Findlater , Sweetman , O’Connell — were removed from the record by Guinness .
History , it seems , is erased by the victor .
By 1960 , Guinness had also taken over the nation ’s ale brewing concerns .
Independent breweries like Smithwick ’s , Cherry ’s and Macardle - Moore had grouped together to protect themselves from predatory takeover , only to provide Guinness with just one company to buy up instead of several .
Only in rebel Cork were there holdouts against the British beer monopoly , though even the two great porter breweries there eventually fell into foreign hands .
Today both Beamish and Murphy ’s are property of Dutch giant Heineken , with the historic Beamish brewery closed down and up for sale .
Freed from the need to make better beer than the brewery next door , the macros turned their attention to maximising their market share and profit margins .
Cask beer was an early casualty , with Guinness inventing nitrogenation to replace it .
Drinkers that were used to waiting for their lively barrel - pulled stout to subside before the barman topped it off were forced to sit through the pointless ritual of a two - part keg pour — something that makes absolutely no difference to the taste of their beer .
Hopping rates plummeted along with serving temperatures , and Ireland ’s hop growers , unable to survive in a consolidated buyers ’ market , tore up their hop gardens .
Consistency , more than flavour , became the watchword for the big breweries .
Guinness ’s unreliable wooden fermenters with their generations of ingrained wild yeast were replaced by stainless steel , and the souring effect is achieved in modern Guinness by injecting it with lactic acid .
Horrified by talk of “ good pints ” and “ bad pints ” , the big breweries took control of pub cellars , offering full service cleaning and maintenance of the lines and taps , eroding generations of cellarmanship wisdom among the nation ’s publicans : all they have to do now is pour the beer and pay the invoices .
The notion that some pubs “ do a good pint ” and some do n’t lives on in Irish lore , but the Guinness people try not to encourage it and , of course , it ’s pretty much impossible to test .
Finally , the era of consolidation coincided with the rise of lager as the drink of choice for Ireland ’s young people .
Two generations on , the country ’s favourite individual beer is still a stout , but the assorted lager brands led by Heineken , Budweiser and Carlsberg now account for two of every three pints served .
Ale , in its entirety , represents just 5 % of Ireland ’s beer market today .
But enough doom and gloom .
In the mid-1990s Irish entrepreneurs brought an exciting new concept to Ireland from the States : the brewpub .
In rural Co. Clare , Biddy Early was the first , followed a year later by The Porterhouse in the middle of Dublin , and by the turn of the millennium Kinsale had its own brewpub , Cork ’s Franciscan
Well was brewing and pouring on the banks of the Lee , and a second Dublin brewpub called Messrs Maguire was operating by the Liffey just downstream from The Porterhouse .
Craft beer had arrived !
For the first time in generations , there were Irish breweries in Irish hands .
Growth has been slow .
There is simply no competing with the marketing power of Heineken and Diageo ( as Guinness & Sons , still headquartered in London , is now called ) .
The new breweries have tended to either build a strong local loyalty — Galway Hooker is what you drink in the City of the Tribes — or else work primarily for export to more receptive markets : some 70 % of the Carlow Brewing Company ’s output goes abroad .
Certainly there have been casualties along the way , both Kinsale and Biddy Early are now defunct , but several new breweries are opening each year , and the major cities all have at least one bar each specialising in local microbrewed beers .
Most recently , handpumps serving cask ale have started to appear in pubs , where such a thing would have been unthinkable even two years ago !
Visitors to Ireland still have their work cut out if they ’re looking for real Irish beer , but there are a few resources worth keeping an eye on .
The excellent Beermapping .com offers directions to all the best places for quality local and imported beer in Ireland , and the nation ’s beer enthusiasts maintain an exhaustive list of Irish pubs and restaurants where Irish craft beer can be found on IrishCraftBrewer.com .
As we speak , Irish Craft Brewer itself is evolving into a fully fledged campaign group to raise awareness of independent , Irish - owned , artisan ( they ’re all the same thing in Ireland ) breweries on the island .
Beoir , as the group is called , will be going live in the summer and hopes to achieve a mainstreaming of craft beer of the sort that we see with envy in countries like the US and Denmark .
Coming from a point of currently having significantly less than 1 % of the beer market , there is a big hill to climb with craft beer in Ireland .
But we ’ve got nothing to lose either .

The era of big government has returned with a vengeance , in the form of the largest federal work force in modern history .
The Obama administration says the government will grow to 2.15 million employees this year , topping 2 million for the first time since President Clinton declared that “ the era of big government is over ” and joined forces with a Republican - led Congress in the 1990s to pare back the federal work force .
Most of the increases are on the civilian side , which will grow by 153,000 workers , to 1.43 million people , in fiscal 2010 .
The expansion could provide more ammunition to those arguing that the government is trying to do too much under President Obama .

“ I ’m shocked that the ‘ tea party ’ has n’t focused on it yet , and the Obama administration only has a thin sliver of time to deal more directly with it , I believe , ” said Paul C. Light , who studies the federal bureaucracy as a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a professor at New York University .
“ When you talk about big government , you ’re talking about a big employer . ”
The new figures are contained in the budget that Mr. Obama sent Monday to Congress .
Mr. Obama says the civilian work force will drop by 80,000 next year , mostly because of a reduction in U.S. census workers added in 2010 but then dropped in 2011 after the national population count is finished .
That still leaves 1.35 million civilian federal employees on the payroll in 2011 .
From 1981 through 2008 , the civilian work force remained at about 1.1 million to 1.2 million , with a low of 1.07 million in 1986 and a high of more than 1.2 million in 1993 and in 2008 .
In 2009 , the number jumped to 1.28 million .
Including both the civilian and defense sectors , the federal government will employ 2.15 million people in 2010 and 2.11 million in 2011 , excluding Postal Service workers .
The administration says 79 percent of the increases in recent years are from departments related to the war on terrorism : Justice , Defense , Homeland Security , State and Veterans Affairs .
After years of decline at the end of the Cold War , the Defense Department is restaffing .
Mr. Obama estimated that the Pentagon will have 720,000 employees this year and 757,000 employees next year - up from a low of 649,000 in 2003 .
The data also show that the Department of Homeland Security will grow by 7,000 a year in 2010 and 2011 , and the Veterans Affairs Department will grow by 12,000 in 2010 and an additional 4,000 in 2011 .
Peter R. Orszag , Mr. Obama ’s budget director , also said more people have been hired to oversee outside contracts .
“ Over the past eight or nine years , those contracts have doubled in size .
The acquisition work force has stayed constant .
It ’s not too hard to figure out that oversight of those contracts has not kept pace with what it should be , ” Mr. Orszag said .
Even as the total number of federal employees rises , the ratio of employees to Americans has declined steadily , from one employee for every 78 residents in 1953 to one employee for every 110 residents in 1988 to one employee for every 155 residents in 2008 .
The federal work force is older than the private - sector work force , which Mr. Light said raises the possibility of reducing the total number through retirements .
About 31 percent of the private work force is 50 or older , while 46 percent of the federal work force is 50 or older .
Mr. Obama is in a situation similar to that of Mr. Clinton , who took office when the budget deficit was at a record high and government bureaucracy was expanding , even though the Pentagon was shedding workers with the end of the Cold War .
Mr. Clinton in 1996 declared that “ the era of big government is over ” and took steps to work with Congress to control spending and cut the work force , which already had been trending lower .
As he left office in 2000 , Mr. Clinton boasted that his administration had helped cut 377,000 government jobs , leaving the smallest civilian federal work force since 1960 .
Mr. Obama , though , appears to be accepting a larger federal work force .
The administration has called for federal workers to get a 1.4 percent pay raise next year , which Mr. Orszag said , “ frankly , I think to a lot of Americans , sounds pretty good . ”
The American Federation of Government Employees , the union that represents many government workers , said it was combing through the budget and did not have a comment .

To borrow the deathless phraseology of Professor AbuKhalil : for those who care and do not care , my interview with Scott Horton at Antiwar Radio can be heard here .
As usual , Scott led the conversation in several interesting directions , to which I made the usual rambling , semi-coherent contributions .
But one thing I did try to put forth was the idea of a " united front " across the political spectrum , dedicated to a single , overarching goal : dismantling the empire .
Much evil would cease , and many good things would flow from such a development .
I worked up some notes on the matter before the talk , and added some more thoughts afterward ; these are appended below .
Much of this is an expansion and refinement of some ideas mentioned in a recent post , so I hope you 'll forgive any repetition .
But that original piece dealt with other topics as well , and I thought this idea merited a spotlight of its own .
So here it is .
Dissidents and critics of the powers that be are often accused of being negative – tearing things down , undermining , never offering a positive alternative vision .
Now , I happen to disagree with this .
I believe that people who work in waste management – clearing away the garbage , the poisons , the crap – are just as important to the life and health of a community as , say , an architect who makes the community beautiful , or a teacher who educates the young , or doctors who heal the sick and so on .
But – it so happens that I do have a positive program to offer , a viable , workable , practical approach to many of our problems .
This is what my program offers :
Lower taxes
Stronger national security
More jobs
Greater prosperity
Higher wages
Better schools , roads , and health care
Less government
Safer streets
What 's more , this program requires no social upheaval , no political turmoil , no violence – no revolution from either Left or Right .
It can be accomplished entirely within the existing political and economic system .
It needs no new government powers , no new bureaucracies , no new taxes .
All it requires is simply this : Bring America Home .
End our worldwide military empire .
As I noted the other day , ending America 's imperial wars and dismantling America 's global military empire – and its global gulag -- would save trillions of dollars in the coming years .
Not only from cuts in direct military spending , but also from the vastly reduced need for " Homeland security " funding in a world where the United States was no longer invading foreign lands , killing their people , supporting their tyrants -- and inciting revenge and resistance .
This would release a flood of money for any number of new domestic initiatives , while also giving scope for deep tax cuts across the board .
Working people would thrive , the poor , the sick and the vulnerable would be better off , businesses would grow , opportunity would expand , the care and education of our children would be greatly enhanced , our infrastructure could be repaired and strengthened , our environment better cleansed and cared for .
The end of empire would also mean an end to the horrendous economic distortion wrought by our war - profiteering industries .
Other businesses would inevitably come to the fore , economic activity would be spread more evenly across more sectors .
In short , people could keep more of their own money while government spending could be directed toward improving the quality of life of all the nation 's citizens .
Now , this is not some pie - in - the - sky dream .
We all have our own ideas and beliefs about what consitutes the good life , or the best kind of society .
And in a post - empire America , there would be plenty of scope for heated debate on all kinds of issues ; ideological conflicts , ' culture wars , ' partisan wrangling , would go on .
And of course there would still be injustice , corruption , and much suffering in society .
So we 're not talking about a utopia .
But – it would be a better society than it is now .
It would be more humane , more just , more secure , more peaceful , more sustainable , more prosperous than it is now .
And all our culture wars and political conflicts would take place in a healthier context , in a freer land , where the focus is on " the pursuit of happiness , " not the " projection of dominance " around the world .
This alternative is entirely achievable , by ordinary human beings .
It requires no miracles , no god - like heroes or messianic leaders to bring it about .
We could easily dismantle the empire – carefully , safely , with proper planning and deliberation – over the next 10 years .
So that 's my blueprint for a better future : Bring America Home .
It 's not revolution , it 's not rocket science , it 's not dogmatic or doctrinaire .
You could support this and still be a Democrat or a Republican , a Baptist or a Marxist , a Muslim or a Jew , a Libertarian or a Green , an environmentalist or an industrialist , a physicist or an alchemist , a soldier or a pacificist – because it's not about trying to build the perfect society , it 's not about promulgating , promoting -- or imposing -- a wide - ranging agenda or particular set of policies .
It 's about taking a single , simple step that will automatically make life better than it is today – for Americans , and for the rest of the world .
Of course , as I noted to Scott , although this vision is itself very reasonable , practicable , doable -- heck , downright serious , moderate and bipartisan , even , as we are told we must be in order to " get things done " -- what is perhaps utopian is the idea that our political and media elites would allow this message to be heard .
As I put it in that earlier piece ( with a few additions here ) :
But [ a post - imperial ] society is precisely what our elites cannot -- or , to be more accurate , will not -- imagine .
Because , yes , it would " erode " their " influence " around the world -- to some extent , at least .
Although they would still be comfortable , coddled and privileged far beyond the dreams of ordinary people , they could no longer merge their individual psyches with the larger entity of a globe - spanning , death - dealing empire -- a connection which , although itself a projection of their own brains , gives them a forever - inflated sense of worth and importance .
As the Geert Wilders case goes into pre-trial , National Review Online asked our experts :
Is there any legitimate reason he 's in court ?
What are the implications of such a trial being held , never mind its outcome ?
( For replies by Bat Ye'or , Paul Marshall , Clifford D. May , Nina Shea , and Robert Spencer , click here . )
Pro-Wilders demonstrators outside the Amsterdam courthouse where he is to be tried .
Wilders is in court because the Netherlands has no First Amendment and so , endlessly , tries to figure out what speech to permit or prohibit .
Wilders is hardly the only victim of this predicament ; the arrest and jailing in 2008 of a cartoonist who goes by " Gregorius Nekschot " notoriously symbolized the state 's incoherence .
U.S. media should cover the Wilders proceedings because Wilders ' career has implications beyond one man , one party , or one country .
It potentially affects all of Europe as the continent works out its response to the Islamic challenge .
The U.S. media does an adequate job of informing its audience about this topic , so the near - silence about Wilders comes as a bit of a surprise .
The Islamic challenge forces Europeans to take stock of themselves in an unprecedented way .
Colorful examples include the British ICONS project that features 120 " national treasures " that help define English culture ; the Dutch government 's film for potential immigrants that features a topless woman on the beach and two men kissing ; and the French prime minister 's decision to expel a man from France for compelling his wife to wear a burqa .
Europe 's future is in play .
Wilders ' time in court affects the outcome .

But I 'm not talking about McSorley 's Stick .
There 's another outrage , one that -- despite being a Kings fan for the last several decades -- I only became aware of in the last few months .
I 'm pretty sure I should be embarrassed by this .
It involves game 6 of the conference finals against Toronto .
Now , I was at this game , sitting a few yards from the incident in question .
But , since I was there , I never saw a replay of the game , not to mention that the incident barely registered with me when I was there .
I remember thinking , " oh did Gilmour get clipped , oh I hope not , oh good , no call -- he seems angry . "
Which coincidentally is pretty much the same reaction Toronto fans had .
Here 's the CBC feed , courtesy of the great Down Goes Brown :
( via DownGoesBrown )
Down Goes Brown describes it as " one of the most controversial plays in NHL history . "
DGB has two other clips related to the " incident . "
First , a delightful one where the NHL explains the non-call and the CBC guy ( whose name I 'm probably supposed to know but do n't , since I have n't watched HNiC since Dick Irvin Jr ) asks if there should be or will be " retribution " against the refs who missed the call ( and I think he 's talking about from the league ) .
( NHL 's official explanation of Kerry Fraser 's missed call against Wayne Gretzky via DownGoesBrown )
Then , Don Cherry 's reaction :
( via DownGoesBrown )
I can't say I really disagree with Cherry 's analysis if indeed I fully understood it through my own heaving sobs , due entirely to the fact that I cannot look at Don Cherry , hear his voice or picture him in my mind without flashing back to this :
( via temphockey )
[ historical footnote : I started playing and following hockey because of Bobby Orr . I grew up in Michigan but the Wings games were n't televised on a channel I could get , and Bruins games were frequently featured on the NBC game of the week , or whatever they called it , so I was a Bruin fan growing up , until I grew up and moved to Los Angeles , not that you need to know any of that .
I just wanted to explain the tears . ]
DGB has written a couple of great posts on this topic .
Here 's some of the first one :
One of the ( many ) things that fans of other teams do n't understand about Leaf fans is why we 're still so angry about the Fraser non-call .
After all , who 's to say the Leafs would have scored on the powerplay ?
Who 's to say the Kings would n't have won anyways ?
Bad calls happen , it 's been 15 years , just let it go .
This is why we 're still angry .
This is why we know that non -call cost us a spot in the Finals .
Because anyone who watched that game knows , without question , that Wendel Clark was going to score the winner .
The Kings could n't stop him that night .
Nobody could have .
Forget the powerplay .
The Leafs just needed one more even - stregth shift .
And they did n't get it , because when it came time to make the biggest call of his career , Kerry Fraser choked on his whistle .
After a career of false starts and bad backs and bad luck and terrible teams and blood and bruises , after all the hours on the trainer 's table , after all the fights with guys twice his size , Wendel Clark finally had a chance to play for the Stanley Cup , and he responded with arguably the greatest game ever played by a Maple Leaf .
This was his moment .
This was what everything had been building towards .
And Kerry Fraser took it away .
So yeah , we 're still a little cranky about that .
And here 's some from the follow - up , a post entitled Happy Kerry Fraser Day ! :
So let 's just stick to the facts : Gretzky high - sticks Gilmour , the rulebook says it's an automatic five and a game , Fraser and his linesmen huddle up and then decide that nobody saw anything , and Gretzky scores the OT winner seconds later .
Years later , Fraser finally came clean to the Toronto Sun and admitted that he blew the call .
Sort of .
" I was blocked out on the play , " Fraser said .
" The replays show that . "
In reality , of course , the replay clearly shows the exact opposite .
At the moment that Gretzky 's stick clips Gilmour ( 0:05 of the video above ) , Fraser has an absolutely clear view of the play , and is looking directly at it .
He was n't blocked out .
He did n't miss it .
He saw it , but he did n't have the guts to call it .
Let 's be clear : Bad calls happen .
Missed calls happen .
They 're part of sports .
And there was no conspiracy here , no secret plot to get a big market US team into the finals and avoid an all - Canadian matchup .
No , this was just one official , staring down the biggest call of his career , and finding himself without the courage to make it .
And of course , this being the NHL , Fraser was never held accountable .
He even got the Finals assignment that year .
After all , who better to work the biggest games of the year than somebody who'd just finished choking on their whistle ?
Kerry Fraser Day is apparently celebrated on May 27 .
I am happy to celebrate it , presumably by not punishing my son for something I saw him do , or by otherwise not noticing something I noticed .
I 'm glad to know the date , actually ( like it would have been hard to look up ) .
It was my second date with my future wife , the first being game six of the previous series , which the Kings also won .
Mostly , I remember my wife 's comment , leaving the Forum amid a crowd of still cheering , ecstatic Kings fans , " Hockey is great , because you always think you 're going to lose and then you come back and win in the end !
It 's terrifying and then it 's exciting ! ! "
Her first two games .
I tried to explain that it was n't always like that .
We were set to go to game six of the finals , too , but of course we never got that far .
And the Kings never had a moment like that again .
And , no , not even in 2001 .
Here 's my question : not having seen this game on TV , and now , only having seen the CBC feed , and there not having been blogs or the internet back then to archive the moment forever , I have no idea how this incident was perceived by Kings fans .
I have no idea how many Kings fans even know about it .
I 'm curious to find out what people think .
Has everyone had this in their collective narrative but me ?
Do Kings fans think the Toronto reaction was silly ?
Or do they / we agree ?
Coming to the party late , I think it should have been called .
But I also think the cop in the Montreal Forum should n't have let Habs personnel on the Kings bench to measure sticks .
Wow .
This is kind of messed up .
Jeopardy , the famous game show that has all the answers and who in Alex Trebek undoubtedly has the smartest game show host in the world , somehow messed up royally last night on a question that to most of us CrackBerry users out there should seem pretty dang simple .
Our own Adam Zeis was watching it live and nearly spit his drink on the floor as it unfolded ....
Under a category of " Non-Edible Fruit " came the question you can watch in the video above .
Luckily , both the contestant and Jeopardy got the question wrong , which means she got the answer right , but seriously .... it 's RESEARCH IN MOTION that makes BlackBerry Smartphones , not BlackBerry !
BlackBerry is a brand .
This little mishap raises a great point though , which is that I 'm guessing most people DO think that BlackBerry is the company that makes BlackBerry Smartphones or at least did think that when they first learned about BlackBerry and / or bought their first BlackBerry Smartphone .
RIM really has done very little that I have ever noticed to build awareness of their corporate brand , instead putting their efforts into that of the BlackBerry name .
Which makes sense I guess ...
BlackBerry is a much better name than RIM .
Since these days RIM pretty much brands every single product they make under the BlackBerry name ( there were exceptions to this in RIM 's pre-BlackBerry days ) it almost makes more sense and would be less confusing to the world if RIM just went out and changed their corporate name to BlackBerry .
Why fight what everybody else seems to get wrong .
What 's even more disturbing here is that Alex Trebek was born in Sudbury , Ontario , which is just a few hours away from RIM 's headquarters in Waterloo !
If Jeopardy and Alex Trebek let something like that slip through the cracks , then I 'm not sure what to think .
What do you think ?
RIM or BlackBerry ?
That is the question !
Several New York City police officers who killed an unarmed black man in a hail of 50 bullets on his wedding day will not face criminal civil rights charges , the US Justice Department said yesterday .
Sean Bell , 23 , was killed and two friends injured outside a strip club after his bachelor party in November 2006 .
His death outraged New York 's black community , who contended that no white suspect would have been shot so many times , if at all .
In April 2008 , a New York state judge cleared two of the officers involved of manslaughter and a third of reckless endangerment .
Federal authorities then launched a separate investigation that could have brought civil rights charges against the officers .
" After a careful and thorough review , a team of experienced federal prosecutors and FBI agents determined that the evidence was insufficient to prove , beyond a reasonable doubt , that the law enforcement personnel who fired at Bell acted wilfully , " the Justice Department said .
" Accordingly , the investigation into this incident has been closed , " it said .
Civil rights leader Al Sharpton criticised police , saying he spoke to US attorney - general Eric Holder on Tuesday and expressed his " extreme disappointment " at the decision .
" Even though two of the three officers in question were black , we will not stop our pursuit of justice in this matter until every measure in the criminal and civil arena has been exhausted , " Mr Sharpton said in a statement .
" Fifty shots on an unarmed man who engaged in no crime is intolerable . "
On the night of the shooting , the undercover officer who fired first had followed Mr Bell and his two friends to Mr Bell 's car , believing they went to fetch a gun to settle a dispute at the strip club .
The police officer opened fire after being grazed by the car as Mr Bell attempted to drive away .
Several other officers reached Mr Bell 's car after the initial confrontation and say they believe the undercover officer was being fired at from inside the vehicle .

On a recent trip to New York to woo newspaper publishers with demonstrations of the iPad , Steve Jobs met with staff of the Wall Street Journal .
During the demo , editors asked about the iPad 's lack of Flash support , to which Jobs replied , " We do n't spend a lot of energy on old technology . "
According to sources speaking to Valleywag , Jobs repeated the comments he made during a recent town hall meeting among Apple employees shortly after last month 's introduction of the iPad .
He reportedly told WSJ staff that Flash is buggy and crashes Macs , is a " CPU hog , " and a source of " security holes . "
He also referred to Flash as dying technology , likening not supporting Flash on the iPad to Apple dropping support for floppy drives , ditching legacy data ports , and replacing CCFL backlighting with LEDs .
Adobe has made efforts to address the concerns about performance on Mac OS X , noting that Flash 10.1 should offer significant improvements ( an area we are investigating further ) .
That is n't likely to sway Apple , though , as Jobs recommends replacing Flash - based content with H.264 video , JavaScript , and other techniques .
Such a move is doable , if not entirely " trivial " as Jobs suggested .
Third base is shallow for 2010 , but that does n’t mean that there are n’t youngsters who could emerge as mainstays in the not too distant future .
Let ’s take a look at how things currently sit for Dynasty Leaguers :
Alex Rodriguez – New York Yankees Evan Longoria – Tampa Bay Rays David Wright – New York Mets Ryan Zimmerman – Washington Nationals Pablo Sandoval – San Francisco Giants Mark Reynolds – Arizona Diamondbacks Kevin Youkilis – Boston Red Sox Aramis Ramirez – Chicago Cubs Chone Figgins – Seattle Mariners Adrian Beltre – Boston Red Sox Kevin Kouzmanoff – Oakland Athletics Ian Stewart – Colorado Rockies Pedro Alvarez – Pittsburgh Pirates Jhonny Peralta – Cleveland Indians Brandon Wood – Los Angeles Angels
Thoughts :
I like Gordon Beckham as much as the next guy ( ok , maybe not , which you can see by my write up on him by clicking here ) , but , since he ’s being moved to 2B this season , it ’s hard to rank him very highly for dynasty leaguers at 3B .
If he ultimately moves back , things will obviously change , but for now he ’s going to stay ranked a bit lower .
In fact , he fell outside the Top 15 .
His long - term usage at 3B is also a concern for Youkilis , but I can’t drop him any further than seventh overall .
While Adrian Beltre will be the man at the hot corner , Youkilis always manages to find his way over there .
Just look at his games played at 3B since 2004 : 65 , 24 , 16 , 13 , 36 and 63 .
Depending on your league rules , he ’s likely to find a way to remain eligible there moving forward .

Michael
Young is a risk for yearly league owners , as he ’s overvalued in my book ( click here to view why ) .
At 33 - years old for dynasty league owners ?
Forget about it .
In fact , I ’d rather take the gamble on some younger options .
Yeah , I ’m high on Kouzmanoff ( you can see why by clicking here , but keep in mind the sleeper article was written prior to his trade ) .
I do believe he ’s in line for a big year , despite his surroundings , and would be alright with getting him as my starter .
Pedro Alvarez may get a chance to make an impact before year ’s end , which earns him a spot on this list .
He ’s a great player to take and stash away for dynasty leaguers .
Drafted second overall in 2008 , he made his pro debut last year and made his presence felt .
Reaching Double - A , he hit .333 with 13 HR and 40 RBI in 222 AB .
This is the Pirates , so I ’d fully expect him to get an opportunity before 2010 is over .
However , taking him as a starter would be a mistake , since when he debuts is a mystery .
Zimmerman or Wright ?
That ’s a debate that ’s likely to rage on for many years to come , huh ?
Brandon
Wood should finally get an opportunity to show what he can do with full - time playing time .
We ’ll finally find out if he ’s real or fiction , though the strikeouts leave a lot to be desired .
As a flyer as a reserve ( I would not draft him to start for my team , outside of deep AL - only leagues ) , he ’s worth the gamble .
What about Jhonny Peralta ?
Are we really about to write him off because of a down season ?
He ’s got the potential to come back full force in ’ 10 ( click here for more on him ) .
What are your thoughts on these rankings ?
Who should be higher on the list ?
Who was left off that you feel belongs ?

Most of the national team players took up bandy after playing college hockey , often because the rules governing contact resemble those of soccer , shoulder - to - shoulder challenges only .
Full - on body checking is prohibited .
“ After I graduated I played in men ’s hockey leagues , and I always came home bleeding , ” said Rick Haney , a former Harvard hockey player and a captain of the American bandy team .
“ Then I tried bandy , and as soon as I stepped out on the ice I knew I was home . ”
The appeal of bandy goes beyond safety considerations .
The game requires more skating stamina than hockey because there is more ice to cover ( 7 to 11 miles per 90 - minute game ) and far fewer substitutions .
It also requires the ability to maneuver at high speed .
Jere Lehtinen , the longtime forward for the Dallas Stars and Finland , is among the Nordic N.H.L. players who have credited their success in hockey to the skating skills they learned as youth bandy players .
Unlike Russia and Sweden , whose rosters are filled with professionals , the United States must use part - timers and some older players .
Haney , a 44 - year - old banker , played a couple of seasons in Sweden and Norway .
But younger players who grew up with the Roseville program  like John Arundel and Mike Hosfield , both 24 , and Jon Keseley , 25  have gone to bandy camps in Sweden and have played in top leagues there .
“ Bandy ’s fun , it ’s fast and we go to some amazing places , ” said Hosfield , who works in international sales .
The International Olympic Committee recognizes the sport because the requisite 25 nations have bandy federations ( about 14 actually play regularly ) , but it does not have sufficient standing for the Olympics .
The Russians , who will stage the 2014 Olympics in Sochi , are pushing the I.O.C. to give bandy some role at those Games .

“ The Russian Olympic committee very much wants to see bandy at Sochi , and they have the support of Vladimir Putin , ” said Magnus Skold , the main organizer for the United States team and a vice president of the Federation of International Bandy , referring to the Russian prime minister .
“ There ’s a very good chance that they can make it happen . ”

Bear : Aww ... it appears that mister I 'm - Above - The - Natural - World has just knocked himself off the top of the food chain ...
The Schadenfreude of Unnatural Selection .
I was reading Knuth 's " Selected Papers on Computer Science " and in chapter 13 " The IBM 650 : An Appreciation from the Field " he had included a photo of a young himself from 1958 at his first computer .
Young Donald Knuth , age 20 , at his first IBM 650 computer in 1958 .
Don Knuth 's first computer , as the chapter 's title suggests , was the IBM 650 .
At that time Knuth had a part - time job helping the statisticians at Case Institute of Technology to draw graphs and do keypunching .
Soon a strange new machine was installed across the hall , that the student newspaper called a " giant brain " .
It was actually an IBM 650 .
One afternoon someone at the institute explained some of the machine 's internal code to a bunch of freshmen , including Knuth .
It all sounded mysterious to him , but it seemed to make a bit of sense , so he got ahold of some manuals .
His first chance to try the machine came a few weeks later , when one of the upperclassmen at the fraternity needed to know the five roots of a particular fifth degree equation .
Knuth decided to compute the roots using the 650 .
This was his first program on the 650 .
Later Knuth realized how lucky he was to have had such a good first encounter with computers .
The polynomial problem was well matched to his mathematical knowledge and interests , and he had a chance for hands - on experience , pushing buttons on the machine and seeing it punch the cards containing the answers .
Knuth 's first large program was a tic - tac - toe that learned to play by remembering the relative desirability or undesirability of each position that it had ever encountered .
The hardest part , as Knuth writes , was figuring out how to keep one digit of memory for each possible configuration of the board .
The machine had just 2000 words of memory , each 10 digits long , plus a sign bit .
Next Knuth proceeded to writing a program that would find prime factors .
The idea was that a person could set up any 10 - digit number in the console switched and start his program , which would punch the corresponding prime factors on a card and stop .
Knuth spent several weeks on this problem , rewriting his program several times .
The final program took 11 minutes to determine that the number 9999999967 was prime .
The next major Knuth 's program was the improvement of SOAP ( Symbolic Optimal Assembly Program ) and SOAP II assembly languages .
He wrote SOAP III and learned about " creeping featurism , " where each of his friends would suggest different things they wanted in an assembler .
The program used all 2000 words of memory .
Knuth does n't think he could have gotten by with only 1999 words , because he had spent considerable time finding every last bit of space by using terrible tricks , such as using a single instruction on a specific address that would cause 4 side effects .
Along the way Knuth wrote a lot fun programs .
One of the competitions between the students was to do as much as possible with programs that would fit on a single punch card - which had room for only eight instructions .
One of the unsolved problems was to take the 10 - digit number on the console and to reverse its digits from left to right , then display the answer and stop ; nobody could figure out how to do this on a signle card .
But one day Knuth proudly marched up to the machine and made a demonstration : he read in a card , then dialled the number 0123456789 on the console , and started the machine .
Sure enough , it stopped , displaying the number 9876543210 .
Everybody applauded .
He did n't explain until later that his card would display the number 9876543210 regardless of what number appeared on the console switches . :)
But there is more to the story .
One day the IBM 650 machine got an extra set of console switches , that were called register 8004 ( top row of switches in the picture ) .
It turned out that nine instructions on an extended 650 were sufficient to reverse the digits of a number , and the ninth instruction could be put into the switches .
Therefore he was able to solve the problem without cheating .
Knuth was very close with IBM 650 .
One night he missed a date with his wife - to - be , because he was so engrossed in debugging that he had forgotten all about the time .
The 650 provided Knuth with solid instruction in the art of programming .
It was directly related to the topics of the first two technical articles he ever submitted for publication .
Therefore it's not surprising at all that he decided to dedicate The Art of Computer Programming books to the IBM 650 computer .
" This series of books is affectionately dedicated to the Type 650 computer once installed at Case Institute of Technology , in remembrance of many pleasant evenings . "
The End .
If you liked this story , you may want to get Knuth 's book " Selected Papers on Computer Science " .
The collection focuses on Knuth 's publications that are addressed primarily to a general audience than to specialists .
Robot uprisings , demon armies , women fighting dragons and men striding the cosmos have never looked cooler , or lovelier , than in the pulp magazine cover art going on display at the University of Connecticut .
Beware : Some of it is quite spicy .
UConn 's Benton Museum is hosting a massive exhibition showcasing the Robert Lesser Collection of Pulp Art. Called " From Amazing Stories to Weird Tales : Covering Pulp Fiction , " the exhibition includes a ton of original pulp cover art in amazing quality .
They 've put up nearly 500 of these images online , and here are a bunch of our favorites .

2010 Ferrari F10
The 2009 Ferrari F60 earned just a single victory for Raikonen despite the teams valiant efforts to field a worthy contender .
Part of their efforts were hindered by their focus on winning both titles for the 2008 season .
In the end , Ferrari would win the Constructors Championship while Lewis Hamilton from McLaren won the Drivers Championship in 2008 .
New rules and a ban on in - season testing for the 2009 season meant Ferrari was not on par with the other teams .
One of its problems was its poor aerodynamics .
Part way through the season , the team decided to stop development of the F60 and focus on its successor , the 2010 Ferrari F10 - the 56th single - seater car produced by Ferrari to compete in Formula One .
New rules for the 2010 season banned re-fueling during the race .
As a result , the F10 is given a much larger fuel tank .
Additional space was freed by the removal of the KERS ( Kinetic Energy Recover System ) unit , which all of the teams had agreed to abandon .

Additional space was freed by the removal of the KERS ( Kinetic Energy Recover System ) unit , which all of the teams had agreed to abandon .
Though the F10 is a new car , it is nearly identical in respects to its mechanical configuration , to the F60 .
It is powered by a 2.4 - liter V8 from the F60 .
The biggest changes to the car were to its design and its aerodynamics , including the nose and the wing .

The chassis is a carbon - fibre and honeycomb composite monocoque suspended by an independent suspension with pushrod activated torsion springs .
The engine is a Ferrari Type 056 , naturally - aspirated unit that has an 18,000 RPM limit .
There is a Ferrari 7 speed semi-automatic sequential gearbox with a quick - shift limited - slip differential .
The car rides on Bridgestone tires and BBS wheels .
Piloting the F10 for the 2010 season is Felipe Massa , who is joined by the two - time World Champion Fernando Alonso .

Another good start in Valencia After yesterday 's good work also the second day of testing for the Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro , held at Cheste 's Ricardo Tormo circuit just outside Valencia , began with positive signs .
Felipe Massa drove 25 laps , with the fastest in a time of 1.11.722 .
Talking to the technicians the Brazilian driver was extremely satisfied with the car 's set up and the tyres ' grip , although it has to be taken into account that the track 's grip is higher than yesterday .
Felipe drove several laps wearing a black carbon helmet : this is a test for a new type of helmet planned by Schubert for the Scuderia .

Alexander M. Haig Jr. , the four - star general who served as a confrontational secretary of state under President Ronald Reagan and a commanding White House chief of staff as the Nixon administration crumbled , died Saturday at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore , according to a hospital spokesman .
He was 85 .
Mr. Haig was a rare American breed : a political general .
His bids for the presidency quickly came undone .
But his ambition to be president was thinly veiled , and that was his undoing .
He knew , Reagan ’s aide Lyn Nofziger once said , that “ the third paragraph of his obit ” would detail his conduct in the hours after President Reagan was shot , on March 30 , 1981 .
That day , Secretary of State Haig wrongly declared himself the acting president .
“ The helm is right here , ” he told members of the Reagan cabinet in the White House Situation Room , “ and that means right in this chair for now , constitutionally , until the vice president gets here . ”
His words were taped by Richard V. Allen , then the national security adviser .
His colleagues knew better .
“ There were three others ahead of Mr. Haig in the constitutional succession , ” Mr. Allen wrote in 2001 .
“ But Mr. Haig ’s demeanor signaled that he might be ready for a quarrel , and there was no point in provoking one . ”
My Computer 's Kinda Buggy
Uh , I 'll just leave this one entirely to Sara :
A few months back I went to an Apple Store in NYC .
I waited my turn , as I waited 45 minutes , I saw cockroaches crawl across the countertop .
When I was called , I made sure not to touch the counter or put my bag on it in fear of these creepy crawlers .
The guy next to me was oblivious and I saw a cockroach crawl up his jacket and before I could say anything , it was in his hair .
I asked the guys behind the bar what gives with the cockroaches .
They explained that the cockroaches came from the gentleman before me .
In fact , when checking the battery , there were dead cockroaches in his computer case and smashed in his battery pack .
Sure , I did n't have to pay anything to replace my disk drive because it was under warranty , but bugs always win as a horror story .

Ca n't argue with that logic .

The Gadget or the Girl ?
Not so much a horror story as a tale of woe , Robert was dating a girl who worked at the Apple Store , when she dumped him for somebody else .
He consoled himself with his Apple TV , and then it died .
Uh oh .
Should he journey to the Apple Store and risk awkward humiliation ?
For The Highlander , yes .
So he went .
Lucky for me she did n't seem to be there which was good because the store was packed I would be stuck there for awhile .
I waited in que for my turn and was greeted by a very nerves gentleman .
He was beat red and his hands were shaking to the point that he was having trouble typing .
While he was taking my info I casually read his name badge and in a Sherlock Homes moment realized his problem .
He was the guy my ex had left me for .
I could express my feelings and suffer the consequences of yelling at a guy who was responsible for fixing my beloved electronics or I could attempt to calm the situation .
Deciding that I sadly liked the Apple TV , more then the girl I ignored my irrational side and calmly explained to the guy that it was no big deal and things were n't working out anyway .
I even wished him the best of luck which may have been one of the hardest things I 've ever had to say .

I 'm Sorry , There 's a Hard Drive Stuck in Your Shuffle
James '
iPod shuffle mysteriously stopped taking a charge , so he took it to the Genius Bar .
When my name came up , I showed the shuffle , devoid of scratches or any wear and tear beyond some minor dirt .
It was just not it 's immaculate white self , but slightly duller than the in - store units .
The Genius took one look at it and said " warranty does n't cover dropping it on the floor , sorry . "
Advertisement
But James did n't drop it on the floor !
Besides , would it matter , since the shuffle is so very tiny , with no moving parts ?
The Genius proceeded to explain how , when a hard drive is dropped on the floor , the spinning disk can get disrupted or even broken because there 's lots of moving parts .
I looked at him for a few seconds and said " It 's a shuffle , it 's flash based , there are no moving parts in the harddrive " .
The Genius laughed at me and said " I think we know our own products " and tried to call the next person .
Advertisement
The manager reiterated that the tiny hard drive in the shuffle can be messed up if you drop it .
After a bit of back - and - forth , the manager agreed to get a new shuffle .
But wait , there 's more — the replacement shuffle did n't have a cap .
When James asked , the manager did n't want to give him one .
Relenting , he tossed it across the bar .
I am now a proud Zune owner , and we are Apple - free in my household , in large part thanks to experiences like this one .

System Crash
Michael , like many of us , is his parents ' personal Geek Squad , so when their iMac 's hard drive died , he took it to the Apple Store .
" You 're about 30 minutes early guys , " the Apple employee said with a dopey grin .
" Why do n't I take this iMac off your hands and you guys chill around the mall for a while until your appointment time . "
I handed off the iMac .
He walked towards the genius bar and my dad and I turned to the wall to look at iPhone cases .
Not more than 20 seconds later do we hear an " oh shit " and a * CLANG ** CRACK *.
Slowly , we turned to see a now pitifully frowning Apple store employee on his knees trying to pick up our iMac from the ground .
As he was apologizing all over the place , I examined the computer .
Apparently it had landed on the stand first , then the computer hit .
Advertisement
" We 'll take care of it , " the Genius assured Michael and his dad .
When they got back , the Genius on their case starts off , " Well it seems that there is more than just a hard drive failure here .
You also have a failed mother board and you may have some screen damage as well .
That 's going to cost you quite a bit . "
Advertisement
" It was dropped " , my dad told the guy .
" Oh , well , sir .
You do have Apple care but it does n't cover any accidental damage like dropping your computer . "

A manager appeared , and promised a replacement in 3 - 4 days , since their iMac had custom parts .
It arrived 17 days later .

Getting Screwed
Jake got his MacBook Pro off of Craigslist , with a full AppleCare warranty intact , so when he noticed some dark spots on the screen , he took it to the Genius Bar .
They cheerfully said they 'd replace the top half of the notebook , and a week later he picked it up , good as new .
Except ...
I got it home and notice that they had left out a screw on the bottom .
No biggie .
I 'll just go back to the Apple Store and get one .
Advertisement
When he arrived the Apple concierge said that they could n't just give him the screw , he needed to set up an appointment — but being the nice girl that she was , she confirmed the Genius Bar had the screw he needed .
After an hour and a half , he gets to the bar , only to see the genius who'd fixed his MacBook .
He told Jake the screw was broken — prompting the question , " Well , why 'd you stick it back in the notebook ? " — and they do n't have any in stock .
You see , I 've been here before .
It 's called the " I 'm sorry , sir . " area of the Apple Store where stupid mistakes seem to happen but the only thing done to remedy the situation is to repeat that phrase over and over like a brainwashed robot .
It happened when my girlfriend and I bought iPhones and again when I wanted to get a hard drive replaced on a MacBook under AppleCare .
Any attempt at reason ( just take the screw out of another MacBook Pro that is ruined in the back ) or memory ( why did the concierge tell me they had a screw ? ) are just failed attempt in the " I 'm sorry , sir . " area .
Advertisement
The genius orders the screw , telling Jake it 'll take a week .
After 3 weeks , and a bajillion phone calls later , the screw magically appears in stock .
The new genius meets me on time and quickly replaces the screw while I see the original douche bag genius come in from a smoke break .
So , yes , it took over 3 weeks for them to replace a screw that they blamed me for breaking .

Travis wrote in with his story after seeing the original post :
After graduating from basic training , Travis decided he wanted a MacBook Pro , and when he checked out at the local Apple Store , the Apple retail guy asked if he was a student , to get a discount .
Travis said he was n't a student , but asked about a military discount .
As I pulled out my I.D. , the individual that was helping me sarcastically stated , " I did n't know you were a ' Baby Killer ' ! " and proceeded on with the transaction .
I was so excited about getting my laptop that i completely shrugged off the comment .
About a week later , I began thinking about the comment , and knowing that he made anti-military slander usually passed towards the Vietnam Era service members , I felt very disrespected .
I did n't so much as care for me , but the girl I was dating at the time , her dad happened to serve in Vietnam , so it made me that much more mad .
I called the store manager and told him my situation and his only way of fixing the situation was to give me a free iPod Touch and insist that this is n't company views .

The following account of the tense 48 hours preceding the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers is excerpted from former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson 's new book , " On the Brink . "
Saturday , September 13 , 2008
Early Saturday morning , I left the Waldorf - Astoria Hotel in Midtown Manhattan , climbed into a car , and sped down a deserted Park Avenue , arriving at the New York Fed just after 7 a.m .
We rode the elevator up to the 13th floor , where Tim Geithner had arranged for me to work in an office just down the hall from his own suite .
I called ( Bank of America CEO ) Ken Lewis , who reported that after closer inspection his people now believed that Lehman 's assets were in even worse shape than they had thought the previous evening .
It was increasingly obvious that he did n't really want to buy Lehman .
I joined Tim in his office for a conference call with Barclays at about 8 a.m. Bank Chairman Marcus Agius and CEO John Varley were on the line from London , and ( President ) Bob Diamond was at Barclay 's midtown Manhattan offices .
Varley said they were working hard on a possible deal , but had serious concerns about some of Lehman 's assets , and indicated Barclays would need to leave $ 52 billion of them behind .
I told Varley to focus on the biggest problems first — the assets he thought were going to be the most troubled — and tell us what he needed to take care of them .
If Barclays gave us its best offer that day , we believed we could deliver a private - sector consortium that would fund whatever shortfall there was .
Even as we spoke , the leaders of virtually the entire banking industry were assembling downstairs at the Fed .
Federal law - enforcement authorities intensified their investigation Friday into suspected Pentagon shooter John Patrick Bedell , whose erratic behavior prompted his parents to contact the police in the months before the attack that left two police officers wounded .
Mr. Bedell , 36 years old , died late Thursday night from the wounds he suffered after opening fire at police officers guarding the Pentagon earlier that evening .
Pentagon police officials said Mr. Bedell , who was carrying two semi-automatic handguns and several magazines of ammunition , was trying to enter the fortified Defense Department headquarters .
Authorities believe Mr. Bedell , who harbored — and had expressed — anger toward the federal government , acted alone .
Officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Pentagon Force Protection Agency said Mr. Bedell emerged from the Pentagon subway station Thursday evening and made his way to a nearby guard post .
When officers asked for his identification , Mr. Bedell , who was wearing a white button - down shirt and blazer , pulled out a pistol and started shooting .
The investigators said Mr. Bedell , who had studied physics and engineering , drove to Washington from his parents ' home in Hollister , Calif. , in the days before the assault .
Mr. Bedell 's 1998 green Toyota Avalon was recovered from a garage at the Pentagon City Mall hours after the attack .
Additional ammunition was found in the car , authorities said .
Mr. Bedell 's parents reached out to law - enforcement officials after growing concerned about their son's mental health .
According to police in San Benito County , the Bedells filed a missing - persons report about their son on Jan. 4 after not hearing from him for several days .
Patrons of the Taipei pastry shop were entirely unsuspecting of the horde of trademark lawyers about to descend .

The Government must provide more detail on exactly how alleged copyright infringers will be cut off from the internet before a file - sharing disconnection law is passed , according to a parliamentary committee .
The Joint Committee on Human Rights has said that the Government must make the Digital Economy Bill more detailed to allow Parliament to scrutinise it properly .
It said it could not rule on whether the proposed law was compatible with human rights law until those details were provided .
The Government claims that the controversial Bill complies with the European Convention on Human Rights and the Human Rights Act .
The Committee has said that not only will Parliament need more detail before the Committee can decide on that issue , but that the Government must better demonstrate that even the notification system it proposes in relation to alleged infringers is a proportionate response .
The Bill outlines a system in which copyright owners would identify file - sharing they believe infringes their rights and ask internet service providers ( ISPs ) to take action .
At first this would come in the form of warnings , then it would be the cutting off of whatever internet connection was used by the alleged infringers .
The Committee said that the disconnections may or may not interfere with people 's rights to privacy and freedom of expression , but that it was impossible to tell on the scant information contained in the Bill itself .
The Bill refers to disconnection as ' technical measures ' .
" The lack of detail in relation to the technical measures proposals – and in particular , in relation to the scope of technical measures , the criteria for their imposition and the enforcement process – has made our assessment of the compatibility of these proposals with the human rights obligations of the United Kingdom extremely difficult , " said the Committee 's report .
" As we have explained in the past , flexibility is not an appropriate reason for defining a power which engages individual rights without adequate precision to allow for proper parliamentary scrutiny of its proportionality . "
The Bill is entering the Report stage of the legislative process at the House of Lords , having been through the Committee stage there .
It is yet to pass through the House of Commons .
The Committee said that it was a possibility that disconnection would breach citizens ' human rights .
" In our view , it is impossible assess fully whether these proposals will operate in a compatible manner in practice without more detail of the proposed mechanism for technical measures , " said the report .
" Because of the lack of detail on the face of the Bill and the limited foundation for justification provided for the breadth of these proposed powers , we acknowledge the concerns about the potential for these powers to be applied in a disproportionate manner which could lead to a breach of internet users ’ rights to respect for correspondence and freedom of expression . "
The Committee said that there are potential problems even just with the Bill 's proposal to send warning notices to people identified as potential copyright infringers .
Though this was not likely to infringe their rights , it was not clear that the action was in proportion to the alleged offence , it said .
" We consider that despite the lack of information on the face of the Bill , it is unlikely that the operation of these proposals alone will lead to a significant risk of a breach of individual internet users ’ right to respect for privacy , their right to freedom of expression or their right to respect for their property rights , " it said .
" However , in the light of the concerns raised by internet users and human rights organisations , we recommend that the Government provide a further explanation of its views on why these proposals are proportionate , including by outlining the harm currently suffered by individual copyright holders and the wider public interest in promoting creativity , and why that harm cannot be appropriately addressed by existing civil and criminal penalties for copyright infringement , " said the report .
In a letter to the Committee , Business Secretary Lord Mandelson defended the plans and said that the sending of warnings would not infringe citizens ' rights to privacy and freedom of expression ( Articles 8 and 10 respectively ) of the European Convention on Human Rights .
" Articles 8 and 10 are qualified rights and it is acceptable under the Convention to interfere with these rights if it is in accordance with the law and it is necessary in a democratic society for the protections of the rights of others , " he said .
" As mentioned above the receipt of a notification does not impede the subscriber ’s access to the internet in any way . "
Lord Mandelson told the Committee that he agreed that the cutting off of internet accounts used by suspected file sharers was likely to affect those rights , but that it was justified .
" Technical measures will hinder or deny subscribers ’ access to the internet and their email correspondence so that their right to freedom of expression and private and family life may be affected , " he said .
" No one has an unconditional right to access the internet .
If a subscriber does not pay a bill the ISP will eventually cut him off .
The Government believes that the measures will be an acceptable balance between the subscriber ’s rights and the public interest in the protection of the interest of the copyright owners . "
The Government considers that this will be legitimate and proportionate action and is necessary for the protection of the right of copyright owners , " said Lord Mandelson .
" The latter have limited methods of protecting copyright and these methods may be less effective across national boundaries than within a single jurisdiction .
Infringement over the internet is likely to cross national boundaries .
These provisions will enhance the effectiveness of copyright protection . "
The Bill will reach the Report stage in the House of Lords on 1 March .

@ Skylash tweeted about this unusual pizza flier that he posted to Twitpic .
His tweet says , " Pizza in La Ventana , " which I 'm guessing is La Ventana , Mexico .
I 've emailed the flier person to get the intrigue - filled story , which appears after the jump .
I love how he is advertising what seems to be a homemade pizza - delivery service via a flier .
Hello !
I am the designer of the poster .
It 's true , we were making pizza in la ventana .
I am currently in San Francisco any my friend is carrying the torch down there .
Our pizza is a Sicilian - style and is cooked in an outdoor brick oven in our backyard .
Pizza is uncommon that far south in Mexico and the " pizza " they try to sell is hardly pizza at all .
Our recipe for crust was passed on for generations and a guarded secret in my family , known for their guarded secrets .
Inspired by our favorite pizza parlor proprietor , Dominic Di Fara , we got to work .
La Ventana is a gringo hangout highly regarded for its world - class kite surfing , so we already had a big niche market .
Unfortunately a rival pizza parlor , run by a vicious gang ( rumored to have raped and killed a girl just down the road a year earlier ) opened up and they threatened our families with violence if we continued selling our superior pizza so we were forced to sell and deliver our pizza as if it were drugs or another illegal commodity .
We delivered the pizzas both by car and by boat and it was about 45 minutes from stretching the dough to monetary exchange .
We continue to get 4 to 5 orders a night , and people love our fresh green peppers .

Paper is a huge waste of paper , and ink is a huge waste of money .
The PrePeat printer could be a huger waste of money , but at least it does n’t use paper or ink .
Instead , you feed it special heat sensitive plastic sheets and it uses a precision thermal head to print out gray scale text and images .
Feed the sheets through the printer again , and a different temperature will erase everything or just write over it .
Do n’t wash , do n’t rinse , but feel free to repeat up to a thousand times with a single sheet of paper .
The PrePeat printer itself costs $ 5500 , and each sheet of the special plastic paper is $ 3.30 , which is certainly a tad steep .
Want to know what else is a tad steep , though ?
That ’s piracy , man .
Piracy on the high seas of ink .
It may not actually make any fiscal sense whatsoever for you to replace your personal printer with a PrePeat ( think more like a medium to large office that ’s still stuck in the seventies ) but it would strike a blow against the tyranny of the empire of black gold .
Huzzah !

A correlation was seen between social status and dopamine D 2/3 receptors , where volunteers with the higher status had higher values for [ 11 C] raclopride BP .
A similar correlation was seen with the perceived social support , where higher [ 11 C ] raclopride BP correlated with higher scores on the MSPSS .
Fourteen healthy volunteers were scanned with [ 11 C ] raclopride to measure D 2/3 receptor binding potential ( BP ) .
Social status was assessed using the Barratt Simplified Measure of Social Status .
In addition , participants were asked to assess their level of social support using the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support ( MSPSS ) .
Previous positron emission tomography ( PET ) imaging studies in nonhuman primates have shown that striatal dopamine type 2/3 ( D 2/3 ) receptors correlate with social hierarchy in monkeys and that dominant animals exhibit higher levels of D 2/3 receptor binding .
The goal of the present study was to examine this phenomena in human subjects using PET and the radiotracer [ 11 C]raclopride .
Previous studies in animals have shown a correlation between dopamine transmission in the brain and social hierarchy ( ) .
In monkeys , dominant and subordinate social rank are determined by physical and social triumph and defeat .
Dominant animals win more physical confrontations and receive more social attention , such as grooming or huddling .
Two positron emission tomography ( PET ) imaging studies have investigated the relationship between social status and Dreceptors in the striatum in monkeys .
Both showed that social dominance was associated with higher Dreceptor binding compared with subordinate animals ( ) .
In humans , social hierarchy is a more subtle phenomenon that can be approximated by measuring social status and social support ( ) .
Thus , the goal of the present study was to examine the correlation between these factors and dopamine Dreceptor binding in human subjects .
Given the known effect of disease states on striatal Dreceptors , including substance dependence , schizophrenia , and anxiety disorders ( ) , only healthy control volunteers were included in this study .
Social status was measured using the Barratt Simplified Measure of Social Status ( BMSSS ) ( ) and social support was measured using the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support ( MSPSS ) ( ) .
Our hypothesis was that low social status and low levels of social support would correlate with low Dreceptor binding in the striatum measured with [ C ] raclopride .
Relationships between BPand the scores on the BSMSS and MSPSS were analyzed with the Pearson product - moment correlation coefficient .
A two - tailed probability value of p < .05 was chosen as the level of significance .
Since age is known to affect Dreceptor BP , this factor was included in the regression analysis .
Given that previous studies had shown a correlation between social status and the striatum measured as a whole ( ) , there were no specific hypotheses regarding the striatal subregions .
Therefore , the primary analysis was restricted to the striatum , with post hoc analyses of the individual subregions .
The simplified reference tissue model ( SRTM ) ( ) was used for derivation of the binding potential ( BP ) implemented in MATLAB ( The Math Works , Inc. , South Natick , Massachusetts ) , using the cerebellum as the reference region .
The outcome measure for the PET studies was binding potential , defined as the ratio of specifically bound to nondisplaceable radioligand at equilibrium ( BP ) ( ) .
BPcan also be described aswhere B. is the concentration of Dreceptors , Kis the inverse of the affinity of the radiotracer for the receptor , and fis the free fraction in the nonspecific distribution volume of the brain ( ) .
[ C ] raclopride has a similar affinity for D2 and D3 receptors ( ) , and the signal from these receptors cannot be distinguished .
The PET scans were registered to the MRI scans in MEDx ( Sensor Systems , Inc ) as previously published ( ) .
The activity measured in the left and right regions were averaged .
The activity in the striatum as a whole ( STR ) was derived as the spatially weighted average of the five ROIs .
All image analysis was performed in MEDx ( Sensor Systems , Inc , Sterling , Virginia ) .
Each subject underwent a transaxial T1 magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan , acquired on the GE Signa EXCITE 3 T/94 cm scanner ( GE Medical Systems , Milwaukee , Wisconsin ) , for delineation of the regions of interest ( ROIs ) .
The regions of interest outlined on the MRI included the subdivisions of the striatum , which have been previously described ( ) .
Briefly , these included the ventral striatum ( VST ) , the dorsal caudate rostral to the anterior commissure ( AC ) ( precommissural dorsal caudate [ preDCA ] ) , the dorsal putamen rostral to the AC ( precommissural dorsal putamen [ preDPU ] ) , the caudate caudal to the AC ( postcommissural caudate [ postCAU ] ) , and the putamen caudal to the AC ( postcommissural putamen [ postPUT ] ) .
The subdivisions were derived based on their cortical and subcortical connections , as described previously ( ) .
C]raclopride was prepared as previously described ( ) , and PET studies were acquired using a bolus injection of the radiotracer .
The PET scans were obtained on the ECAT EXACT HR +
( Siemens / CTI , Knoxville , Tennessee ) in three - dimensional ( 3 - D ) mode .
Emission data were obtained as 15 frames of increasing duration up to 60 minutes .
The PET images were reconstructed by filtered backprojection ( Shepp .5 filter ) with attenuation correction using the data from a 10 - minute transmission scan .
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the New York State Psychiatric Institute and all subjects provided written informed consent .
Study participants were nonsmoking healthy control subjects and were required to have no DSM - IV Axis I disorder ( including substance abuse or dependence ) , no significant medical conditions , and no use of medications before the scan ( 6 months for medications that could affect dopamine , 2 weeks for all others ) .
Subjects ( nine men and five women ) were recruited from the New York City metropolitan area .
Participant screening included a psychiatric assessment with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM - IV Axis I Disorders ( ) , physical examination , electrocardiogram , and laboratory tests .
All subjects were asked for data to complete the Barratt Simplified Measure of Social Status and to complete the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support .
The scans performed on female subjects were not controlled for menstrual cycle phase .
A positive correlation was seen between [ C ] raclopride BPand the MSPSS for the striatum ( r = .73 , p = .005 , age - corrected p = .02 ) , as shown in Figure 2 .
A post hoc analysis was performed with the striatal subregions , and a positive correlation was seen in the ventral striatum ( r = .63 , p = .02 , age - corrected p = .05 ) , precommissural putamen ( r = .78 , p = .002 , age - corrected p = .09 ) , precommissural caudate ( r = .67 , p = .02 , age - corrected p = .05 ) , and postcommissural putamen ( r = .55 , p = .05 , age - corrected p = .15 ) .
Correlation did not reach significance in the postcommissural caudate ( r = .28 , p = .35 ) .
Thus , within the subdivisions of the striatum , this correlation was seen in most , but not all , of the subdivisions .
A correlation was seen between the BSMSS and MSPSS ( r = .53 , p = .05 ) , showing that these are scales that measure factors that are related , but not identical .
Correlation between [ 11 C] raclopride BP ( x axis ) and score on the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support ( MSPSS ) .

Correlations did not reach significance in the precommissural putamen ( r = .48 , p = .08 ) or postcommissural caudate ( r = .20 , p = .5 ) .
The research volunteers included nine men and five women with an average age of 30 ± 4 years ( range 25 – 37 ) .
The average BSMSS score was 33.2 ± 4.8 ( range 24.3–44.0 ) .
One subject declined to complete the MSPSS .
The average MSPSS score was 19.0 ± 9.5 ( range 11.5–20.8 ) .
The average decay - corrected injected dose was 439.9 ± 42 MBq and the average specific activity was 579.6 ± 21.7 GBq / mmol .

2/3 receptor binding potential and measures of social status and perceived social support .
These results are similar to those reported previously in nonhuman primates , which showed that striatal D 2/3 receptors were higher in rhesus monkeys who were dominant in a social hierarchy compared with subordinate monkeys ( 2 Morgan D .

2/3 receptor binding .
Striatal Dreceptor availability has also been shown to correlate with measures of social detachment in healthy human volunteers and is low in patients with social phobia ( ) .
These studies have shown that low Dreceptor availability is associated with personal detachment and aloofness , measured with the detachment subscale of the Karolinska Scales of Personality .
In the present study , we found a correlation with the volunteer 's score on the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support ( ) , a scale that assesses three sources of social support : family , friends , and significant other .
While the MSPSS and the detachment subscale of the Karolinska Scales of Personality ask about different aspects of social behavior , they can both be viewed as measuring the extent of social interaction .
Taken together , these data suggest that striatal Dreceptor binding is associated with an individual 's social capital , which can be thought of as a balance of social rank and stress offset by social support and attachment ( ) .
Overall , these data suggest that higher social status , a greater sense of perceived social support , and lower levels of social avoidance are associated with higher Dreceptor binding .

11C ] raclopride binding in the striatum also showed a significant positive correlation ( r = .54 , p = .04 ) , suggesting that this correlation was not simply a function of error within the BSMSS .
A potential significant limitation of this study is the use of the BSMSS , which provides an estimate of social status across society but does not provide an accurate measure of social prominence with respect to one 's peers or a measure of socioeconomic status .
However , while there is a clear consensus in the literature regarding the importance of these factors on health and disease , there is a lack of consensus of how to measure social status .
Many studies investigating the effects of social status on health have used the Hollingshead ( ) index , which provides a composite score of social status based on the subject 's occupation and level of education .
However , this scale uses a list of occupations generated from the 1970 census data , and many of our subjects ' occupations were not included in this list .
The BSMSS is based on the Hollingshead ( ) scale , in that it generates a composite score based on level of education and occupation but uses an updated list of occupations .
In addition , the BSMSS includes the education / occupation scores of the subjects ' parents , which are weighted to a lesser degree that the subjects ' own educational and occupational achievement , recognizing that social status is partly determined by the opportunities provided by one 's background .
Another more simple determination of social status that is sometimes used is years of education .
In this dataset , a post hoc analysis of years of education and [ C ] raclopride binding in the striatum also showed a significant positive correlation ( r = .54 , p = .04 ) , suggesting that this correlation was not simply a function of error within the BSMSS .
From The Archives : Bush Silences a Dangerous Witness Editor ’s Note :
The hanging of Ali Hassan al - Majid , known as “ Chemical Ali ” for his role in using chemical weapons in Iraqi wars of the 1980s and early 1990s , silenced yet one more witness who otherwise could have filled in the blanks of the Reagan - Bush - I roles in secretly assisting Saddam Hussein ’s armies , the so - called Iraq - gate scandal .
If Majid had been turned over to the International Criminal Court – rather than prosecuted by kangaroo tribunals set up in Iraq by George W. Bush ’s administration – he could have been systematically debriefed about what U.S. officials , including George H.W. Bush , did to facilitate Iraq ’s acquisition of dangerous chemical weapons .
Instead , Majid – wearing a red jump suit , his head covered by a black sack and a noose around his neck – was dropped through the trap door of a scaffold on Monday .
His potential to embarrass the Bush Family was eliminated , just as was done to Saddam Hussein three years ago , as this Dec. 30 , 2006 , article ( slightly modified ) recounts :
The hanging of Saddam Hussein was supposed to be – as the New York Times observed – the “ triumphal bookend ” to George W. Bush ’s invasion of Iraq .
If all had gone as planned , Bush might have staged another celebration as he did after the end of “ major combat , ” posing under the “ Mission Accomplished ” banner on May 1 , 2003 .

But by the end of 2006 , with nearly 3,000 American soldiers already killed and the Iraqi death toll exceeding 600,000 by some estimates , Bush was forced to savor the image of Hussein dangling at the end of a rope a little more privately .
Still , Bush had done his family ’s legacy a great service , while also protecting secrets that could have embarrassed other senior U.S. government officials , both past and present .
By arranging Saddam Hussein 's execution , Bush had silenced a unique witness to crucial chapters of the secret history that stretched from Iran ’s Islamic revolution in 1979 to the alleged American - Saudi “ green light ” for Hussein to attack Iran in 1980 , through the eight years of the Iran - Iraq War during which high - ranking U.S. intermediaries , such as Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates , allegedly helped broker supplies of war materiel for Hussein .
Hussein now wo n’t be around to give troublesome testimony about how he obtained the chemical and biological agents that his scientists used for producing the unconventional weapons that were deployed against Iranian forces and Iraqi civilians .
He ca n’t give his perspective on who got the money and who facilitated the deals .
Nor will Hussein be available to give his account of the mixed messages delivered by George H.W. Bush ’s ambassador April Glaspie before Hussein ’s 1990 invasion of Kuwait .
Was there another American “ green light ” or did Hussein just hear what he wanted to hear ?
Like the climactic scene from the Mafia movie “ Casino ” in which nervous Mob bosses eliminate everyone who knows too much , George W. Bush guaranteed that there would be no public tribunal where Hussein could give testimony on these potentially devastating historical scandals and thus threaten the Bush Family legacy .
That could have happened if Hussein had been turned over to an international tribunal at The Hague as was done with other tyrants , such as Yugoslavia ’s late dictator Slobodan Milosevic .
Instead Bush insisted that Hussein be tried in Iraq despite the obvious fact that the deposed Iraqi dictator would receive nothing close to a fair trial before being put to death .
Hussein 's hanging followed his trial for executing 148 men and boys from the town of Dujail in 1982 after a foiled assassination attempt on Hussein and his entourage .
Hussein 's death effectively mooted other cases that were supposed to deal with his alleged use of chemical weapons to kill Iraqi civilians and other crimes that might have exposed the U.S. role .
[ For details on what Hussein might have revealed , see Robert Parry ’s Secrecy & Privilege or Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Missing U.S. - Iraq History ” or “ The Secret World of Robert Gates . ” ]
Thrill of the Kill Some observers thought Bush simply wanted the personal satisfaction of seeing Hussein hanged , which would not have happened if he had been sent to The Hague .
As Texas governor , Bush sometimes took what appeared to be perverse pleasure at his power to execute prisoners .
In a 1999 interview with conservative writer Tucker Carlson for Talk magazine , Bush ridiculed convicted murderer Karla Faye Tucker and her unsuccessful plea to Bush to spare her life .
Asked about Karla Faye Tucker ’s clemency appeal , Bush mimicked what he claimed was the condemned woman ’s message to him .
“ With pursed lips in mock desperation , [ Bush said ] : ‘ Please do n’t kill me . ’”
But a more powerful motive was always Hussein ’s potential threat to the Bush Family legacy if he ever had a forum where he could have offered detailed testimony about the historic events of the past several decades .
Upon stepping into the White House on Jan. 20 , 2001 , George W. Bush made it a top priority to conceal the history of his father ’s 12 years as Vice President and President and to wrap his own presidency in a thick cloak of secrecy .
One of Bush ’s first acts as President was to sign an executive order that blocked the scheduled release of historic records from his father ’s years .
After the 9/11 attacks , Bush expanded his secrecy mandate to grant his family the power to withhold those documents from the American public in perpetuity , passing down the authority to keep the secrets to future Bush generations .
So , even after George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush were dead , those noted historians Jenna and Barbara Bush would control key government documents covering a 20 - year swath of U.S. history .
Under George W. Bush ’s rules , every document at the George H.W. Bush presidential library had to be cleared for release first by specialists at the National Archives and – if classified – by the affected agencies , but then also by the personal representatives of both the senior and junior George Bush .
With their backgrounds in secret societies like Skull and Bones – and with George H.W. Bush ’s work at the CIA – the Bushes were keenly aware of the power that comes from controlling information .
By keeping crucial facts from the American people , the Bushes could turn the voters into more easily manipulated children .
Whenever there was a potential rupture of valuable information , the Bushes intervened aggressively , turning to influential friends to discredit some witness or relying on the U.S. military to make the threat go away , as happened to the likes of Panama ’s Manuel Noriega and Iraq ’s Saddam Hussein .
The Bushes were helped immeasurably , too , by the credulity and cowardice of the modern U.S. news media and the Democratic Party .
[ Again , see Secrecy & Privilege for details . ]
[ On President Barack Obama ’s second day in office , he reversed Bush ’s order granting family heirs control over presidential records , but many of the Bush Family secrets – both from the first and second Bush administrations – remain hidden , in part , because neither the Obama administration nor Congress has undertaken any systematic review of the records . ]
What Can Be Done Still , even with Hussein ’s execution [ and now Majid ’s ] , there remain opportunities for the American people to finally recover this lost history .
The U.S. military is sitting on a treasure trove of documents seized during the invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
The Bush administration exploited these documents to discredit the United Nations over the “ oil for food ” scandal of the 1990s , ironically when Hussein was n’t building weapons of mass destruction .
But the Bush administration has withheld the records from the 1980s when Hussein was producing chemical and biological weapons .
In 2004 , for instance , the CIA released the so - called Duelfer report , which acknowledged that the administration ’s pre-invasion assertions about Hussein hiding WMD stockpiles were “ almost all wrong . ”
But a curious feature of the report was that it included a long section about Hussein ’s abuse of the U.N. ’s “ oil for food ” program , although the report acknowledged that the diverted funds had not gone to build illegal weapons .
Meanwhile , the report noted the existence of a robust WMD program in the 1980s but offered no documentary perspective on how that operation had occurred and who was responsible for the delivery of crucial equipment and precursor chemicals .
In other words , the CIA ’s WMD report did n’t identify the non-Iraqis who made Iraq ’s WMD arsenal possible .
One source who has seen the evidence told me that it contains information about the role of Chilean arms dealer Carlos Cardoen , who has been identified as a key link between the CIA and Iraq for the procurement of dangerous weapons in the 1980s .
[ One CIA official , who was identified as a connection to Cardoen 's network , was then - CIA Deputy Director Robert Gates , who became Defense Secretary shortly before Hussein ’s hanging in 2006 and remains so to this day . ]
The American people also could demand that the surviving members of Hussein ’s regime be fully debriefed on their historical knowledge before their voices also fall silent either from natural causes or additional executions .
But Saddam Hussein , the singular figure who could have put the era in its fullest perspective and possibly provided the most damning evidence about the Bush Family , has been silenced for good , dropped through a trap door of a gallows and made to twitch at the end of a noose fashioned from hemp .
The White House announced that George W. Bush did n’t wait up for the happy news of Hussein ’s hanging .
After the U.S. military handed Hussein over to his Iraqi executioners , Bush went to bed at his Crawford , Texas , ranch and slept through the night .

BBC News , Nairobi
Kenya 's fashion designers are trying to step into the spotlight and overturn their somewhat dull reputation .
Within East Africa , Kenyans are renowned for being the worst dressed .
Practical and predictable would be the best description of Kenyans ' fashion sensibilities .
Jeans , T - shirts and suits - one size too big - make up many a wardrobe , with a colour palette of grey and brown .
People are willing to invest in Kenyan designs and now can be heard name - dropping at functions
Writer Judy Munyinyi , Nairobi
But now more and more Kenyans are embracing local fashion labels .
Designers who have worked , showcased or studied abroad are injecting a badly needed new lease of life to the industry .
Their collections are bold , bright and , for Kenya , daring .
" I think we have all decided to come back to our roots , we are using a lot of local materials and promoting a lot from our own country , " said Rachel Maithya , who runs the fashion label , ki2 .
" I 'm using a lot of fabric and I 'm trying to make it in a modern and very fashionable way , to have also the young people wanting to wear that and want to be seen around with that . "
Shopaholic 's paradise
But the industry faces two major obstacles - second - hand clothes markets and cheap Chinese imports .
A dress by a local designer can cost upwards of $ 100 Sunshine boutiques , as the markets are commonly known , are a shopaholic 's paradise .
Despite offering employment opportunities and choice for the consumer , they pose a major hurdle to the growth of the fashion industry .
In the 1980s , the country 's textile industry was the leading manufacturing sector .
But the government has not helped much in trying to revive the industry .
During this year 's budget , import duties on second - hand clothes were lowered , making foreign - made clothes even cheaper .
Cheap chic
In the markets , wooden shacks are draped with a wide array of clothes .
Whole outfits can be mixed and matched for less than $ 10 ( £ 6 ) .

In comparison , a single dress by a designer can cost upwards of $ 100 .
Critics of the industry argue that the prices of most outfits being made by the local designers are too expensive , exclusive and lack originality , borrowing heavily from the ' Wests ' - Western countries or West Africa .
But Kevin Mbugua , the style editor of Adam Magazine , points out that it is impossible for local designers to compete against a sector where an item like a shirt could cost less than $ 1 .
Lack of exposure Designer John Kaveke boasts 10 years ' experience in the industry with his label , Kaveke .
He and his fellow designers defend their high prices , placing the blame on the high cost of production , the lack of affordable local produced textiles and the fact that their creations are one - of - a- kind .
A lot of Kenyans are turning their backs on boring clothes
Though to him , these are secondary issues .
He says the key problem facing the fashion industry is the lack of exposure for Kenyan designers .
David Ohingo , a Nairobi resident and creative , agrees : " There is n't enough marketing done to promote local designers .
It 's too costly for them to employ teams to sell their work .
It is expensive for them to get the word out . "
Most designers sell directly from their workshops .
There are only a few who have opened shops but a group of designers have got together and opened a store under a collective label .
Names like Sura Zuri , Moo Cow , Kooroo , Rialto designs , Kiko Romeo , Monica Kanari and Spice may not yet make the fashion racks or the pages of international fashion magazines .
But they are slowly getting noticed .
Writer Judy Munyinyi notes : " The industry is growing , the people who helped start the industry have grown and have become more established and recognised .
There is a lot more recognition for Kenyan designers .
" A lot more Kenyans are willing to patronise the industry even if not that often .
People are willing to invest in Kenyan designs and now can be heard name - dropping at functions . "
The demise of Kenya Fashion
Week four years ago dealt a heavy blow to what had been hailed as a promising industry .
But recent events like the Africa Fashion Fair and the Festival for African Fashion and Arts are showcasing Kenyan designers .
It seems a heightened sense of national pride and the desire to outwardly display forms of patriotism are forcing the Kenyan fashion industry to finally step out of the shadows .

Baby 's rare eye cancer spotted by mother in family photo
A simple picture may have saved a baby 's life after his photo revealed a rare and life threatening tumour behind his eye .
Auxiliary nurse Samantha Rouse discovered her nine - month - old son Jacob 's eye appeared white in a photo she took of him .
The glare from the camera revealed light sensitive cells in his eye that could not be seen face - to - face - a sign of the rare eye cancer retinoblastoma , a rapidly - developing cancer that forms in the cells of the retina , the light - detecting tissue in the eyes .
Telltale :
The picture that sparked Mrs Rouse 's fears
Jacob , who has already lost the sight in his left eye , has been receiving chemotherapy and laser treatment every three weeks in a desperate battle to save the sight in his right eye , as well as his life .
Mother - of - three Samantha was told by family and friends that there was nothing to worry about , but after taking a photo in September last year in which Jacob 's eye appeared to be completely white , she went back to her GP and insisted something was wrong .
Mrs Rouse , 23 , of Hull , East Yorkshire , said : ' You would never have thought there was anything wrong with Jacob .
' He was just a normal happy baby .
It was only when I got some photos developed that I noticed Jacob 's eye was white .
' Nobody believed there was anything wrong , even my GP told me it was just the flash and he was reluctant to refer us .
Maybe my job makes me more cautious .
' It definitely means I was able to stand up to the doctor and insist Jacob went to hospital . '
Jacob was finally diagnosed at Hull Royal Infirmary last November , but Samantha and husband Dane , 25 , who gave up his job as a joiner to look after their sick son , were shocked when they discovered the full extent of their child 's illness .
Fight for sight : Samantha and Dane Rouse with their son Jacob , who is undergoing chemotherapy to clear his eyes of cancer
Doctors told them Jacob was blind in his left eye due to three large tumours in his line of vision .
He also has three smaller tumours in his right eye , which might cause him to go completely blind .
Mrs Rouse said : ' We knew something was wrong , but we did n't expect it to be cancer .
Because its such a rare type of cancer , we did n't know anything about it at all .
We were completely shocked , he 's our baby . '
Jacob 's siblings
Phoebe , three , and Harry , two , have been tested for the rare genetic disease , which only affects one in 15,000 people and tends to develop in children before the age of five .
Worryingly , tests showed Harry has white spots in his eyes , so he has to be tested further .
Both children will continue to be tested in case they develop the disease .
Mrs Rouse said : ' I would definitely urge other parents to check their children 's eyes .
If it had n't been for me taking photos and insisting he got checked , he might have already lost his sight .
' We 're taking each day as it comes , but our family and friends have been amazing and we 're hoping Jacob 's sight will be saved . '
Retinoblastoma affects around 50 children every year and 95 per cent will survive after treatment .
It is best treated if caught early .
Signs include a ' cat 's eye reflection ' in photographs , a black eye on flash photographs , a squint or a cloudy eye .
SEOUL , South Korea — Heinz Insu Fenkl , a literature professor at the State University of New York ( SUNY ) at New Paltz , has cracked one secret to understanding the bizarre regime of North Korea : by reading its comic books .
The academic , who refers to himself as an American - Korean , spends hours in his office tucked away in upstate New York , churning out English translations of the rare books ( called " gruim - chaek " in North Korea ) after he gathers them at shops in China and from colleagues who travel to Pyongyang .
The plots are often wacky , usually pinning blame on loud - mouthed Americans and opportunist Japanese for cursing their promised land with vice .
Most books are leaked to China through the border town of Dandong — a hub of smuggling in North Korean goods .
Others end up in a single shop in Tokyo that specializes in hermit - state memorabilia .
Still , others mysteriously make their way to university libraries in the U.S .
Of the " gruim - chaek " I ’ve located , those published this decade tend to be spy thrillers probably aimed at young boys and teenagers .
The cartoonists establish the storylines strictly as moralistic good - versus - evil tales .
And almost all the books are printed in black - and - white on poor quality paper .
“ I 've also seen some covers of more recent comics that seem to be re-establishing a mythic narrative by referring back to old folktales , ” Fenkl said , adding that he ’s planning a single massive web archive for all his North Korean comic books .
The books are also designed to instill the father of North Korea , Kim Il - sung ’s , philosophy of Juche — radical self - reliance of the state , added Nick Bonner , founder of Koryo Tours , an English - language tour company in Beijing that takes visitors to North Korea several times each year .
“ They ’re much like the themes I read when I was a kid , on the British Army fighting the ‘ Nazis and Japs , ’ ” Bonner reflected , pointing out that some propaganda plots nonetheless resemble our own .
“ But [ in North Korea ] their themes are either historic or based on the Anti-Japanese Guerilla War , or the Victorious Fatherland Liberation War [ the North Korean name for the Korean War in 1950 - 53 ] . ”
In " A Blizzard in the Jungle , " published in 2001 , a group of Americans and North Koreans traveling on an airplane crash in an unnamed African country .
When they ’re stranded in the jungle , the Americans selfishly split ways with their North Korean colleagues , only to be devoured by alligators in a nearby river .
Let it be a warning from the Dear Leader : never embrace the self - indulging lifestyle of the American warmongers .
The fact that North Koreans were writing politically charged comic books set in Africa comes as no surprise , Fenkl said .
Quite a few North Koreans live as expatriates on that continent : for years , North Korea has sent military advisers to Angola , Zimbabwe , Zambia , Ethiopia and Uganda to supply weapons and train soldiers in exchange for mineral concessions .
Strangely , one character onboard the crashed airplane is named Zacharias — possibly an allusion to Zacarias Moussaoui , a mastermind of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks on the Twin Towers .
" A Blizzard in the Jungle " was published in that same year , though Fenkl concedes this is probably a coincidence .
Other comic books directly point fingers at American leaders , rather than only bashing capitalism .
In a similar storyline from 2005 called " General Loser and the Gnats , " Americans who go by the last name “ Bush ” find themselves disgraced by their president ’s policies .
They change their names and confide in the revolutionary cause .
( I have not yet found satires on Barack Obama out of the hermit state . )
North Korea ’s comic craze is nothing new .
For decades , the communist regime has distributed books to elementary school students .
One of North Korea ’s most famous comic books aimed at children is " The Great General Mighty Wing , " an epic narrative published by a state - run press in 1994 .
Mighty
Wing the honeybee confronts a horde of imperialist wasps — cunningly dressed like Japanese soldiers from World War II — trying to invade his land .
After the wasps lay dead , he quickly rallies his enthusiastic colony into a workers ’ collective .
By working together , they build an extensive irrigation canal that flows abundantly to all the bees — not just the powerful wasps .
Concerned about a drought and famine that would eventually kill about 600,000 people , North Korea at the time was looking for ways purvey water to its people .
The regime was constructing a large irrigation canal at the same time Mighty Wing became a sensation .
" Mighty Wing , in some ways , was an iconic image , ” Fenkl said .
“ It was a brilliant move to use bees , or beol , as a symbol to resonate with the historical irrigation project , the Yeoldu 3,000 Ri Beol . ”
“ The books were in color , unlike most comics , ” he added , pointing out the importance the regime might have placed on this cartoon .
Mighty Wing gained fame in North Korea at the same level of Mickey Mouse in the West , thanks to the national fears the artists touched on .
Kim
Il - sung had died that same year — and many North Koreans were secretly uncertain about what would come next .
In his research , Fenkl recently noticed one anomaly : the " gruim - chaek " that reaches the international black market usually differs from those intended for a North Korean audience .
It appears that the editors “ step in , ” he said , imputing the black - market comics with less ideological content .
This could mean they are purposely sending the comics across the sealed Chinese border to expand their readership .
“ I will have to look into it before I come to any conclusions .
' The Crystal Key , ’ for example , is pretty indistinguishable from a non-ideological comic book , ” he reflected , referring to another famous book published in 1992 .
“ [ With the ideological content taken out ] it would be an internationally accessible graphic novel about pirates and a virtuous family protecting their community . ”
Recently , Square - Enix posted on its official Twitter account asking for people 's opinions on a possible Final Fantasy VII remake .
Ever since the infamous tech demo shown at E3 way back in 2005 , fans of the game have been begging for a remake from Square - Enix .
Of course , after the countless amounts of teasing coming from Square - Enix , the response on their official twitter was huge !
Square - Enix 's official twitter was chock - a- block with positive fan responses , so much so that they had to ask people to stop because they were so overwhelmed .
Readers should also bare in mind that this was only from the Japanese audience .
If Square - Enix were ever to post that question where westerners could see it easily , the response would have possibly been tenfold .
This insane number of responses may have been unprecedented by Square - Enix , but this writer would have been surprised if fans did n't latch on to this opportunity to get their opinions heard .
So why is this bit of news more interesting than other taunts from the giant RPG developers , you may ask ?
Well , this is the first time Square - Enix has actually approached its audience about a possible remake themselves , instead of letting information reach them through different sources .
So maybe , after being asked this question countless times in interviews before , they are beginning to listen to their fans and are considering a remake , if they have n't been already .

ATHENS , Feb 26 ( Reuters ) - Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou told parliament on Friday , after a visit by EU economic inspectors , that the worst fears about Greece ’s economy had been confirmed .
Greece is desperate to restore investor confidence in its economic statistics , and reassure buyers of its debt , after revealing that the previous government understated its budget deficit by half .
The European Union is also pressing Greece for radical measures to curtail its deficit to prevent damage to the common currency , the euro .
“ Everything that was revealed after the elections proved that New Democracy ( the previous , conservative administration ) fled from its responsibilities , ” Papandreou said .
“ History confirmed our worst fears . ”
“ The damage is incalculable .
It is not only financial or fiscal but also affects the position of the state ...
“ Our duty today is to forget about the political cost and think only about the survival of our country .
Past policies make it necessary to proceed to brutal changes and reduce accumulated privileges , ” he added .
Greek government officials say the EU inspectors , visiting Athens with IMF experts , have delivered a grim assessment of the nation ’s economy .
Their message was that Athens will miss its targets for reducing the deficit without spending cuts of the kind that have already brought Greeks out on to the streets .
Investors , who must decide whether to buy more Greek debt when Athens issues a new 10 - year bond in the next few weeks , are anxious and Moody ’s agency said it could downgrade Greece ’s credit rating if Greece fails to meet its budget promises .
“ There is only one dilemma :
Will we let the country go bankrupt or will we react ?
Will we let the speculators strangle us , or will we take our fate in our own hands ? ” Papandreou said .
“ We must do whatever we can now to address the immediate dangers today .
Tomorrow it will be too late , and the consequences will be much more dire , ” he added .
Papandreou insisted that Greece would not seek a bailout from abroad : “ We ask the EU for its solidarity and they ask us to meet our obligations .
We will meet our obligations ...
We will demand European community solidarity and I believe we will get it . ”
“ No other country will pay for our debts , ” he said .
“ It is a matter of honour and pride for our country to put our own house in order . ”
Already sensing that too many potential users were attributing the " evil " moniker to Google ( in the absence of actual evil in the world ) , the company yesterday made adjustments to its Google Buzz sign - up procedure .
In Betanews tests , we found Google 's altered dialog box is much more descriptive about the repercussions of setting up a public profile .
It uncovers a critical choice about what you share with others publicly , that had been buried beneath an Edit link , by copying it up front where everyone can see it .
The danger involved with a new user setting up Buzz without being mindful of its default consequences , is that her public profile can be automatically filled with the names and profile links of Gmail contacts she communicates with most .
Betanews tests this morning indicate that changes Google has made to Buzz setup appear to reduce that danger somewhat :
When a Gmail user logs in from the Web and is invited to try Buzz for the first time , a dialog box gives that user an opportunity to find people to explicitly follow by default .
We noticed that when the user starts typing in names , Buzz does attempt to auto - complete those names , using a list of contacts from the Gmail account .
However , at this point in the process , Buzz did not gather those same names into a list of people to be automatically followed , and that 's a big difference .
Here , the user is effectively creating a new default list of people to follow that is devoid of automatic references from Gmail .
If she starts her Buzz setup by accepting this invitation , she may be able to avoid inadvertently publishing her list of followed members to the world right away .

If she starts her Buzz setup by accepting this invitation , she may be able to avoid inadvertently publishing her list of followed members to the world right away .
The dialog box for editing one 's new Buzz - compliant profile now appears the first time the user tries to enter a comment into Buzz ( the equivalent of tweeting ) .
But at this point in time , the user 's Google profile is not public .
That 's significant , because it means information the new user is just now entering into Buzz is n't being broadcast to Google 's search caches , before she has an opportunity to make it private .

The revised dialog box at this point now includes the Show the list of people I 'm following and the list of people following me on my public profile check box -- which had been buried behind an Edit link -- up front , as well as behind the Edit link where it was before .
check box -- which had been buried behind an link -- up front , as well as behind the link where it was before .
Although Buzz urges the new user to create something called a public profile , the degree to which Google publicizes that profile to the world depends on two factors : 1 ) the amount of information the user includes in it ; 2 ) whether the user opts to give her profile a public URL .
Although signing up for Buzz does result in the creation of a " public profile " of sorts , it is only directly viewable to Buzz users ( and perhaps , through a circuitous route , to other Google social services , such as Google Talk ) .
That profile page will include a list of entries shared via Buzz , which does include tweets made using Twitter .
It will also include links to the Buzz user 's lists of followers and followed contacts , but only if the user allowed them to be visible to others .
Yes , visibility is the default choice , but that choice is no longer buried .
And until the user fills in profile details such as career , location , and a list of one 's superpowers ( yes , that 's one of the blanks provided in Google Profile ) , it can not be searched from the Web .

And until the user fills in profile details such as career , location , and a list of one 's superpowers ( yes , that 's one of the blanks provided in Google Profile ) , it cannot be searched from the Web .
Google Profile pages created by Buzz are only " public " by default in a limited sense .
Specifically , for a Google profile to be searchable , one still has to edit her profile page manually , outside of Buzz .
Checking the option at the very bottom enables anyone to browse to http://www.google.com/profiles/Gmail_name, thus giving everyone -- even non-Buzz users -- access to what the user is buzzing .
Although this is n't stated explicitly , enabling this option is what makes the profile searchable like a public Web page , with results that show up in Google searches .
Buzz does not check this option by default .
Until the user checks this option , the profile page 's URL does not include the user 's Gmail name , but rather a large integer at the end .
So although it is technically public , it 's not something that 's designed to be given away , and no one is likely to be able to guess that integer 's 21 - digit value .
Google 's changes do set up a few new speed bumps along the way to creating a Buzz profile , which new users will notice , and many may not appreciate .
We know from experience how folks reacted to the abundance of security warnings shouted out by Windows Vista .
But when making folks aware of the security risks inherent in doing things automatically , this is a good thing .
And the fact that one 's Google profile page is not broadcast to Google 's searchable caches by default , gives Buzz users an important safeguard .

4:50 pm EST February 12 , 2010 · Today on his personal blog , a white - hat hacker who only goes by the name theharmonyguy announced that he had discovered how one can use Picasa to learn the Google username -- the Gmail name -- of any Google user ( who is , unofficially , a Picasa user ) using the long - integer numeric profile address .
With this method , a person whose " public Buzz profile " is only public in a limited sense , could become public in the literal sense .
" With the introduction of Buzz , Google is encouraging users to take advantage of Google profiles , " he wrote .
" But in the process , Google is tying together services that many users may have treated quite distinctly in the past .
If you want your Gmail address to remain private , you need to manage properly the other Google services you use to avoid one of them exposing your Gmail username . "
A number of Arabic and Pashtu interpreters at the terror - war detention center at Guantanamo Bay are under active investigation for omitting valuable intelligence from their translations of detainee interrogations , among other security breaches .
This could taint some of the evidence at the “ 9/11 trial ” in New York and proceedings against other detainees .
Remarkably , the Pentagon never cleaned up the “ mole infestation ” at its highest - security facility after the FBI busted a Muslim spy ring at Gitmo in 2003 .
The 2003 probe involved at least two Arabic interpreters with high - level security clearance .
Senior Airman Ahmad al - Halabi , a Syrian native , and former Army linguist Ahmed Mehalba , an Egyptian native , were later convicted of stealing or mishandling classified documents .
Six years later comes a new problem with Muslim personnel who have virtually unfettered access to detainees and intelligence at Gitmo .
Professional military security and intelligence officials at Gitmo did the preliminary probe , then prepared a classified summary and are now briefing top officials and members of Congress in Washington .
An active FBI criminal probe is also under way .
The possible new spy ring involves several Arabic linguists , some also Egyptian and Syrian immigrants .
They ’re suspected of , among other things :
* Omitting valuable intelligence from their translations of interrogations .
* Slipping notes to detainees inside copies of the Koran .
* Coaching detainees to make allegations of abuse against interrogators .
* Meeting with suspects on the terror watchlist while back in the United States .
Officials say some of the suspected “ dirty ” linguists — who met privately in a locked mosque at Gitmo — have had access to 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed and other high - value al Qaeda detainees .
“ Three years of investigations have revealed the presence of pro-jihad / anti-Western activities among the civilian - contractor and military - linguist population serving Joint Task Force Guantanamo , ” states a copy of a classified Gitmo briefing , prepared in May for the FBI , CIA and Congress ’ intelligence committees .
The report explains that dirty Arabic linguists have gathered classified data involving detainees , interrogations and security operations in an effort to “ disrupt ” Gitmo operations and US “ intelligence - collection capabilities . ”
It goes on to specifically finger the Muslim Brotherhood , a terrorist organization .
The US operations and front groups of the Egypt - based brotherhood are the subject of my recently released book , “ Muslim Mafia , ” which first revealed the contents of the secret Gitmo report .
“ These actions are deliberate , carefully planned , global , and to the benefit of the detainees and multiple terrorist organizations , to include al Qaeda and Muslim Brotherhood , ” the briefing states .
How did this happen at the highest security facility in the world ?
In the wake of the Abu Ghraib scandal , US officials went from waterboarding terrorists to handing them prayer rugs and Korans , while calling them to prayer five times a day .
Pentagon political correctness dictated turning a blind eye to any questions of loyalty among Muslim linguists and chaplains .
Compromised interrogations could affect releases and trials — and the problems go much further .
At least one in seven former Gitmo detainees has returned to terrorism or militant activity .
Some recidivists had met with the suspect Muslim translators .
Others were privately counseled by Muslim chaplains and lay leaders also under investigation for security breaches .
If they fed intelligence to these repatriated detainees , then al Qaeda and the Taliban may know what we know about them and adjust accordingly .
Prisoners released from Gitmo are allowed to keep their Korans — and it ’s camp policy not to search the holy books .
Non-Muslim personnel can’t even touch them .
There ’s no telling what military secrets have been compromised .
Also in question is just how far the enemy has penetrated our critical foreign - language program — not just at Gitmo , but across the entire national security and intelligence complex .
Many Arabic linguists are contractors who rotate in and out of the federal security agencies leading the War on Terror .
To prevent future betrayal , the government must reevaluate its security - clearance and hiring procedures for contract and military linguists .
Post - hiring , it must institute periodic security interviews , polygraph exams and database - access audits for each translator .
More immediately , it must review key translations on the shelf for accuracy , using trustworthy translators — and subject new translations to spot - checking in a stringent quality - assurance program .
The translation of intelligence against our enemy — evidence that will now be tested in civilian court — can no longer be blindly entrusted to individuals with possibly divided loyalties .

A SWEDISH teenager has grown her face back after an allergic reaction to a single paracetamol pill caused the skin to turn black and peel off .
Eva Uhlin , 19 , has recovered her looks after suffering an allergic reaction to the common painkiller , bought over the counter .
The deadly condition , known as toxic epidermal necrolysis , attacked her body , causing her skin to blister , burn and scab .
During her illness , skin on her chest , arms , back and stomach fell off .
At one point the damage to Ms Uhlin 's face was so bad that her lips fused together .
'' It felt like something was crawling around under my skin , I was in total shock - it was like something out of a horror film , '' she said .
'' I could n't believe what was happening .
I had taken paracetamol many times before . ''
It took about five nanoseconds for evangelical Pat Robertson ’s video verdict on the causes of the Haiti earthquake to start making the rounds in France .
Mr. Robertson ’s theory that Haitian slaves made a “ pact with the devil ” 200 years ago in order to free themselves from the hated clutches of Napoleon Bonaparte 's regime – resulting in a curse that led to the destruction of much of Port - au - Prince and a massive loss of life in Tuesday 's earthquake – got the usual chuckles of disbelief among local intelligentsia about American culture .
It was bad enough that he said the successful slave revolt came during the reign of " Napoleon III , or whatever " ( the Haitian Revolution led by Francois - Dominique Toussaint L'ouverture was in fact completed in 1804 when Napoleon Bonaparte ruled France , 44 years before his nephew Napoleon III came to power ) .
But here in Haiti ’s former colonial master , talk about the Robertson “ theory ” clouds with myth an early if awkward chapter in self - determination : the Haitian slaves are considered the first to collectively and successfully overthrow their colonial masters .
In this case , the French .
After the French revolution , in 1794 , the 500,000 slaves brought from Africa to work Haiti 's lucrative sugar and coffee plantations , were freed by decree .
But Napoleon Bonaparte , seeking empire , wealth , and territory , tried re-enslave them in 1802 .
Once slaves breathed the free air , they did not wish to return to their former status as drones or fodder for empire .
Toussaint L'ouverture , a house slave whose father came from Africa , and whose master , Count de Breda , educated him – stepped up .
Mr. L'ouverture ’s reading of French enlightenment and revolutionary writers Mirabeau and Voltaire is thought to have been extensive .
The slave revolt itself took place in the name of the values and ideals of the French revolution in many readings of history here .
Haiti had been “ a hell on earth ” for the slaves , writes Le Monde ’s history specialist , Jerome Gautheret .
“ Each year , 50,000 slaves were brought to Haiti to compensate for the … terrible mortality among the slaves .
In such a fragile society , order could only be precarious , based on terror and violence : the French Revolution shook it in an irreversible way .
In Paris , while ‘ Friends of the Blacks ’ pled for civil equality for all free men and gradual emancipation of the slaves , a powerful colonial party [ in Haiti ] tried to maintain the status quo . ”
Quoted Thursday on Salon.com , UCLA anthropologist Andrew Apter says the notion of a “ pact with the devil ” as behind the slave victory “ is so absurd it is almost funny .
This notion of a pact with the devil is basically an echo of an old colonial response to the successes of the 1790s Haitian revolution . ”
The problem for Haiti is that if it was a hell on earth under slavery , it was also so after the slave revolt , French historians argue .
Africans plucked and sent to Haiti to work under the lash and suddenly freed were not a model constituency for civil society .
Haiti went from the largest sugar exporter in the world to chaos .
“ The plantations were deserted .
The former slaves refused to work on the places they were enslaved , ” Mr. Apter said .
An emerging understanding of Haiti during this time is of an island increasingly divided between the 30,000 to 40,000 mixed race former slaves , and the more recently arrived slaves from Africa .
UCLA ’s Apter argues , “ the reason Haiti is poor is because Europe imposed a blockade on trade after the slave revolt in 1804 , and you have an extremely polarized class structure in which a few families stepped into the positions of the former colonial plantation owners .
There has been a horrible cycle of plundering and autocracy within Haitian leadership . ”

The U.S. Supreme Court pulled the plug Wednesday on plans for camera coverage of the same - sex marriage trial in San Francisco and said any televising of federal court proceedings should start with a more humdrum case .
The 5 - 4 majority said Chief U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker , presiding over the trial on the constitutionality of California 's Proposition 8 , had not given the public enough time to comment last week before he approved live telecasts to be shown in several courthouses around the country .
Walker also approved videotaping for public Internet viewing , in delayed uploads on YouTube .
The ruling permanently bars a broadcast that the high court temporarily blocked just before the trial started Monday .
Opponents of Prop. 8 , the November 2008 initiative that prohibits same - sex marriage , are suing to overturn the measure as a denial of equal protection of the law .
The federal appeals court in San Francisco approved a pilot program last month allowing cameras at selected civil , nonjury trials , a project clearly designed for the Prop. 8 trial .
Walker approved the telecast over the objections of the ballot measure 's sponsors , who said their witnesses could face harassment and might refuse to testify .
The sponsors appealed to the Supreme Court .
No federal trial in California has ever been shown on TV or the Internet .
The Supreme Court , which has refused to televise its own proceedings , said it was not ruling on whether any federal trials could be televised , but the majority justices made their discomfort clear .
The Prop. 8 trial , which involves " issues subject to intense debate in our society ... is not a good one for a pilot program , " because the potential for harm is greater in a high - profile case , the court said .
The justices also said they were concerned about the effect on witnesses ' testimony , which " may be chilled if broadcast , " the court said .
Walker approved the telecast after only a week of public comment , rather than the 30 days that the San Francisco federal court normally requires when it changes its rules .
Walker cited his authority to shorten the comment period when immediate needs arise , and said Monday he had received more than 138,000 comments from the public , all but 32 of them favorable .
But the Supreme Court said there was no immediate need to suspend the 30 - day requirement because shutting off the cameras would harm neither side in the case .
Opponents of Prop. 8 had supported television coverage , as had news organizations , including Hearst Corp. , which owns The Chronicle .
The ruling was issued by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia , Clarence Thomas , Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito .
The dissenters were the court 's more liberal members , Justices Stephen Breyer , John Paul Stevens , Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor .
Breyer , writing for the dissenters , said the public had ample opportunity to comment , there was no evidence that witnesses would be harmed , and those outside the courthouse were losing an opportunity to view a trial of " great public interest . "
Walker had ordered the trial telecast live to the regional appeals court 's headquarters at Seventh and Mission streets in San Francisco and courthouses in Pasadena , Seattle , Portland , Ore. , and Brooklyn , N.Y .
Wednesday 's ruling means the only place people can watch the case on TV is in a 19th floor conference room at the Golden Gate Avenue courthouse that seats about 150 .
Thirty - six seats are available to the public for the trial itself in Walker 's courtroom on the 17th floor .
The case is Hollingsworth vs. Perry , 09A648 .
The ruling can be viewed at links.sfgate.com /ZJCL .

WASHINGTON ( AFP ) – European researchers have taken the world a step closer to fictional wizard Harry Potter ’s invisibility cape after they made an object disappear using a three - dimensional “ cloak , ” a study published Thursday in the US - based journal Science showed .
Scientists from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany and Imperial College London used the cloak , made using photonic crystals with a structure resembling piles of wood , to conceal a small bump on a gold surface , they wrote in Science .

“ It ’s kind of like hiding a small object underneath a carpet — except this time the carpet also disappears , ” they said .
“ We put an object under a microscopic structure , a little like a reflective carpet , ” said Nicholas Stenger , one of the researchers who worked on the project .
“ When we looked at it through a lens and did spectroscopy , no matter what angle we looked at the object from , we saw nothing .
The bump became invisible , ” said Stenger .
Invisibility cloaks have already been developed but they only worked on two dimensions .
In other words , the objects that were supposed to be made invisible were immediately visible from the third dimension , the study said .
The “ cloak ” invented by the European team is the first to work on three dimensions .

It is composed of special lenses that bend light waves to suppress light as it scattered from the tiny bump the researchers were trying to make disappear , the study says .
The invisibility cloak and the bump were both minute .
The cloak measured 100 microns by 30 microns — one micron being one - thousandth of a millimeter — and the bump it hid was 10 times smaller , said Stenger .
The researchers are working now to recreate the disappearing bump on a larger scale , but Stenger said Harry Potter ’s invisibility cloak would not be hanging in would - be wizards ’ wardrobes in the immediate future .

“ Theoretically , it would be possible to do this on a large scale but technically , it ’s totally impossible with the knowledge we have now , ” he said .
“ But it could become a reality in 10 years , ” he said , stressing , however , that the first invisibility cloak would n’t be a flowing cape but a rigid structure .

The US military has ploughed money into several research groups working on invisibility technology , and scientists are probing other applications for the light - based processes , Stenger said .
“ Light is already used in fiber optics , in telecommunications .
And in the near future , we ’re going to use light more and more in computers , ” said Stenger .
GHAJAR , Golan Heights 
In this far - flung village that straddles a tense international border , location is not just a real estate issue .
It determines in which country you reside .
The village , a cluster of pastel - colored houses in a deceptively tranquil valley , sits at a volatile juncture where regional rivals Israel , Lebanon and Syria meet .
It commands crucial water sources , perched above the Hasbani River and the Wazzani springs .
Ghajar ( pronounced RAH - jar ) has a complicated history , adapting to the shifting map of territorial conquests and squeezed between Israel , which currently controls the village , and its enemies , including the Lebanese Shiite militant group Hezbollah .
Now international powers interested in stabilizing the region are pushing for another change in Ghajar ’s status by returning the northern part to Lebanon , unnerving the residents .
Kids with religious parents are better behaved and adjusted than other children , according to a new study that is the first to look at the effects of religion on young child development .
The conflict that arises when parents regularly argue over their faith at home , however , has the opposite effect .
John Bartkowski , a Mississippi State University sociologist and his colleagues asked the parents and teachers of more than 16,000 kids , most of them first - graders , to rate how much self control they believed the kids had , how often they exhibited poor or unhappy behavior and how well they respected and worked with their peers .
The researchers compared these scores to how frequently the children ’s parents said they attended worship services , talked about religion with their child and argued abut religion in the home .
The kids whose parents regularly attended religious services — especially when both parents did so frequently — and talked with their kids about religion were rated by both parents and teachers as having better self - control , social skills and approaches to learning than kids with non-religious parents .
But when parents argued frequently about religion , the children were more likely to have problems .
“ Religion can hurt if faith is a source of conflict or tension in the family , ” Bartkowski noted .
Why so good ?
Bartkowski thinks religion can be good for kids for three reasons .
First , religious networks provide social support to parents , he said , and this can improve their parenting skills .
Children who are brought into such networks and hear parental messages reinforced by other adults may also “ take more to heart the messages that they get in the home , ” he said .
Secondly , the types of values and norms that circulate in religious congregations tend to be self - sacrificing and pro-family , Bartkowski told LiveScience .
These “ could be very , very important in shaping how parents relate to their kids , and then how children develop in response , ” he said .
Finally , religious organizations imbue parenting with sacred meaning and significance , he said .
University of Virginia sociologist W. Bradford Wilcox , who was not involved in the study , agrees .
At least for the most religious parents , “ getting their kids into heaven is more important than getting their kids into Harvard , ” Wilcox said .
But as for why religious organizations might provide more of a boost to family life than secular organizations designed to do the same thing , that ’s still somewhat of a mystery , said Annette Mahoney , a psychologist at Bowling Green State University in Ohio , also not involved in the research .
Mahoney wondered : “ Is there anything about religion and spirituality that sets it apart ? ”
Unanswered questions
Bartkowski points out that one limitation of his study , to be published in the journal Social Science Research , is that it did not compare how denominations differed with regards to their effects on kids .
“ We really do n’t know if conservative Protestant kids are behaving better than Catholic kids or behaving better than mainline Protestant kids or Jewish kids , ” he said .
It ’s also possible that the correlation between religion and child development is the other way around , he said .
In other words , instead of religion having a positive effect on youth , maybe the parents of only the best behaved children feel comfortable in a religious congregation .
“ There are certain expectations about children ’s behavior within a religious context , particularly within religious worship services , ” he said .
These expectations might frustrate parents , he said , and make congregational worship “ a less viable option if they feel their kids are really poorly behaved . ”
If you 're planning on skipping the bulk of this text and heading straight to the review score to decide whether or not you should play through Heavy Rain , just know this : the game starts slow .
It 'll take you a couple hours to get into the meat of the experience and for things to really pick up , but once it does , you 'll be on the edge of your seat until the end and you wo n't want to put the controller down .
In other words , if you stick with it , Heavy Rain
Click +the+image+to+watch+our+video+review .
The +beginning+is+slow ,+but+important .
Having said that , it 's also worth quickly pointing out that I 'm going to keep this review , so feel free to read it without fear of anything being ruined for you ( and trust me , you do n't want anything ruined ) .
Quantic Dream 's last title , dubbed Indigo Prophecy in North America and Fahrenheit pretty much everywhere else , tried to bridge together intricate storytelling with gameplay by using what were essentially quick - time events ( think Dragon 's Lair ) .
A button prompt appears on the screen , and if you press it in time , the game continues and you get another one .
If you do n't , you fail and usually wind up staring at the words " Game Over " .
With Heavy Rain , the studio took this control mechanic to a completely different level by removing the win / fail result and instead turned it into what can best be described as a branching narrative .
You can't ever actually fail in Heavy Rain .
There is no Game
Over screen , and nothing will force you to have to replay anything .
No matter what you do , the game , its characters and the story move on .
This has multiple effects .
If you 're in an action sequence , missing one prompt might not mean much other than that the fight or chase would play out a little differently .
Rather than taking out the bad guy right then , you might get knocked down but get another chance right after that .
Miss too many and the bad guy might get away , but like I said , the story will continue on , no matter the result .
In other instances , these options ( as there is often more than one button available to you at any one time ) will decide what a character says , how they react to something , what you interact with or so on and so forth .
The result is that although you 're still matching button prompts , Heavy Rain feels much more like you 're choosing and influencing what happens in the game , rather than simply reacting to it .
This is a major and key element of the control mechanics that separates Heavy Rain from the likes of Indigo Prophecy , Dragon 's Lair or even God of War 's boss takedown sequences , and it 's really what makes the actual gameplay work quite well .
What 's really interesting is that Heavy Rain manages to always keep you on your toes , and if you do n't pay attention and keep your cool , you 'll pay for it .
There are action sequences that happen when you least expect them , and if you 're not ready , you may " fail " them .
In other cases , the opposite is true : events can happen very quickly and your gut instinct may be to react to them , when the best option may have been to wait for a better opportunity ( or not react at all ) .
The first time this last bit happened to me , I had to stop playing for a minute and think about what I 'd done and what the consequences would wind up being .
Things can get pretty intense , to say the least .
The great thing about all of this , and the reason that Heavy Rain may not have worked with any other control scheme , is that everything in the game revolves around the story .
This is n't something where Quantic Dream came up with some cool scenes and then wrapped a story around everything to tie it together ; the story is the utmost focus , and everything that you do and everything that happens directly feeds into it , without exception .
Without having a " defined " control scheme that only allows you to perform a set number of actions , the changing control options allow the mechanics to adapt to what makes sense for your character to do at any point to keep the storytelling as unopposed as possible .
My one complaint about the control scheme is that it 's sometimes hard to tell what you 're supposed to do .
When your character is frazzled , the button or text options that pop up can be blurred and jittery to show that the person is tense as well as make it a little trickier to choose the right thing ( you might say something wrong if you 're not careful , like in real life ) .
The problem is that button prompts will also pulse if you 're supposed to tap them quickly rather than hold them down or do a single , quick tap , and distinguishing between these variants can be tricky .
It 's not a game - breaking problem , but I messed up in a few places where I would n't have had the prompts been clearer .
Today , data traveling over the Internet are much like crates of oranges traveling the interstates in the back of a truck .
The data are loaded in at one end , unloaded at the other , and nothing much happens to them in between .
About 10 years ago , electrical engineers suggested that bundles of data could be transmitted over a network more efficiently if , instead of passing unaltered from one end to the other , they were scrambled together along the way and unscrambled at the end .
In 2003 , MIT electrical engineering professor Muriel Médard and her colleagues proved the counterintuitive result that , in many cases , the best way to scramble data together was to do it randomly .
Last year , the paper in which the researchers presented their findings received an award from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ( IEEE ) , which recognized its seminal contributions to the field that ’s come to be known as “ network coding . ”
But the same year , the IEEE honored another network - coding paper , in which MIT researchers played the leading role : the paper that , in 2006 , presented the first practical implementation of network coding .
The first article in this two - part series presented a simple example of how network coding increases efficiency .
Suppose that two laptops are trying to send each other messages simultaneously over the Wi-Fi network in a coffee shop .
Ordinarily , the first laptop would send its message to the coffee shop ’s Wi-Fi router , which would forward it to the second laptop .
The second laptop would send its message to the router , which would forward it to the first laptop .
That ’s four total transmissions .
But with network coding , the router would instead combine the two laptops ’ messages into a hybrid message , which it would broadcast to both laptops , reducing the total number of transmissions to just three .
Each laptop would then subtract the message it had sent from the hybrid to recover the message intended for it .
Dina Katabi , an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science ; Médard ; MIT grad students Sachin Katti and Hariharan Rahul ( Katti now teaches at Stanford ; Rahul still works with Katabi at MIT ) ; and Cambridge University ’s Jon Crowcroft and Wenjun Hu generalized this approach to a network with many different transmitters and receivers .
The researchers blanketed two floors of the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab with wireless routers programmed to execute their network coding scheme .
They then used wireless devices to exchange test data over the network .
Like all information sent over modern networks , the test data were broken up into smaller “ packets ” of information for transmission .
And as is typical with most wireless networks , electromagnetic interference , physical obstacles , and sheer distance from the wireless devices meant that no one router received all the packets .
In the MIT network , however , routers also told their neighbors which packets they had received .
A router would use that information when preparing mixed packets to send to its neighbors .
Consider a router that has four packets in its memory , A , B , C and D .
It knows that one of its neighbors also has A and C ; another neighbor has A and D ; and a third neighbor has C and D .
So it creates a single mixed packet that combines packets A , C and D .
The first neighbor uses that packet to recover D ; the second neighbor uses it to recover C ; and the third neighbor uses it to recover A . Since the mixed packets are the same size as the packets they combine , a single packet conveys three times as much information as it would have in an ordinary wireless network .
In experiments , the coding scheme significantly increased the amount of data that the network could carry without requiring any more bandwidth .
Although the precise figure varied according to the number of wireless devices accessing the network , which of them were sending information to which others , and the amount of interference they encountered , “ in general , ” Katabi says , “ you can see , let ’s say , threefold improvements .
” Chris Ramming , who as a program manager for the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) funded several projects that investigated network coding , says that the two papers honored by the IEEE “ are two very seminal papers , for completely different reasons . ”
According to Ramming , who ’s now director of the Corporate External Research Office for chip manufacturer Intel , Katabi and Médard ’s paper “ was a practical result .
It took a completely different kind of network coding and showed in a real wireless network on the MIT campus that it can make an important difference .
” Both Katabi and Médard have continued to work on network coding , sometimes apart , but frequently as collaborators .
“ We exactly complement each other , ” says Katabi .
“ Muriel has the theoretical foundation , while I come to it from , ‘ Let ’s make it work , let ’s make it practical .
How can we actually make it work over an actual wireless channel ? ’
” Indeed , Katabi has found a way to make networks even more efficient by exploiting the physical characteristics of actual wireless channels .
In the network described in the award - winning paper , wireless routers received electromagnetic signals , translated them into bits , mixed the bits together , and then translated the bits back into electromagnetic signals .
But signals sent from different transmitters naturally blend together physically .
That blending is usually a nuisance : the signals have to be separated before data can be extracted from them .
But Katabi built another experimental wireless network in which routers do n’t disentangle blended signals ; they just amplify and forward them .
It turns out that the network coding techniques that work at the level of the bit can be extended to reconstruct the original signals , without lots of intermediate translations .
Médard , too , has been concerned with the practical implementation of network coding , if at a higher level of abstraction .
The Internet is designed so that a computer or phone receiving information will generally acknowledge the arrival of data packets .
If an acknowledgment fails , the sender knows that it has to resend the missing packet .
But if , as with network coding , all the packets are mixed together , which packet does the receiver acknowledge ?
Médard and her colleagues have found a practical way to answer that question , a system wherein each hybrid packet identifies the source packets it combines .
The receiver then keeps the sender apprised of the source packets represented in the hybrids it ’s received .
Médard and her colleagues are also working on applications of network coding in streaming video , where different means of combining data can be tailored to the different image resolutions of receiving devices .
And they ’re considering cases where network coding can be applied to several different networks at once .
If , for instance , your phone can connect to both Wi -Fi networks and the cellular network , then for large files , you might want to download data over both networks at once .
But the cellular network could be significantly more expensive to use than a local Wi -Fi network , so you would want to minimize the amount of data transmitted over it .
Network coding can help coordinate transmissions over the two networks , to maximize efficiency while minimizing cost .
Although a young field , network coding has already sparked corporate interest .
Defense contractor BAE built the equipment for the DARPA projects that Ramming funded , and Microsoft used network coding in a file - sharing program called Avalanche .
Médard says that she is currently working with France Telecom , the French technology company Technicolor ( formerly Thomson SA ) and the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei on network coding applications .
Katabi adds that Cisco , a maker of networking equipment , and South Korean conglomerate Samsung have also expressed interest in the MIT researchers ’ work .
“ Network coding is a very cool idea , ” says Katabi .
“ There are so many things you can do with it . ”
AOKI Shinya talk about UFC109 .... I will trenslate this column
I willpick up some UFC109 fights and tell you my opinion !!
1st , I will say about Nate vs Sonnen ....
Sonnen is 33 years old , 24 - 10 - 1 record , This record is not special , but it is made by very tough fights .
Nate is known as Pancrase fighter , and Knocked Demian Mia out .
Game is decided by Sonnen7s wrestling and pound , When Opponent do guard position , He make him lay again , and his elbow and pound began from it , this is severe , lock opponent , elbow !!
this " LOCK AND ELBOW " is good , I learns from him this technic is difficult to notice , but I love it .
Sonnen controled Nate 's leg joint ( Ko- kansetsu ) , before he do pound , this is important point ... Sonen become grinder , pound and pound , . , .. and half position , back !!
His back control skill is master class .
And He trikes Twister in 2nd round , it is cool !!
this fight was Sonnen 's oneside game .
I heard John Fitch said " The closed guard is dead in MMA （ FightersOnly ） " oh , yes , Yes , i agree ! absolutely Yes !!
long time Closed guard means present my lose by Decision to opponent .
If I am closed position , I have to recover quickly .
pressure of sweep & submission ..... but it is prolog of stand .
how can I stand again from guard ?
it is united technic of submission , sweep , and stand ..... We need groud technic to stand again .
Do you know it ?.......... Sorry I can not explain it perfectly , , , it .... I want to say " MMA IS MMA . " MMA is not " striking + Ground " ... so , it is called as MMA !!

It 's not exactly a Joe Wilson " you lie " moment , but there is a lot of discussion today on last night 's by - play between President Obama and Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito .
Obama criticized the Supreme Court 's ruling last week that corporations can spend as much money as they want on political campaigns , saying it will " open the floodgates for special interests , including foreign corporations . "
As Obama said this , Alito could be seen shaking his head and saying , " not true . "
The liberal Daly Kos said , " Alito channels Joe Wilson , " a reference to the South Carolina congressman who yelled at Obama during his health care speech in September .
Others also made the same comparison .
The conservative National Review , meanwhile , says Alito 's critique is justified .
And one Supreme Court historian called Obama 's statement an unusual insult that may lead to a boycott by the justices at next year 's State of the Union .
White House spokesman Bill Burton said the president had no particular reaction to the justice 's comment .
" One of the great things about our democracy is that powerful members of the government at high levels can disagree in public and in private , " Burton said .
" This is one of those cases . "
Besides :
As a senator , Obama voted against Alito 's confirmation .

Les déplacements en transports en commun en région parisienne sont source d'inconfort et d'incertitude .
Surtout , ils ont un impact certain sur la santé physique et mentale des salariés estime le cabinet Technologia .
Ce cabinet spécialisé en évaluation et en prévention des risques professionnels et de l'environnement estime , dans une étude publiée lundi 8 février , qu'ils peuvent menacer la paix sociale des entreprises .
Une psychologue du travail , un ergonome et un sociologue ont interrogé quelque cent cinquante représentants de personnels ( RP ) , directeurs et directrices des relations humaines ( RH ) pour ce travail illustré de témoignages , dont rend compte le Parisien , alors que le sujet des transports devient l'un des enjeux de la campagne des régionales en Ile - de - France .
" Le temps passé dans les transports , en rendant les salariés moins énergiques et moins disponibles , en les exposant à l'opprobre des managers contrôlant leur ponctualité et en modifiant leur rapport au travail , est un catalyseur multifactoriel des risques psychosociaux ( stress , dépression ) " , résument les auteurs de l'étude .
L'étude pointe la tendance à l'allongement des déplacements domicile - travail en Ile - de - France .
MENACES SUR " LA PAIX SOCIALE "
Le choix pour ce cabinet de s'attacher à un problème " qui reste bien souvent aux portes de l'entreprise (... ) s'explique justement par la nécessité de mettre en avant des difficultés qui souvent passent au second plan alors qu'elles sont pleinement liées au travail " , expliquent les auteurs .
Ceux - ci notent " des savoirs différenciés " chez leurs interlocuteurs quant à la perception des déplacements : ainsi 64 % des RP sont " tout à fait d'accord " pour voir les transports en commun comme source de fatigue , contre 28 % des RH .
Multiplication des correspondances , temps de voyages longs ( perçus comme allant du simple au double chez les utilisateurs du RER A interrogés ) , inconfort lié à l'entassement concourent à fatiguer et stresser les salariés , souligne l'étude qui dénonce notamment le " coût psychologique " sur la santé lié à " l' incertitude " ( correspondances , pannes , retards ... ) .
Les retards au travail , traités différemment d'une entreprise à l'autre , entraînent chez les salariés la mise en place de " stratégies compensatoires " pour les rattraper et pouvoir s'adapter au rythme des transports en commun ( réduire les pauses , travailler plus longtemps ) .
Pour les entreprises elles - mêmes , " l'aléa des transports en commun favorise les retards et les perturbations du travail à effectuer , et de façon indirecte , peut menacer la paix sociale quand une certaine souplesse horaire est accordée aux salariés exposés aux plus difficiles conditions de transport " , explique Technologia .
Le recours à cette souplesse ou à des " recrutements de proximité " laissent toutefois les responsables interrogés " relativement démunis face à une tendance de fond : un accroissement de l'offre de transport plus lent que celui des nouvelles implantations ou des délocalisations au sein de la région " francilienne , qui concentre une très large part de l'activité économique française .

Over the last four years , the United Nations Security Council has repeatedly demanded that Iran stop producing nuclear fuel .
Iran is still churning out enriched uranium and has now told United Nations inspectors that it is raising the level of enrichment  moving slightly closer to bomb - grade quality .
President Obama was right to offer to negotiate with Tehran .
Washington and its allies were right to look for possible compromises even after Tehran was caught  again  hiding an enrichment plant .
Enough is enough .
Iran needs to understand that its nuclear ambition comes with a very high cost .
President Obama said on Tuesday that the United States and its allies are “ moving along fairly quickly ” on a new sanctions resolution .
He also said it would take several weeks to draft a proposal .
That is not reassuring .
Once a resolution is written , the negotiating process typically drags on for weeks , if not months .
Iran is in such economic and political turmoil that its government may be more vulnerable to outside pressure .
Security forces have expanded a crackdown on the political opposition , arresting hundreds of people ahead of Thursday ’s anniversary of the Iranian revolution .
If there 's one thing that unites the Republican Party it's that the stimulus bill was a job - killing piece of legislation that was the worst thing in the whole entire world for the economy , right ?
Or maybe that 's just what unites them in public , because in private the Washington Times reports they 've been working overtime to get their hands on job - creating stimulus cash .
Sen. Christopher S. Bond regularly railed against President Obama 's economic stimulus plan as irresponsible spending that would drive up the national debt .
But behind the scenes , the Missouri Republican quietly sought more than $ 50 million from a federal agency for two projects in his state .
...
In a letter to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack , Mr. Bond noted that one project applying to the USDA for stimulus money would " create jobs and ultimately spur economic opportunities . "
Bond is n't alone .
Remember Joe " You Lie " Wilson ?
Rep. Joe Wilson , South Carolina Republican who became famous after yelling , " You lie , " during Mr. Obama 's addresses to Congress in September , voted against the stimulus .
Nonetheless , Mr. Wilson elbowed his way into the rush for federal stimulus cash in a letter he sent to Mr. Vilsack on behalf of a foundation seeking funding .
" We know their endeavor will provide jobs and investment in one of the poorer sections of the Congressional District , " he wrote to Mr. Vilsack in the Aug. 26 , 2009 , letter .
You see the pattern ?
Slam the stimulus in public , but in private , ask for stimulus funds to create jobs .
For example , Sen. Robert Bennett of Utah :
On Feb. 13 , 2009 , Sen. Robert F. Bennett , Utah Republican , issued a statement criticizing the stimulus — but two days earlier , he privately forwarded to Mr. Vilsack a list of projects seeking stimulus money .
" I believe the addition of federal funds to these projects would maximize the stimulative effect of these projects on the local economy , " he wrote .
And here 's even more quotes uncovered by the Washington Times in private letters written by Republican lawmakers seeking stimulus funds from the Agriculture Department :
Sen . Mike Johanns , Nebraska Republican : " The proposed project would create 38 new jobs and bring broadband to eight hospitals , five colleges , 16 libraries and 161 K - 12 schools "
" The proposed project would create 38 new jobs and bring broadband to eight hospitals , five colleges , 16 libraries and 161 K - 12 schools " Sen. Lamar Alexander , Tennessee Republican : " It is anticipated that the project will create over 200 jobs in the first year and at least another 40 new jobs in the following years . "
Rep. John Linder , Georgia Republican : " the employment opportunities created by this program would be quickly utilized "
Kudos to the Washington Times for having done the leg work of filing the FOIA requests to expose these examples of Republican lawmakers talking out of both sides of their mouths , publicly lambasting the stimulus as a job - killing measure , but privately conceding that it actually created jobs .
It 's hard to imagine a more effective way of demonstrating Republican hypocrisy on the question of whether the stimulus bill creates jobs , and Dems should remind them of it every waking day .
A new study provides further evidence suggesting many companies tweak quarterly earnings to meet investor expectations , and the companies that adjust most often are more likely to restate earnings or be charged with accounting violations .

WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama 's much - challenged health care overhaul gained traction Wednesday as a liberal lawmaker became the first to switch his opposition and Catholic nuns declared their support in an unusual public break with the bishops .
Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio , long a supporter of Medicare - for - all , voted against the House Democratic bill in November because it did not go far enough in creating a robust government - run plan to compete with private insurance .
But Kucinich said Wednesday that the bill coming before the House represents the best chance to expand coverage to the uninsured , even if it does not include a public plan .
At a Capitol Hill news conference , Kucinich said his decision was a combination of pragmatism and concern about the impact that defeat of the health care bill would have on Obama 's presidency .
" You do have to be very careful that the potential of President Obama 's presidency not be destroyed by this debate , " said Kucinich .
" Even though I have many differences with him on policy , there 's something much bigger at stake here for America . "
Kucinich said he'd met with Obama four times to discuss the health overhaul , most recently on Monday when he flew back to Ohio with the president aboard Air Force One.
Obama called Kucinich 's decision " a good sign . "
At stake is a bill that would cover some 30 million uninsured people , end insurance practices such as denying coverage to those with a pre-existing conditions , require almost all Americans to get coverage by law and try to slow the cost of medical care nationwide .
The comprehensive legislation could affect nearly every American , from those undergoing annual checkups to people facing major surgery .
Democratic leaders hope to vote this weekend .
Meanwhile , in a rare public disagreement that will reverberate among the nation 's 70 million Catholics , leaders of religious orders representing 59,000 nuns sent lawmakers a letter urging lawmakers to pass the Senate health care bill .
Expected to come before the House by this weekend , the measure contains abortion funding restrictions that the bishops say do n't go far enough .
" Despite false claims to the contrary , the Senate bill will not provide taxpayer funding for elective abortions , " said the letter signed by 60 leaders of women 's religious orders .
" It will uphold longstanding conscience protections and it will make historic new investments ... in support of pregnant women .
This is the real pro-life stance , and we as Catholics are all for it . "
The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and the National Right to Life Committee have denounced the bill as a backdoor subsidy for abortion .
But the nuns and the Catholic Health Association — representing some 600 hospitals — say restrictions in the Senate bill would still prevent taxpayer funding for abortion , although the legal mechanism for doing so is different from what the bishops prefer .
" This is politics ; this is n't a question of faith and morals , " said Sister Simone Campbell , executive director of Network , a national Catholic social activism lobby .
" We are the ones who work every day with people who are suffering because they do n't have health care .
We cannot turn our backs on them , so for us , health care reform is a faith - based response to human need . "
Another sign of a rift among abortion opponents emerged as Rep. Dale Kildee , D - Mich. , announced his support for the bill .
Kildee was among the anti-abortion Democrats who backed a Michigan Democrat , Rep. Bart Stupak , in forcing tough restrictions on the original House - passed bill .
Kildee said in a statement Wednesday that after careful study , he 's concluded the Senate bill would also bar federal funding for abortion — while saving lives by providing coverage to those now uninsured .
" Voting for this bill in no way diminishes my pro-life voting record or undermines my beliefs , " he said .
" I am a staunch pro-life member of Congress , both for the born and the unborn . "
A new report from the nonpartisan Robert Wood Johnson Foundation shows the nation 's middle class , who typically do n't qualify for government health insurance , became uninsured at a pace faster than the poor from 2000 to 2008 .
The report says 13 million middle - income earners were uninsured in 2008 — about 2 million more than in 2000 .
Wednesday 's developments heartened House Democratic leaders , who are still short of the 216 votes they need to pass the bill .
The No. 2 Democrat in the House , Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland , dodged a question about whether his party has the votes .
" I do n't have a precise number , " Hoyer said on ABC 's " Good Morning America . "
" We think we will have the votes when the roll is called . "
White House aides said Obama and senior advisers are making clear to lawmakers that they will not be left standing alone in a difficult election year if they cast a tough vote for health care overhaul .
The aides spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private meetings .
Environmentalists say Asian carp , an invasive species of food - guzzling fish , could cause an ecological disaster if it enters Lake Michigan
The fight looks utterly unequal .
In the red corner : the combined might of North America , including the US and Canadian governments , the US army , the governors of eight American states , two Senate c­ommittees and the supreme court .
In the blue corner : one fish .
The way things are looking , the fish is winning .
At stake is the health of the Great Lakes , the world 's largest body of fresh water .
Environmentalists warn of ecological disaster , courtesy of Asian carp , an invasive species of food - guzzling fish that is within miles of entering Lake Michigan .
If they do , they would have the ­potential to spread throughout the lakes , wreaking havoc to their ecosystem and with it the $ 7bn ( £ 4.7 bn ) fishing and recreation industries on which millions of jobs depend .
" This is an intense threat , and people are just waking up to how big the danger is , " said David Ullrich of the Great Lakes and St Lawrence Cities Initiative , which represents 70 waterfront cities in the US and Canada with a joint population of 13 million .
Asian carp were first introduced to southern states of the US from China in the 1970s to help clean tanks in fish farms .
They escaped and for more than 30 years have steadily worked their way up the Mississippi river system , devouring food and devastating native fish populations along the way .
Last December , DNA of the carp was found just a few miles from the Great Lakes outside Chicago , a discovery that Ullrich described as " a major shock to everyone " .
Though they live on plankton and algae , Asian carp are like the Terminators of the fish world .
They can grow to four feet and 110 pounds , and eat up to 40 % of their body weight in a single day .
By sucking up so much goodness from the water they deprive the juveniles of native species of their primary source of food , leading to their decline .
Further downstream from the Great Lakes , in the Illinois and Mississippi ­rivers , the damage is already abundantly evident .
The newcomers have starved out native species to such an extent that Asian carp now account for more than nine out of every 10 fish .
The fear is that if they become established in the Great Lakes the same brutal transformation will occur .
The lakes are considered all the more susceptible because they were formed at the end of the last ice age as the glaciers receded .
That was 10,000 years ago , which in biological terms is a blink of an eye , rendering this young ecosystem all the more vulnerable to invasive attack .
As an additional threat , the silver variety of Asian carp also have the ability to leap two metres into the air , which they do when disturbed by ­vibrations of passing motor boats .
Such acrobatics would be quaint were they not so perilous .
" These fish have broken jaws , knocked people unconscious and caused folks to nearly drown in the Mississippi river , " said Joel Brammeier of the environmental group Alliance for the Great Lakes .
" Imagine cruising down a lake at 20 knots and getting hit in the stomach or head with a bowling ball – that 's what you can envisage with Asian carp . "
With the fish now within striking distance of the lakes , an extraordinary array of officialdom has begun to engage with the problem , from small fishing and shipping firms right up to the federal government , Congress and supreme court .
Everyone is agreed that the fish must be stopped , but consensus on how to do so is proving elusive .
Earlier this month the Obama administration put forward a $ 78.5 m plan for blocking the fish .
Its focus lies in an electronic barrier that has been built by the US army corps of engineers across a canal through which the fish would have to swim to reach the lakes .
The barrier , opened last year , has been designed to allow ships to pass while deterring fish .
It works by shooting a high - voltage current through the water strong enough to stun , but not kill , the carp .
The crucial question is whether it is foolproof .
" I do n't think we can ever guarantee 100 % of anything in life , but we think it 's well above 99 % of the fish that are turned back , " said Chuck Shea , who manages the barrier .
But for those who fear that arrival of the fish would spell disaster , that 1 % risk is simply too high – particularly as the carp DNA found last December was beyond the barrier .
The state of Michigan , supported by Minnesota , Wisconsin , Ohio , Pennsylvania and New York , all of which have Great Lakes shores , has taken the matter to the supreme court to force through a permanent solution .
These states are pressing for the ultimate barrier : they want to set the clock back 110 years to when the lakes were distinct from the Mississippi river system .
It was only in 1900 that the connection between the two was made when , in a breathtaking – some say breathtakingly arrogant – feat of engineering , the flow of the Chicago river was reversed to allow billions of gallons of waste water to be sent downriver from Chicago thus solving the city 's sewerage problem .
As a result of the reversal , Lake Michigan was artificially joined by canal to the Illinois river and hence the Mississippi , providing the Asian carp more than a century later with an artificial pathway into the Great Lakes .
Michigan wants that pathway to be cut off , by sealing the locks that link the two ecosystems .
The state , whose economy is singularly dependant on the Great Lakes by dint of its long shoreline , is not satisfied by the Obama administration 's proposal merely to restrict use of the locks .
Michigan 's attorney general recently denounced the federal plans as " half - measures and gimmicks " .
Against that view , the state of ­Illinois has been pressing for the locks to remain at least partially open .
Economic ­imperative is at work here , too .
Chicago , a city whose greatness was ­initially founded upon shipping , still has a small but significant trade in heavy materials such as coal and gravel by barge along the canal through which the carp are now progressing in the opposite direction .
Judy Biggert , a Chicago member of congress , has labelled the outcry over Asian carp " hysteria " and ridiculed Michigan and others for their " act now , think later mentality " .
The fear for environmentalists is that while this largely economically - driven squabbling goes on , Asian carp will be allowed to continue gobbling their way towards Lake Michigan .
Should they be allowed to reach there in numbers ­sufficient to start a breeding colony — and females can spawn more than a ­million eggs several times in a season — it will all be over bar the shouting .
Brammeier sees Asian carp as a crucible for the lakes , pointing out that they have already been severely harmed by toxic waste and 180 previous invasive species .
" We know so much about this new threat .
If , after all that , we still can't act , if we stand down , then we will be confining the Great Lakes to another century of damage and degradation . "

The core of Palin 's politics and increasingly the core of the Republican party , as she put it last night :
" I think , kind of tougher to , um , put our arms around , but allowing America 's spirit to rise again by not being afraid to kind of go back to some of our roots as a God fearing nation where we 're not afraid to say , especially in times of potential trouble in the future here , where we 're not afraid to say , you know , we do n't have all the answers as fallible men and women so it would be wise of us to start seeking some divine intervention again in this country , so that we can be safe and secure and prosperous again .
To have people involved in government who are n't afraid to go that route , not so afraid of the political correctness that you know -- they have to be afraid of what the media said about them if they were to proclaim their alliance on our creator . "
If the context , meaning and implications of this sort of conservatism still befuddle you , if you still think of yourself as a conservative but do not fathom how a former beauty queen sportscaster is now most likely the future of the GOP , please read my prediction and analysis of this development in " The Conservative Soul : Fundamentalism , Freedom and the Future Of The Right .

# 5 – Exploding iPods
THE TECHNOLOGY : Apple iPods and iPhones contain a rechargeable lithium - ion battery , one of the most efficient batteries yet developed .
A lithium battery can carry more than three times the energy of an old - fashioned nickel - cadmium battery .
THE PANIC : Lithium is a pretty reactive element , and if it short - circuits , a lithium - ion battery can heat up rapidly .
This can cause iPhones , iPods , and other electronic devices to explode — the heat makes the display shatter , turning your cool new touchscreen into a blizzard of dangerous shrapnel .
It can also make anything nearby catch fire ; one Dutch man‘s iPhone even burned a hole right through his car ‘s seat .
Every iPhone out there could really be an incendiary bomb in disguise , waiting for the right moment to go off and wreak havoc on techno - geeks and music lovers the world over .
THE REALITY : While lithium batteries have been known to do some unpleasant things , these incidents are , on the whole , incredibly rare .
Only a handful of malfunctions have been reported , out of tens of millions of Apple products sold worldwide every year .
You ‘re probably more likely to win the lottery or get struck by lightning than to have your phone explode .
The Consumer Product Safety Commission investigated the matter , and they have found only fifteen incidents nationwide , none of which caused serious injury .
They concluded that the risk of an accident is “ very low . ”
# 4 – Robots Attack
THE TECHNOLOGY : Workplaces , particularly factories , are becoming increasingly automated .
A large percentage of consumer products are never touched by human hands before they are bought — they are manufactured , assembled , and distributed entirely by robots .
This revolution in production has allowed all of us to lead lives of comparative luxury , with toys undreamt of by nineteenth - century kings .
The Panic :
Once the machine is released , it will chomp up everything in its path – plants , animals , even the bodies of fallen soldiers .
THE PANIC : In April , a Swedish worker was nearly killed by a factory robot while attempting to perform maintenance on it .
He thought that the robot — a machine used for lifting heavy rocks — was turned off , until it grabbed his head and attempted to crush him with its pincer - like robot arms .
He managed to fight it off , but only after suffering four broken ribs and a number of bruises .
Can armies of vengeful Terminators , bent on the annihilation of the human race , be far behind ?
THE REALITY : Factory work is dangerous and it always has been , ever since the Industrial Revolution began two hundred years ago .
Indeed , most workplaces have actually gotten much safer over the years .
As any student of nineteenth - century history will tell you , there used to be no safety regulations at all and people routinely had body parts crushed by machines without warning labels or safety guards .
Robots themselves have been a tremendous help to us , doing the dirty and dangerous work so a human does n‘t have to .
Unsurprisingly , the press does n‘t report on people who do n‘t get hurt .
# 3 – " Sexting "
THE TECHNOLOGY : Cellphones with texting capability , a camera , and a wireless Internet connection have become increasingly ubiquitous over the past five years , with tens of millions in use in the US alone .
THE PANIC : Studies show that millions of people are using these cellphones to take sexually explicit photos of teenagers , and distribute them to their friends .
And the primary allure of the cellphone — its portability and user friendliness — makes it extremely easy to get and send pornographic images of anyone .
Are we in the middle of the biggest child porn epidemic in our nation ‘s history ?
THE REALITY : The vast majority of these “ child pornographers ” are … the teenagers themselves .
Most of the photos are of themselves , their boyfriends , or their girlfriends .
And the recipients of the photos are almost always the other children at school .
Teenagers have always been more sexually active than their parents and teachers would like to think , and the most recent generation is no exception .
However , under child pornography statutes , it makes no difference if you ‘re a teenager , or even if they ‘re pictures of yourself .
It ‘s still a crime , and a number of teens have been brought up on felony sex offender charges just for having such photos stored on their phones .
The Vermont legislature has recently introduced a bill that would legalize these photos as long as the participants are willing and between the ages of 13 and 18 , hopefully bringing some much - needed sanity to this panic .
# 2 – Bombing the Moon
THE TECHNOLOGY : NASA ‘s LCROSS spacecraft , which blasted off in the general direction of the Moon this June , with a mission to confirm the presence of ice in the Moon ‘s shadowy polar regions .
THE PANIC : LCROSS will investigate the Moon , not by landing on it , but by doing something rather more spectacular : smashing a projectile into the Moon ‘s polar region , and then analyzing the resulting debris plume .
Scientists predict that the plume will even be visible from Earth , with a reasonably sized amateur telescope .
When LCROSS launched , there were a number of reports about how NASA was “ bombing the Moon ” in violation of the Outer Space Treaty .
Conspiracy theorists even claim that it ‘s a ploy by the government to antagonize a secret alien base on the far side .
THE REALITY : NASA ‘s “ missile ” is n‘t a bomb , an explosive , a nuke , or indeed anything special at all — it ‘s just an old , burnt - out rocket stage without any fuel left .
It ‘s tiny compared to the Moon : the rocket stage weighs around two tons , while the Moon weighs in at a slightly heftier 73,477,000,000,000,000,000 tons .
And , while it is a violation of international law to put nuclear weapons in space , there ‘s no law against crashing a spacecraft into a celestial body .
It ‘s been standard practice for almost fifty years , from the early days of space exploration in the 1960s , to last June , when Japan ‘s Kaguya probe ended its life with a bang .
# 1 – Flesh Eating Robots
THE TECHNOLOGY : Cyclone Power Technologies ‘ “ Energetically Autonomous Tactical Robot , ” or EATR , a steam - powered robot developed under a grant from the Pentagon and intended for use by the military .
THE PANIC : Engineers hope that EATR will be able to power itself for months at a time by roaming around the battlefield autonomously and consuming “ organic matter ” to feed its engine .
Once the machine is released , it will chomp up everything in its path —- plants , animals , even the bodies of fallen soldiers .
It will relentlessly consume to sate its insatiable thirst for fuel .
It even comes with a chainsaw , perhaps to help it slice us up into more manageable pieces , before it feasts upon our flesh ?
THE REALITY : After the rumors started making their way around the Internet , EATR ‘s designers stepped in to clarify : the “ flesh - eating robot ” will consume vegetable matter only , and it comes equipped with a suite of sensors and computers to help it determine whether the things it comes across are animal , vegetable or neither .
After all , desecration of the dead is against the laws of war and plant matter is a much better fuel source anyway .
There are a lot more bushes to feast upon than human bodies .
Thomas McCabe is a mathematics student at Yale University and a research associate at the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence .
Balducci 's lawyer , Franco Coppi , one of Italy 's highest profile lawyers , said he had no comment on the newest accusations against his client , saying : " We have much more serious things to be concerned with right now , " referring to the corruption charges .
“ Everything that everyone did during those first two heartbreaking weeks will have been for nothing if these patients do n’t get continuing care , ” said Dr. Elizabeth Bellino , a pediatrician based at Tulane University who worked in Haiti right after the earthquake .
In Uganda now on a project , Dr. Bellino , 34 , said she closed her eyes and saw the beaming face of a 12 - year - old Haitian boy named Mystil Jean Wesmer who ended up comforting her when she dissolved into tears .
As she recounts it , Mystil smiled gently and , sensing that she was overwhelmed by the need around her at a field hospital run by Americans , said : “ ‘ Go take care of the sicker kids .
I ’ll be O.K. ’ ”
He himself was waiting to have his leg amputated .
“ All he wanted to know was how he was going to walk to school and church , ” Dr. Bellino said .
“ I said , ‘ Well , we ’ll figure that out . ’
But now I ’m so worried about him , about all the kids . ”
Dr. Pierre , a Haitian - American who is the director of pediatric intensive care at the Brooklyn Hospital Center , said he thought constantly about the patients he left behind , too .
Even as he plans his next trip — he and Dr. Stephen Carryl , the chairman of surgery at his hospital , will be returning with a prosthetics maker — a few memories plague him .
Back in Brooklyn , he still hears the loud , shrill cry of a mother at the moment her small son died of a raging infection on the lawn of a hospital in the Carrefour neighborhood .
The mother and father , one child already lost to the earthquake , had implored Dr. Pierre to help their 4 - year - old , who had been eviscerated by a concrete block and hurriedly stitched back together by a local doctor .
Periodically in this blog , I have written about positive and negative effects of video games .
It is clear that video games can have both positive and negative influences on behavior .
On the negative side , violent video games can lead to more aggressive behavior in general .
On the positive side , playing action video games can make people faster and more accurate in other settings that require complex actions .
Here 's another positive effect of video games .
A paper in the February , 2010 issue of the Journal of and Social Psychology by Tobias Greitemeyer and Silvia Osswald looked at whether video games with positive messages can lead to more positive behaviors .
Not every video game involves violence .
It is possible to create games that have action , but in which the object is to help characters accomplish .
For example , in one study , participants came to a lab and played one of two video games .
The positive video game was City Crisis , which requires the player to fly a helicopter through a city to rescue people from buildings and to chase criminals .
The game was exciting without promoting wanton violence .
The neutral game used for comparison was Tetris , in which players have to fit geometric blocks into a well .
The participants in the study played these games while a female experimenter looked on .
After a while , a male confederate entered the room and played the role of an ex-boyfriend of the experimenter .
He started harassing the women , saying that the woman had been ignoring him and that now she would have to talk to him .
He talked loudly and kicked a trash can .
If the participant made no move to help ( such as saying something to the man or looking for another experimenter ) , the man left after 2 minutes .
The measure of interest was whether the video game player helped the woman .
When people were playing the video game that involved helping other characters , over 55 % of them chose to help the woman .
When people were playing the neutral game , fewer than 25 % helped the woman .
The authors report four studies overall in this paper that suggest that people are more likely to be helpful when playing video games that promote positive behaviors than when playing either games that are neutral or violent .
To examine why people might be more helpful when playing positive video games , one study asked people to list all the thoughts they had while playing the games .
People playing the positive video game wrote more thoughts related to helping than people who played neutral games .
In addition , the number of these helpful thoughts predicted how likely people were to help later in the study .
So , this research suggests that playing video games that involve being helpful can promote helpful behaviors beyond the video games .
Of course , in the end the difficulty is getting people to play video games with these positive messages .
But at least there is research to suggest that if people do play these games , it does have a positive effect on their behavior later .
Syria has turned down a planned visit to a research reactor in Damascus by UN nuclear inspectors trying to shed light on possible covert atomic activity in the country , diplomats said on Wednesday .
Syria told the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) in a letter that the visit could not take place due to preparations for the IAEA 's 35 - nation Board of Governors meeting , which starts on Monday .
The letter was dated Feb. 18 , the same day as the IAEA issued its latest report on Syria , but reached the agency on Tuesday , a diplomat close to the IAEA said .
This did not give the agency enough warning as it had planned the inspection also for Tuesday .

Kurt Cobain left a drug rehab center in Marina Del Rey California on April 1 , 1994 and was later reported missing .
As you probably know , he was found dead just seven days later .
My name is Tom Grant .
I am a retired private investigator and former detective with the Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department .
To read Tom Grant 's profesional biography , click on photo below .
On April 3 , 1994 , while conducting business as a California State licensed private investigator , I was hired by Courtney Love ( who was in Los Angeles at the time ) , to locate her husband after he left a drug rehab center in Marina Del Rey , California .
Ms. Love stayed in Los Angeles while I flew to Seattle to search for Cobain with his best friend Dylan Carlson .
In fact , Carlson and I had been in the Cobain residence the night before Kurt 's body was discovered in the room above the garage .
The police immediately concluded " suicide . "
I was n't so sure .
Neither was Rosemary Carroll , Courtney Love 's own entertainment attorney .
Ms. Carroll was also a close friend to both Courtney and Kurt .
We both knew something was terribly wrong here .
After several months of intensive investigation , including dozens of taped interviews with Cobain 's closest friends and family members , I reached the conclusion that Courtney Love and Michael Dewitt , ( the male nanny who lived at the Cobain residence ) , were involved in a conspiracy that resulted in the murder of Kurt Cobain .
It appears this was not the first attempt on Cobain 's life by Courtney Love , however , it was obviously the first to succeed .
In December of 1994 , I began speaking publicly about the suspicious circumstances surrounding Cobain 's death .
Facing the potential consequences of exposure , Courtney Love , her wealthy and powerful friends , her attorney 's and the symbiotic " rock press " have engaged in an effort to keep the public from learning the true facts about Kurt 's death .
These are people who are motivated by profit rather than truth .
Courtney 's attorneys have consistently threatened those in various media outlets with " potential lawsuits " if these journalists were to give me a platform from which to discuss my investigation of the Cobain Case .
As I predicted when I first began telling the public about the details of my investigation more than 21 years ago , no legal , criminal or civil , action has ever been taken against myself or anyone in the media who has covered this story .
In spite of the hot air they 've been blowing all these years , this investigation has received coverage in hundreds of major newspapers , magazines , television and radio talk shows around the globe .
The pathetic cowards of this world can only blow smoke .
Once they 've been exposed , they run and hide .
Faqir Mohammed , the leader of the Taliban in Bajaur and the deputy leader of the Movement of the Taliban in Pakistan .
Unconfirmed reports from Pakistan indicate that a senior al Qaeda military commander and a top Taliban leader have been killed during airstrikes earlier today in the Mohmand tribal agency .
Pakistani military officials claimed that Qari Zia Rahman and Faqir Mohammed were among 30 Taliban and foreign fighters killed during helicopter and airstrikes in the Pindyali region in Mohmand , The Nation reported .
A commander named Fateh was also killed , according to Geo News .
Faqir Mohammed is the leader of the Taliban in the Bajaur tribal agency ; he is also the second in command of the Tehreek - e - Taliban Pakistan , or the Movement of the Taliban in Pakistan , the group founded by South Waziristan leader Baitullah Mehsud and thought to be led by Hakeemullah Mehsud .
Faqir is a close ally of al Qaeda and of its second in command , Ayman al Zawahiri , who is known to have sheltered in Bajaur in the past .
Qari Zia Rahman is an al Qaeda leader who operates in Pakistan ’s Bajaur tribal agency as well as in Afghanistan ’s Nuristan and Kunar provinces , where the Taliban control most of districts .
He is allied with Faqir Mohammed , the leader of the Taliban in Bajaur , as well as with Osama bin Laden .
Rahman ’s fighters are from Chechnya , Uzbekistan , Turkmenistan , Afghanistan , and various Arab nations .
He commands a brigade in al Qaeda ’s paramilitary Shadow Army , or the Lashkar al Zil , US intelligence officials have told The Long War Journal .

Today ’s strikes took place just one day after Pakistani fighter - bombers and helicopters attacked Taliban forces in the Safi region in Mohmand in retaliation for an attack on a military checkpoint .
More than 200 Taliban fighters overran a military checkpoint and killed a Frontier Corps soldier .
The military also claimed 30 Taliban fighters were killed in the attacks .
The casualties in both strikes cannot be independently confirmed as the military bars reporters from the tribal areas .
Faqir and the Bajaur Taliban are thought to have entered Mohmand after the Pakistani military took over the stronghold of Damadola .
The military said it seized more than 150 cave and bunker complexes , and killed 75 Taliban fighters during the assault .
Major General Tariq Khan , the leader of the Frontier Corps , claimed the Taliban leadership has been decimated and the movement has been defeated .
Khan made an identical claim of Taliban defeat in March 2009 , however .
In the past , the Pakistani military has claimed that Faqir and Rahman have been killed in other strikes .
In June 2009 , Rahman was reported killed during a battle with Pakistani forces in the Charmang region of Bajaur .
In August 2008 , the military claimed Faqir was killed while transporting weapons near Khar , the main town in Bajaur .
The current reports of Faqir and Rahman ’s deaths come as six top leaders of the Afghan Taliban ’s Quetta Shura , or executive leadership council , have been detained in Pakistan .
The Pakistani military and government have previously denied that the Quetta Shura existed and said no senior Afghan Taliban leaders were present in Pakistan .

This story , originally published in our April 1960 issue of Scientific American , is being made available as a supplement to the April 2010 issue 50 , 100 , 150 Years Ago feature .
The State of Israel has undertaken to create a new agriculture in an old and damaged land .
The 20th century Israelites did not find their promised land " Rowing with milk and honey , " as their forebears did 3,300 years ago .
They came to a land of encroaching sand dunes along a once - verdant coast , of malarial swamps and naked limestone hills from which an estimated three feet of topsoil had been scoured , sorted and spread as sterile overwash upon the plains or swept out to sea in Rood waters that time after time turned the beautiful blue of the Mediterranean to a dirty brown as far as the horizon .
The land of Israel had shared the fate of land throughout the Middle East .
A decline in productivity , in population and in culture had set in with the fading of the Byzantine Empire some 1,300 years ago .
The markers of former forest boundaries on treeless slopes and the ruins of dams , aqueducts and terraced irrigation works , of cities , bridges and paved highways - all bore witness that the land had once supported a great civilization with a much larger population in a higher state of well - being .
Last year , as a finale to the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the State of Israel , an international convention brought 485 farmers from 37 countries to see what had been accomplished .
They found a nation of two million people , whose numbers had doubled in the decade , principally by immigration .
Yet Israel was already an exporter of agricultural produce and had nearly achieved the goal of agricultural self - sufficiency , with an export / import balance in foodstuffs .
It had more than doubled its cultivated land , to a million acres .
It had drained 44,000 acres of marshland and extended irrigation to 325,000 acres ; it had increased many - fold the supply of underground water from wells and was far along on the work of diverting and utilizing the scant surface waters .
On vast stretches of uncultivable land it had established new range - cover to support a growing livestock industry and planted 37 million trees in new forests and shelter belts .
All this had been accomplished under a national plan that enlisted the devotion of the citizens and the best understanding and technique provided by modern agricultural science .
Israel is not simply restoring the past but seeking full utilization of the land , including realization of potentialities that were unknown to the ancients .
For the visiting farmers , many of whom came from the newer and less developed nations of the world , the example of Israel was a proof and a promise .
Civilization is in a race with famine .
The doubt as to the outcome is due not so much to the limitations of the earth 's resources , plundered as they are , but to a lag in the uptake of progressive agricultural practices and failure in the distribution of the present output of food .
More than two thirds of the people of the world are undernourished .
Most of them live in the lands where mankind has lived longest in organized societies .
There , with few exceptions , the soil is in the worst condition .
The example of Israel shows that the land can be reclaimed and that increase in the food supply can overtake the population increase that will double the 2,800 - million world population before the end of this century .
Israel is a pilot area for the arid lands of the world , especially those of her Arab neighbors , who persist in their destitution in the same landscape that Israel has brought into blossom .
The achievement of Israel is the more remarkable for the fact that politics showed little regard for the logic of terrain and watershed in setting the boundaries of the state .
The 7,815 square miles allocated to Israel in the 1948 partition of Palestine make a narrow strip of land along the eastern shore of the Mediterranean , roughly 265 miles long and 12 to 70 miles wide .
It comprises only part of the Jordan River Valley , the principal watercourse of the region , with its three lakes : Lake Huleh , 230 feet above sea level at the northern end ; the Sea of Galilee , nine miles to the south and 680 feet below sea level ; and the Dead Sea , 65 miles farther south and 1,290 feet below sea level .
More than half of Israel 's territory is occupied by true desert or near desert , and the principal agricultural acreage lies on the narrow coastal plain , on the northern uplands and on the western slope of the Jordan Valley from Lake Huleh downstream to 25 miles below the Sea of Galilee , where Israel 's boundary comes down to the river .
This division of territory and the persistent hostility of Israel 's Arab neighbors continue to frustrate programs to realize the full benefits of the water supply to all concerned in a region where water is scarce .
Climatically Israel much resembles California .
Rains come in winter , and the summers are long and dry .
Moreover , the erratic rainfall varies considerably from one end of the country to the other , from an average of 42 inches in the north , to 26 inches at Jerusalem , to less than two inches at Eilat on the Gulf of Aqaba at the foot of the desert of the Negev .
Temperatures range to similar extremes over short distances , being cool at high elevations and hot and tropical in the Jordan Valley .
In the spring a hot , dry wind , called the khamsin , may blow for days at a time out of the desert to the east , with calamitous effect upon unprotected crops .
Harsh as these conditions are , there has been no significant deterioration in climate since Roman times .
The same plants still thrive in protected places , and springs recorded in the Bible still bubble from the ground .
The " desert " that took over the once - flourishing land was the work of man , not of nature .
Fortunately one geologic feature operates in favor of the conservation of rainfall ; the porous limestone of the landscape absorbs a high percentage of the rain and distributes the water widely from the regions of heaviest fall through labyrinthine aquifers underground .
The total discharge from springs exceeds the flow of the Jordan : a single great spring near the foothills of Judea gives rise to the Yarkon River .
Another important source of water , the heavy summer dew , helps crops to grow in the uplands .
The agricultural restoration of Israel began in the 1880's , with the arrival of the first immigrants brought by the emergent Zionist movement as refugees from the pogroms of Eastern Europe .
They were able to buy " useless " marshland on the coastal plain .
These marshes had been created by the shoaling of erosion - laden streams and by the damming effect of the inland march of sand dunes .
With heroic labor the early settlers succeeded in draining the marshes and farming them successfully .
But until the State of Israel was established , the effort was on a " first aid " basis .
When the new government set out to frame a comprehensive program for the development of the country 's soil and water resources , it could call upon a number of outstanding authorities among its own citizens : specialists in forestry , horticulture , soil science , plant breeding and civil engineering who had come as refugees from Germany and Central Europe .
But with a major portion of its expanding population coming from the Arab countries of North Africa and the Near East , Israel did not have enough experts in the many disciplines needed to establish a modern agriculture in short order .
The government therefore was among the first to draw upon the technical assistance offered by the specialized agencies of the United Nations and by the " Point Four " program of the U. S. I had the rewarding experience of sharing in this work as a member of missions that served in Israel under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the U. N. from 195 1 to 1953 , consulting in the establishment of a national program of land development and in building up a staff of men to carry it out ; and again from 1955 to 1957 helping to build a department of agricultural engineering at Technion , the Israeli institute of technology .
The first order of business , begun in 1951 and completed in 1953 , was the taking of a comprehensive inventory of the land .
This comprises the 2.38 million acres north of the 60th parallel , about half the territory of Israel , where major agricultural development is possible .
One of the most thorough inventories of its kind in the world , it furnished a secure foundation for land use policy and for the immense task of reclamation and water development that has followed .
Classification of the inventoried land by end - use shows that , given adequate water supply , about 40 per cent , or a million acres , can be made suitable for general cultivation ; about 15 per cent for orchard , vineyard , pasture and other use that will keep a permanent plant cover on the soil ; 20 percent for natural pasture without irrigation ; and 25 percent for forests , parks and wasteland .
Outside the area of detailed survey , in the Negev , an extensive reconnaissance has projected a program for range development and for the cultivation of forage crops in those areas where the scant winter runoff can be diverted or impounded to support irrigation .
A major feature of the land inventory was the classification of the lands according to their relative exposure to erosion by wind and water .
In the hands of the Israeli Soil Conservation Service this has served as a blueprint for measures to preserve the best soils and ultimately to reclaim land now unusable .
The hazard of erosion increases in geometrical ratio with increase in the gradient of the soil .
The first line of defense is directed against the dynamics of the falling raindrop and includes measures of soil management that are also required for sustained crop yields such as the build - up of organic matter to increase the water - holding capacity of the soil and the use of crop litter to absorb the energy and reduce the splash - erosion of the raindrop .
Contour plowing and the planting of crops in strips along the contour provide the second line of defense and usually suffice against the hazards of moderate storms .
These defenses can be set up by the individual farmer or farm cooperative and are everywhere encouraged through education and demonstration by the Soil Conservation Service .
But rains in Israel characteristically come in downpours , in a few heavy storms during the rainy season and in extreme storms every few years .
Where such rains overtax the first two lines of defense , more elaborate and costly measures must be designed and laid out by soil - conservation engineers of the Soil Conservation Service .
Slopes must be broken by broad base terraces to pick up and slow storm runoff and the terraces must be interconnected by waterways to keep the accumulated water from cutting gullies through the fields .
Storm waters are then available for storage in surface ponds and reservoirs or to recharge ground waters .
This line of defense must be accurately and adequately engineered , for running waters do not forgive a mistake or oversight in design .
One of the effects of man-induced erosion in the past was the creation of marshes on the narrow coastal plain , notably at Hadera , Kabri and in the Jezreel Valley .
Carrying through the work started by the early settlers , Israel has now fully reclaimed these lands , draining and planting them to eucalyptus trees in the lowest spots and to citrus groves and crops on the higher ground .
A more substantial engineering challenge was presented by the marshlands of the Huleh basin at the head of the Jordan Valley .
In Roman times and before , this region was fertile and thickly populated , but it had become a dismal swamp and a focus of malarial infection to the country at large .
Sediments from the uplands to the north had progressively filled in the northern end of Lake Huleh , thus creating a marsh that was overgrown with papyrus .
The marshes have now been drained by widening and deepening the mouth of the lake to bring down its water level and by a system of drainage canals .
With the papyrus cleared away , the deep deposit of peat beneath yields richly to cultivation , much as do the delta peat - lands at the head of San Francisco Bay .
The Huleh Reclamation Authority estimates that this little Garden of Eden will support a population of 100,000 in an intensive agricultural economy , cultivating vegetables , grapes , fruits , peanuts , grains , sugar cane , rice - even fish ( in ponds impounded on the old lake bed ) .
The yield of fruits and vegetables will soon require the installation of processing and canning plants on the spot .
Another gain achieved by the reclamation of this land is the conservation of water ; the reduction of the evaporation surface of the lake and surrounding marshes will save enough water to irrigate 17,000 to 25,000 acres of land , depending on the rainfall of the district to which these waters will be delivered .
The Huleh Drainage and Irrigation Project is not great in size , but it symbolizes the determination of Israel to make the most of its resources .
The development of water supplies and irrigation constitutes the most significant achievement of the new nation and differentiates its agriculture most sharply from that which prevails in all but a few areas in the surrounding Arab countries .
Since the time of Abraham , when " there was famine in the land , " agriculture in this region has been at the mercy of the variable winter rainfall .
In ancient Palestine irrigation was limited to small areas that could be fed by gravity from perennial springs .
These works had long since fallen into disuse , and at the beginning of this century very little of the Holy Land was irrigated .
In 10 years the State of Israel has quadrupled the acreage under irrigation , from 72,500 to 325,000 acres .
It was this achievement that made possible the absorption of the great influx of immigrants .
Irrigation has increased yields per acre from three to six times and more over those achieved by dry farming in the region and has secured dependable yields from year to year .
With most of the water coming from wells , irrigation in Israel is accomplished by sprinkling , rather than by furrow or border ditch .
The grid of pumps and pipes delivers the water under pressure but at low rates of flow .
Irrigation engineers soon found that sprinkling was best adapted to this mode of delivery and for application of the water to sandy soils and to rougher , stony land unsuited for leveling .
The high investment in pumps and piping has been more than offset by the intensive year - round cultivation made possible by irrigation and by the urgent need to settle immigrants in self - supporting activity on the lands .
Each year from 25,000 to 30,000 additional acres are being brought under irrigation , and the prospect is that this will continue until the limit of water supply is reached .
Meanwhile extensive field research is devoted to achieving the most efficient use of water .
In the northern Negev , for example , it has been found that about six inches of irrigation water , applied just before the winter rains to soak the soil to its water - holding capacity down to a depth of about four feet , will make up the equivalent of 20 inches of rainfall , sufficient for winter grain .
In many soils irrigation raises a serious drainage problem .
Evaporation from the soil and transpiration by crops in the " consumptive " use of the water leave behind the salts it carries in solution .
After a few years the accumulation of salts may reach toxic proportions .
Certain crops , such as sugar beets , take up some salts and may be planted in rotation to reduce this accumulation .
But whatever the crop , drainage must be provided in time to leach away the salts , and the chemical composition of the soil must be kept under surveillance .
To bring much of the land under irrigation and cultivation has required strenuous repair of the damage don e by centuries of erosion .
The slopes in stony soils are typically covered by an " erosion pavement " made up of stones too heavy to be moved by rain splash and by the sheet flow of the storm runoff that carried away the topsoil .
In some parts of the country , farmers have raked these stones from the fields and piled them into great heaps .
'''' here erosion has exposed the rock or gullied the deep soils beyond plowing , the land has been put to some lower use , such as rough pasture or woodlot .
In many parts of the highlands modern farmers have been able to take advantage of the soil - conservation works of the ancient Phoenicians .
My own investigations indicate that the Phoenicians , 3,000 to 4,000 years ago , were the first people in the Middle East to clear and cultivate mountain slopes under rainfall agriculture and so were the first to encounter soil erosion .
They were also the first to control soil erosion by using the principle of the contour and by building stone walls to convert a slope into a series of level benches .
Most of these ancient terraces had been allowed to fall in ruins .
Today they are being reconstructed and redesigned .
Since the terraces are narrow and so suited only to hand labor , the practice is to collect the stones from old terrace walls and to pile them into ridges spaced more widely apart on the contour , creating terraces with gentle gradients for cultivation by tractor - drawn farm implements .
Under sprinkler irrigation the new terraces are proving to be favorable sites for vineyards and orchards .
Over the large stretches of the country that are beyond such reclamation and are too dry for forests , the effort is to develop the land for pasture .
Throughout the Near and Middle East and North Africa the land has been overgrazed for more than 1,000 years .
What sheep will not eat , goats will , and what the goats leave , camels will graze .
By the time these hardy animals have ranged over the land through the long , hot , rainless summer , there is little plant cover left to protect the soil from the winter rains .
But if one may judge by the relict species of forage grasses and plants that survive in rocky places and thorn thickets beyond the reach of goats and camels , it may be surmised that this lan d was once a pastoral paradise .
The prompt return of a good cover of grasses and herbs after the goats were removed from the land by the Israeli Government in 1948 confirms this appraisal .
The Soil Conservation Service has since been reseeding the range with native plants and with species imported from the U. S. and South Africa .
In addition , certain woody bushes and low trees are being planted to hold the soil and furnish browse for livestock ; the rich beans of the hardy carob tree , for example , yield as much feed as an equal planting of barley .
Measures to divert and spread the storm waters over the pastures are further increasing the yield .
Herds of beef and dairy cattle are now beginning to multiply on the restored range .
Early in the Jewish immigration to Israel the planting of trees came to be a symbol of faith in the future .
Afforestation now plays a central role in the control of erosion , in reclamation of stony hills and in sheltering orchards and garden plots from the winds , whether from the sea or the desert .
Some 250 million trees , both native and imported species selected by the Israeli Forest Experiment Station , are to be planted in the next 10 years .
The growing of stock in the nurseries and the planting of trees on uncultivated hillsides , on roadsides , in shelter belts and on sand dunes provides interim employment for new immigrants until they become .
established .
Already the new stands are yielding timber , poles and fuel products - valuable commodities in a deforested land .
The land inventory has served to protect the best agricultural lands from being engulfed by the growing cities and towns of Israel .
Along the coast , for example , the communities have been encouraged to expand their boundaries into the sand dunes rather than into surrounding cultivable land .
The dunes comprise 10 per cent of the coastal land and ; under the drag of the prevailing westerly winds , are overwhelming good land , orchards and even houses .
Experiments are under way to hold the shifting dunes by stabilizing the sand surface and by aggregating sand grains into crumb structures .
This is accomplished by plantings of hardy shrubs and sand grasses , and of such fibrous - rooted plants as alfalfa , with water supplied to some tracts by sewage effluent and partially rectified sewage water .
The rapid growth of the plants where this has been tried converts the sand in a few years into a stable soil - like material suited to the planting of trees and even some crops .
But the full reclamation of the dunes to agricultural use is still in the research stage .
Ultimately the expansion of agriculture is limited by the availability of water .
The Israeli Water Planning Agency is seeking to double the 1956 water supply by 1966 , giving the country a total of 14.5 million acre feet ( an acre foot is 12 inches of water per acre ) per year .
A central feature of the plan derives from a survey that I conducted in 1938 and 1939 for the U. S. Department of Agriculture and from the proposal , growing out of that survey , of a Jordan Valley Authority to achieve the fullest development of the surface and underground waters of the valley for the entire original Mandate under the League of Nations , including what is now the Kingdom of Jordan as well as Israel .
That proposal called for the development of ground waters and diversion of the upper Jordan waters within Israel to the dry lands in the south and for the diversion of the waters of the Yarmuk River to the eastern side of the Jordan Valley for irrigation of a promising subtropical region in Transjordan .
In order to replace the flow of these rivers into the Dead Sea , salt water was to be brought in from the Mediterranean Sea through canals and tunnels to drop through two sets of hydropower stations nearly 1,300 feet below sea level to the Dead Sea .
This salt water would not only produce electric power but also would maintain the level of the Dead Sea for the extraction of the minerals and chemicals that are there in fabulous amounts .
The plan was declared feasible by an international consulting board of engineers .
All parts of the plan that do not require the collaboration of the adjoining Arab states are now being carried out by the Israeli Government .
The prestressed - concrete sections of the main 108 - inch pipeline that will carry upper Jordan water down as far as the Negev are now being fabricated and set in place in a great trench , and the tunnels to carry it through intervening hills are under construction .
Beyond this major undertaking the country is conserving for use and reuse such minor flows of water as are represented by the sewage of its cities and the runoff of intermittent streams along the coast .
In the southern Negev , where the annual rainfall is less than six inches , the Soil Conservation Service is adopting the methods of ancient Nabataeans to impound the waters of flash floods for the irrigation of forage crops .
Prospects for the future have recently been brightened by progress in the desalting of sea water .
A new method developed in the laboratories of the Government is about to be tested in two pilot plants , each with an output of 250,000 gallons per day .
Success in this undertaking would be a major victory not only for Israel but also for all the other arid - land countries of the world .
On the anvil of adversity the State and people of Israel have been hammering out solutions to problems that other nations must sooner or later face up to .
There are no more continents left to explore or to exploit .
The best lands of the earth are occupied and in use .
All of them , to a greater or lesser extent , need the same measures of reclamation and conservation that have succeeded so well in Israel .
The frontiers of today are the lands under our feet .
A Transportation Security Administration employee in Florida is behind bars this weekend after a 15 - year - old girl claimed he groped her and asked if she would be his “ sex slave , ” according to published reports .
Charles Henry Bennett , a 57 - year - old TSA worker at Orlando International Airport , is being held without bail after he reportedly confessed to a version of the described events , even acknowledging his shocking request .
The girl was allegedly 13 at the time .
According to a police report discussed in area media , Bennett allegedly grabbed the girl ’s breasts from behind and solicited her .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It ’s unclear exactly where the alleged abuse took place and how Bennett and the girl met , because the arrest report detailing the abuse is heavily redacted , ” local news site Florida Today noted .
The arrest was a product of an investigation initiated after the state ’s Department of Children and Families was informed of the girl ’s allegations , the publication added .
Multiple news agencies cited Bennett ’s MySpace page , but none linked readers directly to it .
On the page attributed to Bennett , text describes him as “ a BDSM Master ” with “ many years experience in the lifestyle and as a trainer . ”
BDSM is an acronym commonly used to refer to sexual fetishes that fall in the bondage , dominance , submission and masochism categories .
“ I am very open minded n expect the same from friends .
I enjoy meeting new ppl in the lifestyle and those that r curious , ” the page adds , concluding that its owner is searching for “ Submissive females ” .

“ Police said the girl was reluctant to provide specific details about the incident and appeared sullen , ” NBC affiliate WESH 2 in Orlando reported .
“ They said she also expressed sorrow at the prospect of Bennett being arrested .
While she did not report any other episodes of abuse , she did not deny other acts of sexual assault occurred , the police report said . ”

Ryan ( left ) will stay as club president after buying Hicks out Liverpool Football Club co-owner Tom Hicks has agreed to sell his controlling interest in Major League Baseball side the Texas Rangers .
The Hicks Sports Group , owners since 1998 , is selling to a group headed by legendary former Rangers pitcher Nolan Ryan and lawyer Chuck Greenberg .
The final sale price is thought to be in excess of $ 500 m ( £ 310.3 m ) .
But the deal must first be approved by Major League Baseball ( MLB ) and Hicks Sports Group 's creditors .
MLB rules require that the agreement must be reviewed by its ownership committee and approved by 75 % of the 30 team owners .
The Rangers - who were owned by a group led by former US President George W. Bush in the early 1990s before he became governor of Texas - hope that the deal may be completed before the new MLB season starts on 5 April .
606 : DEBATE
Shame him and Gillett wo n't sell Liverpool
supershinakuma
" It 's a complex business deal that positions the franchise positively for the future , " Hicks said in a statement .
Hall of Fame pitcher Ryan 's total of 5,714 strikeouts in his 27 - year career with Texas , the New York Mets , California Angels and Houston Astros is a major league record .
As well as having ownership interests in two of Houston 's minor league affiliates , Ryan took over as the Rangers ' club president in 2008 and will continue in that role .
Greenberg , who owns two minor league teams himself , is set to take over as managing general partner and chief executive officer .
In a separate transaction , the Hicks - controlled Ballpark Real Estate has agreed to sell or transfer roughly 153 of the 195 acres it owns surrounding the Rangers and Dallas Cowboys stadiums to the Greenberg - Ryan group .
Hicks bought Liverpool along with co-owner George Gillett in March 2007 , but the Premier League club has taken on a large level of debt which has seen the two Americans criticised by some supporters ' groups .
Last year , Gillett agreed to sell his 80 % stake in the Montreal Canadiens NHL ice hockey team to help ease the financial pressure on the Anfield club .
However , Hicks says he intends to retain ownership of his NHL team , the Dallas Stars , which he has owned since 1996 .

New York Movie Map : The Answers
First of all , thanks to everyone who enjoyed the New York Movie Map , spread the cheer around , and especially ordered one !
It went gangbusters over the last week and took my site down three times with all the traffic , so , that was fun .
Hey order yours here wooo !
One thing that struck me while I was working on this thing was how often I ’d see the World Trade Center pop up .
It made sense , since a whopping 71 out of the 91 movies were released before 9/11 , and showing the WTC was just a stock way of saying , “ hey , we ’re in New York now ” .
You can probably imagine , though , that each time I saw it I raised an eyebrow .
Interestingly , there ai n’t a lot of notable scenes that happen there ( Snake Plisskin lands a glider on top of one of the towers in Escape from New York , and the 1976 King Kong climbs it , but I had fine alternatives for both ) , so it was n’t that tough of a decision to leave the WTC off the map .
There was surprisingly little complaining about movies I screwed up or left out , so I ’m pretty pleased with myself , but the most common gripe was that I left out the other boroughs and the upper part of Manhattan .
Like I either half - assed it , forgot about , or wanted to take a dump on all the fine folks that do n’t live in the exact epicenter of the universe .
Look , I grew up in Queens , went to school on E. 94th , and lived out in Brooklyn so I know what it ’s like to be neglected by pop media .
And that ’s just it – blame Hollywood , not me .
These roughly 12 square miles of Manhattan is where THEY put everything .
If I included all of NYC , or even just upper Manhattan , there ’d be a ton of wasted space where relatively little ’s happening and it ’d reduce the impact .
I had to make it work as a visual piece and not just as a reference .
So it made sense to focus on where most of the action is concentrated .
I do n’t think anyone really needs to see it go all the way up to Inwood or down to * cough *
Staten Island just for the sake .
I ’m still going through all the answer submissions I ’ve gotten over the last week ; if you won you ’ll be hearing from me by email within the next 2 days !
And with this , the submission deadline is over … because HEY LOOK THE ANSWERS …

British police are investigating the verbal attack on Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon after an Oxford University student shouted “ slaughter the Jews ” during a talk he gave at the university on Monday night .
During the event , hosted by the university ’s Student Union , a Muslim student , who had been heckling the deputy foreign minister , got up and shouted in Arabic “ Itbah Al - Yahud ” – “ slaughter the Jews ” as he was leaving the lecture hall .
The incident was referred to the police on Tuesday .
Thames Valley Police confirmed on Wednesday that they had received a complaint and were considering a charge of racially aggravated public disorder .
A police spokesman toldthey were taking the matter “ very seriously , ” that they were at the very early stages of investigation and that no arrests had yet been made .
The university has promised to look into the incident once the police have completed their investigation .
“ Our policy is always to await the outcome of police investigations where criminal offenses are alleged , and to look at any internal disciplinary process after the police have finished their investigation , ” an Oxford University spokesperson told the .
“ So we will await the outcome .
We abhor racism but obviously now this is in police hands we cannot comment on the individual case .
” The Oxford University Student Union released the following statement condemning the disturbances at the event and distancing itself from the individual .
“ Whilst the vast majority of the audience behaved in an orderly and responsible fashion , some members continually interrupted the speech and one individual in particular appears to have made a directly anti-Semitic remark .
These individuals exceeded the principles of free speech that the Society upholds .
They and their remarks are not representative of this Society , nor the vast majority of the audience .
The Oxford Union will not tolerate this kind of behavior by its members .
" The president of the Student Union , Stuart Cullen , has launched an investigation to identify the members who disrupted the event .
“ The Union will be taking disciplinary action against these members , in accordance with the Society ’s rules .
The president praised the work of the security and local police on the night and expressed his gratitude for their help , as well as that of the Israeli embassy , in coordinating the event .
“ The Oxford Union believes in the rights of free speech and protecting our invited speakers ' ability to express themselves in an orderly and disciplined environment .
We further believe that our members have the right to challenge and question the speakers in keeping with the Society 's expectations of good conduct .
” Ayalon had considered pressing charges before police began their investigation .
“ This demonstrates our new policy on hatred and racism and we will have zero tolerance for anti-Semitism , something that should have happened a long time ago , ” said the deputy foreign minister .
Ayalon received a hostile reception at the university and was heckled throughout his talk by accusations of “ war crimes ” and racism .
Another student carrying a Palestinian flag tried to approach the platform from which Ayalon was speaking and was led out by security staff .
At a demonstration outside the lecture hall , organized by the university ’s Palestine Society , protesters chanted , “ From the river to the sea , Palestine will be free .
” Speaking to a partly hostile audience , Ayalon took a number of hostile questions and received applause at the end .
Ayalon said that after the event , several students approached him thanking him for providing a narrative they said they had never heard before .
“ Comments like these show proof that the narrative on campuses have been hijacked by those who have a hatred for not only Israel but also Jews , ” said Ashley Perry , Ayalon ’s media adviser .
“ The event also proved that if the Israeli narrative is explained in a calm matter , as the deputy minister did , then we can increase understanding among those who have not ever been exposed to another narrative . ”
As predicted by the weather forecasters the start of the second pre-season formula one test at the southern Spanish track Jerez was a wet one .
Apart from an hour of dry running at the start of the day , it was wet and damp all day long with teams using a mix of extreme wets and intermediate tyres .
So basically , an unexciting day that does n’t tell us fans that much at all .
But the eagerly anticipated new car from Red Bull was launched today , surely that was exciting ?
No , it was quite a low key affair and Red Bull seem to be lacking confidence in their new car .
Take no meaning from the quick times from today as they were set very early on and most teams had not done much running .
The times in the wet from the different teams appeared to be ( as we do n’t know fuel levels ) quite similar .
Williams launched a live internet timing service available here : http://www.attwilliams.com/test-timings.
A screen shot is shown below and displays the fastest times produced today ( one exception – Glock in his Virgin Racing car did one lap in 1 min 38 seconds ) .
What you need to know about today :
It was wet and not very exciting
Nico “ The Hulk ” Hulkenberg completed 118 laps in his Williams – the car is proving reliable and he is getting good car time to be ready to compete in Bahrain
Virgin Racing were the first “ new ” team to test , although they only managed to do a 3 or so laps .
Glock ’s first out lap was very tail happy and he came straight back in and was not seen again until near the end of the session .
Webber ’s Red Bull completed only 50 laps as he had an oil leak that caused his car to stop on track and red flag the session .
He tried to cover the diffuser with his helmet and gloves !
That was at around midday and only reappeared at the very end of the session
Rosberg was quickest in his Mercedes – he had a mechanical problem right at the end of the day
Buemi in the Toro Rosso was 2nd quickest and did around 90 laps today
Alonso in the Ferrari completed 88 laps without any problems , confirming their reliability
The Force India ’s first appearance was a good one with no problems encountered
Here are some photos from today :
There have been some grumblings and mumblings around the comments section here at MHH about Paul Stastny needing to step up and contribute more to the success of the team .
People have opined that he is n't earning his $ 6.6 million contract ( FYI , all of the contracts I 'm discussing are in terms of cap hit , not year - by - year payouts ) .
I 've had SoS on my keeper league roster for a couple of seasons now and have a fairly good grasp of his statistical value , so I figured I 'd take a closer look at his performance and compare it to his contemporaries .
First up , how is he looking in terms of career track :
2006 -2007 : 28 goals , 50 assists in 82 games for a 0.951 PPG average .
2007 -2008 : 24 goals , 47assists in 66 games for a 1.076 PPG average .
2008 -2009 : 11 goals , 25 assists in 45 games for a 0.8 PPG average .
Those three seasons average out to an average of 0.959 PPG or 0.33 goals per game and 0.63 assists per game .
This season : 10 goals , 35 assists in 49 games for a 0.918 PPG average ( 0.2 goals per game and 0.71 assists per game ) .
This projects out to about 17 goals and 59 assists for the season .
That would put his season PPG at 0.927 .
Perhaps a tick off of his career average , but he'd set a new personal best for assists if that projection holds up .
Assuming ( for the sake of argument ) that his season ends with that 0.927 PPG , that would be about $ 87 k per point .
That 's a purely stats and cash analysis which has none of his intangibles , like his ability to elevate the play of any warm body put on his line , his two - way play , or the fact that he has taken more face - offs than anybody in the league .
Now let 's see how he stacks up against his contemporaries ...
Stastny currently ranks 14th among NHL centermen for points .
In order to keep this to a truly contemporary argument , let 's compare him to other centers within 2 years of his age with 3 - 5 years of full - time NHL experience .
SoS is a spry 24 years of age with three previous NHL seasons under his belt .
Here 's how the short list looks :
All the cap hit numbers were taken from nhlnumbers.com .
The first thing that jumps out on SoS 's statline in comparison to the other inhabitants of this list is his assists ( 1st ) .
The second is his plus / minus ( tied for 2nd ) .
His 10 goals are the lowest among his contemporaries , but outside of Crosby , nobody has cracked 20 goals so it 's not a huge distraction .
One or two posts go the other way and he 's right in the thick of things .
The dollars - per - point over the course of an 82 - game season column ( the last one ) shows that the Avalanche are getting pretty decent value for their buck when compared to some of the guys above and below Stastny on the list .
However , comparing his production vs. salary to guys like Koivu , Zajac , and Laich ( career high of 67 , 62 , and 53 points respectively ) , Crosby ( generational talent making mad $ $ ) , or Richards ( retarded infinity contract to spread out the cap hit ) is n't necessarily apples - to - apples .
So let 's look closer at Kopitar , Kesler , Weiss , and Horton ( players with similar PPG rates this season ) .
Stastny matches up almost 1 - to - 1 with Kopitar in the value department .
Kopitar 's career PPG to this point is 0.88 compared to SoS 's 0.95 so I 'd give the edge to Paul if I had to pick .
The Panthers appear to be getting excellent value from Horton and Weiss .
However , Horton has career high in points is 62 , Weiss ' is 61 and the Panthers have n't seen the playoffs since the last time the Sooners won a National Championship , so maybe there should be more qualifications for ' value . '
Their career PPG's also pale when compared to Stastny 's ( 0.697 for Horton and 0.592 for Weiss ) .
Kesler follows the same trend with good value , but a career PPG of 0.495 to this point and he 's the second best center on his team .
The elephant in the room is Getzlaf .
With a career PPG of 0.924 , the Ducks are seeing redunkulous value per point for his efforts .
Nothing else to say here .
He 's a good player .
Damn good .
Taking all of the above into consideration , I personally think Son of Stastny is having a pretty good year .
He 's had rotating linemates yet still manages to produce ( 1st on the team in points ; 3rd in shots , PP production , and +/- ; and best faceoff numbers ) .
He has n't set the world aflame with powerplay production , but since nobody in the organization has a clue what one of those looks like for the last 3 years , I 'm willing to give him a pass .
He 's playing a larger role in the team 's offense and defense and seems to have broken that nasty habit of blocking shots with breakable parts of his body .
He 's not truly overpaid compared to his contemporaries , but rather is being paid what the market has basically set as his value .
All - in - all , I believe he 's the best player on the team and has been playing like it over the course of the season .

Google has filed 64 domain name disputes with the National Arbitration Forum since 2001 .
It has won 62 times , arguing that the names in question were confusingly similar to its own .
But on Christmas Eve , Google suffered its second loss in eight years as the arbiters decided that groovle .com was not similar enough to Google 's name and that it had not been registered in bad faith .
This , despite the fact that groovle .com offers a " groovy custom search homepage . "
Objecting to Google 's trademark filings
Most of the disputes involve obvious uses of Google 's name or of its product names .
Examples include :
youtubeislam.com
googlemenu.com

You get the idea .
The National Arbitration Forum is certified by ICANN to decide domain disputes ; when Google wins , the domain at issue is transferred to the company 's control .
One side effect of this policy is that , whenever Google decides to truly index all of the world 's information , the " sexogoogle.com " domain name is already in the company 's control .
Google last lost a dispute back in 2004 when it went after a man named Richard Wolfe for froogles.com .
In that case , Wolfe had registered froogles.com back in 2000 and had set up a " frugal " shopping site there that earned commissions from the 700 retailers linked to on the site 's 400 product pages .
The disputed Froogles.com
Wolfe told the arbiters that he had chosen the site because the actual word " frugal " was not available and because froogles.com " has a nice ' ring ' to it , and because the 's ' on the end of the word reminds him of well - known department stores . "
When Google ( later ) launched its froogle .com shopping engine and filed for a trademark on the term in 2003 , Wolfe filed a Notice of Opposition on the grounds that he was already using the froogles.com term .
During arbitration , Wolfe said that Google 's legal team was shaking him down .
" Google ’s filing of its Complaint in this action is an apparent effort to coerce Mr. Wolfe into withdrawing his opposition to Google ’s application in the PTO , " said the decision .
" Indeed , in an e-mail dated May 11 , 2004 , Google 's counsel represented that if Mr. Wolfe would withdraw his opposition to Google ’s application to register its mark FROOGLE , then Google would not object to Mr. Wolfe continuing to operate his website at < froogles.com >.
Google made it quite clear in its e-mail that if Mr. Wolfe refused , Google would initiate proceedings to have his domain name taken from him and transferred to Google . "
When Wolfe refused to withdraw his opposition , Google tried to seize the froogles.com domain name on the grounds that it was too close to " Google . "
In a split decision , the arbitration panel sided with Wolfe , noting that he was running an actual business at the site , that the site had bern around for four years already , and that " the dissimilar letters in the domain name are sufficiently different to make it distinguishable from Complainant ’s mark because the domain name creates an entirely new word and conveys an entirely singular meaning from the mark . "
Enter Groovle
When Groovle.com ended up in the crosshair of Google 's legal eagles this year , the outcome looked grim , but the young Canadians behind the domain claimed that their case was far more similar to the froogles.com case than to something like adsence.com .
Yes , they run a search engine interface on the site , but the team says that " Groovle " is no play on " Google . "
A custom Groovle interface to Google
" There is no misspelling of GOOGLE involved .
The Disputed Domain Name contains an important ' R ' and important ' V ' that serve to distinguish the sound , appearance , meaning , and connotation of GROOVLE from GOOGLE .
The addition of the ' R ' and the ' V ' clearly make the predominant word and meaning ' GROOVE ' or ' GROOVY ' rather than GOOGLE . "
In a brief , unanimous Christmas Eve decision , the three arbiters on the panel agreed .
Groovle 's Christmas present ?
Keeping its own domain name .
The world looks at China with envy .
China ’s economy grew 8.7 percent last year , while the world economy contracted by 2.2 percent .
It seems that Chinese “ Confucian capitalism ” – a market economy powered by 1.3 billion people and guided by an authoritarian regime that can pull levers at will – is superior to our touchy - feely democracy and capitalism .
But the grass on China ’s side of the fence is not as green as it appears .
In fact , China ’s defiance of the global recession is not a miracle – it ’s a superbubble .
When it deflates , it will spell big trouble for all of us .
To understand the Chinese economy , consider three distinct periods : “ Late - stage growth obesity ” ( the decade prior to 2008 ) ; “ You lie ! ” ( the time of the financial crisis ) ; and finally , “ Steroids ’ R’ Us ” ( from the end of the financial crisis to today ) .
Late - stage growth obesity
About a decade ago , the Chinese government chose a policy of growth at any cost .
China ’s leaders see strong gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth not just as bragging rights , but as essential for political survival and national stability .
Because China lacks the social safety net of the developed world , unemployed people are n’t just inconvenienced by the loss of their jobs , they starve ; and hungry people do n’t complain , they riot and cause political unrest .
Remember the 1994 movie “ Speed ” ?
A young cop ( Keanu Reeves ) had to save passengers on a bus that would explode if its speed dropped below 50 m.p.h .
Well , China is like that bus with 1.3 billion people aboard .
If the Communist Party ca n’t keep the economy growing at a fast clip , the result will be catastrophic .
To achieve high growth , China kept its currency , the renminbi , at artificially low levels against the dollar .
This helped already cheap Chinese - made goods become even cheaper .
China turned into a significant exporter to the developed economies .
Normally , if free - market economic forces were at work , the renminbi would have appreciated and the US dollar would have declined .
However , had China let this occur , demand for its products would have declined , and its economy would n’t have grown at roughly 10 percent a year , which it did during the past decade .
The more China sold to the United States , the more dollars it accumulated , and thus the more US Treasuries it bought , driving our interest rates down .
US consumers responded to these cheap goods and cheap home loans by going on a buying binge .
However , companies and countries that grow at very high rates for a long time will inevitably suffer from late - stage growth obesity .
Consider Starbucks :
In 1999 , it had 2,000 stores and was adding 1.8 stores a day .
In 2007 , when it had 10,000 stores , it had to open 5.5 stores a day in a desperate bid to keep growth rates up .
This resulted in poor decisions and poor quality – a recipe for disaster .
In China , political pressure for full employment has led to similar late - stage growth obesity .
In 2005 , China built the largest shopping mall in the world , the New South China Mall : Today it ’s 99 percent vacant .
China also built up a lavish district in a city called Ordos : Today , it ’s a ghost town .
You lie !
All good things come to an end , and great things come to an end with a bang .
When the financial meltdown erupted in 2008 , US and global banks started dropping like flies .
Countries everywhere suffered contraction .
Even China .
During the crisis , Chinese exports were down more than 25 percent , tonnage of goods shipped through railroads was down by double digits , and electricity use plummeted .
Yet Beijing insisted that China had magically sustained 6 to 8 percent growth .
China lies .
It goes to great lengths to maintain appearances , including censoring media and jailing those who write antigovernment articles .
That ’s why we have to rely on hard data instead .
Steroids ‘ R’ Us
Today the global economy is stabilizing , thanks to Uncle Sam and other “ uncles ” around the world .
But the consumers of Chinese - made goods are still in debt , unemployment is high , and banks are n’t lending .
You might think the Chinese economy would be growing at a lower rate .
But no , it is growing again at nearly 10 percent , as though the financial crisis never occurred .
Though this growth appears to be authentic – electricity consumption is back up – it is not sustainable growth , because it is based on an unprecedented stimulus package and extraordinary government involvement in the economy .
In the midst of the financial crisis , in late 2008 , Beijing fire - hosed a $ 568 billion stimulus into the Chinese economy .
That ’s enormous !
As a percentage of GDP , it would be like a $ 2 trillion stimulus in America , nearly triple the size of the one Congress passed last year .
It gets even more interesting .
Unlike Western democracies , whose central banks can pump a lot of money into the financial system but ca n’t force banks to lend or consumers and corporations to spend , China can achieve both at lightning speed .
The government controls the banks , so it can make them lend , and it can force state - owned enterprises ( one - third of the economy ) to borrow and to spend .
Also , because the rule of law and human and property rights are still underdeveloped , China can spend infrastructure project money very fast – if a school is in the way of a road the government wants to build , it becomes a casualty for the greater good .
Government is horrible at allocating large amounts of capital , especially at the speed it is done in China .
Political decisions ( driven by the goal of full employment ) are often uneconomical , and corruption and cronyism result in projects that destroy value .
To maintain high employment , China has poured money into infrastructure and real estate projects .
This explains why , in 2009 , new floor space doubled and residential real estate prices surged 25 percent .
This also explains why the Chinese keep building new skyscrapers even though existing ones are still vacant .
The enormous stimulus has exacerbated problems that already existed , threatening to turn China into a less shiny but more drastic version of debt - riddled Dubai , United Arab Emirates .
What happens in China does n’t stay in China .
A meltdown there – or even a slowdown – would have severe consequences for the rest of the world .
It will tank the commodity markets .
Demand for industrial goods will fall off the cliff .
Finally , Chinese appetite for our fine currency will diminish , driving the dollar lower against the renminbi and boosting our interest rates higher .
No more 5 percent mortgages and 6 percent car loans .
No shortcuts to greatness
We look at China and are mesmerized by its 1.3 billion people , its achievements of the past decade , its recent economic resiliency , and its ability to achieve spectacular results on the fly .
But we have to remember that economic bubbles are usually just a good thing taken too far .
The Chinese economy is no exception .
Its long - term future may be bright , but in the short run we ’ve got a bubble on our hands .
Everyone wants a shortcut to greatness , but there is n’t one .
China has been trying to bend the laws of economics for a while , and with the control it exerts over its economy it may seem that it ’s succeeded .
But this is only a temporary mirage , which must be followed by a painful reality .
No , there is no shortcut to greatness – not in personal life , not in politics , and not in economics .

A Danish newspaper apologised today to eight Muslim organisations for the offence it caused by reprinting controversial cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad , in exchange for their dropping legal action against the newspaper .
Politiken reached a settlement with the groups , which represent 94,923 of Muhammad 's descendants , in which it agreed to print an apology for the affront the cartoons caused .
The newspaper has not given up its right to publish the cartoons and has not apologised for having printed them as part of its news coverage .
In a joint statement , the two sides said they wanted to " express their satisfaction with this amicable understanding and settlement , and express the hope that it may in some degree contribute to defusing the present tense situation " .
The decision to issue an apology for the offence caused has been met , however , by widespread condemnation from the Danish media and political parties .
The editor of Jyllands - Posten , which originally printed the cartoons in 2005 and is published by the same media company as Politiken , said that its sister paper had failed in the fight for freedom of speech and called it a " sad day " for the Danish press .
Kurt Westergaard , one of the cartoonists , who earlier this year was the subject of an attempted attack at his home , said the newspaper had betrayed its duty to freedom of speech .
" In Denmark we play by a set of rules , which we do n't deviate from , and that 's freedom of speech , " he told the newspaper Berlingske Tidende .
" Politiken is afraid of terror .
That 's unfortunate and I fully understand that . "
The leader of the rightwing Danish People 's party , Pia Kjærsgaard , called the situation absurd , and said that Politiken had sold out .
She urged Danish newspapers to reprint the cartoons as a protest against Politiken 's settlement .
" It is deeply , deeply embarrassing that [ Politiken 's editor ]
Tøger Seidenfaden has sold out of Denmark 's and the west 's freedom of speech .
I cannot distance myself enough from this total sellout to this doctrine , " Kjærsgaard said .
The leader of the Social Democrats , Helle Thorning - Schmidt , also criticised Politiken 's decision : " It 's crazy .
The media carries offensive material every day .
That is what freedom of speech is about . "
The prime minister and the newly appointed foreign secretary have not commented on the settlement .
Last year 11 Danish newspapers were contacted by the Saudi lawyer Faisal Yamani , who demanded that the Muhammad cartoons were removed from their websites , that the newspapers print an apology and that they promise not to use the cartoons again .
Seidenfaden initially refused Yamani 's request for an apology , saying it was the paper 's duty to print the cartoons as part of its news coverage after Westergaard became the subject of an alleged murder plot .
Yamani , the lawyer who negotiated the settlement on behalf of the descendants , said : " This is a good settlement .
It would be wrong to speak of a victory .
Both parties have reached the point where they understand the background to what has happened .
Politiken is courageous in apologising , even though its was not their intention to offend anyone . "
In September 2005 the Danish newspaper Jyllands - Posten published a series of cartoons depicting Muhammad , in what it described as an attempt to promote freedom of expression .
The cartoons initially had little impact , but when they were reprinted by Norwegian newspapers a storm erupted , with violent protests across the Middle East .
In February 2006 the violence escalated as newspapers in France , Germany , Spain and Italy reprinted the caricatures .
The offices of Jyllands - Posten had to be evacuated several times after security threats .
Protests spread to other Arab countries and Danish goods including Lego and Bang & Olufsen were boycotted by Saudi Arabia , Libya and Syria .
The Danish embassy in Damascus was burned down in 2006 , others were attacked and death threats forced Westergaard into hiding .
Westergaard 's caricature of a bearded man with a bomb in his turban became the most talked about of the cartoons , but he has said the man in the drawing did n't " necessarily " depict Muhammad .
According to some Islamic traditions , it is blasphemous to make or show an image of the prophet .
• This article was amended on 1 March 2010 .
Not all branches of Islam consider it blasphenmous to make or show images of the prophet Muhammad .
This has been clarified .
BARCELONA , Feb 15 ( Reuters ) - Spain 's government said on Monday it would be open to the possibility of internet service providers such as Telefonica TEF .
MC charging search engines like Google GOOG .
O a fee .
“ It ’s an option which we should discuss and which we should consider as a possible option , ” Industry Minister Miguel Sebastian told reporters at the Mobile World Congress industry fair in Barcelona when asked about comments made by Telefonica Chairman Cesar Alierta .
Alierta said last week that Spain ’s dominant operator was considering charging search engines but did not say how the firm could charge Google or Yahoo or why it wanted to target search engines and not other webpages .
“ It ’s clear that internet search engines use our networks without paying us anything , ” he said in a video on the webpage of Basque television company ETB .
“ That is going to change , of that I ’m convinced . ”
Telefonica had discussed the proposal to charge with other European operators during a private meeting in Seville at the end of last year , a source at the Spanish firm said .
“ All the operators want search engines like Google or Yahoo to pay to use its networks , ” he said .
In January French President Nicolas Sarkozy said he wanted to explore whether the online advertising revenues of major search engines could be taxed in France as well as their home countries .
He also said he wanted the country ’s antitrust body to rule on whether Google enjoyed a dominant market position in online advertising .
Deloitte said in a report last week that ISP providers would push increasingly for content providers to contribute to the cost of network rollout .

Climategate U - turn as scientist at centre of row admits :
There has been no global warming since 1995
Data for vital ' hockey stick graph ' has gone missing
There has been no global warming since 1995
Warming periods have happened before - but NOT due to man-made changes
Data : Professor Phil Jones admitted his record keeping is ' not as good as it should be '
The academic at the centre of the ‘ Climategate ’ affair , whose raw data is crucial to the theory of climate change , has admitted that he has trouble ‘ keeping track ’ of the information .
Colleagues say that the reason Professor Phil Jones has refused Freedom of Information requests is that he may have actually lost the relevant papers .
Professor Jones told the BBC yesterday there was truth in the observations of colleagues that he lacked organisational skills , that his office was swamped with piles of paper and that his record keeping is ‘ not as good as it should be ’ .
The data is crucial to the famous ‘ hockey stick graph ’ used by climate change advocates to support the theory .
Professor Jones also conceded the possibility that the world was warmer in medieval times than now – suggesting global warming may not be a man-made phenomenon .
And he said that for the past 15 years there has been no ‘ statistically significant ’ warming .
The admissions will be seized on by sceptics as fresh evidence that there are serious flaws at the heart of the science of climate change and the orthodoxy that recent rises in temperature are largely man-made .
Professor Jones has been in the spotlight since he stepped down as director of the University of East Anglia ’s Climatic Research Unit after the leaking of emails that sceptics claim show scientists were manipulating data .
The raw data , collected from hundreds of weather stations around the world and analysed by his unit , has been used for years to bolster efforts by the United Nation ’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to press governments to cut carbon dioxide emissions .
Following the leak of the emails , Professor Jones has been accused of ‘ scientific fraud ’ for allegedly deliberately suppressing information and refusing to share vital data with critics .
Discussing the interview , the BBC ’s environmental analyst Roger Harrabin said he had spoken to colleagues of Professor Jones who had told him that his strengths included integrity and doggedness but not record - keeping and office tidying .
Mr Harrabin , who conducted the interview for the BBC ’s website , said the professor had been collating tens of thousands of pieces of data from around the world to produce a coherent record of temperature change .
That material has been used to produce the ‘ hockey stick graph ’ which is relatively flat for centuries before rising steeply in recent decades .
According to Mr Harrabin , colleagues of Professor Jones said ‘ his office is piled high with paper , fragments from over the years , tens of thousands of pieces of paper , and they suspect what happened was he took in the raw data to a central database and then let the pieces of paper go because he never realised that 20 years later he would be held to account over them ’ .
Asked by Mr Harrabin about these issues , Professor Jones admitted the lack of organisation in the system had contributed to his reluctance to share data with critics , which he regretted .
But he denied he had cheated over the data or unfairly influenced the scientific process , and said he still believed recent temperature rises were predominantly man-made .
Asked about whether he lost track of data , Professor Jones said : ‘ There is some truth in that .
We do have a trail of where the weather stations have come from but it ’s probably not as good as it should be .
‘ There ’s a continual updating of the dataset .
Keeping track of everything is difficult .
Some countries will do lots of checking on their data then issue improved data , so it can be very difficult .
We have improved but we have to improve more . ’
He also agreed that there had been two periods which experienced similar warming , from 1910 to 1940 and from 1975 to 1998 , but said these could be explained by natural phenomena whereas more recent warming could not .
He further admitted that in the last 15 years there had been no ‘ statistically significant ’ warming , although he argued this was a blip rather than the long - term trend .
And he said that the debate over whether the world could have been even warmer than now during the medieval period , when there is evidence of high temperatures in northern countries , was far from settled .
Sceptics believe there is strong evidence that the world was warmer between about 800 and 1300 AD than now because of evidence of high temperatures in northern countries .
But climate change advocates have dismissed this as false or only applying to the northern part of the world .
Professor Jones departed from this consensus when he said : ‘ There is much debate over whether the Medieval Warm Period was global in extent or not .
The MWP is most clearly expressed in parts of North America , the North Atlantic and Europe and parts of Asia .
‘ For it to be global in extent , the MWP would need to be seen clearly in more records from the tropical regions and the Southern hemisphere .
There are very few palaeoclimatic records for these latter two regions .
‘ Of course , if the MWP was shown to be global in extent and as warm or warmer than today , then obviously the late 20th Century warmth would not be unprecedented .
On the other hand , if the MWP was global , but was less warm than today , then the current warmth would be unprecedented . ’
Sceptics said this was the first time a senior scientist working with the IPCC had admitted to the possibility that the Medieval Warming Period could have been global , and therefore the world could have been hotter then than now .
Professor Jones criticised those who complained he had not shared his data with them , saying they could always collate their own from publicly available material in the US .
And he said the climate had not cooled ‘ until recently – and then barely at all .
The trend is a warming trend ’ .
Mr Harrabin told Radio 4 ’s
Today programme that , despite the controversies , there still appeared to be no fundamental flaws in the majority scientific view that climate change was largely man-made .
But Dr Benny Pieser , director of the sceptical Global Warming Policy Foundation , said Professor Jones ’s ‘ excuses ’ for his failure to share data were hollow as he had shared it with colleagues and ‘ mates ’ .
He said that until all the data was released , sceptics could not test it to see if it supported the conclusions claimed by climate change advocates .
He added that the professor ’s concessions over medieval warming were ‘ significant ’ because they were his first public admission that the science was not settled .

Novelty Wines Recipe
Description
Non-conventional alcoholic home - brews .
Wines attempted so far : Sweet Orange Wine , Dry Orange Wine , Tomato Wine , Cola Wine , Chocolate Wine , Mushroom Wine , Ginger Beer , Earl Grey Tea Wine , Banana Wine , Camomile Wine , Rosemary Wine , Bay Wine , Rose Petal Wine , Kvas Wine , Muscovado Wine , Curry Wine and Chicken Wine !
Some flavours taste like wines , some like cocktails and some like alcopops ( and some taste foul ! ) .
It is cheaper than most shop - bought beverages in the UK but the reason I tried brewing was that one can make all sorts of amusingly imaginative wines .
Alcohol levels are quite high at typically 15 - 16 % alcohol by weight which is closer to sherry levels than normal wine or beer levels .
Summary
Start off yeast with water , nutriment & sugar .
Sterilise equipment .
Put fruit juice ( or equivalent ) & yeast mix in a demijohn and seal with a bubble lock .
Leave in a warm place until the sugar has been digested .
Add more sugar .
Repeat until it stops brewing at about 16 % .
Syphon into bottles , sweeten , seal & label .
Takes approximately : 30 min work ( mainly cleaning & bottling ) , 2 - 8 weeks brewing ( depending upon the temperature ) .
Ingredients
Fruit juice ( or some other safely edible matter plus water ) 4 l Sugar ( including that in the fruit juice ) 1200 g Sterilising agent / preservative ( e.g. ' Campden ' tablets which are food grade sodium metabisulphite ) 125 g Dried yeast ( wine yeast , not bread or beer yeast , for better alcohol tolerance ) 1 tsp Yeast Nutriment ( this is just food grade ammonium nitrate but do n't call it fertiliser , even though it is , because it puts people off :-) ) 1 tsp Sweetener ( e.g. saccharin tablets or saccharin solution ) 0 to 80 tablets Second - hand wine bottles 5 Bottle stoppers ( plastic ) 5 Grapes , malted barley & hops none
Equipment
4.4 litre demijohn ( or similar vessel ) with bung & bubble - lock ( or similar air - lock ) .
Measuring glass or scales for measuring sugar .
Screw - top bottle for starting yeast in .
Wide nozzle funnel for sugar ( a top section cut off a plastic fizzy drinks bottle makes a good funnel ) .
Jug or similar for sterilising in .
Syphon ( preferably plastic because glass breaks too easily ) .
Somewhere to carry out the brewing where the temperature will be 20 °C or above ( preferably 25 °C or above ) for weeks .
A hygrometer ( liquid density measuring float ) is useful to test brewing completion and work out the sugar content of unlabelled ingredients but is not vital .
Detailed Instructions ( using Fruit Juice )
The most tedious part of it is all the washing up & sterilizing needed to ensure that is only yeast which grows !
Set up the brewing vessel :
Make some sterilising solution by dissolving some sodium metabisulphite in tap water according in the ratio specified on its packet .
Sterilize the demijohn by swilling around sterilizing solution inside it .
Sterilise the bung & bubble - lock by soaking them in the the sterilizing solution .
Rinse out the demijohn with tap water .
Pour 1 litre ( i.e. one standard carton ) of fruit juice into the demijohn .
Add the yeast .
Add the yeast nutriment .
Add 1 litre more of fruit juice ( the reason for doing it two parts is so that the first lot deters the powdery yeast etc. from sticking to the bottom of the demijohn & the second lot can wash in any that remains stuck in the funnel - it is just a lazy way to avoid stirring & scrapping with more utensil sterilizing ) .
If the total amount of sugar in 2 litres of fruit juice is less than 200 g , then add enough sugar to bring it up to that level .
Do not worry that it just sits at the bottom not dissolving immediately ( it will have plenty of time to dissolve ) .
Rinse the bung & bubble - lock with tap water , fill the bubble - lock according to its instructions with sterilizing solution and fit them to the demijohn .
Put the demijohn in a place at least 20 °C hot ( preferably at 25 °C or more so it brews faster but not so hot it kills the yeast ( if that happens , just add new yeast to the demijohn and move it somewhere less hot ) ) and leave it .
It should increase to bubbling at a rate of a bubble every few seconds in a few days .
Wait until undissolved sugar has gone & bubbling reduces to very slow ( a bubble a minute or less ) again .
You should now have 2 litres of beverage at about 5 % alcohol .
Feeding the yeast again : Pour another litre of fruit juice into the demijohn .
If the total amount of sugar ( in the fruit juice plus added sugar ) so far put into the demijohn is less than 600 g , then add enough sugar to bring it up to that level .
Put the demijohn back in the warm place and leave it .
It should soon ( within an hour or so ) return to bubbling at a rate of a bubble every few seconds .
Wait until undissolved sugar has gone & bubbling reduces to very slow again .
You should now have 3 litres of beverage at about 10 % alcohol .
Feeding the yeast yet again : Pour another litre of fruit juice into the demijohn .
If the total amount of sugar ( in the fruit juice plus added sugar ) so far put into the demijohn is less than 1200 g , then add enough sugar to bring it up to that level .
Put the demijohn back in the warm place and leave it .
It should soon return to bubbling at a rate of a bubble every few seconds .
Wait until undissolved sugar has gone ( or nearly gone , the yeast might give up from alcohol poisoning before finishing off all the sugar ) & bubbling reduces to very slow again .
You should now have 4 litres of beverage at about 15 % alcohol .
To confirm complete conversion of the sugar , use a hygrometer or taste a sample .
Bottling it :
For once , there is no need to make more sterilising solution .
You are going to be putting preservative into the wine which is the same chemical as the sterilization agent anyway .
Do n't shake the demijohn ; the ugly sediments should remain at the bottom .
Syphon the wine into the bottles taking care not to suck up the sludge from the bottom of the demijohn or overflow a bottle .
( A good source of bottles is to volunteer to clear up & recycle the junk empty bottles from a party . )
It does not need a stopcock on the syphon tube to stop the flow when moving the tube between bottles , just lift the bottles together with the tube outlet to the level of the demijohn and syphoning will pause .
Add preservative to the wine according the ratio specified on the instructions which came with it .
Add sweetener if required .
Put stoppers in the bottles .
Corks are traditional but plastic stoppers are a lot more convenient to put in and take out and can be reused to reseal part finished bottles .
Just poke one into the top of a bottle far enough for it not to leak , turn the bottle upside down and gently tap on a hard floor by using its own weight dropping from 10 cm or so .
I have not broken a bottle so far ( but I did break a corking machine before switching to using plastic stoppers ! ) but make sure you handle them in such a way that , if they do break , the resulting sharp glass does not cause injury ( for example , definitely do n't lean on the bottle and do n't push the stopper in hard with your hand ) .
Even easier and safer is if you can find screw - top wine bottles with the lids ( which are usually thrown away ) .
Clean the outsides of the bottles if needed .
Draw some labels by hand or on a computer , duplicate them by photocopying or printing , cut them out and glue them to bottle .
If possible it is better to use a laser printer or photocopier than an inkjet one ( even if it means sticking to black and white ) because inkjet ink is normally water soluble and wine bottles are often handled in damp conditions ( an alternative , suggested by a reader of this site , is to spray inkjet printed labels with hairspray to damp - proof them ) .
For some reason , people appreciate wines in bottles with neat full size labels a lot more than the a small functional handwritten sticky labels traditionally put on home - brew bottles .
For my own bottles , I drew a label in Corel Draw in a style deliberately suggestive of a Victorian ' snake oil ' bottle !
Deliver to parties , give to friends or drink .
It is amusing to deliver one just after bottling with " The vintage ?
Oh , ... " , squint at the label , " ... about 6 pm this afternoon . " !
Detailed Instructions ( not using Fruit Juice )
If you are using something other than fruit juice then follow the recipe for using fruit juice above but put whatever ingredients you are using in the demijohn at the beginning and add tap water to bring it up to the required volume whenever the recipe says to add fruit juice .
There is a risk of the wrong type of microbe growing if the ingredients are not sterile .
In some cases the ingredients can be cooked ( e.g. curry wine & chicken wine ) or brewed like a tea ( e.g. Earl Grey tea wine and rosemary wine ) so just keep them hot until they go into the demijohn ( I suggest boiling less than the full amount of water , to save time & energy , and making up the volume with cold water that is put in the demijohn before the hot mix so that the hot mix is immediately diluted saving the demijohn from a thermal shock as its glass is not designed to take boiling water ) .
If that is not applicable ( e.g. banana wine ) then it might be advisable to make up a yeast ' starter ' culture to give the yeast a head start .
To do that just mix the yeast and a spoonful of sugar in a cupful of lukewarm water in sterilised capped container at least half an hour before the yeast is called for in the recipe then use that mix instead of the dried yeast when needed .
Calculating the amount of sugar in the ingredients may be less trivial than with fruit juice ( where the cartoon label 's nutritional information section usually , at least in the UK , states the sugar concentration ) .
Sometimes the labels of the ingredients may have that information or it might be obvious ( e.g. there is negligible sugar in tea leaves ) but otherwise one has to either guess or measure it .
To measure it , leave the ingredients in the water in the demijohn , with occasional shaking , for a day or so before adding the yeast and extra sugar so that the sugar in the ingredients dissolves into the water then measure the sugar concentration from the density of the solution using a hygrometer .
However , it is not vital to know the sugar concentration as it is only needed for working out the final alcohol concentration for labelling .

When brewed , add a total of 80 saccharin tablets ( equivalent to 400 g of sugar ) .
Shake before serving as with fruit juice .
Why ?
This was my first successful brew .
I used orange juice because it was the cheapest fruit juice to experiment with .
The amount of sweetener specified brings it back up to the sweetness of the original fruit juice .
A friend came up with the name ' Bucks Flat ' because it tastes like a ' Bucks Fizz ' ( orange juice & sparkling white wine ) cocktail other than that it is not fizzy .
Dry Orange Wine
What ?
An orange wine .
Bright orange colour .
It tastes like a bit like wine and lot like alcoholic orange juice .

Identical to the Sweet Orange Wine but only add a total of 40 saccharin tablets .
Why ?
A friend suggested that I was wrong to expect a wine to be as sweet as fruit juice so I made the next batch with less sweetener .
The result tastes more sophisticated but I think more people preferred it sweet .
Tomato Wine
What ?
A tomato wine .
Rich , thick and bright red .
It tastes like a Bloody Mary cocktail if mixed with a little Tabasco , Worcestershire Sauce & lemon juice .
It also mixes well with thick Dutch advocaat for a tomato omelette flavour and lurid red & yellow stripy appearance !

How ?
Follow the basic recipe using tomato juice .
It is almost too thick to syphon so it needs some pouring and it needs stirring before decanting anyway to get up the thick phase of tomato juice which gives it its rich texture therefore there is a lot of sediment in the resulting drink but it does not show much .
Add a total of 40 saccharin tablets during bottling .

Why ?
I first made it as a joke for party run by a friend who liked Bloody Mary cocktails and then I found out that some people liked it .
I myself like it with , as suggested by another friend , lots of Tabasco .
Cola Wine
What ?
A total failure .
It did n't even brew .
A total failure .
It did n't even brew .
Why ?
I tried brewing up a fizzy cola soft drink as a joke but it did nothing at all .
My guess is that the phosphoric acid in the cola drink killed the yeast immediately .
Chocolate Wine
What ?
A cocoa wine .
Clear with a light brown tint .
I personally think it tastes foul but a few people like it .
A friend said that it tasted like ' tudge ' ( spelling uncertain ) , a drink brewed rapidly from sugar & the leaves of a native plant in Ethiopia .

Why ?
I made this as joke for friend who liked fine French wines and fine Swiss chocolates but whom I knew would be disgusted by this combination .
Personally , I thought that the resulting wine tasted really revolting but that might have been because I mainly like solid chocolate for its creamy cocoa butter component and this wine has none of .
I made an advertising mistake in putting " Warning : it tastes foul . " on the label .
The first bottle remained unopened through 2 parties and lying in a sports hall kitchen for two weeks because of that advert .
It was only when I started pouring it away down a sink that some friends asked to try it , a few actually liked it , and two even took the rest of my bottles home to drink .
Mushroom Wine

Put it in the demijohn , add water & follow the basic recipe .
Why ?
After finding some people unexpectedly liked the chocolate wine , I was determined to make a really outrageous wine .
Mushrooms were selling very cheap in the local market so I made a mushroom wine expecting it to be foul black in colour and musty tasting .
I was surprised when it came out a clear elegant yellow and not very bad flavoured .
I 've even had a friend who did not notice this wine was not a normal white grape wine until told .
Ginger Beer
What ?
Traditional British ginger beer ( which was a naturally sparkling ginger wine not the carbonated ginger soft drink currently sold under the name of ' ginger beer ' ) .
Traditional cloudy light brown colour .
It tastes of ginger and is fizzy .
About 10 % alcohol .
Best drunk young .

How ?
Follow the basic recipe using powdered ginger root and water but only use 800 g of sugar in total so that the final brewing can be done in the bottles .
Use bottles which can withstand pressurised contents ( such as sparkling wine bottles & plastic fizzy drink bottles ) so they do n't explode and sterilize & rinse the bottles before filling because the contents will be live , not preserved .
Add 0.5 tsp of sugar to each bottle .
Leave it to finish fermenting in the bottles a while to build up the fizz .
Despite it having no sugar left and no artificial sweetener , it still tastes somewhat sweet because ginger itself acts as a non-sugar sweetener ( I guess that that is the explanation of why it came to be the standard flavouring of brewed children 's drinks in the days before artificial sweeteners ) .

Why ?
Ginger beer is a well known home brew and used to be used ( but typically only at 1 to 5 % alcohol ) as a cheap home - made kid 's fizzy drink but it is not currently available in UK supermarkets .
There are drinks called ' ginger beer ' but they are soft drinks made from soda water with ginger flavouring .
Even supermarket ' traditional style ginger beer ' is just the same soft drink with cloudy colouring added .
I thought I would try to recreate the original style drink by adapting my standard brewing method to it .
The traditional method for ginger beer was very similar to mine except that there was a nostalgic ritual of using a brewing culture from one batch to seed the next rather than starting antiseptically afresh .
The culture which was passed down was called the ' ginger - beer plant ' and was identified by Harry Marshall Ward in 1892 as being an unusual symbiotic combination of Saccharomyces pyriformis yeast with Bevibacterium vermiforme bacteria but normal wine yeast is probably okay as a substitute .
As for drinking young , it was liked when new but when some bottles I laid down for 3 years were tried they were found to taste foul ( the opposite of what was found with banana wine ! ) .
Earl Grey Tea Wine
What ?
A sweet tea wine with a slight citrus flavour .
Clear light reddish brown .
It tastes like iced tea .

Why ?
There are several coffee liqueurs available but tea liqueurs are rare so I thought of making tea liqueur .
I mentioned this to a friend who suggested Earl Grey Tea as an improvement ( it is one of the few traditional UK teas which is normally drunk without milk ) .
The result has been liked by those who tried it .
The first one described it as " It 's good .
It 's like having a cup of tea and having a drink at the same time . " .
Banana Wine
What ?
A banana wine .
Clear & colourless with pale yellow sediment if unshaken , opaque and pale yellow if shaken .
When young it tastes like slushy , over ripe & slightly mouldy bananas .
When mature it tastes like a rich , smooth & sweet liqueur and not like bananas .

How ?
Follow the basic recipe using liquidised peeled bananas ( about 1 kg of bananas ( which is about 4 25 cm bananas ) in yellow - skin state ) and water .
It might be a good idea to prepare a starter culture of yeast so that brewing starts quickly because the banana pulp is probably not totally sterile .
For calculating how much sugar to add , ripe dessert bananas are about 20 % sugar .
Stir before bottling so that the cloudy sediment which makes it look like banana is also transferred to the bottles .

Why ?
A friend suggested banana wine and bananas were going cheap in the local market .
I was surprised that the banana pulp and resulting wine remained banana yellow ; I was expecting it to go brown like cut banana pieces or black like overripe bananas .
However , although the colour remains good , the resulting wine smelled , to me , revoltingly like mouldy bananas .
The remainder , considered a failure , got left it in a cupboard for 3 years before I got around to clearing the cupboard up .
When I found them , I gave a bottle to the friend who had suggested it whereupon we found its remarkable transformation from something horrid to something rather nice .
Camomile Wine

Why ?
I thought about making a ' herbal tea ' ( tisane ) wine at the same time as the Earl Grey Tea wine and happened to have a lot of pure camomile ( a daisy - like herb ) left over from when I found it selling very cheap ( by UK standards ) in a Dutch market thinking that it would give at least an attractive bright yellow colour like camomile tea .
It was disappointing that the colour ended up rather pale and the taste rather bland .
I keep calling it ' calamine wine ' ( ' calamine ' is zinc carbonate used in the popular pink lotion for symptomatic treatment of rashes & sunburn which is probably poisonous to drink ) by mistake !
Rosemary Wine
What ?
A rosemary wine .
Clear & colourless with a slight pearl haze ( from the rosemary essential oil ) .
It tastes strongly of rosemary making it reminiscent ( but less subtle , being a pure herb rather than a blend ) of a vermouth wine .

Why ?
I got a liking for the flavour of rose petals from rose jam from Turkey & Bulgaria .
That is difficult to get in the UK and rose petals are usually sold expensively for decoration but I came across bags of dried rose petals on sale briefly in a local halal grocery shop .
I then had so many rose petals that I could even splash out and try brewing them .
Kvas Wine
What ?
Traditional East European kvas ( which was a light brewed weak bread - beer not the sugary malty caramel - coloured carbonated soft drink currently sold under the name of ' kvas ' in supermarkets ) but increased in alcohol to wine strength .
Traditional cloudy light brown colour .
It tastes of yeast , stale bread & mint .

Make a basic kvas base by taking 450 g of stale dark ( pumpernickel style ) rye bread , drying it in an oven ( 110 ºC , gas mark 1/4 , for 1 - 1.5 h ) , crumbling it , adding 3 l of boiling water , leaving it 8 h , sieving it through a fine sieve ( e.g. cloth ) , adding 100 g of sugar , adding 5 tsp of yeast , adding a mint sprig , adding about 20 raisins , leaving another 8 h and straining .
Then use that liquid and follow the basic recipe .

Why ?
I came across kvas first in Armenia .
It is traditionally sold as a refreshing drink on hot summer days from distinctive street carts with a cylindrical horizontal metal tank of the drink .
The carts are painted bright yellow .
When I got back to the UK I looked for it in East European supermarkets but they were mainly Polish and in the north European former Soviet countries the traditional drink has already been replaced by a very different drink under the same name , a simple mass produced ( Coke Cola , under local brand names , is one of the main producers ! ) fizzy drink .
That is much as has happened to traditional ginger beer in the UK a few decades previously .
Therefore I tried making my own using a mixture of a recipe I got from a friend with tips from several recipes I got found on the WWW and some experimentation .
It tasted closer to the original I had tried but was a lot a effort and was not as suited to back home in the UK as on a hot street on holiday .
At the same time as making it to the proper strength of about 1 % alcohol , I experimented with brewing it up as wine .
Muscovado Wine
What ?
A muscovado sugar wine .
Very dark brown .
It tastes overwhelmingly strongly of muscovado / treacle / molasses , more so than muscovado sugar itself because the sugar has been brewed away leaving only the flavour and rather bitter .
It makes me think of what I imagine the dregs of a rum production plant would taste like .
I find it unpleasant .

Why ?
A friend who was familiar with my weird brews suggested that I should just brew up sugar then add the flavouring afterwards .
I did not do that because it removes the fun of seeing how the flavour & colour will change ( which is often quite dramatic & unexpected ) in brewing but did give me the idea of brewing from flavoured sugar .
Muscovado is the most strongly flavoured of the standard supermarket sugars in the UK .
Curry Wine
What ?
A wine with the flavour of a basic UK - Indian restaurant curry sauce .
Bright reddish orange and textured .
It is smooth , tastes of ginger & other spices like a curry and has a burning chilli aftertaste .
It is generally unpleasant in my opinion yet I have found a friend of a friend who actually really likes it .

How ?
Make a chicken broth by boiling up the bones , skin , cartilage & other fleshy ( not the feathers ! ) leftovers of a roast chicken .
Strain it , allow it to cool and scrape off the solidified fat .
Bring it back to the boil to sterilise it and pour it boiling into the demijohn ( put some cold water in first for it to mix with so that the glass does not crack from thermal stress ) and brew it according to the basic recipe .
Chicken can be very unhealthy if it is rotten so this wine needs careful sterilisation of the apparatus .
When finally syphoning it into bottles , avoid not just the solid detritus which has sunk to the bottom as normal but also the remaining fat which has floated to the surface .

When asked about the ingredients of my previous wines , I 've joked " ... it 's okay , it 's vegetarian " to vegetarian friends .
From that it was obvious to invent a wine which was not vegetarian .
Pedantic Health & Safety Advice
It is currently fashionable to litter any set of instructions with excesses of safety warnings ( " Riding your pushbike at high speed into a brick wall can cause injury . " etc. ) so here are a few for this brewing :
I do n't accept any responsibility for any detrimental consequences of producing or ingesting wine made according to this recipe .
I give it to friends as a joke not as a cheap way of getting drunk ( in the southern UK there is an easier source of cheap alcohol : nip across the channel to France and fill ones car with bottles of plonk from the Calais tourist hypermarkets ) and , as of yet , I know of no one who as consumed enough in one binge to tell if the hangovers are worse than for commercial wines .
I have never done a chemical assay on it for hangover inducing congeners .
Even the ethanol content I have only estimated from the amount of sugar the yeast has digested and some simplistic chemical calculations .
The glassware involved in brewing can be dangerous when it breaks and broken glass can be almost invisible in water .
Also take care when opening the bottles .
The pressures created ( intentionally , as for Ginger Beer , or by accident from bottling incompletely brewed wine ) when brewing in bottles can cause bottles ( especially ones made for non-fizzy wine ) to explode , liquid to squirt out and stoppers to be ejected at speed .
The demijohns weigh about 5 kg when full so take care in lifting not to injure your back ( and , less obviously , do n't bump them on things as the shock travelling through the liquid can be sufficient to create an almost imperceptible fine ring crack around the base which wrecks the demijohn and allows the contents to slowly and messily seep out ) .
I have heard ( but cannot confirm ) stories that very slow winter brewing in prisoner of war camps generated dangerously concentrations of methanol so wait for the summer warmth .
( Slow brewing in the cold is unsuitable for impatient people like me anyway ! )
Excessive consumption of ethanol over time can cause lots of health problems which are well known ( and being permanently pissed wastes a lot of productive time ) .
Excessive acute consumption of ethanol causes other health risks , hangovers and increased risk of accidents ( however , I doubt most people would want to consume large amounts of these wines ! ) .
Oh , and ethanol is fattening .
About 50 kcal per 10 ml unit , i.e. around six hundred thousand calories per 750 ml bottle of this wine .
Furthermore , the 50 litres of carbon dioxide given off in brewing a bottle ( and the 100 litres of carbon dioxide breathed out after digesting it ) add to the global warming problem .
Etc..
Origin
I spotted a brewing kit ( demijohns , bubble locks , bungs , hygrometers , buckets , corking machine , instruction book etc. ) going cheap in a charity second - hand shop in the winter of 2001 so I bought it for experiments .
My first brewing attempt brewed ridiculously slowly .
I asked a colleague at work what could have gone wrong and was told that the temperature needed to be at least 22 °C so I waited until summer and tried again .
I read the instruction book which came with the kit plus a few more books from a public library and lazily combined the recipes into a minimalist one on the principle that anything missed out by any of the recipes was not vital and so could be discarded .
I also missed out duplicate sterilisation stages and blithely assumed that cold tap water direct from the rising main & ingredients in sealed packets from supermarkets did not need sterilization at all .
I tested the resulting recipe on orange juice as it was the cheapest fruit juice available .
It brewed well and I kept adding sugar until the yeast stopped digesting it .
From the amount of sugar which went in , the amount left undissolved and the liquid density , I calculated the alcohol content as being about 15 % .
However , it tasted horribly bitter ( as orange juice minus its intrinsic sugar would do ) and I was too impatient to slowly dissolve more sugar in it so I used an artificial sweetener , calculating the amount to match the original sweetness of the orange juice .
That was how I got my basic recipe .
The others are just minor variations of it .
Almost any food can be used because the brewing is mostly just the yeast digesting the added sugar .
Although I had only intended the orange juice wine as throw - away experiment , I bottled some up and took it to a party as a joke ( my intended real contribution being flapjack cakes which I had recently also experimented on ) .
However , the orange wine was unexpectedly quite popular so I made it again and adapted the recipe into other unusual & jokey flavours with Sweet Orange Wine , Dry Orange Wine , Tomato Wine , Chocolate Wine , Cola Wine , Mushroom Wine & Ginger Beer in the 2001 .
In 2002 I added Earl Grey Tea Wine , Banana Wine , Camomile Wine , Rosemary Wine Curry Wine & Chicken Wine .
In 2006 I added Bay Wine & Kvas Wine .
In 2007 I added Rose Petal Wine & Muscovado Wine .
I also did a couple of other experiments in 2002 to test simplifications of the basic recipe .
One was the starter culture .
All the recipes I read had the yeast & nutriment mixed with a small amount of water and sugar in advance of being added to the demijohn .
This starter culture was to be made 2 hours to a day , depending upon the recipe , in advance and some recipes had it warmed .
I think the purpose was originally to ensure that the yeast was growing strongly enough from the start to out compete any rival microbes growing in the demijohn , a requirement no longer needed in a sterile system .
An experiment showed that this was not vital ( although it might speed up the start of brewing ) and so could be missed out and the dried yeast simply added directly to the demijohn and so I shortened the recipe .
The other was increasing the sugar level slowly to enable the yeast to acclimatize to the growing ethanol concentration .
However , experimentation showed that this was not vital either ( possibly because the slow dissolution of the granulated sugar has this affect anyway ) but I left 3 stages of sugar ( and liquid ) adding because it reduces the risk of initial frothing messily overflowing through the bubble - lock and because ( in experimental brews ) less ingredients are wasted if ( as with the cola one ) it totally fails .

By : Trace Mayer , J.D. On 9 December 2009 Representative Ron Paul introduced H.R. 4248 the Free Competition in Currency Act of 2009 .
This
Act has the potential to impact the investment world more than any other legislation that has been enacted for decades .
The impact on the bond market , Treasury market , stock market and general economy would be tremendous and disruptive .
The aims of the Act are fairly simple to ( 1 ) repeal federal law which currently decrees unconstitutional forms of currency legal tender , ( 2 ) prohibit federal taxes on gold , silver , platinum , palladium or rhodium bullion , ( 3 ) prohibit States from assessing tax or fees on any currency or monetary instrument used in interstate or foreign commerce that has legal tender status under the United States Constitution , ( 4 ) repeal federal criminal code pertaining to gold , silver or other metal coins and nullify any previous convictions under those codes .
Like he has often been when attempting to restore the checks and balances of the Constitution on this issue with H.R. 4248 Dr. Ron Paul is the lone voice in the wilderness and has no co-sponsors .
To my knowledge the only legislation Dr. Ron Paul has introduced that has been approved and enacted is Public Law 99 - 185 and Public Law 99 - 61 which require under 31 United States Code 5,112 that � the Secretary shall mint and issue , in quantities sufficient to meet public demand , coins which � contain .999 fine silver or fine gold .
When the public wants to buy gold or silver , lawful money , there should be enough !
H.R. 1207 � FEDERAL RESERVE TRANSPARENCY
ACT OF 2009 On 26 February 2009 Representative Ron Paul of Texas introduced H.R. 1207 the Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2009 .
Most in the financial establishment chuckled , politicians ignored it and the general public was clueless as to its effect .
But because of rapid education of the public and the political pain they exerted on the politicians the bill now has 317 co-sponsors .
To fully understand the impact of the H.R. 4248 legislation it is important to take a short journey through American legal history .
CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL TENDER Under Article 1 Section 8 Clause 5 Congress is given the power to � Coin Money , regulate the Value thereof� .
Notice the Constitution does not say what money is only that it is something that is coined rather than printed .
The Tenth Amendment states , � The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . �
The Constitution operates on the principle that if a power is not specifically delegated then it is prohibited .
In this case , the Federal Government is given no authority to make anything legal tender .
The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 was enacted by Congress creating the Federal Reserve and it would not be the first unconstitutional legislation .
They habitually violate their own laws .
Because Congress does not have the power to declare anything legal tender and because the Federal Reserve was created by Congress therefore it follows that the Federal Reserve cannot declare anything legal tender .
The individual States do retain the power to declare things legal tender but are restricted under Article 1 Section 10 Clause 1 from making any � Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts� .
The creature cannot exceed the creator .
The Founding Fathers strongly supported the hard money system .
After all , they had just fought a Revolution after living through the tyranny of King George with the Stamp Act , Writs of Assistance , destruction from the the Continental hyperinflation and implosion of the economy .
Despite the constraints of the Constitution the monetary system of the United States has been perpetually in violation .
For example , the United States Dollar or Federal Reserve Note Dollar went poof multiple times last century including on 5 April 1933 when FDR decreed gold to be a dangerous weapon of mass financial destruction , deemed it a controlled substance and threatened any United States citizen with jail time for owning it , on 4 June , 1963 and 24 June 1968 when silver certificate redemption was completely ceased and 15 August 1971 during the Nixon shock .
WHAT IS A DOLLAR ?
Dr. Edwin Vieira , J.D. , is the author of the preeminent legal treatise on monetary jurisprudence in American law Pieces Of Eight , holds four degrees from Harvard and practices law before the United States Supreme Court .
I highly recommend reading Dr. Vieira�s entire essay , What Is A Dollar ? , which is quoted only in small part here : 2 . Do the present monetary statutes intelligibly define the �dollar�� ?
Unfortunately , the present monetary statutes do not define the �dollar� in an intelligible fashion .
a. Federal Reserve Notes .
Most people associate the noun �dollar� with the Federal Reserve Note ( �FRN� ) �dollar bill , � engraved with the portrait of President George Washington .
This association is mistaken .
No statute defines � or ever has defined � the �one dollar� FRN as the �dollar , � or even as a species of �dollar . �
Moreover , the United States Code provides that FRNs � shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the Treasury Department of the United States * * * or at any Federal Reserve bank .�
4
Thus , FRNs are not themselves �lawful money � � otherwise , they would not be �redeemable in lawful money . �
And if FRNs are not even �lawful money , � it is inconceivable that they are somehow �dollars , � the very units in which all � United States money is expressed . � 5 b. United States coins .
The situation with coinage is more complex , but equally ( if not more ) confusing .
The United States Code provides for three different types of coinage denominated in �dollars� : namely , base - metallic coinage , gold coinage , and silver coinage .
c. Currency of �equal purchasing power� .
The UnitedStates Code provides no answer to this perplexing question .
Indeed , it mandates that the question should not even be capable of being asked .
For the Code commands that � the Secretary [ of the Treasury ] shall redeem gold certificates owned by the Federal reserve banks at times and in amounts the Secretary decides are necessary to maintain the equal purchasing power of each kind of United States currency .
14 The term dollar is used in Article 1 Section 9 Clause 1 and the Seventh Amendment .
Neither the slave - trade faction nor the right to trial by jury would have accepted these provisions without a clear definition of what the dollar is .
Therefore , their support of these provisions inferentially establishes what a literal reading of them straightforwardly suggests : to wit , that the noun �dollar� refers , not to a mere name applicable to whatever Congress whimsically might decide thereafter to call a �dollar , � but instead to a particular coin so familiar in American experience as to be beyond political transmogrification .
�
Obviously , Jefferson�s free - market , scientific approach is a world apart from the arbitrary way in which Congress has set up the mutually incompatible and internally irrational sets of silver , gold , and base - metallic coins that exist today .
2 ) The Coinage Act of 1792 .
Little more than a year after Hamilton�s Report , Congress enacted its principles into law .
Section 9 of the Coinage Act of 1792 contained the monetary definitions for the United States monetary system and defined DOLLARS or UNITS � each to be of the value of a Spanish milled dollar as the same is now current , and to contain three hundred and seventy one grains and four sixteenth parts of a grain of pure , or four hundred and sixteen grains of standard silver .
THE COINAGE ACT OF 1792
It is interesting to see the difference between how the Founding Fathers and the current politicians deal with those who engage in quantitative easing .
For example , on 21 November 2002 at the National Economists Club in Washington DC Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said , A little parable may prove useful : Today an ounce of gold sells for $ 300 , more or less .
Now suppose that a modern alchemist solves his subject�s oldest problem by finding a way to produce unlimited amounts of new gold at essentially no cost .
Moreover , his invention is widely publicized and scientifically verified , and he announces his intention to begin massive production of gold within days .
What would happen to the price of gold ?
Presumably , the potentially unlimited supply of cheap gold would cause the market price of gold to plummet .
Indeed , if the market for gold is to any degree efficient , the price of gold would collapse immediately after the announcement of the invention , before the alchemist had produced and marketed a single ounce of yellow metal .
What has this got to do with monetary policy ?
Like gold , U.S. dollars have value only to the extent that they are strictly limited in supply .
But the U.S. government has a technology , called a printing press ( or , today , its electronic equivalent ) , that allows it to produce as many U.S. dollars as it wishes at essentially no cost .
By increasing the number of U.S. dollars in circulation , or even by credibly threatening to do so , the U.S. government can also reduce the value of a dollar in terms of goods and services , which is equivalent to raising the prices in dollars of those goods and services .
Section 19 of the 1792 Coinage Act provided : SEC . 19 .
And be it further enacted , That if any of the gold or silver coins which shall be struck or coined at the said mint shall be debased or made worse as to the proportion of fine gold or fine silver therein contained , or shall be of less weight or value than the same ought to be pursuant to the directions of this act , through the default or with the connivance of any of the officers or persons who shall be employed at the said mint , for the purpose of profit or gain , or otherwise with a fraudulent intent , and if any of the said officers or persons shall embezzle any of the metals which shall at any time be committed to their charge for the purpose of being coined , or any of the coins which shall be struck or coined at the said mint , every such officer or person who shall commit any or either of the said offences , shall be deemed guilty of felony , and shall suffer death .
As David Reilly of Bloomberg reported on 29 January 2010 in Secret Banking Cabal Emerges From AIG Shadows : Later , when it became clear information would be disclosed , New York Fed legal group staffer James Bergin e-mailed colleagues saying : � I have to think this train is probably going to leave the station soon and we need to focus our efforts on explaining the story as best we can .
There were too many people involved in the deals � too many counterparties , too many lawyers and advisors , too many people from AIG � to keep a determined Congress from the information . �
Think of the enormity of that statement .
A staffer at a body with little public accountability and that exists to serve bankers is lamenting the inability to keep Congress in the dark .
�
Now , I �m not saying Congress should be meddling in interest - rate decisions , or micro-managing bank regulation .
Nor do I think we should all don tin-foil hats and start ranting about the Trilateral Commission .
Yet when unelected and unaccountable agencies pick banking winners while trying to end - run Congress , even as taxpayers are forced to lend , spend and guarantee about $ 8 trillion to prop up the financial system , our collective blood should boil .
Reuters reported on 8 December 2009 that the Chinese do not put up with this type of financial terrorism : Yang Yanming was sentenced to death in late 2005 and took the secret of the whereabouts of 65 million yuan ( $ 9.52 million ) of the misappropriated funds to his grave , the Beijing Evening News said .
The report added that Yang was the first person working in China�s securities sector to be executed .
�
Conscious that the growing gap between rich and poor could generate resentment , China is battling corruption and stock trading abuses .
It has used the death penalty as a deterrent in serious cases .
It will be interesting to see if there is swing in the political attitude of the people towards the Federal Reserve engaging in quantitative easing .
As Dr. Ron Paul was the lone voice in the wilderness with calling for an audit of the Federal Reserve , is currently a lone voice about competing currencies and while he is joined by an increasingly shrill chorus condemning the bailouts he may yet become a lone voice in championing in introducing stiff legislation as a deterrent instead of rewarding the nefarious behavior with bailouts .
If legislation like the 1792 Coinage Act were to be passed then there would likely be a lot of rounding up to do .
Financial criminals , whether engaged in something large like unconstitutional legal tender or something small like a potential Monex fraud , should take heed .
CURRENCY CONTROLS
Many currency controls are in place which support the FRN $ by hindering its competitors such as gold , silver , platinum , palladium or rhodium .
H.R. 4248 intends to remove these barriers .
More may be implemented and holders of FRN $ may their usefulness and velocity frozen .
For example , there are �qualified intermediary � rules the Infernal Revenue Service require foreign banks to follow even where legislation protects bank privacy .
The PATRIOT Act allows for �sneak and peak� warrants along with the ability to confiscate cash at will and in secret .
A particularly insidious but scarcely mentioned currency control was implemented by the United States Mint on 14 December 2006 which provided : The United States Mint has implemented regulations to limit the exportation , melting , or treatment of one - cent ( penny ) and 5 - cent ( nickel ) United States coins , to safeguard against a potential shortage of these coins in circulation .
�
Prevailing prices of copper , nickel and zinc have caused the production costs of pennies and nickels to significantly exceed their respective face values .
� We are taking this action because the Nation needs its coinage for commerce , � said Director Ed Moy .
� We don�t want to see our pennies and nickels melted down so a few individuals can take advantage of the American taxpayer .
Replacing these coins would be an enormous cost to taxpayers .�
Specifically , the new regulations prohibit , with certain exceptions , the melting or treatment of all one - cent and 5 - cent coins .
The regulations also prohibit the unlicensed exportation of these coins , except that travelers may take up to $ 5 in these coins out of the country , and individuals may ship up to $ 100 in these coins out of the country in any one shipment for legitimate coinage and numismatic purposes .
In all essential respects , these regulations are patterned after the Department of the Treasury�s regulations prohibiting the exportation , melting , or treatment of silver coins between 1967 and 1969 , and the regulations prohibiting the exportation , melting , or treatment of one - cent coins between 1974 and 1978 .
The new regulations authorize a fine of not more than $ 10,000 , or imprisonment of not more than five years , or both , against a person who knowingly violates the regulations .
In addition , by law , any coins exported , melted , or treated in violation of the regulation shall be forfeited to the United States Government .
Better be careful with the amount of pocket change you take across the border into Mexico to buy gum .
You may find yourself unjustly criminally liable and headed to jail !
ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS
The Federal Reserve Note is a bill of credit , a debt instrument .
As Murray Rothbard observed on page 18 of his 1963 America�s Great Depression , � It is true that credit contraction may overcompensate , and , while contraction proceeds , it may cause interest rates to be higher than free - market levels , and investment lower than in the free market .
But since contraction causes no positive malinvestments , it will not lead to any painful period of depression and adjustment .�
Mr. Rothbard continues the observation that government policy can hobble the adjustment process by : � (1 ) Prevent or delay liquidation , ( 2 ) Inflate further , ( 3 ) Keep wage rates up , ( 4 ) Keep prices up , ( 5 ) Stimulate consumption and discourage saving and ( 6 ) Subsidize unemployment . �
H.R. 4248 would hasten the liquidation of the FRN $ credit instruments and hobble the government and central bank�s ability to inflate further .
Because the monetary metals are safe stores of value it would encourage savings .
The cascading effect this would have on wage rates , prices and the inability to subsidize unemployment would allow the country to recover from this greater depression much quicker .
UNAVOIDABLE COLLAPSE
The current unconstitutional monetary system will collapse .
It is not a matter of if but when .
Tremendous resources are being mashelled in an attempt to stop the collapse but it is about as effectual as a lone man putting forth his arm to stop the might Amazon from flowing or some costumed King named Cnut decreeing that the tide should not rise .
Economic law will takes it course .
As Ludwig von Mises predicted decades ago in chapter 20 of Human Action , �
The boom can last only as long as the credit expansion progresses at an ever - accelerated pace . �
But then finally the masses wake up . � A breakdown occurs .
The crack - up boom appears .�
The fiat currency system with the Federal Reserve Note dollar as the world reserve currency is in the process of and will eventually completely breakdown and fail .
There is no easy solution .
The more capital is misallocated through bailouts the more painful the liquidation and correction will be .
Dr. Ron Paul�s legislative prescription to the monetary ailments is like taking a drug addict off drugs ; the simplest , most ethical and most likely solution to put America back in a position to generate freedom , peace and prosperity .
To ignore H.R. 4248 and continue with the current monetary system is like giving an alcoholic a stolen bottle of whisky to cure his headache ; while it may mask the pain in the short term it causes more damage , is immoral to steal the whisky and will lead to a worse headache later .
CONCLUSION
With unlimited greed , insatiable and imprudent desires in Wall Street and Washington it must be that the whole operation must combine and climax in an unsustainable debt bubble that either implodes in a depression or erupts in hyperinflation .
But in the grand design , gold and silver�s primary role are not as economic tools , insurance against depression or hyperinflation , but guarantors of liberty when actually used in ordinary daily transactions .
Gold , silver and the other precious metals protect against confiscation through inflation which is a form of taxation without representation or due process of law .
These shiny metals are not mere barbaric commodities but essential checks and balances in the American political machinery .
Thus , the fight over of competing currencies is about more than just wealth .
It is a fight with only two destinies : freedom of choice or coercion .
To realize the first and vanish the second will not have too high a price because without it you will have paid the ultimate anyway without a return .
Dr. Ron Paul�s H.R. 4248 the Free Competition in Currency
Act of 2009 would return America to a Constitutional monetary system , lay the foundation for freedom , peace and prosperity and clear up the unintelligible federal law in these regards .
For these reasons I endorse this legislation .

A surgeon in New Zealand has received a dressing down for swearing at a severely obese patient .
The female patient made the complaint after a very tense consultation with her surgeon last year .
The New Zealand Herald newspaper reports the doctor said " f... " at least three times after the 44 - year - old obese woman told him she did not like the word " diet " and preferred the term " lifestyle " .
The doctor told his patient she was " going on a f...ing diet " .
The woman was on a waiting list for gastric bypass surgery .
After she complained about his swearing , she received a letter from the surgeon saying they no longer had a " therapeutic relationship " and her name had been removed from his waiting list .
The doctor has admitted using bad language .
New Zealand 's Health and Disability Commissioner said the conduct was insulting and unprofessional and he has recommended the surgeon attend a communication skills course .
I held a 6 - hour workshop at NSConference in both the UK and USA recently , focusing on software design and user experience .
Predictably , an extremely popular topic was the iPad , and how to approach the design of iPad applications .
I gave a 90 - minute presentation on the subject to start each workshop , and I want to share some of my observations here .
Please note : this is about the user interface conventions and considerations which apply to creating software for the iPad platform ( and touch - screen tablet devices in general ) .
It is not a technical discussion of iPad- related APIs ( which remain under NDA at time of writing in early March 2010 ) .
As I watched the iPad introduction keynote , there was one thing above all which struck me :
That ’s iWork ( Keynote , Pages and Numbers ) for iPad .
It ’s also a message .
It 's not just a big iPhone
The iPad may be a larger version of the iPhone in terms of the hardware and operating system , but treating it as the same device would be foolish .
It turns out that increasing the display size of touch - screen hardware can transform it into an entirely new class of device .
The iPad is a productivity platform in a way that the iPhone rightly never tried to be .
( And it ’s officially OK to charge $ 9.99 per app . )
When Steve Jobs introduced the iPad , he did so in a very specific way :
The iPad is in the middle , between the iPhone and the Mac .
This is n’t just an acknowledgement of relative display size or processing power , it ’s also a strong indication of the market position of the device and its software .
The iPad is a target for apps from the desktop , not just from smartphones .
There are some very interesting opportunities here .
The Missing Link
We already have iPhone apps on the iPad ( they can run at their native size in the middle of the screen , or be scaled up to fit ) .
That ’s useful , but it ’s not particularly interesting .
Far more relevantly , we can bring desktop - class applications to iPad - but we need to rethink our user interface and design in general .
What works on iPhone wo n’t automatically work on iPad .
The essence of the new opportunities on iPad is that this class of device is a natural home not just for the viewers and small utilities we ’ve seen on our phones , but also for creators and editors as we see on desktop platforms .
Productivity applications , and sophisticated workflows .
There are entire genres of applications which have n’t been truly feasible on an iPhone OS device until now ; this is an opportunity to literally pioneer a high - profile touch - screen version of those applications .
In order to work out how to do that effectively , we need to talk about what exactly is different about the iPad compared to the touch - screen smartphone platforms .
It all comes down to input and output .
The display is much larger ; 1024x768 pixels .
Apps with more demanding presentation requirements will be at home here .
The virtual keyboard is larger , and external physical keyboards are supported via Bluetooth or the dock .
Apps which focus on typing are now much more feasible .
The iPhone supports multi-touch , but only the iPad can credibly claim to support two hands .
We 'll talk more about this later .
These facts lead to a shift in how we can think about what applications and interfaces can exist on the iPad .
We just need a set of guidelines to follow .
The iPad introduces and lends itself to some new UI conventions .
I ’ve compiled a list of thoughts that I ’m going to discuss below .
Some of these are simply from looking at the built - in apps on the iPad , and some are subjective impressions .
Master - Detail
This is n’t new , but it ’s new to the iPhone OS platform .
Master - Detail is an interface concept whereby you can see both a list of things , and also additional information about the currently - selected thing in the list .
On iPhone , either the Master or the Detail was visible , but not both - there was n’t room .
On iPad , we can again have Master - Detail , as exemplified by Mail :
This gives us an easy set of conventions :
Master - Detail is feasible and acceptable on iPad .
In landscape , both Master and Detail are visible .
In portrait , the Master is shown in a transient pop-over .
Two - pane and three - pane interfaces are once again worthy of consideration on this class of device .
Look like a Viewer
The primary warning about designing for the iPad is : more screen space does n’t mean more UI .
You ’ll be tempted to violate that principle , and you need to resist the temptation .
It ’s OK to have UI available to cover your app ’s functionality , but a bigger screen does n’t mean it should all be visible at once .
Hide configuration UI until needed .
Look like a viewer , and behave like an editor .
Pages looks like a beautiful reading app :
until you interact with something to display relevant editing UI :
This leads us naturally to the next point .
Edit in place
On the Mac and other desktop platforms , there ’s a convention where we have globally - positioned editing UI .
Common examples include floating inspector palettes , toolbars , menus , and status - bars .
That wo n’t fly on the iPad , because it introduces a level of indirection between the editing action and the object being edited .
It ’s a touch - screen device ; we should interact and edit directly .
Edit object properties in place .
Attach the editing UI to the object .
Show / hide / move as necessary .
For example , when you edit transition / build animations in Keynote , you do so on the actual object to be animated :
Upon adding an animation , the list of available types is similarly attached to the relevant object :
The same goes for slides as a whole :
It ’s a good principle to follow ; it ’s direct and immediate , and it ’s intuitive for a device where it feels like you ’re interacting with the actual objects using your fingers .
Inspectors should be Contextual
There can , however , sometimes be value in keeping standard editing interfaces in standard positions ; the key consideration is how much UI to show .
On the desktop , this is something we often get wrong .
Here are two familiar examples :
These inspectors ( for Keynote and Microsoft Word on the Mac ) are difficult to use because they show all possible editing controls at once , disabling those which do n’t apply to whatever is selected .
It ’s not easy to find which options apply to what you ’re editing at the time , and the density of controls requires the pixel - precision of a mouse pointer and considerable screen space to display .
On the iPad , any globally - positioned inspectors should nonetheless be contextual in terms of what editing UI they show .
Do n’t overload the user with irrelevant options ; hide anything that does n’t apply .
If you ’re editing text , show only text editing controls :
If you ’re editing a chart , show only options relevant to charts :
The guideline is simple , and it ’s good advice even for the desktop :
Inspectors should present context - relevant UI .
Hide controls which do n't apply to the selection or focus .
The concept of context is key to iPad software design .
In human - computer interaction , we often discuss this under the title of modes .
Use Modes to simplify UI
Modes , or modal interfaces , are where the user deals just with one particular area of a piece of software at a time .
They see only the relevant controls and information for one particular task or type of work ; an example would be iPhoto ’s photo - editing interface , or the Ribbon in the recent versions of the Microsoft Office applications .
There ’s been a history of modes getting some bad press on the desktop .
The issue is that they trade stability ( things always being in exactly the same place in the UI , and not changing ) for simplicity ( not having too many controls to look through at once ) .
On the iPad , it ’s clear where the winning side of the balance is : simplicity .
Modes are completely appropriate on this device .
The challenge is in keeping our UI clear and uncluttered .
Not only that , but our UI has to be actually usable with a finger - an incredibly imprecise , enormous , screen - hiding input device - rather than a pixel - perfect mouse pointer .
Modes can help us keep plenty of space around .
Move UI elements into modes , and / or position them contextually and temporarily - but just do n’t go overboard with the number of modes .
Modes are preferable to clutter .
But removing a feature might be preferable to adding a mode for it .
The modal organisation of features is better than an all - at - once approach , but do n’t let it become an excuse for feature creep .
One of the primary rules of iPad app design must surely be that less is more .
Fewer Features
Feature - creep or bloat is the bane of desktop software .
Any application with a non-trivial feature set is n’t fully used by most of its users ; that ’s pretty obvious to anyone who has ever used Microsoft Office or Adobe Photoshop or even the iWork apps on the Mac .
There are plenty of features there which you ’ll never touch , and would probably never miss if they were gone .
Most users need only a small set of features , and software is better when it ’s focused .
A nice side - effect of focused software is that the UI is easier to design and comprehend ( because there ’s less of it , and it ’s more obvious why each thing is there ) .
The trick is to figure out which small set of features are actually important , and implement only those .
Offer only the most - used / needed features .
If in any doubt , remove a feature .
Discard optional / niche or highly configurable functionality .
This is another rule which is equally true for the desktop .
The difference is that people have been trained to accept fuzzy - edged applications on their computers , whereas they probably wo n’t do so on the iPad .
Be focused , targeted and comprehensible .
You can add things later when it becomes clear what ’s important , but you ’ll never recover from a confusing first impression .
Two Hands
Many people are excited about the fact the iPad is large enough to support two whole hands providing input simultaneously .
The hardware support is no different from the iPhone , but the available space certainly is .
Suddenly we have visions of really usable card games and air hockey and so forth ; it ’s hard to underestimate the importance of this factor .
The worrying thing is that I ’ve heard people talking about providing twice the UI , with strips of buttons and controls down both sides of the screen , just because there ’s enough room for that kind of thing now .
Resist that temptation at all costs .
The way to support dual - handed input on the iPad is in a discoverable and optional way .
There are a couple of interesting examples in Keynote :
During the iPad introduction keynote , Phil Schiller was using Keynote on the device , and demonstrated some subtle dual - hand input features .
Whilst resizing a photo , you can tap another photo with your other hand and the one you ’re resizing will match that other photo ’s size .
Similarly , whilst dragging a slide you can tap other slides with your other hand to add them to the group being dragged , thus moving them all at once .
The important point is that there are other , more obvious ways to accomplish these things ; the two - handed input features are conveniences and power - user features .
They ’re useful and time - saving and possibly discoverable , but they ’re not the only way to accomplish those tasks .
We ’re only just beginning to come to terms with the possibilities of dual - handed input ; essential functionality should n’t require it yet .
Dual - handed input is acceptable .
Be usable with one hand .
Do n't require two hands for essential features .
But do n't be afraid to offer time - saving , discoverable dual - handed functionality .
The fact that users can use their hands to interact is something to capitalise on ; it ’s a very important aspect of the attraction to this type of device .
Understandably , it ’s rooted in human psychology .
Use the Psychology of Touch
This is where it gets touchy - feely , and thus where we engineers are least comfortable .
It ’s also where we find the explanation as to why your grandmother wants an iPad but would n’t touch a Mac or PC .
The twin key factors are touch , and the device ’s unique form - factor .
Touch is emotionally important to humans ; it conveys the identity and “ realness ” of an object .
Direct touch bypasses abstraction and creates a strong connection with the touched object .
This is particularly true when the object itself triggers associations in our minds .
Due to its very size and weight and display area , the iPad triggers powerful associations with :
Printed documents
Notepads of paper
File - folders from the filing cabinet
Clipboards
Books
There is something intrinsically “ right ” about seeing the iPad as a technological successor to , or version of , these physical objects .
We ’re immediately ready to accept the one as a substitute or enhancement for the other .
This is a powerful , and novel , position for the iPad software developer .
It was n’t true with the iPhone or iPod Touch ; the devices are too physically small .
The “ Notes ” app on the iPhone will forever be a simulation of a legal pad ; the similar app on the iPad is a legal pad ( to your user ) .
It ’s an incredibly important distinction in terms of how it influences our design .
There ’s a predilection towards “ realness ” on the iPad which overrides mere fashion and aesthetics as seen on the iPhone ; it ’s a core component of the attraction of the hardware .
The standard apps on the iPad build directly on this by using virtual materials .
The form - filling view in Numbers is a good example :
We ’ve all clipped those card dividers into our binders , and seen them become dog-eared .
We know how the slightly waxy laser - printer paper feels , and we ’ve bent and reshaped that paperclip a thousand times .
These are real things , presented virtually .
We ’ve all been in the room with these varnished bookshelves , lit by afternoon sunlight .
We ’ve all bought a new novel , opened it and guiltily buried our nose in the pages just to enjoy the smell of books .
We ’ve all used this legal pad to sketch ideas .
Perhaps we ’ve even seen it on the telephone table in the study or hallway , slid into its leather slip - case with an index sheet ( all those things are visible in the interface above if you look for them ) .
We ’ve all seen this quality day - planner and wished we had the discipline to use it , because it ’s a beautiful analogue thing in an increasingly digital world .
We ’ve paid ridiculous prices for Moleskines and diaries and fountain pens .
We ’ve all seen this address book sitting on a desk , hard - bound and meticulously re-indexed , with a red fabric bookmark sitting loosely over the cover .

Key Questions
In summary , when approaching iPad app design , do so in a way that acknowledges the strengths and unique advantages of the device and platform .
Ask yourself these questions :
What are the core features ?
How can I remove some of them ?
How can I make this work on a touchscreen device ?
How do I create an emotional connection ?
How can I make my app uniquely suited to iPad ?
Do n’t ship before testing on an actual device , and remember that first impressions last - take the time to get it right .
Do n’t assume that what works on iPhone will be equally suited to iPad , and certainly do n’t generalise from desktop software .
There ’s a unique and exciting opportunity here , and just possibly the beginning of the next major stage in software design and user experience .
You ’re getting in on the ground floor , and there ’s every reason to be optimistic .
Good luck .

How to discredit Mein Kampf
My copy of Mein Kampf sits on a shelf in my study , along with a couple of dozen books on World War II .
It was the first book ever translated by the late Ralph Manheim ( who also translated the works of Gunter Grass and others ) and published by Houghton Mifflin in 1943 .
I ’ve used it to prepare lectures on the Second World War , where I quote a few of Hitler ’s more lurid and bizarre passages in order to convey to students the dangerous world - view from which Nazism sprang .
I mention this because authorities in Bavaria are reportedly trying to prevent new editions of this book from being published in Germany ( where it has been banned ) , now that the original copyright ( which is controlled by the Bavarian government ) is about to run out .
Their concern , which is understandable but in my view overstated , is that neo - Nazi groups will use the expiration of copyright as an opportunity to disseminate Hitler ’s hateful ideas anew .
I think this is a mistake .
In addition to being filled with a lot of appalling racist claptrap , Mein Kampf is an awful book - turgid , tedious , badly organized , and mostly boring .
So the danger that a German edition it will win a lot of new converts seems remote .
Second , it ’s widely available in pirated versions on the Internet and in plenty of other countries ( including the Untied States ) , so anybody with neo - Nazi sympathies can get a copy already .
But most importantly , the best way to deal with a book like Mein Kampf is to expose it to light , demolish its “ arguments , ” and remind everyone where Hitler ’s world - view ultimately led .
Apart from its obvious xenophobia and anti-Semitism , the book is filled with historical falsehoods , bogus prescriptions and sophomoric attempts at philosophy .
If you want fascism to remain a marginalized social phenomenon , allowing qualified historians to dissect Hitler ’s ideas is a better antidote than censorship .
After acknowledging the legitimate sensitivities of some who oppose publication , Stephen Kramer , secretary - general of the Central Council of Jews in Germany , wisely counseled that the best course was not censorship but an open effort to put the work in context , with an appropriate commentary .
As he told the Times , “ Those who are already on the wrong side already have the book and already read it from their own point of view .
Let ’s get it out there , and let ’s get it out there with a commentary .
” Furthermore , banning publication would just let extremists argue that elites are conspiring to keep some valuable “ wisdom ” away from the people , and a few nutjobs might even believe them .
Two additional lessons are worth remembering as well .
Books like Mein Kampf remind us that bizarre , incoherent , and hateful ideas can sometimes win over enough people to sway a nation and ultimately help lead to the deaths of millions .
When you actually look at the the book , and read about the history of Nazism , it may be hard to believe that serious people in an advanced society could be persuaded by arguments of this sort .
But they were .
And while Hitler may be the extreme case , we live in an era where plenty of political ( and I regret to say , religious ) figures offer all sorts of memoirs and tracts of their own , some of them nearly as bizarre and illogical ( if not as murderous ) as Hitler ’s infamous tome .
And I regret to say that some of them have a significant following .
The second lesson , of course , is that following beliefs of this sort was not only a tragedy for millions of innocent people in Europe , but it was also a disaster for Germany itself .
Anyone who is ignorant enough to be attracted by the program set forth in Mein Kampf needs to be reminded about what Hitler ’s world - view produced .
In addition to directly causing the deaths of millions , his leadership led to Germany being extensively bombed , occupied by several foreign armies , divided for nearly half a century , and regarded with suspicion for many decades thereafter .
Thus Hitler was not only one of history ’s greatest criminals , but also one of history ’s greatest failures .
Mein Kampf is a blueprint for disaster , and anyone who might find it inspirational needs to be reminded of that fact .
The marketplace of ideas is n’t perfect , but I have enough faith in it to believe that you can put Mein Kampf on a bookshelf in Germany today — preferably in an annotated edition that exposes all of its errors — and that the net effect will be to further discredit one of the darkest chapters in modern human history .
An 80 - year - old man believed he was following the Bible when he used an alkathene pipe to punish a child for stealing $ 1000 from him .
The man , who has interim named suppression , yesterday pleaded guilty in the New Plymouth District Court to two charges of assaulting a child and assault with a blunt instrument between November 1 and December 7 .
When arrested , the man told police that he was frustrated by the child 's behaviour and had been " seeking to correct him in the manner described in the Bible " .
His lawyer , Paul Keegan , said the incident was out of character for the man .
" He is a Christian man and believes firmly in traditional methods of discipline , " he said .
Judge David Ongley said there was a firm belief in the community that there should be no unnecessary force used to discipline children , that it was not acceptable and required a penalty .
The defendant was allowed interim name suppression until sentencing on February 12 .
Port - au - Prince , Haiti ( CNN ) --
A man pulled alive from the rubble of a building in Haiti 's capital Monday may have been trapped since the January 12 quake that leveled much of the city , doctors reported .
The 28 - year - old man , identified as Evan Muncie , was found in the wreckage of a market where he sold rice , his family told staff at a University of Miami field hospital .
He suffered from extreme dehydration and malnutrition , but did not appear to have significant crushing injuries , the doctors said .
" He was emaciated .
He had n't had anything in quite some time .
He had open wounds that were festering on both of his feet , " said Dr. Mike Connelly , of the university 's Project Medishare .
The people who brought him to the hospital said they found the man while digging out the marketplace , Connelly said .
i Reporter Michael Andrew brought Muncie 's story to light while working with the 82nd Canadian Naval unit .
Read Andrew 's account of the discovery
The man told doctors that someone was bringing him water while he was trapped , but doctors told CNN that he sounded confused and at times appeared to believe he was still under the rubble .
Connelly said the man must have had some water during the past month to have survived , but Connelly was n't sure how he would have had access to it .
" Initially , I 'm sure he had his senses with him , so maybe he was able to find some kind of resources , " Connelly told CNN .
The discovery came nearly a month after the magnitude - 7.0 earthquake that devastated Port - au - Prince on January 12 .
More than 200,000 deaths have been blamed on the quake .
Haiti's government declared search - and - rescue efforts over on January 23 , but survivors still were being unearthed as late as January 27 .

Back in May last year , the US government launched Data.gov as a statement of transparency , and the Internet rejoiced .
After the launch , excitement kind of fizzled with the actual Data.gov site , but big cities like San Francisco , New York , and Toronto got in on the open data party .
Then just a couple of weeks ago , Data.gov.uk launched , which brought me back to the US counterpart .
How do the two compare ?
Here ’s my take .
Behind the Application
The two applications are very similar on the surface .
They catalog government data .
Look a little closer though , and you ’ll see that they ’re actually really different in purpose , design , and end results .
These key differences stem directly from those who were involved in the creation of each .
Data.gov : According to FAQ , it was developed by the Federal CIO Council , as in Chief Information Officers Council .
Here ’s their main role in government , which sounds a lot like information science :
The CIO Council serves as the principal interagency forum for improving practices in the design , modernization , use , sharing , and performance of Federal Government agency information resources .
Data.gov.uk :
It was a much more tech - oriented operation from the UK side with Tim Berners - Lee and Nigel Shadbolt advising .
Shadbolt is a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of Southampton and Berners - Lee is credited with inventing the World Wide Web .
Winner : Toss up .
While the computer science backgrounds can lead to good implementation , the information science crew took on organizing the many many US agencies .
However the UK had the Web inventor .
Yeah , gotta give the edge to the UK .
Data
Now let ’s get into the actual data .
When Data.gov first launched there were only forty something datasets , but the collection has since grown to several hundred .
Data.gov.uk , on the other hand , started with a few hundred .
Data.gov :
It links directly to data files in various formats including CSV , XML , Excel , and KML .
A lot seems to be lacking though .
For example , there ’s no basic demographic data like population from the Census Bureau .
You think that ’s where they ’d start .
Maybe the Open Government Directive , which instructs Executive departments to publish three “ high - value ” data sets , might help this along .
Data.gov.uk : Instead of hosting the data , the UK took a link catalog approach .
To the end user this does n’t make a huge difference .
As long as you get the data , you ’re good , but from a developer standpoint , it ’s a lot easier to catalog links than files .
Winner : Data.gov.uk .
A quick browse through the available data sets on both sites will show you the wider range of topics on Data.gov.uk .
Design and Usability
One looks like a government website .
The other sports a more modern design .
Data.gov :
At launch , Data.gov did n’t look all that bad to me , but then I tried to use the site and find some data .
The main flaw I saw was in the data browser .
I was n’t looking for a particular data set .
I just wanted to browse , so I ’d select an agency and search .
The problem is that a lot of the listed agencies do n’t have any data cataloged .
Data.gov.uk : Navigation through the site was very familiar using common netspeak like tags and apps .
I felt more engaged .
Winner : Data.gov.uk .
Both could use a data preview though .
Projects
Data.gov :
Other than the “ join the dialogue ” section on a separate domain and the pitch on the homepage , Data.gov makes little effort to highlight or promote any projects that use the data from the site .
The focus is on a repository .
What you do with the data does n’t seem to matter much .
At least Sunlight Labs is making an effort .
Data.gov.uk : Lists recent apps and has an idea submission section .
They clearly want you to use the data with a developer - centric approach .
Winner : Data.gov.uk .
It ’s all about engaging with data over creating a catalog .
Bottom Line
While Data.gov.uk was just recently launched publicly , it has many advantages over Data.gov .
It ’s easier to use and geared towards developers , who , let ’s face it , are the only ones who are going to do more with the data than open it up in Excel .
Data.gov has some catching up to do .
Both still have a long way to go .
Both are good steps in the right direction .
SEMITAY BAZAAR , Afghanistan —
After the declaration this weekend that the battle for the Taliban enclave of Marja had been won , for the Marines standing behind sandbags and walking patrols , the more complicated work has begun .
With it will be a test of the strategy selected by President Obama and the generals now running the Afghan war .
After months of preparation for the largest offensive in Afghanistan since 2001 , and two weeks of fighting and moving forces around a sprawling desert battlefield , the last pieces of the campaign ’s opening push into a Taliban enclave had come together by the weekend .
Marine units were finishing sweeps of contested ground , clearing the last stretches of roads of hidden bombs , and reinforcing hastily erected patrol bases and outposts .
More Afghan government forces were arriving , increasing the manpower to counter the Taliban fighters engaged in the guerrillas ’ routine of emplacing booby traps and challenging Marine patrols with hit - and - run fights .
The transition from deliberate combat operations to creating security for the often lackluster Afghan government was under way .
A set of tasks more complex than fighting was ahead : encouraging the population of Marja to accept , much less support , an outside government presence .
congrats to her , do n't know why everyone has to be all " omgosh loser " about it , she did something she enjoys .
I look around at people collecting pieces of paper , be it comics or books ... some to not even open them , in my eyes that 's a loser .
to own something for the sake of the ' value ' of owning it , with no intention ever to sell it .
that is ' lulz loser ' to me =/

This device is lovingly called the SPINmaster .
[ Linux - works ] built it to spin up multiple hard drives before the motherboard starts up .
It detects the power - up from the PSU and uses a relay to hold the motherboard in reset , indicated by the red LED .
Each of four relays then spins up a hard drive and illuminates the green LED when ready .
Once all green lights come on the reset relay shuts off and the bios starts up .

Nearly one month after passengers foiled an attempted suicide bomb attack aboard Northwest Airlines Flight 253 as it approached Detroit on Christmas Day , new information reveals that the White House and U.S. security agencies had specific intelligence on accused terrorist , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , far earlier than previously acknowledged .
Along with new reports , evidence suggests that the administration ’s cover - up of the affair has very little to do with a failure by the intelligence apparatus to “ connect the dots ” and may have far more serious political implications for the Obama administration , and what little remains of a functioning democracy in the United States , than a botched bombing .
What the White House and security officials have previously described only as “ vague ” intercepts regarding “ a Nigerian ” has now morphed into a clear picture of the suspect–and the plot .
The New York Times revealed January 18 that the National Security Agency “ learned from a communications intercept of Qaeda followers in Yemen that a man named “ Umar Farouk ” – the first two names of the jetliner suspect , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab–had volunteered for a coming operation . ”
According to Times ’ journalists Eric Lipton , Eric Schmitt and Mark Mazzetti , “ the American intelligence network was clearly listening in Yemen and sharing that information . ”
Indeed , additional NSA intercepts in December “ mentioned the date of Dec. 25 , and suggested that they were ‘ looking for ways to get somebody out ’ or ‘ for ways to move people to the West , ’ one senior administration official said . ”
Clearly , the administration was “ worried about possible terrorist attacks over the Christmas holiday . ”
These concerns led President Obama to meet December 22 “ with top officials of the C.I.A. , F.B.I. and Department of Homeland Security , who ticked off a list of possible plots against the United States and how their agencies were working to disrupt them , ” the Times reports .
“ In a separate White House meeting that day ” the Times disclosed , “ Mr. Obama ’s homeland security adviser , John O. Brennan , led talks on Yemen , where a stream of disturbing intelligence had suggested that Qaeda operatives were preparing for some action , perhaps a strike on an American target , on Christmas Day . ”
In mid-January , Newsweek reported that the “ White House report on the foiled Christmas Day attempted airliner bombing provided only the sketchiest of details about what may have been the most politically sensitive of its findings : how the White House itself was repeatedly warned about the prospect of an attack on the U.S. , ” Mark Hosenball and Michael Isikoff disclosed .
According to the newsmagazine , “ intelligence analysts had ‘ highlighted ’ an evolving ‘ strategic threat , ' ” and that “ ‘ some of the improvised explosive device tactics AQAP might use against U.S. interests were highlighted ’ in other ‘ finished intelligence products ’ . ”
However , the real bombshell came last Wednesday during hearings before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee when Bushist embed , and current Director of the National Counterterrorism Center ( NCTC ) , Michael E. Leiter , made a startling admission .
CongressDaily reported on January 22 that intelligence officials “ have acknowledged the government knowingly allows foreigners whose names are on terrorist watch lists to enter the country in order to track their movement and activities . ”
Leiter told the Committee : “ I will tell you , that when people come to the country and they are on the watch list , it is because we have generally made the choice that we want them here in the country for some reason or another . ”
CongressDaily reporter Chris Strohm , citing an unnamed “ intelligence official ” confirmed that Leiter ’s statement reflected government policy and told the publication , “ in certain situations it ’s to our advantage to be able to track individuals who might be on a terrorist watch list because you can learn something from their activities and their contacts . ”
An alternative explanation fully in line with well - documented inaction , or worse , by U.S. security agencies prior to the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks and now , Christmas Day ’s aborted airline bombing , offer clear evidence that a ruthless “ choice ” which facilitates the murder of American citizens are cynical pretexts in a wider game : advancing imperialism ’s geostrategic goals abroad and attacks on democratic rights at home .
Leiter ’s revelation in an of itself should demolish continued government claims that the accused terror suspect succeeded in boarding NW Flight 253 due to a failure to “ connect the dots . ”
However , as far as Antifascist Calling can determine , no other media outlet has either reported or followed - up CongressDaily ’s disclosure ; a clear sign that its explosive nature , and where a further investigation might lead , are strictly off - limits .
Taking into account testimony by a high - level national security official that terrorists are allowed to enter the country for intelligence purposes , one can only conclude that the alleged “ failure ” to stop Abdulmutallab was neither a casual omission nor the result of bureaucratic incompetence but rather , a highly - charged political calculation .
Bushist Embeds : Destabilizing the Obama Administration ?
One subject barely explored by corporate media throughout the Flight 253 affair , is the unsettling notion that the aborted Christmas day bombing may have been a move by rightist elements within the security apparatus to destabilize the Obama administration , a course of action facilitated by the Obama government itself as we will explore below .
This is not as implausible as it might appear at first blush .
When one takes into account the meteoric rise to power by the 40 - year - old former Navy pilot and federal prosecutor , Michael Leiter ’s ascent tracks closely with his previous service as a cover - up specialist for the Bush - Cheney regime .
“ In 2004 , while working as a federal prosecutor , ” a New York Times puff piece informs us , “ Mr. Leiter joined the staff of a commission , appointed by President George W. Bush , to examine intelligence failures leading up to the war in Iraq .
That led to a series of jobs in the intelligence world , and in 2008 , Mr. Bush appointed him director of the counterterrorism center . ”
A rather curious appointment , if Leiter were simply an ingénue with no prior experience in the murky world of intelligence and covert operations .
However the former Navy pilot , who participated in the U.S. wars of aggression against the former Yugoslavia and Iraq seemed to have the requisite qualifications for work as an intelligence “ specialist . ”
While attending Harvard Law School , Leiter served as a “ human rights fellow ” with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague , the U.S. - sponsored kangaroo court that has prosecuted America ’s official enemies in the Balkans whilst covering - up the crimes of their partners .
Amongst America ’s more dubious “ allies ” in the decade - long campaign to destabilize socialist Yugoslavia were al - Qaeda ’s Islamist brigade , responsible for carrying - out hideous massacres in Bosnia and Kosovo , with NATO approval and logistical support , as Global Research analyst Michel Chossudovsky , and others , have thoroughly documented .
As Deputy General Counsel and Assistant Director of the President ’s Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States , the so - called “ Robb - Silberman ” cover - up commission , Leiter focused on what are euphemistically described in the media as “ reforms ” with the U.S. “ Intelligence Community , ” including the stand - up of the FBI ’s repressive National Security Branch .
Prior to joining NCTC , Leiter was the Deputy Chief of Staff for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence under former NSA Director and ten - year senior vice president of the spooky Booz Allen Hamilton security firm , John “ Mike ” McConnell .
From his perch in ODNI , Leiter coordinated all internal and external operations for the Office , including relations with the White House , the Department of Homeland Security and the CIA .
Leiter ’s résumé , and his role in concealing Bush administration war crimes , predicated on ginned - up “ intelligence ” invented by Dick Cheney ’s minions in the Defense Department and the CIA , should have sent alarm bells ringing inside the incoming Obama administration .
As we have seen since Obama ’s inauguration however , rather than cleaning house–and settling accounts –with the crimes , and criminals , of the previous regime , the “ change ” administration chose to retain senior - and mid-level bureaucrats in the security apparatus ; employing officials who share the antidemocratic ideology , penchant for secrecy and ruthlessness of the Bush administration .
While the Times claims his “ unblemished résumé ” has taken a hit over the Flight 253 plot , an interview with National Public Radio shortly before the Abdulmutallab affair , provides chilling insight into Leiter ’s agenda , particularly in light of his January 20 statement to the Senate Homeland Security Committee .
Presciently perhaps , the NCTC chief told NPR : “ We ’re not going to stop every attack .
Americans have to very much understand that it is impossible to stop every terrorist event .
But we have to do our best , and we have to adjust , based on , again , how the enemy changes their tactics . ”
It becomes a painfully simple matter for “ the enemy ” to gain advantage and “ change their tactics ” when those charged with protecting the public actually facilitate their entrée into the country “ for some reason or another ” !
According to the Times , the White House has kept Leiter at the helm and that it came as “ no surprise to Bush officials ” because , get this , “ Michael was n’t political , ” if we ’re to believe the carefully - constructed legend of former Bushist Deputy National Security Adviser Juan Zarate .
If the Bush - Cheney years tell us anything it ’s that appointments by the previous regime were ruthlessly political .
As The Washington Post reported shortly after Obama ’s election , these appointments were made permanent across a multitude of federal agencies and departments , including the security apparat , in a cynical maneuver designed to reward Bush loyalists .
“ The transfer of political appointees into permanent federal positions ” the Post disclosed , “ called ‘ burrowing ’ by career officials , creates security for those employees , and at least initially will deprive the incoming Obama administration of the chance to install its preferred appointees in some key jobs . ”
The Times reports that the White House has publicly defended Leiter “ and aides to the president said Mr. Obama called to convey his support . ”
Perhaps not so curiously , the allegedly “ nonpolitical ” NCTC Director “ has been mentioned as a possible future head of the Central Intelligence Agency , and how he performs might help determine whether he remains on the fast track . ”
One can only wonder , how many other counterterrorist officials have “ burrowed ” their way into , and hold key positions in the current administration , ticking political time - bombs inside America ’s permanent shadow government .
Senate Whitewash Fuel Attacks on Democratic Rights
During Wednesday ’s Senate hearings , Obama ’s Director of National Intelligence , Admiral Dennis C. Blair , in keeping with the former Bush administration ’s assault on democratic rights , assailed the decision by the Justice Department to try the suspect in a court of law .
This is fully in line with the rhetoric of ultra-right Republicans and so - called “ centrist Democrats ” such as arch neocon Senator Joseph Lieberman .
Newsweek reports that new details “ surrounding the Christmas Day interrogation of the bombing suspect aboard Northwest Flight 253 raise questions about the accuracy of testimony provided Wednesday by senior U.S. intelligence and Homeland Security officials . ”
Last week , the newsmagazine reported that “ Obama administration officials were flabbergasted Wednesday when Director of National Intelligence Adm.
Dennis Blair testified that an alleged Qaeda operative who tried to blow up a U.S. airliner on Christmas Day should have been questioned by a special interrogation unit that does n’t exist , rather than the FBI . ”
This theme was quickly picked - up by Senate Republicans .
The overarching sentiments expressed by this gaggle of war criminals and corporate toadies was not to demand accountability from the responsible parties , but to call for further attacks on Americans ’ democratic rights .
Republicans on the committee lambasted Obama ’s Justice Department for its decision to try Abdulmutallab in a civilian court .
John McCain ( R - AZ ) , the Republican party ’s failed candidate in the 2008 presidential election , said the decision was “ a terrible , terrible mistake , ” while the execrable Jeff Sessions ( R - AL ) claimed that the hapless suspect should have been delivered to the U.S. military as an “ enemy combatant . ”
Ranking Republicans on the committee , Susan Collins ( R - ME ) and John Ensign ( R - NV ) went so far as to imply that Abdulmutallab should have been tortured .
Collins inquired : “ how can we uncover plots ” if accused criminal suspects are allowed to “ lawyer up and stop answering questions ? ”
Ensign , a staunch supporter of policies articulated by the Bush administration , particularly former Vice President and war criminal , Dick Cheney , argued that “ limiting ” CIA interrogators to the methods laid out in the Army Field Manual would allow terrorists to “ train ” in advance of interrogations .
But the harshest criticism of the administration came in the form of a stealth attack by Obama ’s own Director of National Intelligence , Admiral Blair .
The Wall Street Journal reported January 21 that “ nation ’s intelligence chief said the man accused of trying to blow up an airliner on Christmas Day should have been questioned by a special interrogation team instead of being handled as an ordinary criminal suspect . ”
Rather than coming to terms and halting the Bush regime ’s practice of torturing so - called terrorist suspects , the Obama administration has compounded the crime by creating a secretive group of interrogators called the High - Value Interrogation Group or HIG .
Blair told the Senate that the administration had “ botched ” the handling of suspect Abdulmutallab , by , wait , not handing him over to a group that as of this writing , exists only on paper , a salient fact of which Blair was certainly knowledgeable !
In his testimony however , the DNI told the Homeland Security Committee that the HIG “ was created exactly for this purpose–to make a decision on whether a certain person who ’s detained should be treated as a case for federal prosecution or for some of the other means . ”
Blair implicitly criticized the Justice Department ’s decision to uphold constitutional protections that guarantee a suspect a right to a trial in a court of law and not a one - way ticket to an American gulag .
Blair said , “ we did not invoke the HIG in this case ; we should have .
Frankly , we were thinking more of overseas people and , duh , you know , we did n’t put it [ in action ] then . ”
Mendaciously , the DNI claimed “ I was not consulted .
The decision was made on the scene , [ and ] seemed logical to the people there , but it should have been taken using this HIG format , at a higher level . ”
Newsweek reporter Michael Isikoff disclosed January 20 that “ senior administration officials ” told him that Blair was “ misinformed on multiple levels ” and that the DNI ’s assertions were “ all the more damaging because they immediately fueled Republican criticism that the administration mishandled the Christmas Day incident in its treatment of the accused Qaeda operative as a criminal suspect rather than an enemy combatant . ”
Isikoff reported January 22 that Blair , Leiter and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano were asked about the decision to try Abdulmutallab and all gave the same answer when queried by right - wing Senator Susan Collins , the Committee ’s ranking Republican : “ Were you consulted regarding the decision to file criminal charges against [ suspect Umar Farouk ] Abdulmutallab in civilian court ? ”
Leiter and Napolitano both replied : “ I was not . ”
According to Newsweek , Blair also said he was “ not consulted ” and claims that the government “ should have ” brought in the yet - to - be activated HIG “ to conduct the questioning of the suspect . ”
As with every aspect of this strange affair , Newsweek reports , these statements are riddled with lies and mischaracterizations .
Isikoff writes that “ all the relevant national - security agencies , including top aides to Blair and Napolitano , were fully informed about the plans to charge the suspect in federal court hours before he was read his Miranda rights and stopped cooperating . ”
Newsweek further reveals that a “ key event ” was a secure videoconference on Christmas Day “ that included Leiter ” and Jane Lute , DHS ’ No. 2 official and that “ neither Leiter nor any of the other participants , including representatives from the FBI and the CIA , raised any questions about the Justice Department ’s plans to charge the suspect in federal court , the officials said . ”
“ If you participate in a conference call and you do n’t raise any objections , that suggests you were consulted , ” said one senior law - enforcement official .
Another added that “ nobody at any point ” raised any objections , either during the meeting or during a four - hour period afterward when Abdulmutallab was informed of his Miranda rights to be represented by a lawyer , ” according to Newsweek .
Ultra -right Senator Kit Bond ( R - MO ) , the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a witting accomplice to the previous regime ’s high crimes and misdemeanors against the American people said , “ That this administration chose to shut out our top intelligence officials and forgo collecting potentially life - saving intelligence is a dangerous sign . ”
It ’s a “ dangerous sign ” to be sure , for America ’s battered democracy .
An On - Going Cover-Up
As events continue to unfold and new information shreds the official story , is Leiter ’s chilling testimony that suspected terrorists are allowed to enter the United States “ because we have generally made the choice that we want them here in the country for some reason or another , ” merely a banal slip or something far more sinister that betrays the real order of things in post - democratic America ?
Relevant questions begging for answers include :
Who made the decision not to “ connect the dots ” ?
Are right - wing elements and holdovers from the previous administration actively conspiring to destabilize the Obama government ?
Was the attempted bombing a planned provocation meant to incite new conflicts in the Middle East and restrict democratic rights at home ?
As with the 9/11 attacks , these questions go unasked by corporate media .
Indeed , such lines of inquiry are entirely off the table and are further signs that a cover - up is in full - swing , not a hard - hitting investigation .
In truth , what we are dealing with here as we stagger into the second decade of the 21st century , is not a “ conspiracy ” per se but a modus operandi as the World Socialist Web Site has argued , rooted in a bankrupt system quickly reaching the end of the line .
Conservatives cheered when freshly minted Sen. Scott Brown ( R - MA ) promised to be a “ new breed of Republican , ” but it does n’t seems like this is what they had in mind .
On one of his first major votes , Brown split with his party Monday to support a cloture motion on the $ 15 billion Democratic “ jobs bill , ” defeating an attempted Republican filibuster in a final tally of 62 -30 .

Conservatives and Tea Partiers were furious , hurling at him an array of insults they traditionally reserve for liberal Democrats or Republicans they believe have committed heresy .
Immediately he was inundated with accusations of being a “ RINO ” ( Republican In Name Only ) , a “ traitor , ” and a “ sell out . ”
“ Un-effing believable , ” wrote one conservative on Twitter to Brown .
Brown hedged his bets is a statement explaining his vote , calling the bill imperfect but reaffirming his desire to govern in a bipartisan manner .
“ I came to Washington to be an independent voice , to put politics aside , and to do everything in my power to help create jobs for Massachusetts families , ” Brown said .
“ This Senate jobs bill is not perfect .
I wish the tax cuts were deeper and broader , but I voted for it because it contains measures that will help put people back to work . ”
But his Facebook fans , whom he re-posted the statement to , were having none of it .
“ Rot , liar ! ” read one of thousands of angry comments that followed , another of which said , “ You were not elected to vote like a lib .
Bet you are n’t reelected traitor ! ”

“ SHAME ON YOU , SCOTT BROWN ! ” read a third .
“ YOU LIED !
SHAME !!
NO MORE RINOS !!! ”
The ensuing headline on the conservative - leaning Drudge Report displayed an image of Brown with red eyes and scarlet undertones .
One Daily Kos blogger said it was an attempt to “ make him look like Satan . ”
While filibustering health care reform was signature to Brown ’s platform , he also said he ’d work with Democrats on other issues .
But the ferociously negative conservative reaction toward him will likely cause some worries among his staffers .

A favorite of the fiery Tea Party crowd not long ago , Brown will as a senator face a series of tough calls when balancing the wishes of his progressive Massachusetts constituency and the staunch conservatives that dominates the Republican Party .
The jobs bill relies on a combination of tax credits and targeted business incentives to boost employment and stave off job losses .

Brown was n’t alone in bucking party line as Republican Sens.
Susan Collins ( ME ) , Olympia Snowe ( ME ) , George Voinovich ( OH ) and Kit Bond ( MO ) — the latter two of whom are retiring — also joined with Democrats to end debate and move the legislation forward .
Democratic Sen. Ben Nelson ( NE ) voted with the GOP to filibuster .
NEW YORK -- NFL owners will vote next week whether to allow each team a possession in overtime in the playoffs if the team winning the OT coin toss kicks a field goal on the first series .
Previously , the game would end whenever either side scores , as happened in the NFC championship game in January , with New Orleans beating Minnesota on Garrett Hartley 's kick .
But NFL competition committee chairman Rich McKay says a trend has developed showing too strong an advantage for teams winning the coin toss to start overtime .
If the team that falls behind by three points on the first series also kicks a field goal , then the game would continue under current sudden death rules .
The proposal is only for the postseason .
" Statistically , it is pretty clear there has been a change , " McKay said .
" When sudden death was put in for 1974 , it clearly worked very well and was a good system .
It brought excitement and effectively broke ties .
From ' 74 - '93 you had a 50 - 50 [ breakdown ] in who would win between those who won toss and who lost the toss .
" Changes occurred over time , and the numbers have changed to 59.8 percent winning the coin toss and winning the game .
The team that loses the coin toss wins 38.5 percent .
" We are trying to put in a system that emphasizes more skill and strategy as opposed to the randomness of the coin flip . "
McKay credited the advancements in field goal accuracy and skills of return teams for the hefty switch in statistics .
The competition committee found that since 1994 , when the kickoff was moved back 5 yards to the 30 , teams winning the OT coin toss won 34.4 percent of the games on the first series .
They kicked field goals 26.2 percent of those times , an increase from 17.9 percent in 15 years .
" I would say this is something that 's been on our radar for a number of years and been talked about a lot , " he said .
" In the last four or five years , we have not proposed anything because we thought if there were n't enough votes [ among the 32 owners ] , we should not propose it .
This year , the statistics are so compelling we need to get the discussion going . "
Rest assured there will be plenty of discussion ; 24 votes are needed to adopt the change .
" Overtime , since 1958 , has had ... the first team that scores , wins , " said Redskins general manager Bruce Allen .
" I like the 1958 rules better " than the proposal .
The players union strongly has supported the current overtime setup because it fears another system could lead to more injuries .
McKay said the competition committee has " not spent a lot of time with them " on this proposal , but will make the players association aware of the recommendation .
Vikings kicker Ryan Longwell never got a chance to try to win that game in New Orleans , under the current rule .
But Longwell said Tuesday he was n't lobbying for a change .
" Personally I like it the way it is , " Longwell said in a text message .
" If you get the ball , go score .
If you do n't get the ball , stop 'em . "
Another recommendation to the owners , who will hold their meetings in Orlando , Fla. , beginning Sunday , centers on expanding protection for defenseless players , most notably receivers .
McKay said a recent rule change helped , but there are cases where receivers already have made a catch and still are defenseless when they get hit in the head area .
The proposal will offer those players protection from hits to the head until after the catch is made and the receiver has an opportunity to protect himself .
We can't say we 've ever heard of a $ 26 Russian program called SkyGrabber before , but it 's about to get famous real fast -- according to the , Iraqi insurgents have been regularly using the satellite - snooping software to monitor live Predator video feeds .
Apparently the Predator transmits video over an unencrypted link , so there 's no major hacking or security breach going on here , but it 's obviously a huge issue -- and we'd say the bigger problem is that Pentagon officials have known about this flaw since the 1990s , but they did n't think insurgents would figure out how to exploit it .
Way to underestimate , guys .
The WSJ says the military is working to encrypt all Predator feeds from Iraq , Afghanistan , and Pakistan , but it 's slow going because the Predator network is more than a decade old and based on proprietary tech -- too bad it 's not proprietary enough to keep prying eyes out of it .

The stakes were dramatically raised in the Middle East at the weekend by news that the US is deploying defensive missile systems throughout the Gulf .
Writing in the Guardian , Robert Tait warned that the deployment " may strengthen radical elements in the revolutionary guards " .
It is for this reason that President Obama should realise the importance of balancing bigger sticks with bigger carrots , including the reduction of sanctions against Iranian civilian airlines .
Last month more than 40 passengers were injured when an Iranian Tupolev 154 crash - landed at Mashhad .
Another Russian - built Tupolev crashed last year en route to Armenia , killing all 168 on board .
Iran has a poor aviation safety record , with numerous crashes since US aviation sanctions prevented it from buying more reliable western planes in 1995 .
The question that arises from these incidents is whether banning civilian airline parts represents " smart " sanctions that are intended to maximise the pressure on the ruling regime while limiting their unintended side effects , or whether it puts the lives of innocent travellers of all nationalities at risk .
At the end of 2009 the head of Iran 's Civil Aviation Organisation , Reza Nakhjavani , criticised the American ban as inhumane and tantamount to denying the country medical supplies .
Yet according to the Carnegie Institute the initial logic of the Iran Sanctions Act was to " curb the strategic threat of Iran " with particular focus on the developing energy sector .
Although development of the energy sector has been somewhat stunted , Iran 's reliance on Russia and China to fill in for the US has the unintended consequence of making it a lot harder to find security council consensus on dealing with the country .
The 1995 sanctions against Iran prohibited military technology or militarily useful technology to the country .
The difficulty with the latter is that it opens up the confusion concerning how sanctions should dealing with potential " dual use " materials .
Parts that could be used to repair Iran 's ailing civilian fleet could be cannibalised and perhaps used by the Iranian military .
In their paper on the 1990s , a period they described as the " sanctions decade " , David Cortright and George Lopez stressed the importance of minimising the humanitarian impacts .
The fundamental purpose of sanctions , they said , " should be bringing states back into the international arena through constructive engagement " .
A report prepared for the International Civil Aviation Organisation ( ICAO ) in 2005 warned that American sanctions against Iran were placing civilian lives in danger by denying Iranian aviation necessary spare parts .
The report said the US government and major US companies were ignoring international treaties and taking actions that put passengers on Iranian commercial airlines at risk , including thousands of people from other countries travelling to and from Iran .
Last year , the former director of the atomic agency , Mohamed ElBaradei , described the prospect of further sanctions on Iran as ineffective .
Iranian airlines do not suffer alone .
Last year Syria 's attempt to escape western isolation was dealt a blow when the US blocked French attempts to upgrade Syria 's national carrier with Airbuses .
Syria stopped flying Boeings to and from London in 2006 due to US sanctions on spare parts .
I remember flying one of the last Syrian Air 747s from London to Damascus : seats were dislodged from the floor and the descent started hours from Damascus to minimise stress on the plane 's ageing parts .
As the debate rumbles on over escalating sanctions against Iran it is worth remembering their terrible track record across the region .
Sanctions against Iraq killed thousands of innocents ( Columbia 's Richard Garfield estimated the most likely number of excess deaths among children under five years of age from 1990 to March 1998 to be 227,000 ) and allowed Saddam Hussein to control what little was allowed into the country .
Although they were certainly effective in reducing the capabilities of the Iraqi military , they weakened the state to such an extent that the 2003 regime change resulted in its almost total disintegration .
Considering the clear dangers of the failed state / ungoverned space hypothesis that justifies the Afghan mission , it seems hard to understand advocating the creation of a similar arena in Iran .
The Foreign Office speaks of a desire to " foster links between the Iranian people and the British people – there is much potential for educational , scientific , sporting and cultural exchanges " .
Obama has tried desperately , and so far unsuccessfully , to reach out to Iran and the Iranian people , emphasising the " common humanity that binds us together " in a New Year message .
Replacing rhetoric with the very real gesture of selling a number of safe civilian airliners would show that Obama is serious when he says he wants to improve ties to the Iranian people .
As Saeed Kamali Dehghan recently wrote in the Guardian : " I 'm not the Iranian government , I 'm an ordinary Iranian and the sanctions are just crippling me . "

Dubai :
The government of Dubai on Thursday announced that it is fully prepared to host the headquarters of the United Nations if its officials decide to move from New York where the organisation is currently located .
According to an official source in the Dubai government , the announcement was made in light of the UAE's — and Dubai's — appreciation of the vital role the United Nations plays in all areas , and in the protection of international peace and security and economic development in particular .
The source said Dubai welcomes dialogue with UN officials to provide them with full information on the capabilities which the emirate can provide and which could make it the optimal choice as the new seat of the UN headquarters if a final decision is taken to move out of New York .
Among the capabilities which Dubai possesses are suitable geographical location and world - class infrastructure and air , land and sea transport systems which make the emirate an easily accessible meeting point in the middle of the world , noted the source .
Dubai's offer is part of efforts the UAE is making to assume its full role as a responsible and effective member of the international community and to find alternatives to contribute to stronger international joint actions .
The debate over the jobs bill revolves partly around the larger question : did the first stimulus work , or not ?
Briefly : I think it did a lot more good than bad , but defending it can be difficult .
It probably added to GDP growth , but to prove that would require a counter - factual that we do n't know -- GDP growth without the stimulus .
It probably reduced unemployment , but to prove that would require another counter - factual that we do n't know -- the unemployment rate without the stimulus .
That 's one reason I 'm indebted to EPI economist Josh Bivens for what I think is the most illuminating point about the stimulus ' effect I 've heard :
In a podcast with The Nation 's Chris Hayes , Bivens explains how we can measure the effect of the stimulus on disposable income and , indirectly , to consumption , which makes up between 60 and 70 percent of our GDP .
If you look at personal income minus government transfers -- this is a good proxy for how the private sector is doing at generating income growth without counting government assistance -- that measure has fallen by 8 percent since the recession began .
But disposable personal income -- what people have the ability to actually spend , due to tax breaks and government transfer payments like unemployment insurance -- is actually up one percent .
One reason consumption has n't fallen off the cliff , he suggests , is that Recovery Act has extended billions of dollars of transfer payments and tax credits as the private sector suffered .
Here 's the graph showing " the difference in year - over - year growth in personal income minus transfers versus disposable personal incomes " :
The problem with the stimulus , Blevins concludes , it that it might end to soon .
In the second half of this year , the White House expects it to add almost nothing to GDP growth , just as unemployment is finally falling .
That 's one reason why Blevins thinks that despite the Recovery Act , we 're still in for a " long , ugly muddle . "
[ Python - Dev ] Reworking the GIL
Hello there ,
The last couple of days I 've been working on an experimental rewrite of the GIL .
Since the work has been turning out rather successful ( or , at least , not totally useless and crashing ! )
I thought I 'd announce it here .
First I want to stress this is not about removing the GIL .
There still is a Global Interpreter Lock which serializes access to most parts of the interpreter .
These protected parts have n't changed either , so Python does n't become really better at extracting computational parallelism out of several cores .
Goals -----
The new GIL ( which is also the name of the sandbox area I 've committed it in , " newgil " ) addresses the following issues : 1 ) Switching by opcode counting .
Counting opcodes is a very crude way of estimating times , since the time spent executing a single opcode can very wildly .
Litterally , an opcode can be as short as a handful of nanoseconds ( think something like " ... is not None " ) or as long as a fraction of second , or even longer ( think calling a heavy non -GIL releasing C function , such as re.search ( ) ) .
Therefore , releasing the GIL every 100 opcodes , regardless of their length , is a very poor policy .
The new GIL does away with this by ditching _Py_Ticker entirely and instead using a fixed interval ( by default 5 milliseconds , but settable ) after which we ask the main thread to release the GIL and let another thread be scheduled .
2 ) GIL overhead and efficiency in contended situations .
Apparently , some OSes ( OS X mainly ) have problems with lock performance when the lock is already taken : the system calls are heavy .
This is the " Dave Beazley effect " , where he took a very trivial loop , therefore made of very short opcodes and therefore releasing the GIL very often ( probably 100000 times a second ) , and runs it in one or two threads on an OS with poor lock performance ( OS X ) .
He sees a 50 % increase in runtime when using two threads rather than one , in what is admittedly a pathological case .
Even on better platforms such as Linux , eliminating the overhead of many GIL acquires and releases ( since the new GIL is released on a fixed time basis rather than on an opcode counting basis ) yields slightly better performance ( read : a smaller performance degradation :-) ) when there are several pure Python computation threads running .
3 ) Thread switching latency .
The traditional scheme merely releases the GIL for a couple of CPU cycles , and reacquires it immediately .
Unfortunately , this does n't mean the OS will automatically switch to another , GIL - awaiting thread .
In many situations , the same thread will continue running .
This , with the opcode counting scheme , is the reason why some people have been complaining about latency problems when an I/ O thread competes with a computational thread ( the I / O thread would n't be scheduled right away when e.g. a packet arrives ; or rather , it would be scheduled by the OS , but unscheduled immediately when trying to acquire the GIL , and it would be scheduled again only much later ) .
The new GIL improves on this by combinating two mechanisms : - forced thread switching , which means that when the switching interval is terminated ( mentioned in 1 ) and the GIL is released , we will force any of the threads waiting on the GIL to be scheduled instead of the formerly GIL - holding thread .
Which thread exactly is an OS decision , however : the goal here is not to have our own scheduler ( this could be discussed but I wanted the design to remain simple :-)
After all , man -years of work have been invested in scheduling algorithms by kernel programming teams ) .
- priority requests , which is an option for a thread requesting the GIL to be scheduled as soon as possible , and forcibly ( rather than any other threads ) .
This is meant to be used by GIL - releasing methods such as read ( ) on files and sockets .
The scheme , again , is very simple : when a priority request is done by a thread , the GIL is released as soon as possible by the thread holding it ( including in the eval loop ) , and then the thread making the priority request is forcibly scheduled ( by making all other GIL - awaiting threads wait in the meantime ) .
Implementation --------------
The new GIL is implemented using a couple of mutexes and condition variables .
A {mutex , condition} pair is used to protect the GIL itself , which is a mere variable named `gil_locked` ( there are a couple of other variables for bookkeeping ) .
Another {mutex , condition} pair is used for forced thread switching ( described above ) .
Finally , a separate mutex is used for priority requests ( described above ) .
The code is in the sandbox : http://svn.python.org/view/sandbox/trunk/newgil/
The file of interest is Python / ceval_gil.h .
Changes in other files are very minimal , except for priority requests which have been added at strategic places ( some methods of I /O modules ) .
Also , the code remains rather short , while of course being less trivial than the old one .
NB : this is a branch of py3 k .
There should be no real difficulty porting it back to trunk , provided someone wants to do the job .
Platforms ---------
I 've implemented the new GIL for POSIX and Windows ( tested under Linux and Windows XP ( running in a VM ) ) .
Judging by what I can read in the online MSDN docs , the Windows support should include everything from Windows 2000 , and probably recent versions of Windows CE .
Other platforms are n't implemented , because I do n't have access to the necessary hardware .
Besides , I must admit I 'm not very motivated in working on niche / obsolete systems .
I 've e-mailed Andrew MacIntyre in private to ask him if he'd like to do the OS / 2 support .
Supporting a new platform is not very difficult : it 's a matter of writing the 50 - or - so lines of necessary platform - specific macros at the beginning of Python / ceval_gil.h .
The reason I could n't use the existing thread support ( Python / thread_ *.h ) is that these abstractions are too poor .
Mainly , they do n't provide : - events , conditions or an equivalent thereof - the ability to acquire a resource with a timeout Measurements
------------
Before starting this work , I wrote ccbench ( * ) , a little benchmark script ( " ccbench " being a shorthand for " concurrency benchmark " ) which measures two things : - computation throughput with one or several concurrent threads - latency to external events ( I use an UDP socket ) when there is zero , one , or several background computation threads running (*)
http://svn.python.org/view/sandbox/trunk/ccbench/
The benchmark involves several computation workloads with different GIL characteristics .
By default there are 3 of them : A- one pure Python workload ( computation of a number of digits of pi ) : that is , something which spends its time in the eval loop B - one mostly C workload where the C implementation does n't release the GIL ( regular expression matching ) C- one mostly C workload where the implementation does release the GIL ( bz2 compression )
In the ccbench directory you will find benchmark results , under Linux , for two different systems I have here .
The new GIL shows roughly similar but slightly better throughput results than the old one .
And it is much better in the latency tests , especially in workload B ( going down from almost a second of average latency with the old GIL , to a couple of milliseconds with the new GIL ) .
This is the combined result of using a time - based scheme ( rather than opcode - based ) and of forced thread switching ( rather than relying on the OS to actually switch threads when we speculatively release the GIL ) .
As a sidenote , I might mention that single - threaded performance is not degraded at all .
It is , actually , theoretically a bit better because the old ticker check in the eval loop becomes simpler ; however , this goes mostly unnoticed .
Now what remains to be done ?
Having other people test it would be fine .
Even better if you have an actual multi- threaded py3 k application .
But ccbench results for other OSes would be nice too :-)
( I get good results under the Windows XP VM but I feel that a VM is not an ideal setup for a concurrency benchmark )
Of course , studying and reviewing the code is welcome .
As for integrating it into the mainline py3 k branch , I guess we have to answer these questions : - is the approach interesting ?
( we could decide that it 's just not worth it , and that a good GIL can only be a dead ( removed ) GIL ) - is the patch good , mature and debugged enough ?
- how do we deal with the unsupported platforms ( POSIX and Windows support should cover most bases , but the fate of OS / 2 support depends on Andrew ) ?

Pure water is a key requirement for good health and alternative cheap , safe methods are required in many countries .
In a paper that has just been published in the American Chemical Society journal , Langmuir , researchers from Uppsala University in co-operation with The University of Botswana describe how extracts from seeds of the Moringa oleifera tree can be used for water purification .
Flocculation of particulate impurities is a common first stage in purification of water .
This often uses addition of either aluminium or iron salts .
Aluminium , particularly , has undesirable health implications .
An alternative procedure that uses a natural extract from seeds of the Moringa oleifera tree is used in Africa .
Research in a paper that has just appeared in the leading American Chemical Society journal on interfaces , Langmuir , describes how very small amounts of the protein from these seeds can bind strongly to surfaces and thus would cause contaminant particles to aggregate .
The Scattering Centre at Ångström Laboratory and the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Uppsala University is a centre of expertise in exploiting a powerful technique known as neutron reflection to measure structure and composition of layers of just a few nanometres ( millionths of a millimetre ) at the interface between a solid and a liquid .
A co-operation with the University of Botswana where there is a long interest in exploiting natural products has led to a research project that provides important insight in to the way that protein molecules from the Moringa oleifera seeds interact , binding strongly both to each other and surfaces so as to cause aggregation in to large lumps that are readily removed from the water .
" It is nice to see how the basic interactions of molecules can play a role in solving practical problems , " says Adrian Rennie , Professor at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Uppsala University .
" Understanding of the process may lead to further development in water purification with materials that are locally available and environmentally friendly . "
Researchers at Moores Cancer Center at the University of California , San Diego and colleagues have found that prostate cancer treatments varied significantly between county hospitals and private providers .
Patients treated in county hospitals are more likely to undergo surgery while patients treated in private facilities tend to receive radiation or hormone therapy .
These findings were published online by the journal Cancer on January 25 .
" The study examined the factors that drive treatment choices for patients with prostate cancer " said J. Kellogg Parsons , MD , MHS , principal investigator and urologic oncologist at Moores UCSD Cancer Center .
" We found that decisions are significantly influenced by the type of health care facility where they receive care . "
Surgery , radiation and hormone therapy are the most common treatments for localized prostate cancer .
Each is associated with different risks and benefits with no consensus as to the most effective form of treatment , though life expectancy , other illnesses , cancer severity and patient preferences may account in part for treatment choices .
Parsons and colleagues at UCLA compared the types of treatments prostate cancer patients received from public and private hospitals as part of a California public assistance program .
The researchers analyzed the care provided to 559 men enrolled in a state - funded program for low - income patients known as Improving Access , Counseling and Treatment for Californians with Prostate Cancer ( IMPACT ) .
Between 2001 and 2006 , 56 percent of the study participants received treatment from county hospitals and 44 percent received care from private facilities .
While tumor characteristics were similar in each group , patients treated in private facilities were more likely than those treated in county hospitals to be white and less likely to undergo surgery .
Specifically , patients treated in private facilities were nearly two - and - a - half times more likely than those treated in county hospitals to receive radiation and more than four - and - a - half times more likely to initially receive hormone therapy instead of surgery .
While the reasons for these differences in treatment decisions are not known , the type of doctor that patients see may play a role , according to Parsons .
At county hospitals , patients were initially under the care of urologists , while the initial providers at private facilities represented urologists , radiation oncologists , and medical oncologists .
" The fact that prostate cancer patients are treated differently based on the type of hospital has implications for health policy , quality of care and equality of care -- particularly because public hospitals are funded by city and state governments to provide health care for underserved , poor populations , " said Parsons .
After skin malignancies , prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer , and the second leading cause of cancer death among U.S. men .

Mair on Washington Post on illiteracy in China
[ This is a guest post by Victor Mair ]
Below is a report on illiteracy in China from the Washington Post , with interspersed comments by me .
I hasten to point out that the numbers I cite in my comments are impressionistic , based on my personal experiences in various parts of China since 1981 .
In particular , I have been fortunate to work closely with the Wenzi Gaige Weiyuan Hui ( Script Reform Committee ) , reorganized in 1986 as the Guojia Yuyan Wenzi Gongzuo Weiyuan Hui ( State Language Commission ) .
No one knows what these numbers really are , although it would be simple enough to determine them experimentally ; I believe that the lack of information is probably because the Chinese government is concerned that the results would be embarrassing .
Perhaps the rough estimates that I give will stimulate someone into doing the ( simple ) research that would settle the question by providing more accurate figures based on verifiable surveys .
For purposes of effective language planning and policy , it is essential to have reliable data .
Maureen Fan , " Illiteracy Jumps in China , Despite 50 - Year Campaign to Eradicate It " , Washington Post Foreign Service , Friday 4/27/2007 ( A19 ) LIUPU , China --
Last year , finally , everyone in Liupu village was able to read and write 1,500 Chinese characters , a census showed .
Village leaders threw a big dinner to celebrate , presenting commemorative teacups to the last two adults to make the grade .
But ask Zhao Huapu , the earnest principal of Liupu Shezu Girls School , how many people here can actually read and write , and he gives an embarrassed smile .
Nearly 30 percent of Liupu 's adults are illiterate .
Here we run smack dab up against the stark difference between official government propaganda and statistics on the one hand , and harsh reality on the other hand .
The encouraging thing is that -- under current circumstances -- we are starting to get a chance to hear some of the latter .
" That 's just reality .
. . .
A lot of them can't read and write , " said Zhao , who acknowledged that the census is based on a test that fails to measure adult literacy accurately .
Illiteracy is increasing in China , despite a 50 - year - old campaign to stamp it out and a declaration by the government in 2000 that it had been nearly eradicated .
The reasons are complex , from the cost of a rural education to the growing appeal of migrant work that draws Chinese away from classrooms and toward far - off cities .
Well , I would say that the single most important reason is the fact that the script is so cumbersome and hard to master , a fact that is almost always completely overlooked by officials , analysts , and journalists .
In many cases , as in this farming hamlet in China 's southern Guizhou province , villagers whose education ended in elementary school have simply forgotten basic skills .
From 2000 to 2005 , the number of illiterate Chinese adults jumped by 33 percent , from 87 million to 116 million , the state - run China Daily reported this month .
The newspaper noted that even before the increase , China 's illiterate population had accounted for 11.3 percent of the world 's total .
" The situation is worrying , " Gao Xuegui , director of the Education Ministry 's illiteracy eradication office , told China Daily , blaming the increase on changing attitudes toward knowledge in a market economy .
" Illiteracy is not only a matter of education but also has a great social impact . "
Gao 's remarks echoed concerns voiced by literacy researchers and served as a reminder of the challenges facing China 's mostly rural population .
This country is proud of its traditional focus on education , as well as more recent efforts to raise standards , such as passage of a law that says every child has the right to nine years of schooling .
Yet in many rural areas , such schooling remains unavailable or prohibitively expensive .
" Has the right " my eye !
Because of the costs of tuition and books , as well as other factors , access to high - quality education in " socialist / communist " China is even more dependent on family income and connections than in capitalist countries .
Ditto for medical care .
In 2000 , officials announced that the illiteracy rate in Tibet , the worst in China , had dropped to roughly 42 percent from 95 percent about 50 years earlier .
Despite the appalling poverty and daunting physical conditions faced by the Tibetan people , it is easier for them to become literate in their own language than for Chinese in theirs , simply because they are blessed with an alphabetic script .
From 2001 to 2005 , China educated nearly 10 million adults who could n't read and write , the Education Ministry said in September .
Authorities have also boasted of higher enrollment figures in primary and middle schools .
Experts , however , contend that official reports are sometimes unreliable .
Local officials are pressured to inflate enrollment figures , and students who are enrolled often do n't bother to show up , they say .
There are also questions about how literacy statistics are gathered .
In Liupu , for example , Zhao and other local leaders go door - to - door each September , asking the village 's roughly 300 families how many people are in each household and what type of education they have .
Those who can show they have graduated from primary school are not counted as illiterate , regardless of whether they can actually read or write .
Literacy in China is defined according to an exam taken in fourth grade .
Even if villagers pass that exam , they frequently do not pursue further education .
Having no reason to read and write , many forget the skills .
This is especially true of ethnic minorities , rural women and young dropouts , according to researchers .
" It 's undeniable that there 's a relapse , but what the number is , is hard to tell , " said Guo Hongxia , a scholar at the China National Institute for Educational Research .
Hu Xingdou , a sociologist and professor of economics and China issues at Beijing Institute of Technology , suggested that the problem is related to the perceived benefits of education .
Nobody mentions the monumentally difficult script !
" Farmers do n't see a bright future from receiving more education , " he said .
" Many believe it wo n't help them much in making money .
They also can't afford to send their children to university , and a university degree no longer guarantees a job after graduation . "
Farmers are expected to learn at least 1,500 characters ,
That 's a bad joke !
according to state education regulations .
Urban residents should master 2,000 .
Hah !
Teachers in Beijing often tell students they need to know 3,000 characters to read a newspaper .
I 'd be very surprised if 10 - 15 % of the population can write that many characters .
Perhaps 20 - 25 % can recognize 3,000 characters , but I 'm not even very confident about that .
College graduates are tested on 7,000 characters or more .
A pipedream !!!
I doubt whether even a hundredth of one percent of the Chinese population can write 7,000 characters ; probably no more than 2 - 3 % could recognize that many .
In Liupu , located at the end of a three - mile - long , potholed dirt road , many of those who can't read and write are older , homebound women .
Members of the Shezu ethnic minority , they speak their own dialect
LANGUAGE , please !
and have had little formal education .
Still , with the help of Zhao , the school principal , they are trying to make gains .
On a recent Saturday night , Zhao used a flashlight to climb a rocky path of steps , past an old woman beating water out of pickled vegetables , up to a spartan wooden house .
Inside , two young volunteer teachers from his school and an older village party cadre sat in a circle , tutoring eight illiterate women , their faces lit by a soundless television .
" Actually , not many people have the patience to read this all the way through , " said Zhao Tongxiu , a 24 - year - old teacher , pointing at a page in a book .
" Did your teacher teach you all this ? "
" She taught us all of this , but I just cannot remember it , " said his pupil , Wang Chengyi , who thought she was about 30 years old .
" My child taught me how to write a little at home , but still I do n't write well .
I just ca n't memorize it .
I 'm already this old , what use is it studying ? "
Many women here do n't have time for class , the teachers said .
They are tired after working 12 - hour days in the fields and returning in the evening to feed their families .
Wu Wanqin , 44 , the village cadre , earned 2 1/2 cents from the government as an incentive to get the women together Saturday .
She would have to walk several of them home by flashlight afterward , and some lived half an hour away .
The women of Liupu use a simple , practical textbook published by the Beijing Cultural Development Center for Rural Women , which began testing it in parts of China a few years ago .
But often , adults learning how to read are taught words that do n't closely relate to their lives , according to Guo , the national education researcher .
By June , Guo said , officials will urge that the approach used in Liupu be adopted countrywide .
Researchers say that illiteracy is not confined to older generations , an assertion borne out in Liupu .
Zhao Xianghua , 15 , said half of her friends can't read .
She boards during the week at a county school that charges $ 50 a year in tuition , but she has friends who do n't have the same luxury .
" Several are already out working , " she said , " and when they come back to visit and we hang out , I can feel the distance between us . "
The main test of literacy in China will be officials ' ability to follow up with students and cement any gains , said Hu , the professor , who complained that adults are often taught only how to pass a test .
That is indeed true , but Professor Hu has n't put his finger on the real reasons why it is so hard for Chinese to maintain literacy .
With alphabetic literacy , one can forget how to spell a word properly but still get one 's idea across by misspelling it .
If one forgets a crucial character , like the TI4 of DA3 PEN1TI4 打喷嚏 ( " sneeze " ) , which very few Chinese know how to write , you 're stuck .
" It 's like planting trees to make a forest , " Hu said .
" Many people plant trees , but few take care of them , and finally the trees die before becoming a forest . "
The people of China -- now , as they have been for the past three millennia -- are constantly challenged by an enormously complicated script suitable only for an elite consisting of a tiny proportion of the population .
The * only * reason people are starting to recognize ( once again -- after the propaganda of the last 50 years ) the huge dimensions of the illiteracy problem in China now is that there is slightly more , partially honest reporting managing to slip out .
The real situation across the length and breadth of China is much , much worse than even the most critical recent reports reveal .
If only China would adopt a policy of true digraphia ( PINYIN plus HANZI ) and actively promote it , the problems of illiteracy would vanish within a decade or two .

Times are tough , but who'd have thought it would get to this :
More and more consumers are choosing cheaper alternatives for when they die .
Discount caskets and cremation are bigger than ever .
In turn , casket revenues have croaked .
WSJ : In response , casket makers are diversifying , building less expensive models and expanding cremation offerings .
The country 's biggest casket maker , Hillenbrand Inc. , parent of Batesville Casket , is going outside the funeral business altogether .
Earlier this year it said it would spend $ 435 million to buy K - Tron International Inc. , which makes factory equipment .
" We are a very significant player in an industry that is n't growing , " explains Hillenbrand Chief Executive Ken Camp .
Part of the problem is people like Marc Kruskol , a 52 - year - old publicist in Palmdale , Calif .
He does n't want a casket burial regardless of how strong the economy is , he says .
When he dies , he wants to donate his organs and be cremated .
Traditional burials are a waste of cash , he says .
" It 's like taking a bag full of money and burying it . "
So blow your money today and then immolate yourself .
It 's the New Normal .
Abu Yousif is back home , back to Baghdad , where his brother was murdered and where , he believes , the same fate awaits him in the hands of the vengeful killers .
Every day is spent living in fear that the gunmen will hunt him down .
" They have not gone away from here .
I am afraid of what could happen .
I only sleep a little , and then I wake up and think , is this going to be my last day , wondering what is going to happen to my family , " he says .
" This is still a very dangerous place .
People in England must realise that . "
Mr Yousif , a 39 - year - old engineer , was one of 40 Iraqis thrown out of Britain , where they had sought asylum , because the Home Office decided that their homeland was now a safe place to live .
It was the first time that a return to Baghdad had been attempted since the start of the Iraq war in 2003 .

To the huge embarrassment of the British Government , 30 of the deportees were refused entry by the Iraqi officials and sent back .
Ten others were taken off the plane with UK officials who promised that the local embassy would look after them .
What actually happened , says Mr Yousif , was that they were given $ 100 each and told to fend for themselves .
Human rights groups , churches and refugee charities have condemned the British authorities for insisting on the deportation to a place visited daily by murderous attacks .
A spokesman for Amnesty International said : " Given the reports of killings , bombings and other human rights abuses that continue to come out of Baghdad , it is hard to comprehend that the UK Government considers it a safe place to return people . "
Mr Yousif has now been back in Baghdad for three days , most of which , he says , have been spent in a room at the house of a friend .
" I can not go back to live at home because I am told that is being watched , " he told The Independent yesterday .
" I do not even like leaving the room at my friend 's home because I am always nervous .
I think that I will be at risk from these same people who killed my brother .
I do not know how long I can stay with my friend – he will be at risk as well .
I keep a bag packed in case I have to move suddenly . "
Mr Yousif said that each of the detainees had two guards alongside them during the flight to Iraq .
The atmosphere was fraught , with many of those being sent back in obvious distress .
Mr Yousif and the others also received $ 45 each from immigration officials who said there was nothing more they could do .
" I was wandering around , I felt lost .
Then I got a taxi to my friend 's place .
Luckily he and his family were there and they took me in .
The money is running out fast , and I am not sure how I will support myself . "
Mr Yousif met
The Independent at a public location in central Baghdad , which he considered to be comparatively safe .
His voice was strained as he described how his life had unravelled , his eyes darting around , trying to spot signs of danger .
He had been convinced several times during the journey to the meeting that he was being followed .

Mr Yousif has not seen his wife and two children or his parents for more than three years .
They went into hiding after the death of his brother , Sabah , and it is safer for them , he felt , not to be with him .
The chain of violence which led to the murder of Sabah and Mr Yousif fleeing Iraq began when he started working for an international company , Global , engaged in security work for the US military and Iraqi ministries .
" I have a degree from the technical university here , but this was 2004 and it was very , very difficult to get jobs .
Working for foreigners made you a target , but I needed the money to feed my family , " he said .
" I worked for them for two years , and then the terrorists must have found out about my job .
I was sent an envelope with a bullet in it and a warning that I would be killed unless I stopped working for the company .
" I did not want to put my family in danger , my wife was very afraid , and I decided to leave the job .
My brother went to the offices to pick up some documents for me and after he left he was murdered .
They shot him in the head and then they disfigured the body with knives .
They had mistaken him for me .
" My parents blamed me for what had happened , for working for a foreign company , and I do not think even now they have forgiven me . "
Mr Yousif was advised by friends to leave the country .
He paid $ 8,000 to a Kurdish group who took him through northern Iraq , Turkey and then across Europe in a truck to Dover .
He walked into a police station in April 2006 , saying he was an asylum - seeker .
He was held in a detention centre in Cambridge while his application was processed .
He appeared before a tribunal , where his case was rejected .
" I was told that Iraq was now a free country and I would be sent back because it was safe .
The same week there were bombs in Baghdad with a lot of people blown up . "
Mr Yousif was put on notice of deportation but given temporary leave to remain .
He stayed with an Iraqi family for almost three - and - a - half years in Dover .
At the end of last month he was told to report to a detention centre .
He was held there for two weeks , then put on the flight to Baghdad .
" When I got to England , I thought I was safe at last .
I thought I would be able to take my family over there and we could start a life away from all the trouble and the violence .
" All the British people I had met in Baghdad said it was a good place , and a fair place , and I believed them . "
He shakes his head .
" Now I do not know what will happen to me .
I have lost everything , I feel there is just darkness ahead of me . "
The asylum - seeker 's name was changed .

Carlotta Freeman has been awarded a $ 1 - million judgment in her case against appliance manufacturer Whirlpool .
Freeman , a Black woman who was employed by the company , claimed her complaints about racial and sexual harassment were ignored by Whirlpool management that eventually caused the situation to turn into a physical altercation as she was attacked by a white male co-worker , Willie Baker .
Judge John T. Nixon , who presides over the Nashville Division of the United States District Court for Middle Tennessee , found that every level of management of the now defunct La Vergne plant in Tennessee failed to respond to Carlotta Freeman ’s complaints .
Nixon ’s decision was based on Freeman ’s “ emotional and psychological injuries caused by Whirlpool ’s ineffective response to her repeated complaints of racial and sexual harassment . ”
According to The Tennessean , several medical experts testified that Freeman had developed chronic post - traumatic stress disorder and could n’t participate in normal activities .
“ She ’s completely disabled , not able to work because of the incident , ” Freeman ’s lawyer Andy Allman said .
“ She is pretty much a complete introvert , rarely leaves her home anymore . ”
The court ordered Whirlpool to pay Freeman a little more than $ 1 million .
Scientists are reporting the first evidence from human research that blueberries -- one of the richest sources of healthful antioxidants and other so - called phytochemicals -- improve memory .
They said the study establishes a basis for comprehensive human clinical trials to determine whether blueberries really deserve their growing reputation as a memory enhancer .
A report on the study appears in ACS ' Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry .
Robert Krikorian and colleagues point out that previous studies in laboratory animals suggest that eating blueberries may help boost memory in the aged .
Until now , however , there had been little scientific work aimed at testing the effect of blueberry supplementation on memory in people .
In the study , one group of volunteers in their 70s with early memory decline drank the equivalent of 2 - 2 l / 2 cups of a commercially available blueberry juice every day for two months .
A control group drank a beverage without blueberry juice .
The blueberry juice group showed significant improvement on learning and memory tests , the scientists say .
" These preliminary memory findings are encouraging and suggest that consistent supplementation with blueberries may offer an approach to forestall or mitigate neurodegeneration , " said the report .
The research involved scientists from the University of Cincinnati , the U.S. Department of Agriculture , and the Canadian department of agriculture .
This email comes from a female reader in Malaysia :
I ’m an atheist and proud to be one although I can’t exactly reveal my true self since I live in Malaysia where ethnic Malays are ‘ MUSLIMS ’ and ca n’t convert to other religions .
My dad was previously a Catholic Filipino ( who converted to Islam ) and my mum is Malay .
When I was born , I was a Muslim by default .
I ’ve been an atheist since 4 years ago ( before that I was just agnostic ) and I ’m in a relationship with a British guy .
We plan to get married but as usual – my parents wants him to convert so we can ‘ nikah ‘ .
We ca n’t get married in the UK since he does n’t have a job there and I doubt I can get a job there because of their recession .
We are both happily living together in Malaysia ( his funds comes from a house he ’s renting out in Oxford ) but we hate the direction this country is going .
Today they caned 3 women and 4 men for having sex outside of marriage .
In Malaysia , atheists are very much hated and I can never be myself here or even voice out my opinions .
My question may be ridiculous but is there an organization which helps atheist people just like how they have those Christian organization who help their kind ?
The help we need is to get out of this country — by securing a job somewhere else , or a lawyer who can help us get married without him having to convert ( which is impossible as many have tried ) .
FYI — renouncing Islam is a death sentence in Malaysia ( Malays are trialed using the Syariah Law )
Earlier today , a victim of the largest extortion racket in the world struck back , giving up his life in the process .
The control freaks , and their propagandists who pretend to be " reporters , " will no doubt spend the next few weeks demonizing the man , or painting him as crazy .
You can decide for yourself if this was the case .
As best I can tell , today Joseph Stack burned down his house , and then crashed his plane into the Austin , Texas offices of the IRS .
We do n't need to ponder the reason , because he told us why , in a suicide note , which can be read here : I found reading the note very disturbing , mainly because Mr. Stack was obviously far more intelligent , and more in touch with reality , than the vast majority of Americans .
In other words , compared to the deluded masses of conformists , Mr. Stack was the sane one .
Several statements in his suicide note show that he had overcome the authoritarian statist indoctrination far more than most people ever will .
Does the following sentiment sound familiar ?
" We are all taught as children that without laws there would be no society , only anarchy .
Sadly , starting at early ages we in this country have been brainwashed to believe that , in return for our dedication and service , our government stands for justice for all .
We are further brainwashed to believe that there is freedom in this place ...
I have spent the total years of my adulthood unlearning that crap from only a few years of my childhood . "
[ Joseph Stack , 2/18/2010 ]
A lot of you will find aspects of Mr. Stack 's personal story disturbingly familiar .
I see no need to parse every sentence of it , though I would urge everyone to read it all , carefully .
What would drive a rational , intelligent man to do such a thing ?
Of course , the control freaks and their propagandists will paint Mr. Stack as a nutcase , and will claim that his actions , by themselves , prove that he was insane .
But they do n't .
They prove he was desperate , and frustrated , and that he was willing to give up his life to try to resist injustice .
And that is the part the parasite class does not want people to think about .
They will paint him as a " mentally unstable " " tax cheat , " or apply to him whatever other labels they think might make people not want to think about what Mr. Stack did , and why .
Now comes the controversial , uncomfortable part .
Several people have already asked me whether I approve of what Mr. Stack did .
Any good , unthinking obedient serf would immediately blurt out , " Of course not ! "
In short , though I am saddened that the world had to lose Mr. Stack in the process , and although there are alternatives I would have much preferred , yes , generally I have to praise him for what he did .
I 'm not about to emulate him , nor would I suggest that anyone else do so , but he had the courage to do something about the injustice he saw , and that puts him ahead of 99.99 % of the population .
So far , I have heard about a couple of injuries , and one person unaccounted for , at the crash site .
So at the moment , as far as I know , Mr. Stack is the only one who died in the crash .
I do n't know whether that was his intent or not .
In other words , I do n't know if he intended to destroy only property , or to kill people as well .
As far as mere property , if someone found a way to destroy every IRS computer , every IRS building , every IRS vehicle , firearm , every bit of property used by the federal extortion racket , without hurting any people , I would without hesitation cheer , loud and long .
( I 'd like it even more if someone took it all , and gave it to the people who were robbed to pay for it in the first place . )
But the question of taking human life is far more serious .
At this point , most writers would quickly add , " I would never condone violence against law enforcers ! "
Not me .
Violence is justified when used in an attempt to stop an aggressor -- one who initiates violence .
And the politician scribbles called " laws " have no effect on that .
IRS employees , from CID down to the paper - pushers , are constantly initiating violence , every time they levy a bank account , or swipe someone 's home , or send threatening letters ( i.e. , " pay up or we 'll do nasty things to you " ) .
It is their job to use violence , and threats of violence , to take property from those to whom it rightfully belongs .
Most do it without thinking , and I doubt any of them accept any personal responsibility for their actions .
" Hey , I 'm just doing my job . "
Yeah , you and the Nazi SS .
But this is the problem that the " authority " myth creates : a bunch of brain - dead authoritarian jackasses , day after day , terrorize , extort and rob millions and millions of people .
The people are then left with a choice : go after the unthinking bureaucrats whose main sin is being blindly obedient , or allow injustice to continue .
Neither option is pleasant .
Apparently Mr. Stack chose the former .
I 'll have more to say about this later , but today , let me leave you with two excerpts from " The Iron Web " which are disturbingly appropriate to what happened today :
Excerpt 1 : " Real life is n't like the movies .
In the movies , the bad guy is always so obviously evil that when he dies , in some spectacular finale , everyone stands up and cheers .
That 's not how it works in real life .
In real life , the people who have to be killed to protect the innocent are hardly ever truly evil themselves .
Instead , their sin is usually just being stupid , and doing what they 're told .
That 's all .
...
The state uses violence for everything it does .
Every law is a command , and if anyone disobeys , force is used to make them comply .
And good people do n't want to resist .
Even if they do n't like the law , even if they think it 's unjust , the last thing they want to do is kill some poor pawn who is just doing what he was told .
It would be so much easier if only evil people committed evil , but through the belief in ' authority , ' otherwise good people routinely become agents of evil .
Even the atrocities of Hitler 's regime , Stalin 's regime , and all the others , were the result of a few truly evil people , and thousands upon thousands of merely obedient people .
The real villains are n't stupid enough to go to the front lines themselves .
That 's what compliant subjects are for .
But the result is that the good people of the world are left with a choice : either allow evil to occur , or kill people who are merely misguided or ignorant .
Most people choose the first option , and mankind has suffered unspeakable horrors because of it .
" Excerpt 2 ( from a different character ) : " You have to understand , this was bound to happen .
The parasites have been making this monster for decades , and now it 's broken free .
It 's not about whether I think it 's good .
I do n't .
But I think it 's inevitable .
It 's like some poor dog that 's been beaten since it was a puppy .
Mostly it just cowers and whimpers , always in fear .
Then one day , it snaps and rips its master 's throat out .
Those IRS paper - pushers have been emptying peoples ' bank accounts , taking their homes , and ruining lives for years and years .
The zoning bureaucrats , the inspectors and regulators -- they 've all been pushing people around for decades , and it all adds up .
As long as the cogs in the machine felt comfortable obeying orders , they went right on doing it .
Their victims had no recourse , so they just put up with it .
Well , now all their frustrations are coming out as hatred and a desire for revenge .
When people are oppressed , humiliated and tormented for all their lives , even if only a little at a time , and even if they barely notice , it builds up inside them .
It 's like a poison the body can't get rid of .
It builds up and builds up , until something breaks .
" Today , something broke .
Mr. Stack , rest in peace .
Up-and - coming

Yesterday , we pointed our readers to an article where " Kick - Ass " co-creator Mark Millar claimed that unlike other stories , where there had " never been a superhero comic set in the real world , " he and John Romita Jr. were " now showing superheroes as real people for the first time . "
Some of our readers may consider this to be the product of a hype machine so shameless that it could give even Stan Lee tips on hucksterism or rattle off a llitany of comics that treat super - heroes in a fashion that 's just as realistic ( or moreso ) than " Kick - Ass , " but the ComicsAlliance staff knows better .
If Mark Millar says it , it 's gotta be true .
That 's why today , we 're backing up his claims with a look at The Six Realest Moments In " Kick - Ass ! "
# 6 : Breaking Your Back Makes You Stronger
In the second issue , the title character beats up three gangsters ( handily identified as " Puerto Ricans " ) by waving around what appear to be nightsticks wrapped in electrical tape , despite the fact that each one is about twice his size .
And he has no formal combat training whatsoever .
And he is doing this " as soon as I was off the crutches " from an earlier incident that left him with " a broken back and two broken legs , " " a ruptured spleen , one collapsed lung and head trauma . "
It 's a little - known real - world scientific fact that massively traumatic injuries actually leave you stronger and more physically capable than you were before !
# 5 : Little Girls Are Incredibly Powerful Killing Machines
One of the book 's breakout characters is , of course " Hit Girl , " a skinny eleven - year - old girl who looks to weigh somewhere around 45 pounds , and who -- in a fit of Millar 's signature realism -- is constantly cutting people down with a pair of katanas that she often wields one - handed .
In addition to the standard - issue decapitations and limb - severings , Hit Girl also effortlessly bisects skulls and chops people clean in half .
The layman may be under the impression that the laws of physics would make this impossible , but as top medical scientists have agreed as recently as 1453 , little girls are actually made of an alloy comprised of sugar , spice , and high - tensile littlegirlium , a substance capable of storing and unleashing incredible amounts of kinetic energy .
In fact , in an effort to go green , many hospitals have done away with sternal saws previously used for bone - cutting , and instead just schedule " take your daughter to work day " every time there 's a need for brain surgery .
# 4 : Kevlar Makes You Invincible
In another highly realistic scene , Hit Girl is shot seven times at point - blank range , which knocks her out a second - story window .
She later returns , none the worse for wear , because she 's wearing a skin - tight layer of Kevlar .
Kevlar , of course , is a miracle fabric so strong that a layer the thickness of a t - shirt can stop a .50 caliber bullet from less than six inches away , and which also functions as as short - distance parachute .
This is why , as students of history will no doubt recall , firearms were rendered completely obsolete after its invention , and why all wars are now waged via Lazer Tag™ .
# 3 : Little Girls Are Better Shots Than Professional Marksmen
Completing the Hit Girl Realisim Trifecta , there 's the scene where she -- again , a tiny child -- accurately shoots a pistol in each hand , scoring headshots on a roomful of bad guys .
Issues of recoil are , of course , negated by the littlegirlium factor , and while some so - called " experts " claim that accurate two - handed shooting is impossible even for the best shooters , people who are familiar with the work of documentary filmmaker John
Woo know that this is n't the case .
The only question is why Hit Girl was n't chewing on the standard - issue toothpick or sliding down a banister .
# 2 : Sticks Are More Powerful Than Guns
After being tortured with electricity and beaten half to death , Kick Ass is able to defeat his nemesis , who has a gun , by hitting him with a stick .
We do n't even need to explain this one .
Stick vs. Gun ?
Of course stick wins .
That 's just how it works here in the real world .
And finally , the most realistic moment of the series ...
# 1 : " Marvel 1985 " Is The Talk of Comic Book Shops
One of the many , many , many , many , many , many , many plugs for Marvel Comics that Millar 's able to work into his script in a way so seamless that they definitely do n't draw you out of the story is this one , where Millar has one of his characters talk about how interesting the premise of " Marvel 1985 " is .
The fact that Millar also wrote a comic called " Marvel 1985 " is , of course , completely coincidental .
With his dedication to realism , we 're absolutely certain that he 's simply faithfully reporting a conversation he overheard at his local shop .
Clearly , " Kick - Ass " is the most realistic comic ever , finally dethroning the previous holder of that title : " Ultimates 2 . "
Memo to the media : not only is it good journalism to fact - check Republican lies , it 's entertaining too .
If we wanted to hear unfiltered Republican lies , we 'd watch Fox .
If you 're not Fox , your audience wants reporting of the sort Maddow delivered last night .
Watch :
As Maddow concluded :
This is the Republican response to this terrorist attack at the end of 2009 .
Again , my friends and colleagues in the media have two choices in covering this .
You can just copy down what the Republicans and Vice President Cheney are saying , and click " send , " call it journalism , or you can actually fact - check those comments and put them into context .
Your choice .
It ’s your country .

Remaining Unread : The Top Ten Reasons We Don't Get to Certain Books by Beth Carswell
Some co-workers and I were recently at the lunch table talking about ( you guessed it ) books .
The subject turned specifically to lamentations over the books sitting on our shelves unread , collecting dust , while we grow quietly old .
This is a phenomenon I know all too well .
So what happens ?
Why do some books languish unopened in my collection , while fresh young faces shoot to the top of my stack , given precious priority placement at my bedside ?
I think there are numerous reasons some books take us ages - or forever - to read .
Here are my top 10 .

Naomi Klein's No Logo , Al Gore 's An Inconvenient Truth , and Camille Paglia 's Sexual Personae all discuss crucial , undeniably vital issues , from manipulation in marketing and capitalism , to the crisis of climate change and its increasingly clear reality , to the age - old nature versus nurture debate in sexuality and gender roles , and its effect on participation in the arts , the workplace and more .
But I only know this from reading jacket - blurbs and reviews .
These are the books I buy with the best intentions and a healthy dose of guilt , feeling I should educate myself enough to at worst appear socially conscious ( perhaps brilliant ) at a dinner party , and at best , save the world .
But in reality , I 've finished university , I work hard all day , and sometimes , when I read for pleasure , I want it to be just that - pleasant .
It 's a shame I find it difficult to make myself pick up the more serious , non-fiction books - sometimes , as in the case of We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families : Stories from Rwanda , these can be the most fascinating and rewarding books ( if grim and devastating ) and go a long way toward understanding people and the world around us .
Numerous times I 've come across a good deal on book two or three in a trilogy or series , and gone “ ooh !
I 've been meaning to read this ! ” and picked it up …. only to never get around to procuring the first instalment (s ) .
I know my taste pretty well by now , and I should trust my instincts .
Despite its enormous , unstoppable , bestseller status , I know I would loathe Marley & Me , for instance .
But every now and then , all the praise and adulation and recommendations get to me , and I buy something against my better judgment .
These remain largely unread .
I wish I could say the same for The Pilot 's Wife , which stole four hours or so of my life , and made me temporarily more stupid .
I refuse to link to it .
You can thank me later .
One day , I will read Tolstoy 's War & Peace , David Foster Wallace 's Infinite Jest , and Vikram Seth's A Suitable Boy .
One day .
But I 've barely recovered from reading Shantaram ( excellent , but mammoth ) , and that 's been a couple of years now .
It 's just such a commitment to read a giant book .
5 . It 's a classic .
I feel like I should read everything ever written by Charles Dickens , Mark Twain , D.H. Lawrence , Jane Austen , Victor Hugo … I feel like I should forgo all chocolate and alcohol in favour of vegetables , too .
And floss more .
Constant flossing .
I should be flossing right now .
Things rarely work out that exact way .
If I have any feelings of “ should ” about a book , it usually sinks toward the bottom of the pile ( see # 1 ) .
6 . My reading stacks get wildly out of control .
Between book sales , gifts , and my entirely revolting lack of self - control , it 's amazing how many books I always have on my " to read " pile .
Do n't get me wrong - this feels like complaining that too many men are in love with me , or this diamond necklace is too heavy for my neck .
Nevertheless , it 's a contributing factor to some of the volumes lying seemingly forgotten on my bookcases .
7 . The siren call of the bargain bin .
When we 're standing right there , and a book costs 5 p , and it has a UKRAINIAN SPY with an OMINOUS MOUSTACHE , and a TORRID LOVE RHOMBUS and a SUSPICIOUS DASCHUND in it , it 's difficult to not grab it on the spot - after all , it 's cheaper than a fancy coffee .
And oh man - suspicious daschund .
Good times guaranteed .
Even the covers tempt me .
A woman in a silver leotard , draped unconscious in the arms of a swarthy astronaut , while the rings of Saturn loom behind ?
How can it NOT be good ?
And such a steal !
But when you do this a lot - and Lord , I do this a lot - it 's amazing how quickly they build up , and sit there , judging you , accusing you , when you walk down the hall .
8 . The author wrote something else we like .
There have been so many times I 've brought a book home - despite thinking it sounds mundane or otherwise not up - my - alley , because I adored another book written by the same person .
The obvious example for me would be Truth and Beauty by Ann Patchett .
I really loved both Bel Canto and The Magician 's Assistant , so picked up Truth and Beauty despite it sounding like something I would n't like ( it 's a departure from her fiction - an account of a friendship , and pretty preachy and heartwarming ) .
And I did n't like it - or the first part of it , anyway - and I 've never picked it back up .
9 . It 's a textbook or an assignment
Nothing takes the fun , joy or pleasure out of reading like being told we have to .
I procrastinated on virtually every reading assignment given me in university ( except , perhaps , my literature classes ) , then would come home , pick up whatever book I was reading by choice , and devour it .
10 .
We have a friend / crush who works at the bookshop , or in my case …
I work at one of the world 's largest and most wonderful book websites on Earth .
My job includes researching and writing about books for large chunks of each and every day .
Many of those books I suddenly realise I need to read and own immediately if not sooner .
Between gorgeous antiquarian collectibles with cherry blossoms on the cover , twisty - turny mystery books and more , it 's a bit shocking how many I 've ordered as a direct result of work - related book exposure .
... I wonder if I can claim that as a business expense ?
Regardless of the whys and what fors , our lunch table conversation reassured me that I 'm by no means unusual in my unread - book shame .
We all have a few books in the closet - behind the skeletons .
Here are some of the books the staff of AbeBooks ( names withheld to protect the guilty ) have n't been able to get through .
25 Books We Just Could n't Read ( Yet ) :
Gabrielli is clearly concerned about declining future world oil production .
His statements are now in alignment with those of other oil company executives including Sadad al - Husseini , former Aramco executive , who states that world oil production is on a peak plateau , and Total 's CEO , Christophe de Margerie who does n't see global oil production ever exceeding 89 million barrels per day ( mbd ) .
World oil production in December 2009 was only slightly lower at 86 mbd .
According to the company 's projections , production from existing fields will fall from a little over 80 million barrels a day to maybe half of that even if new techniques are used to slow their rate of decline .
So just keeping global production flat is going to require lots of new fields and requires the world to replace one Saudi Arabia per three years .
This is a stronger statement than the one he gave in January 2009 in an interview with Business Week when he said the following .
Gabrielli shows world oil capacity peaking in 2010 as shown in the translated version of his chart below .
He shows historical world oil production to 2008 .
Next , he applies a decline rate of 5 % per year to existing production represented by the lower light blue area .
He then forecasts capacity additions from sanctioned projects estimated from Wood MacKenzie 's Global Oil Supply Tool .
These oil capacity additions are in four categories : OPEC new projects , OPEC expansion projects , non-OPEC new projects and non-OPEC expansion projects .
In 2010 the biggest contributor is OPEC expansion projects which includes about 1.3 mbd from Khurais and 0.8 mbd from Khursaniyah .
These additions include both crude oil and natural gas liquids and are sourced from Saudi Arabia 's official statements which lack independent verification .
He also shows three demand scenarios ranging from low demand to high demand .
For the BAU scenario , the required new capacity , in addition to sanctioned project capacities , is about 29 mbd in 2020 .
Unsanctioned projects from Brazil and Iraq should be able to provide some of this capacity but other capacity additions will be needed to meet demand .
Biofuels can also help but there will probably not be enough new oil capacity additions to meet demand in 2020 .
It is important to note that Gabrielli 's capacity additions exclude additions from unsanctioned projects and from oil yet to be discovered .
Thus many Iraq projects and Brazilian Santos basin projects would be excluded .
Iraq might produce another 8 mbd by 2020 according to recent estimates by BP's CEO .
Brazil 's production is forecast by Petrobras to increase by about 2 mbd by 2020 .
Thus , additions from non sanctioned projects from Iraq and Brazil might add another 10 mbd capacity by 2020 .
However , this still leaves a required lower capacity addition of 19 to 24 mbd in 2020 to come from other sources .
This capacity addition is equivalent to production from about two Saudi Arabias which is an enormous challenge .
Gabrielli 's observed decline rate appears to be about 5 % per year and he applies it to the entire liquids production in 2008 .
Part of the liquids production , such as ethanol and Canada oil sands , is increasing rather than declining .
The use of separate decline rates for each component of liquids production would be better , but the peak oil capacity year of 2010 would probably not change .
Instead , the forecast production curve decline profile would be slightly different .

On another slide , Gabrielli plots cumulative decline in existing fields against time .
Consequently , the world needs one Saudi Arabia every two years just to keep production constant .
Fortunately , new oil capacity from sanctioned projects can offset some of cumulative decline of 30 mbd in 2015 .
However , the chart above still shows a gap of over 5 mbd which needs to be filled by projects yet to be sanctioned or development of undiscovered oil .
If this gap can not be filled then demand cannot be met and prices will increase to reduce demand down to supply .
Fig 2 - One Saudi Arabia Needed Every Two Years - click to enlarge
Gabrielli also shows few new large discoveries being made recently in the chart below .
However , these discoveries can have significant lag periods before production reaches meaningful levels .
Petrobras ' recent discovery at Tupi may be about 5 billion barrels of oil and gas , but production is expected to grow slowly with capacity increasing to 100,000 barrels per day possibly by the end of this year .
This capacity is planned to remain constant until 2012 as part of the Tupi pilot project .
If full commerciality is declared , then Tupi might reach 1 mbd by 2022 .
Gabrielli also shows the large Kashagan discovery in 2000 which was supposed to start production in 2005 , but the earliest start date is now 2013 .
Additional constraints on world oil production are weaknesses in the production , refining and logistics systems .
In addition , Gabrielli points out that refineries need to be matched to the type of oil being produced .
Recently , world oil production is becoming heavier and more sour which requires suitable refineries .
The construction of these refineries can take several years .
Limitations of known reservoirs are an additional constraint as many existing fields are very old and cannot produce more oil easily .
Mexico's Cantarell field is in decline and Kuwait 's Burgan field has passed peak production .

In October 2009 , Gabrielli gave a different presentation which showed a forecast of world oil demand based on the IEA WEO 2008 and the EIA IEO 2009 shown below .
Note that the additional capacities required for 2020 and 2030 are larger than the ranges given in his December 2009 presentation .
For example , in 2020 , Fig 1 shows additional required capacity of 29 to 34 mbd while Fig 4 shows required capacity of 42 to 51 mbd .
This difference is due to Fig 4 excluding sanctioned project additions , whereas Fig 1 includes sanctioned project additions as sourced from Wood MacKenzie .
Gabrielli expresses concern about future oil supply as he states in the slide below that world oil production capacity will be challenged to meet projected demand growth .

Another source of capacity addition data is Wikipedia Oil Megaprojects .
If an annual decline rate of 4.5 % is assumed for existing production then the chart below also shows 2010 as peak oil capacity , excluding biofuels and processing gains .
The blue line represents the decline for existing production .
The oil production in 2030 in the chart below is just over 40 mbd which is higher than Gabrielli 's estimate from Fig 1 above .
This is due mainly to Gabrielli using a higher annual decline rate of 5 % and the Wikipedia Oil Megaprojects data including additional projects which are highly likely to be sanctioned .
Fig 5 - World Oil Capacity to 2030 based on Wikipedia Oil Megaproject Data - click to enlarge ( oil includes crude oil , lease condensate , oil sands and natural gas liquids )
The capacity addition data from Wikipedia Oil Megaprojects can also be plotted from 2003 to 2020 as shown in the chart below .
Additions from yet to be sanctioned projects and yet to be found oil have also been added .
The bulk of these additions are estimated to come from Iraq , Brazil deepwater , Russia , Saudi Arabia , USA deepwater and some West African deepwater .
The text in the chart indicates that world oil production has passed peak .
In addition , capacity additions in 2010 and 2011 should be only slightly less than the decline of existing production .
However , an oil supply crunch is shown for 2012 / 13 as new capacity additions in those years are less than natural global decline from existing fields .
Fatih Birol , chief economist of the IEA has also stated that an oil supply crunch could occur by 2014 .
One of the reasons for this crunch is that many projects were delayed when oil prices fell to under $ US40 per barrel in late 2008 .
Gabrielli says that the world needs the equivalent of one Saudi Arabia every two years just to keep production constant by offsetting natural oil decline rates .
In 2008 , Saudi Arabia produced 9.3 mbd of crude oil which is also represented by Gabrielli 's red line in Fig 2 above .
For the two years 2008 / 09 , the chart below shows capacity additions of 9.2 mbd which is just less than one Saudi Arabia .
If biofuel additions are also included , then the equivalent of one Saudi Arabia of capacity was added in 2008 / 09 .
However , it will be a big challenge to keep on adding a Saudi Arabia equivalent capacity every two years .
2010/11 capacity additions , including biofuels , will be less than one Saudi Arabia and in 2012 / 13 , additions will be only about one half of a Saudi Arabia .
Furthermore , the IEA 's World Energy Outlook has stated that decline rates are accelerating which means that in the future more than one Saudi Arabia equivalent capacity would be needed every two years to offset world oil decline rates .

Gabrielli 's concerns about peak oil capacity in 2010 and future declining world oil capacity should be taken seriously .
In Fig 1 above , he shows that by 2012 / 13 the world oil capacity will only just meet world demand , based on Wood MacKenzie 's data , highlighting the risk of a potential oil supply crunch .
If Wikipedia Oil Megaproject data are used then peak oil capacity is also indicated in 2010 as well as an an oil supply crunch in 2012 / 13 .
The IEA 's Fatih Birol has also stated that an oil supply crunch is likely to occur by 2014 .
In other words , the world does not have enough future Saudi Arabia equivalent capacity additions to stop world oil production from declining , causing an inevitable supply crunch within the next few years .

The southern limit of permanently frozen ground , or permafrost , is now 130 kilometers further north than it was 50 years ago in the James Bay region , according to two researchers from the Department of Biology at Université Laval .
In a recent issue of the scientific journal Permafrost and Periglacial Processes , Serge Payette and Simon Thibault suggest that , if the trend continues , permafrost in the region will completely disappear in the near future .
The researchers measured the retreat of the permafrost border by observing hummocks known as " palsas , " which form naturally over ice contained in the soil of northern peat bogs .
Conditions in these mounds are conducive to the development of distinct vegetation -- lichen , shrubs , and black spruce -- that make them easy to spot in the field .
In an initial survey in 2004 , the researchers examined seven bogs located between the 51st and 53rd parallels .
They noted at that time that only two of the bogs contained palsas , whereas aerial photos taken in 1957 showed palsas present in all of the bogs .
A second assessment in 2005 revealed that the number of palsas present in these two bogs had decreased over the course of one year by 86 % and 90 % respectively .
Helicopter flyovers between the 51st and 55th parallels also revealed that the palsas are in an advanced state of deterioration over the entire James Bay area .
While climate change is the most probable explanation for this phenomenon , the lack of long term climatic data for the area makes it impossible for the researchers to officially confirm this .
Professor Payette notes , however , that the average annual temperature of the northern sites he has studied for over 20 years has increased by 2 degrees Celsius .
" If this trend keeps up , what is left of the palsas in the James Bay bogs will disappear altogether in the near future , and it is likely that the permafrost will suffer the same fate , " concludes the researcher affiliated to the Centre d'études nordiques .
Washington ( CNN ) -- Idaho on Wednesday became the first state to pass a law saying no thanks to part of President Obama 's health care proposal .
The Idaho Health Care Freedom
Act says in part , " every person within the state of Idaho is and shall be free to choose or decline to choose any mode of securing health care services without penalty or threat of penalty . "
Gov. C.L. " Butch " Otter , a Republican , said Wednesday he signed it because he believes any health care laws should ensure people are " treated as an individual , rather than as an amorphous mass whose only purpose in this world is to obey federal mandates . "
Several other states may follow suit .
The governor of Virginia is expected to sign a bill passed in his state last week , and according to American Legislative Exchange Council , similar proposals have made it through one chamber of the legislatures in Missouri , Oklahoma and Tennessee .
While such bills have recently failed in six states , 22 additional states have seen proposals introduced .
These state laws would directly conflict with the national health care bill that Democrats are trying to pass , which includes a requirement that all individuals get health coverage or face a tax penalty .
Several legal analysts said if Congress enacts a national health care law , it would supersede any state laws written to block them .
" I think most of the states that are passing these laws understand that they can't trump federal law with state law , " said Professor Jonathan Siegel at George Washington University Law School .
" But what they get out of it is symbolic effect .
They 're sending a message to the federal politicians that they do n't like the health care mandate . "
Such state laws might not be the only legal challenge to Democratic health care legislation .
Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum , a Republican , on Tuesday sent a letter to the other 49 state attorneys general , asking them to join him " in preparing a legal challenge to the constitutionality of whatever individual mandate provision emerges , immediately upon the legislation becoming law . "
States have previously challenged federal laws and regulations in areas aside from health care .
Five states have passed a Firearms Freedom Act , according to firearmsfreedomact.com , including Montana , Wyoming , South Dakota , Tennessee and Utah .
The law declares that any guns that are manufactured and kept in - state are not subject to federal gun laws passed by Congress under interstate commerce authority , because the guns never crossed state lines .
A number of states have also passed laws trying to wrest more control from Washington over issues such as how public lands are used or how a state 's National Guard forces are deployed overseas , according to the 10th Amendment Center , which advocates for states ' rights .
While such laws may face an uphill path in court , supporters describe them as a sign of public opinion , which can still have impact .
They point to last year 's announcement of federal policy on medicinal marijuana , after 14 states passed laws to allow its use .
While federal drug law makes no exception to allow medicinal use of marijuana , Attorney General Eric Holder said in October that prosecuting the use of medicinal marijuana users would n't be a priority .
He said the Justice Department would instead " effectively focus our resources on serious drug traffickers , while taking into account state and local laws . "
CNN 's Brian Todd and Eric Weisbrod contributed to this report .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Justice Department is forming an intellectual property task force because of what some estimate to be billions of dollars in losses from copyright piracy .
The movie and software industries have been hard hit by piracy , often international .
The book industry is starting to be affected because of electronic books .
The recording industry says the vast majority of music consumed in China , once a center of illegal CD copying , is now downloaded illegally .
The Justice Department said on Friday that the creation of the task force followed a meeting called in December by Vice President Joe Biden , which Attorney General Eric Holder and other cabinet officials attended along with a who ’s who from the movie , music and book industries .
The attendees included Motion Picture Association of America Chairman Dan Glickman as well as top executives of the Recording Industry Association of America , Sony Pictures Entertainment , Warner Bros. and Time Warner , Viacom , General Electric ’s NBC Universal , Warner Music , Vivendi ’s Universal Music and Walt Disney Co .
“ This task force will allow us to identify and implement a multifaceted strategy with our federal , state and international partners to effectively combat this type of crime , ” said Holder .
Copyright theft costs companies more than $ 25 billion each year , according to Howard Gantman , a spokesman for the Motion Picture Association of America .
Public Knowledge ’s
Art Brodsky said he hoped the task force ’s emphasis would be on shutting down Chinese DVD and CD factories rather than going after individuals .
“ There is balance in copyright law , ” said Brodsky , who sought to defend “ the person who maybe posts a song ... someone who has no intent of making money off it .
The idea that you can be fined several thousand dollars for a 99 cent song is out of touch with reality . ”
The task force will be chaired by the deputy attorney general and other members will include officials from various divisions within the Justice Department .
Gary Grindler is the current acting deputy attorney general .
The task force is to coordinate with state and local law enforcement with an increased focus on links between piracy and international organized crime .
It will also coordinate with the office of Victoria Espinel , the intellectual property enforcement coordinator .
“ The Justice Department ’s new task force will play a critical role in supporting the Administration ’s ongoing efforts to protect American intellectual property and the millions of jobs that depend on it , ” said Espinel .
The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry has estimated that for every song purchased , 20 are downloaded illegally -- losses that could reach billions of dollars .
This document was developed by the participants of the OER Search and Discovery meeting , based on discussions at the meeting .
Introduction
This document aims to help those who ask , " What should I be doing when I publish my OER's so that they are searchable and discoverable by the OER community and ( perhaps ) the whole world ? " .
More specifically , this document aims to help those with a collection of such OER's .
There are several options for many of the fundamental questions .
Luckily , the number of options is actually quite limited .
For nearly all producers we recommend adopting one of the choices outlined below .
These have significant adoption and deployment , increasing the reach and exposure of your OER .
We will develop bridges between the different approaches ; indeed , many of these bridges already exist .
In essence , the choices boil down to :
If you are looking for a repository to store the OER's and make them available to the world , then you can contact ARIADNE or Connexions who will gladly do so on your behalf or provide you with the code to run your own repository .

We strongly suggest that you your repository For your content , we make no specific assumptions : HTML documents , OpenOffice documents , Microsoft Office documents , MPEG video clips , PDF documents , MP3 sound files , etc. ; anything goes .
Of course , in the spirit of open educational resources , we certainly encourage you to publish in as open a format as feasible .
educational resources , we certainly encourage you to publish in as open a format as feasible .
For the metadata , we strongly suggest to use either Learning Object Metadata or Dublin Core .
For specific niche domains , other formats like for instance MPEG apply as well .
You may also define a so - called ' application profile ' that defines your specific requirements your repository imposes with respect to metadata , so that you can enforce them .
In concrete terms , such metadata can be expressed as XML or RDF .
Harvesting
Harvesting is a technique that allows a software agent to collect resources ( content or metadata ) from a repository .
Some harvesting protocols such as OAI - PMH enable the requesting agent to retrieve only a specific set of metadata or content ( for instance based on a query that identifies what is relevant ) .
The major advantage of harvesting is that the harvester then has all the metadata or content available , so that queries from end users can be processed without further need to contact the harvested repositories .
Especially in the context of infrastructures with many dozens or more repositories , this can be quite important , as the response time involved with contacting repositories in order to answer and end user request becomes prohibitively long .
Moreover , when queries are forwarded to local repositories for federated search , the local repository may incur considerable load servicing third party queries .
The major concern with harvesting for some organisations is that this approach allows third parties to collect the metadata and content from a repository .
In an OER context , this is probably not much of a concern , but it can still raise issues about visibility for the party being harvested .
In concrete terms , there are two important harvesting protocols :
OAI - PMH : The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting is widely used by repositories of scholarly material and learning resources .
It can include simple queries to determine which metadata or content to harvest .
The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting is widely used by repositories of scholarly material and learning resources .
It can include simple queries to determine which metadata or content to harvest .
RSS / Atom : RSS and Atom are syndication formats , commonly used for web feeds that can be read by software such as Bloglines or Google Reader .
They may be used more generically to let software know about updates to a repository as resources are created or changed .
We suggest that you adopt OAI - PMH if you have no strong reason to prefer RSS , as OAI - PMH offers more features that can be important for third party developers .
If you also want to provide feeds of new objects that are deposited in your repository , then an additional RSS feed is quite useful .
Registration
In order to enable harvesting software to contact a provider of content and metadata , this software must be aware of
the location of the provider ( typically a URL ) , as well as
the protocol(s ) that the provider supports ( OAI - PMH , RSS ) .
This information is typically maintained in a so - called registry .
In a way , a registry is a meta- repository : a repository with information about repositories .
Its main goal is to enable other services to discover repositories .
To this effect , it sometimes also includes additional information about the content repositories , such as data about
the collections they hold : their domain , the number of resources , etc .
when the repository was last updated ,
etc .
We strongly encourage you to register your repository in with ARIADNE or OERfeeds .
info .
Metadata
Metadata describe the content .
We strongly suggest that you use either one of the following two metadata schemas , that define an extensive set of metadata elements :
LOM : The IEEE Learning Object Metadata standard defines circa 70 elements that can be used to describe general , technical , educational and other aspects .
DC : Dublin Core metadata are more generic in nature .
Specific extensions for learning content are discussed in the DCMI Education Community .
By adopting one of these common schemas , it is easy for software to process the metadata .
For specific niche content , standards such as MPEG ( for audio - visual material ) and others , special purpose formats may be more appropriate .
In that case , a mapping to LOM or DC enables interoperability with learning specific tools and infrastructures .
In order to enforce your requirements , you can define an " application profile " .
This typically involves making some metadata elements mandatory , or imposing constraints on the values that they can hold , etc .
Finally , the metadata are typically expressed in a machine - readable format , sometimes called a " binding " .
Common bindings includes :
XML : the Extensible Markup Language that is at the heart of many Web document formats ( like HTML ) .
RDF : the Resource Description Framework allows you to describe relationships and properties about your resources .
The information is commonly written as XML .
If you are publishing XHTML content , we recommend using RDFa to include the metadata with the content .
See " ccREL : The Creative Commons Rights Expression Language " for a discussion of applications enabled by co-locating metadata and content .
If you want to make sure that the metadata you expose adhere to your self - imposed requirements , we strongly suggest leveraging a validation service , such as ARIADNE 's validation service .

Macbeth Introduction
Stop us if you 've heard this one before : a man hears an exciting prophecy about his future and decides to take fate into his own hand by killing his king .
Things go rapidly downhill .
Sure , it 's possible that you were just tra -la - la-ing through the Internet and randomly stumbled over this guide , but we 're guessing that you already know Macbeth 's basic plot .
After all , it is one of the most famous works of English literature , and it's even loosely based on some real - life 11th - century events found in Holinshed 's Chronicles .
So let 's tell you something you might not know : when it was first performed by Shakespeare 's company around 1606 , Macbeth was the latest in ripped - from - the - headlines , up - to - the - minute political events .
It 's basically The Dark Knight trilogy of the ( very ) early 17th century .
Check it out :
(1) It was written in 1605 or 1606 , right after James I , the first Stuart king , took up the crown of England in 1603 .
James I was the son of Mary , Queen of Scots ( cousin to Elizabeth I ) and this less - than - direct connection meant that James was eager to assert any legitimacy he could over his right to the English throne .
Coincidentally , Macbeth is the only of Shakespeare 's plays set in Scotland , and it includes a nice little moment where he ties James I 's ancestry to the rightful succession .
(2) Witchcraft was a hot topic at the end of the 16th and beginning of the 17th century .
James I was particularly excited about witches — excited about hunting them down , that is — publishing his very own book about the subject , Daemonolgie , in 1597 .
Coincidentally , Macbeth begins with the stage directions , " Enter three witches . "
(3) In 1605 , James was also the target of the Gunpowder Plot , where a group of rebel Catholics tried to blow up the King and Parliament .
( This is where we get Guy Fawkes , that guy in V for Vendetta ) .
Coincidentally , Macbeth shows the murder of a king and alludes in Act II , scene iii , to the Catholic priest who encouraged Catholics to be deceptive and treasonous .
These allusions would have struck a sensitive chord with the play 's audience — a lot like referring to the attacks of September 11th .
In case you have n't picked up on it , we do n't actually think these are coincidences .
Shakespeare was consciously writing a play that would be topical , touching on the subjects that everyone — from the groundlings to the king himself — would be thinking about .
Presumably , King James was happy enough with the play : Shakespeare 's theater company The Kings Men , which was under the patronage of the king himself , survived the performance .
But , even though the world is restored to normal at the end of the play , we have to wonder : was Shakespeare 's critique of power intended to hit home ?
And did it ?
That 's how scientists , including NASA , have been characterizing 2010 AL30 .
The object will reach its closest approach to Earth at 7:45 AM EST ( 1245 GMT ) on Wednesday morning .
2010 AL30 has been thought to possibly be man-made because of its orbital period , which is almost exactly one year .
After all , there is a lot of junk out that that we have deposited and left .
However , Paul Chodas , a scientist at NASA 's Near - Earth Object Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , CA says that he took a closer look at 2010 AL30 on Monday and in his opinion , it is not man-made , but rather , a small asteroid .
Chodas said the 2010 AL30's trajectory is not the type used to transfer spacecraft out of Earth 's orbit .
Additionally , there appear to be no other objects that might typically " follow " in the wake of a manmade object .
Finally , he said that during the Apollo lunar missions of the late 1960s and 1970s , when many spacecraft were launched into the space near the moon , it was far from Earth .
2010 AL30 is estimated to be about 36 feet ( 11 meters ) wide .
According to Spaceweather.com , it will appear as bright as a 14th magnitude star .
It will pass through the constellations Orion , Taurus and Pisces as it moves by the Earth .
For those who wonder just how often NEOs pass the Earth , another will bypass us later this week .
However , that asteroid , 2010 AG30 , will miss us by 650,000 miles , a much more comfortable distance , though a near - miss in astronomical terms .

Browns wide receiver and return man Josh Cribbs says he ’s finished in Cleveland .
“ I said good - bye to some people on the medical staff , some of the equipment guys and the coaches , ” Cribbs told the Cleveland Plain Dealer today .
“ I wished the coaches luck and told them I hoped they kept their job .
But it absolutely felt like the last time I ’d be setting foot inside the building .
I feel like it ’s over for me in Cleveland . ”
Cribbs , who previously said he does n’t think he fits in new front office boss Mike Holmgren ’s plans , said he expects Holmgren to trade him during the off - season .
“ There ’s no way I ’ll play another down for the Browns without the new contract , ” he said .
“ They wo n’t let me sit , because I have value .
They ’d be forced to trade me . ”
Cribbs said Holmgren made the right call in retaining Browns coach Eric Mangini , but he thinks Holmgren has insulted him by giving him a $ 1.4 million a year offer that suggests the Browns see him as strictly a special teams player , and not a threat on offense .
“ I ’m not just insulted by the number , but by the fact they consider me just a kick returner , ” Cribbs said .
“ I ’m so much more than that .
. . .
I ’m shocked they make me an offer like that after all I ’ve done for this team . ”
In addition to being a Pro Bowl returner , Cribbs caught 20 passes for 135 yards and ran 55 times for 381 yards this season .
Green Party elected officials seem to be having problems with their consciences at the moment .
And indeed it ’s not only Deirdre de Burca who is calling John Gormley ’s leadership into question .
As I said on Friday there ’s a lot more going on behind the scenes that has very little to do with Willie O’Dea .
The most productive ( in terms of mainstream news interest ! ) twitter account of a politician in Ireland was busy again tonight .
Senator Boyle as is usual disappeared after tweeting something controversial and despite the best efforts of all the media to track him down Dan was nowhere to be seen .
No other members of the party to be found to appear on programmes on radio or TV either .
Maybe they were busy at the meeting I mentioned earlier listening to Cóirites talking about the evils of the Civil Partnership in the gatecrashed rendezvous with Eamon Ryan .
This current difficulty and unease is not about the Greens stating they do n’t wish to be ‘ moral compass ’ on the past ills of Fianna Fáil either .
There are very current ills that the Greens are being pressurised to overlook in order to get their agenda through .
An unfortunate still shot from today in the Dáil that featured heavily on twitter tonight .
RedState Bans Birthers
Created : February 12 , 2010 16:11 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
RedState ’s Erick Erickson announces a blanket ban on conspiracy theorists at his site , taking some whacks at liberals and “ Clintonistas ” for starting the “ truther ” and “ birther ” conspiracy theories while announcing that he will “ part ways with the individuals and groups willing to share the stage and treat as legitimate the crazies who believe the President was born in Kenya , the crazies who believe our government was complicit September 11th terrorist attacks … two groups , incidentally that increasingly overlap . ”
It ’s an interesting statement , especially for the focus on how craziness can blow back onto the rest of the conservative movement .
Markos Moulitsas of Daily Kos has long banned conspiracy theorists , but that has not stopped the occasional anti-Zionist diary from appearing on the site , generating a ton of comments and being used against Kos and allies as “ representative ” of the left .
The whole statement :
We ’ve always banned truthers at RedState .
Increasingly , we have also banned a number of individuals who think Barack Obama is disqualified from being President because despite the Republican Governor of Hawaii confirming the legitimacy of the Democratic President ’s birth origin as a citizen of the United States .
Today I want to reaffirm and make it more definitive .
If you think 9/11 was an inside job or you really want to debate whether or not Barack Obama is an American citizen eligible to be President , RedState is not a place for you .
Birfers and Truthers are not welcome here .
Period .
End of Story .
But I want to expand on this too .
The tea party movement is in danger of getting a bad reputation for allowing birfers and truthers to share the stage .
At the National Tea Party , Joseph Farah treated the birfer issue as legitimate .
In Texas , tea party activists have rallied to Debra Medina who , just yesterday , refused to definitely dismiss the 9/11 truther conspiracy as crackpot nonsense .
If a candidate cannot do that , we cannot help that candidate .
It ’s that simple .
So we arrive at one of those moments where I am fully prepared to part ways with the individuals and groups willing to share the stage and treat as legitimate the crazies who believe the President was born in Kenya , the crazies who believe our government was complicit September 11th terrorist attacks … two groups , incidentally that increasingly overlap .
This sets us up for attacks from the left and from within that we must anticipate .
It is one thing to separate ourselves from these individuals and groups .
It is quite another to know that these people are among us .
We should be careful .
All of us have an obligation to vet those who we ally with .
Just because someone is stridently against the size of government does not make him an ally if he also believes the U.S. Army blew up the World Trade Center .
Such a person brings disrepute on us all , deservedly so .
On the other hand , it may not be known that someone is a birfer or truther .
We should be willing to show each other good grace and a measure of understanding in dealing with the troublesome fringe .
We should also remember it was the Clintonistas who started the birfer rumor and the most vocal truthers live in Hollywood and voted for Obama .
That is not , however , an excuse for us to associate with the nuts .
The media never runs stories about the Communist Party USA ’s routine pronouncements in favor of Barack Obama .
The media has never run legitimate stories about Barack Obama ’s ties to the communist oriented New Party in Chicago .
Obama gets a pass even on radicals whose support he personally solicited and those he personally befriended for years .
But the moment a birfer opens his mouth and spouts his stupidity from the stage of a tea party rally it becomes headline news on every news network .
Complain all you like that that ’s not fair , but it ’s the world we live in .
We must be vigilant .
We must be willing to draw a line in the sand and stand against fatuous nonsense that opens up the right to attacks by a left - leaning media intent on embarrassing the good people who have developed through the tea party movement a renewed sense of civic involvement .
Birfers and Truthers have no place among us .
And they are most decidedly not welcome at RedState .
This sets us up for attacks from the left and from within that we must anticipate .
It is one thing to separate ourselves from these individuals and groups .
It is quite another to know that these people are among us .
We should be careful .
All of us have an obligation to vet those who we ally with .
Just because someone is stridently against the size of government does not make him an ally if he also believes the U.S. Army blew up the World Trade Center .
Such a person brings disrepute on us all , deservedly so .
I ’d add that “ birthers ” often encourage members of the U.S. military not to serve under Barack Obama — it was the saga of a military contractor , Stefan Cook , that pushed the “ birther ” conspiracy theory into the headlines .
How Ruby Manages Memory and Garbage Collection
By Peter Cooper
Garbage Collection and the Ruby Heap is a presentation given by Joe Damato and Aman Gupta at the recent LA Ruby Conference .
You only get the slides for now ( all 70 of them ! ) , but they 're very detailed and can almost work as a standalone concise e-book on Ruby 's garbage collection system .
Joe and Aman take a look at C memory management vs Ruby and show the difference between the stack and the heap .
As a garbage collected language , Ruby takes the easy route by putting everything on the heap and the presentation demonstrates how the MRI ( Matz 's Ruby 1.8 ) does this , as well as how objects are tracked within memory ( right down to the underlying C structs ) .
MRI 's garbage collection scheme is n't particularly well optimized ( though Phusion 's Ruby Enterprise Edition has made some tweaks ) and the presentation demonstrates the viability of some other garbage collection schemes ( as always , the issue is compatibility with native extensions ) .
The presentation finishes off with a interesting walkthrough of using memprof ( a Ruby memory profiler ) to debug a memory leak in Rails 3 .

I want to flag this story by Anne Stuhldreher because it ’s a pretty great financial innovation .
From the Washington Post , Credit unions launch a savings lottery , and everyone hits the jackpot ( my bold ) :
… But eight Michigan credit unions , including one in Highland Park , have helped build people ’s savings by doing something radical : acting less like financial institutions and more like the lottery …
Some estimates suggest that more than 80 percent of lottery revenue comes from households making less than $ 50,000 a year — the very people who have the hardest time saving ….
In January 2009 , the credit unions declared that for every $ 25 someone saved , the saver would earn an entry into a drawing for a $ 100,000 prize one year later .
At the same time , they gave out monthly prizes of up to $ 100 …
Save to Win produced stunning results .
More than 11,000 Michigan residents opened accounts through the contest , saving $ 8.6 million throughout 2009 …
More than half of the participants said they had n’t saved regularly before opening their accounts .
About 60 percent admitted they played the lottery during the past six months .
And 44 percent earned less than $ 40,000 .
Highland Park ’s Communicating Arts Credit Union led the charge .
It had tried a lot of things to get its members to save , including offering a CD with a whopping 10 percent interest rate , but nothing worked , according to chief executive Hank Hubbard .
But 15 percent of its members opened Save to Win accounts , the highest rate among the eight credit unions .
“ We were very surprised , ” Hubbard said .
“ It ’s a breathtaking penetration rate , especially for a new product and one focused on saving , since that ’s something our members do n’t do . ”
Here ’s a representative site of a Save to Win .
Remember , following arguments like the ones in Karelis ’ Persistence of Poverty , it ’s perfectly reasonable to think that poor people have an increasing marginal utility in cash – that , at the margin , having a tenth dollar is worth more than having the first dollar .
So with that in mind , it can be perfectly rational for poor people to not save the first dollar and risk it on trying to get the tenth dollar with a lottery ticket .
So why not incorporate it into a savings account ?
Take a small interest rate cut , say a tenth of a percent , from each savings account , and then randomly give that to a few members , conditional on them saving money .
I think it ’s brilliant , and it does n’t surprise me that it ’s started with credit unions , where some of the most consumer friendly innovation is being tried .
Where most commercial banks are looking to payday lenders for innovation , credit unions appear to be looking at cutting edge behavioral “ nudge ” style work for innovations to help people build their financial lives .
How cool is that ?
So -Called Free Trade Agreements are to Free Trade , as the Ministry of Love is to Love
There ’s an unfortunate tendency among many libertarians to accept at face value neoliberalism ’s self - identification with “ free markets ” and “ free trade . ”
For example Jim Bovard , who usually comes down on the right side of things involving government power , in “ Feeling Your Pain ” dismissed Seattle anti-WTO protesters as “ opponents of trade , capitalism , and modern civilization , ” and accepted the Uruguay Round as a straightforward agreement to “ lower trade barriers ” — despite arguably creating a system of trade barriers more statist and more protectionist than the wildest imaginings of Smoot and Hawley .
At The Washington Times (! ) , Cato ’s Daniel Griswold comments : “ Despite complaints from critics on the left , such as Ralph Nader , and even a few libertarians , such as Rep. Ron Paul of Texas , membership in the World Trade Organization serves Americas national interest . ”
WTO membership , he argues , helps both to keep U.S. markets open , “ for the benefit of U.S. consumers and import - using industries , ” but “ also promotes trade liberalization abroad , which opens markets and keeps them open for U.S. exporters … . ”
Further , he says , WTO membership “ does not limit our freedom as individual Americans ” ; rather , trade agreements “ limit the power of governments to interfere in the peaceful commerce of their citizens , ” which in turn “ enhances the liberty and prosperity of all Americans . ”
It ’s interesting that Griswold specifically mentions “ genetically modified crops , ” “ high - technology products , ” and “ copyrighted sound recordings ” among the American exports promoted by the WTO .
That suggests , however obliquely , what fake “ free trade ” agreements like the Uruguay Round of GATT are really all about .
It ’s no coincidence , comrades — as Lenin might say — that the main beneficiary industries of the Uruguay Round and the rest of the phony “ free trade ” regime are those most dependent on “ intellectual property . ”
Strong —nay , draconian — IP law is at the heart of the neoliberal “ free trade ” agenda .
Again , it ’s no coincidence that the leading industries in the global economy are software , entertainment , biotech , electronics , and the kind manufacturing in which corporations outsource all production to independent contractors and rely entirely on ownership of “ intellectual property ” to maintain control of their supplier networks .
In short , “ intellectual property ” plays the same protectionist role for the global corporate economy that tariffs did for the old national industrial economies .
From the perspective of transnational corporations , it has the virtue of decoupling protectionism from geography .
As a result , all the inconvenient barriers to a single corporation transferring production inputs and unfinished goods across national lines are removed .
The barriers enforced by IP protectionism coincide , not with national borders , but corporate walls .
But just as much as did tariffs , “ intellectual property ” regulates who is allowed to sell a given product in a given market and protects the privileged “ owner ” of that “ right ” against competition from unauthorized sellers .
To get some perspective on just how protectionist , how statist , how authoritarian “ intellectual property ” is , let ’s go back to Griswold ’s Bearded - Spock universe claim that the WTO and the accords it enforces do n’t limit our freedom as individual American citizens .
Mr. Griswold should try getting a DMCA takedown letter , or getting his Internet service cut off by the “ three strikes ” laws likely to be passed pursuant to ACTA .
He should try wearing a T - shirt with DeCSS printed on it , or try playing a DRM ’ed CD on an unauthorized platform or using a computer sabotaged with Genuine Advantage .
He should try manufacturing generic spare parts and accessories for proprietary industrial platforms , or selling an identical knockoff of a proprietary industrial design for a price actually approaching the marginal cost of production .
If Mr. Griswold equates the WTO to “ free trade ” and believes the neoliberal trade agenda does n’t limit our freedom as citizens , all I can say is his ideas of “ free trade ” and “ individual freedom ” are worthless to any genuine libertarian .
If it ’s true that the Uruguay Round and WTO do n’t limit our individual freedoms , it ’s true only to the extent that they ’re unenforceable .
And thank God , they are .
Roots of Free Speech Laws
In British common law , " free speech " was defined as no " prior restraint " ; that is , people were free to say whatever they wanted , but they could then be prosecuted for sedition or seditious libel
In 1735 , American printer Peter Zenger successfully challenged British seditious libel law in New York colonial court
Zenger case established a more generous free speech standard in American colonies than in Britain
During American Revolution , new American states passed restrictive sedition laws
American colonists inherited a rich free speech tradition from the British ; the tightly linked rights of free speech and press could be traced back centuries through a dense web of common law .
But within this common law tradition , free speech was largely defined as no " prior restraint . "
People had the right to say or publish what they wanted , but they were not protected from prosecution for sedition or seditious libel for what they wrote .
Moreover , the definition of these employed by the courts was pretty broad .
Under British common law , a person could be found guilty of sedition for any statement that disrespected the social hierarchy upon which the political order rested .
Believing that there was a natural order to things — superiors and inferiors , rulers and subjects — British common law labeled as seditious any statement that threatened to subvert the " natural " social hierarchy .
Moreover , a person could be found guilty of sedition under British law regardless of the truth , effect , or intent of the statement .
A person could whisper a half - serious , but truthful joke to a friend — " the prime minister is a philandering drunk " — which resulted in no real damage to the official or the political order , but still could be found guilty .
This was because the courts could legally impose a " bad tendency test , " and consider whathave happened as a consequence of a statement .
What actuallyhappen was beside the point .
If the court could imagine a plausible set of negative events resulting from an individual 's statement , he could be convicted of sedition on the basis of this fabricated scenario .
In 1735 , an American printer Peter Zenger successfully challenged this understanding of seditious libel in a New York court .
When he was arrested for criticizing the royal governor , he argued that the truth of his statements should protect him from conviction ; that is , a person should be protected from seditious libel charges if his statements were true .
Moreover , Zenger argued , the jury , rather than the judge , should determine whether a particular statement met the standard of libel .
Zenger 's victory set a more generous precedent for American courts during the colonial period .
But this right of free speech was still far from the right we enjoy today .
While the colonial courts operated with a more lenient standard , colonial legislatures continued to pass restrictive speech laws .
They insisted that as legislators their own speech must be protected , but they also believed that good order required prohibitions against speech that insulted or interfered with the operations of the government .
Nor did the practice change after Americans declared independence .
During the Revolution , state legislatures passed sedition acts punishing speech they deemed unacceptable .
For example , New York passed a law in 1781 that made it illegal to say or print that the King of England had or should have any authority over the colonies .
In other words , if we look to the broader historical context — to the British common law tradition and the American colonial and Revolutionary practice — free speech meant , for the most part , no prior restraint .
American courts employed a more protective definition of seditious libel , but colonial and state legislatures had no problem defining and punishing unacceptable forms of speech .
Nor is there anything to suggest that the states wanted to establish a different type of protection when they demanded that the government add a bill of rights to the Constitution .

Alan Jackson ’s PostScript :: MailLabels is a Perl utility to automate production of high - quality label layouts .
it is designed to be useful to Perl scripters , who can easily incorporate high - quality PostScript output into their scripts , but the scripts included in the base package are , themselves , an easy - to - use set of command - line tools for label printing .
Best of all , the package provides printer calibration and alignment tools .
INSTALLATION
PostScript :: MailLabels is available through two routes — you can download the package as a bundle from Jackson ’s site , or you can have Perl automatically fetch it for you from the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network ( CPAN ) .
The latest version on Jackson ’s site is 2.30 ( CPAN ’s may be slightly behind , but is from the same major release version and incorporates the same features ) .
To install , download and unpack the .tar.gz archive on your system .
From a command line , switch to the unpacked directory and type perl Makefile .
PL , followed by make to build the installable package .
At this point , you can optionally run make test , which will have PostScript : : MailLabels generate some test pages — useful the first time you install , but not required .
Finally , sudo make install will install the package system - wide .
“ PostScript : : MailLabels can produce two calibration aids , one that allows you to measure the printable area of the page ( left ) , and one that lets you test X - and Y - alignment ( right ) . ”
To fetch PostScript :: MailLabels from CPAN , just type perl - MCPAN -e ' install PostScript :: MailLabels ' , and Perl will take care of the rest .
CPAN support is common to the vast majority of Linux distributions , but you should check to see if your distro ’s package is installed , just to be sure .
HOW IT WORKS
Because PostScript :: MailLabels is a Perl module , not a standalone script , it can only be used inside of other Perl scripts .
Fortunately , Jackson provides a few demonstration scripts that will let even the complete Perl novice get started easily printing labels .
In practical usage , PostScript : : MailLabels lets you define a label set by the dimensions of the paper and label sheet ( including the standard Avery and Dymo product codes ) , the address format you wish to use ( which is completely flexible , suitable for home and business use , in any country , and supports postal bar codes ) , and font .
In addition , you can specify adjustments to account for the printable area and alignment of your printer .
For example , a label setup in your script could be as simple as
$ labels -> labelsetup ( Avery => $ labels ->averycode ( 5160 ) , PaperSize => ' letter ' , Font => ' Helvetica ' , ) ;
You set up the address layout line - by - line , such as
$ labels -> definelabel ( 0 , 'attentionline ' , ) ; $ labels -> definelabel ( 1 , ' firmname ' , ) ; $ labels -> definelabel ( 2 , 'deliveryaddress ' , ) ; $ labels -> definelabel ( 3 , 'city ' , ' state ' , 'zip ' , ) ; $ labels -> definelabel ( 4 , 'country ' , ) ;
Each of the fields requires a simple definition including its name , the component “ type ” ( name , road , place , or bar ) , whether the field can be trimmed for length to fit onto the label , the field ’s index number in the input array , and the font to use ( possibly overriding the default ) .
For example ,
$ labels ->editcomponent ( ' attentionline ' , 'name ' , 'no ' , 0 , ' Helvetica ' ) ; $ labels ->editcomponent ( ' firmname ' , 'name ' , 'no ' , 1 , ' Helvetica ' ) ; $ labels->editcomponent ( ' deliveryaddress ' , ' road ' , 'yes ' , 2, ' Helvetica ' ) ; $ labels ->editcomponent ( ' city ' , ' name ' , ' no ' , 3 , ' Helvetica ' ) ; $ labels ->editcomponent ( ' state ' , 'name ' , 'no ' , 4 , ' Helvetica ' ) ; $ labels ->editcomponent ( ' zip ' , ' place ' , ' yes ' , 5 , ' Helvetica ' ) ; $ labels ->editcomponent ( ' country ' , ' name ' , 'no ' , 6 , ' Helvetica ' ) ;
Note in these two examples that the city , state , and zip fields appear on different lines in the input array , but that PostScript : : MailLabels lets us place them all on the same line of the address label layout .
The component “ type ” is important because PostScript : : MailLabels attempts to automatically trim extra-long lines to fit , and uses different strategies depending on the data type .
‘ name ’ fields get their first name abbreviated to initials first , while ‘ road ’ fields get suffixes like “ Road ” and “ Street ” excised first .
“ PostScript : : MailLabels ’s demo output , showcasing the tool ’s ability to produce postal barcodes , as well as to save paper by starting in the middle of a previously - used sheet of labels . ”
Adjustments to the printing settings border widths for the printable area of the page ( Printable_Left , Printable_Right , Printable_Top , and Printable_Bot ) , specifications for where the labels begin on the page ( Output_Left , Output_Top , etc ) , and shifts that can be applied to the entire generated output ( X_Adjust and Y_Adjust ) .
Finally , $ output = $ labels -> makelabels ( \@addrs ) ; produces the output .
By default , the file is named labelsheet.ps , and you can print it directly on any PostScript printer .
TAKING PostScript :: MailLabels FOR A TEST SPIN
If you are not a Perl hacker , assembling a script from scratch might sound a bit daunting .
Jackson has complete documentation of PostScript :: MailLabels on his site , including the full options for layout and font handling , working with Avery and Dymo codes , postal barcodes , and more .
Just as good is that he provides code for a test program that both explains the options and produces helpful reference output .
You can copy - and - save the code posted under the example heading as example .pl , and run it from the command line .
In addition to the PostScript sample defined in the script , it will write several output lines to the terminal .
These include a list of the defined address components , a sample of the defined layout , a list of the fonts available on the system , a list of the acceptable paper sizes , a list of the known
Avery template types , and the widths of various test strings ( including zip codes and bar codes , because fitting them to the label is so critical to proper delivery ) .
For a simpler , more straightforward usage scenario , look at the demonstration scripts in the package ’s / demo / directory .
Even if you are new to Perl , these demo scripts will let you get started with easy modifications to learn the ropes .
In particular , take a look at std_business.pl , which prints addresses on standard letter - sized paper .
The __DATA__ section at the end of the script holds a “ virtual ” data file of sample addresses , including a mix of different name and addressing options , in the United States and abroad .
Running perl std_business.pl will produce a PostScript output file called labeltest.ps based on this data .
You can run the script as - is to get a feel for what it does , after which modifying it for your own data , label definitions , and layout may be an easier path to customization than writing a script from scratch .
As you make your own modifications , though , do n’t overlook two very important options : starting in the middle of a label sheet , and running the test output to calibrate your layout .
The FirstLabel directive tells PostScript : MailLabels where on the grid of labels you have defined to print the first entry ( starting from the top left ) ; you use this to begin printing on a sheet where some of the labels have already been printed .
Just add the line FirstLabel => 4 ( or whichever the appropriate number ) to your labelsetup parameters .
You run the test output by calling $ output = $ labels -> labelcalibration ; and $ output = $ labels -> labeltest ; instead of $ labels -> makelabels .
The first will create a PostScript page of the appropriate side with a set of calibrated X and Y axes at the center and extending to the edges of the page — you can use it to precisely measure the printable dimensions of your page .
The second will generate a blank “ template ” page with outlines marking where the labels should be ; you can hold this up next to a sheet of real labels to test for proper alignment before printing .
If you like Perl , you ’ll want to dig into PostScript : : MailLabels to uncover even more of what it can do .
But even if you ’re new to Perl , the easy to use syntax and support options make it a breeze to pick up .

De Bruijn notation as a nested datatype
By Richard Bird and Ross Paterson , in the Journal of Functional Programming , available from Ross Paterson ’s website :
de Bruijn notation is a coding of lambda terms in which each occurrence of a bound variable x is replaced by a natural number , indicating the `distance ’ from the occurrence to the abstraction that introduced x .
One might suppose that in any datatype for representing de Bruijn terms , the distance restriction on numbers would have to maintained as an explicit datatype invariant .
However , by using a nested ( or non-regular ) datatype , we can define a representation in which all terms are well - formed , so that the invariant is enforced automatically by the type system .
Programming with nested types is only a little more difficult than programming with regular types , provided we stick to well - established structuring techniques .
These involve expressing inductively defined functions in terms of an appropriate fold function for the type , and using fusion laws to establish their properties .
In particular , the definition of lambda abstraction and beta reduction is particularly simple , and the proof of their associated properties is entirely mechanical .

SHANGHAI  Flush with cash despite the global economic downturn , China ’s sovereign wealth fund quietly bought more than $ 9 billion worth of shares last year in some of the biggest American corporations , including Morgan Stanley , Bank of America and Citigroup .
Although most of the stakes were small , the China Investment Corporation , the government ’s $ 300 billion investment fund , now owns stock in some of the best - known American brands , including Apple , Coca - Cola , Johnson & Johnson , Motorola and Visa .
The detailed list , which contained holdings totaling $ 9.6 billion as of Dec. 31 , was disclosed Friday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission ; it lists stakes only in companies traded in the United States .
The filing offers a glimpse of how China is trying to diversify its more than $ 2 trillion in foreign currency holdings with stock , rather than investing almost entirely in United States Treasury bonds and other debt securities issued by governments and by government - sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae .

California Charter School Association Co-Founder and long time board member Steve Poizner is running for Governor .
He spoke at the reactionary right wing Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) on Friday , February 19 , 2010 .
In a speech in which he proposes unconscionable further tax cuts for the ueber - wealthy and corporations in the midst of a recession , rails against public unions and brags about his plan to neuter labor once and for all , the most vile and venomous portion of Steve Poizner ’s speech at CPAC was reserved for undocumented peoples .
In fact , his hateful rhetoric sounded exactly like speeches by Jim Gilchrist , founder of the vicious anti-immigrant group “ The Minutemen . ”
Here ’s the CCSA founder Steve Poizner tipping his hand ( more appropriately his hood ) , at the event headlined by Glen Beck :
And last , but not least — sometimes it ’s unpopular to talk about it on the campaign trail — I do n’t care .
I ’m going to be a truth teller .
Last , but not least , we have to stop illegal immigration once and for all !
[ lengthy rabid applause from racist crowd ]
We ’re going to do two things ; and I know there ’s some people who think it ’s just a Federal matter , but it ’s not .
The Governor can do a lot about it .
First thing I ’m going to do is turn the magnets off .
There ’s a lot of state programs that attract people to California illegally , and I ’m going to turn those magnets off .
And the second thing I ’m going to do is I ’m going to secure the border .
If I have to send the National Guard to the border , that ’s what I ’m gonna do .
Lest the CCSA try to deny Poizner ’s founding , influence , and leading position with the California Charter School Association , he was their co-founder and a board member as late as 2008 .
From CCSA Co-Founder Steve Poizner ’s biography on his campaign site : “ Steve demonstrated his passion for local control of schools by co-founding EdVoice and the California Charter Schools Association – the state ’s leading charter school organization .
Since his involvement in the charter school movement began , the number of charter schools in California has doubled . ”
CCSA Co-Founder Steve Poizner on Wikipedia : “ In 2003 , Poizner co-founded the California Charter Schools Association . ”
A CCSA Press Release from 2008 lists Steve Poizner as a Board Member .
Another CCSA Press Release from 2005 lists Steve Poizner as a Board Member .
One wonders what Poizner ’s close friends and fellow charter charlatans Jed Wallace , Steve Barr , Marco Petruzzi , Judy Burton , Ben Austin , and all the other CCSA cheerleaders will have to say about this outrageous speech .
In fact , will any of the corporate friendly opportunists including : Yolie Flores - Aguilar of LAUSD , Monica Garcia of LAUSD , Maria Casillas of Families in Schools , Jarad Sanchez of Alliance for a Better Community , Veronica Melvin of Alliance for a Better Community , Gabe Rose of Green Dot Public [ sic ]

However , CCSA co-founder Steve Poizner may have shown the charter - voucher supporters ’ true face a little earlier than their right wing billionaire backers might have liked .
Anyone concerned with fighting racism and forwarding civil rights needs to join the struggle against the charter school industry .

As many as one - quarter of researchers handling nanomaterials do not use any lab protection measures , such as fume hoods , and half do not use masks or respirators to prevent inhalation of particles , according to an international survey of research laboratories by a team of Spanish researchers ( Nat. Nanotechnol . , DOI : 10.1038/nnano.2010.1 ) .
“ We do n’t know a lot about the consequences of long - term exposure to nanoparticles , ” comments Kristen Kulinowski , director of external affairs at Rice University ’s Center for Biological & Environmental Nanotechnology and director of the International Council on Nanotechnology .
Consequently , much of the available guidance for handling nanomaterials safely focuses on minimizing exposure .
“ It sounds like that message has not gotten down to the research community , ” Kulinowski says .
The survey team , led by Jesus Santamaria of the Nanoscience Institute of Aragon at the University of Zaragoza , used a Web of Science literature search for keywords such as “ nanoparticle ” and “ nanotube ” to identify researchers working with nanomaterials .
They contacted 2,300 researchers , and 240 completed the survey .
Of those , 95 % were from universities or other institutional research labs .
About 35 % of the respondents were laboratory principal investigators .
The rest were other researchers in the groups .
The survey found that among researchers who were aware that their materials could become airborne , 21 % used “ no special protection ” in the lab and 30 % used no personal protective equipment when handling nanomaterials .
The survey results are not surprising to representatives of the National Institute for Occupational Safety & Health , who have observed similar results in field studies they conduct to evaluate methods to determine exposure to airborne particles , says Charles L. Geraci Jr. , coordinator of NIOSH ’s Nanotechnology Research Center .
NIOSH has developed a two - pronged approach for assessing nanoparticle exposure that includes both general particle counters and filter - based sampling coupled with chemical and microscopic analysis to determine the identity of particles ( J. Occup .
Environ .
Hygiene , DOI : 10.1080/15459620903476355 ) .
In field studies , NIOSH researchers found that nanomaterials can become airborne during tasks such as cleaning of reactors , weighing , and sonicating .
Nanomaterials are emitted in the form of agglomerates and clusters rather than as individual fibers or spherical particles ( J. Occup .
Environ .
Hygiene , DOI : 10.1080/15459620903508066 ) .
Andrew D. Maynard , chief science adviser at the nonprofit Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies , questions the results of the Spanish survey , saying that the questions were poorly worded and contained confusing language : A “ mouth mask without filters , ” for example , could be taken to be a simple surgical mask or one that is designed to be a particulate filter , such as the N95 mask found by NIOSH to be effective against nanoparticulate aerosols .
But the confusion , Maynard adds , still points to a need for better understanding , awareness , and implementation of safe - handling protocols for nanomaterials .
Tutorial on how to make a fractal map .
Example : [ link ]
It was very cool to figure out how to make this , and somebody asked how I did it , so I put together this tutorial .
I have used these maps for D&D games before , and I 've found it 's very nice because of all of the little details that can be filled in .
The map here is very , very small .
If you want to generate maps with this technique , I 'd recommend making it as big as your computer can handle .
Several changes to the X86 and KVM code are to speed up the kernel 's own hypervisor .
The kernel developers once again revised and considerably extended the still emerging tracing infrastructure .
The Power and PowerPC code now also supports the Gamecube and Wii games consoles .
When releasing Linux 2.6.33 -rc7 at the end of last week , Linus Torvalds expressed some dissatisfaction because the main development branch currently contains more flaws than he would like .
He asked the developers to take another close look at the list of known bugs in the predecessor of 2.6.33 and indicated that he will probably release an eighth RC before finalising Linux 2.6.33 .
The Kernel Log takes this opportunity to continue its report about the advancements of Linux 2.6.33 , discussing what 's new in terms of architecture support , kernel infrastructure , tracing and virtualisation in the following fourth part of the " Coming in 2.6.33 " mini series .
The first , second and third part of this series covered the most important changes concerning network support , file systems , the storage subsystem and graphics hardware .
Virtualisation
Numerous improvements have been made to the KVM ( Kernel - based Virtual Machine ) virtualisation solution , which is mainly developed by Red Hat .
Some of these , for instance , have improved the kernel hypervisor 's interaction with the Cpufreq framework responsible for changing the clock speed of modern processors .
Various other changes to the KVM code , in combination with X86 code modifications , are to reduce the management effort required for context switches , which is designed to improve performance ( 1 , 2 ) .
KVM no longer blocks the virtualisation functions of modern CPUs unless it actually needs them ; this allows other virtualisation solutions to work without first having to unload the KVM 's kernel modules when KVM is inactive .
The KVM developers also improved the operation of paravirtualised Xen guest systems under Xen .
Furthermore , the kernel can now shift memory areas that have been merged by the KSM ( Kernel Shared Memory ) feature , which was created in the KVM area and introduced in Linux 2.6.32 , into swap memory if required .
Mainly developed by Novell , the KVM - related AlacrityVM hypervisor , designed specifically for High Performance Computing ( HPC ) and real - time applications , was submitted for inclusion in 2.6.33 but did n't make it , just like the distributed Ceph file system .
According to Torvalds , this was both because of time issues and because too few of the kernel developers and distributors appear to have advocated it ; several kernel hackers had previously accused the AlacrityVM developers of insufficient cooperation with the developers of the KVM project , sparking protracted discussions ; an article on LWN .
net summarises the respective background information .
Tracing
The developers have made further changes to the tracing infrastructure around Ftrace and to the performance events previously called performance counters ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) .
The new " kprobe - based event tracer " allows probe points to be added to almost any kernel area at run-time ( documentation ) ; users can access this infrastructure via the " perf " program , which is included in Linux and offers a new " probe " subcommand .
Details of a previous developer version of the now added code can be found in an article released on LWN .
net last summer .
LWN . net also offers three articles by Steven Rostedt describing the Linux kernel 's tracing options , which he co-developed – the most recent of them was released in January and explains several advanced uses of the tracing infrastructure , but it also contains references to two earlier articles describing the basics .
Several kernel changes allow processes to be monitored simultaneously or improve Big Kernel Lock ( BKL ) diagnostics .
The analysed data can now be filtered via regular expressions ; the kernel developers have also extended the Perf command 's Perl script support ( for example 1 , 2 , 3 , documentation ) .
Its " bench " subcommand , which is new in 2.6.33 , offers several speed measuring functions ( for example 1 2 , 3 , 4 , documentation ) .
New are also Perf's " kmem " and " diff " subcommands as well as kernel module support improvements .
Linux on the Gamecube and Wii
The architecture code for Power and PowerPC CPUs now supports Nintendo's GameCube and Wii games consoles ( for example 1 , 2 ) ; further details can be found on the GC Linux project 's web page , and via the commit links at the end of this article .
ARM , MIPS and x86 systems now allow the kernel and initial ramdisk ( initrd ) to be compressed via LZO ; the commit comment states that , while LZO does n't compress as efficiently as Gzip , it can be decompressed considerably faster on ARM systems ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) .
The ARM developers have integrated a large number of further improvements for dozens of different systems with ARM CPUs or ARM cores ; one new addition , for example , supports the Dove ( 88AP510 ) SOC ( System - on - a - Chip ) made by Marvell .
Not only the code for ARM hardware , but also that for other architectures has been extended to support new processors and systems even die - hard Linux fans may not have heard about – the MIPS code , for instance , will from now on support Cisco 's MIPS 24 Kc - based " Powertv cable settop box " .
Also new is the code to support the Loongson 2 F .
The real - time developers made numerous changes to further reduce the use of the Big Kernel Lock ( BKL ) .
Currently inconsequential for users is a major renaming of the spinlocks used for locking critical internal kernel areas .
These locking mechanisms , which work with active waiting and must not be interrupted , are now called arch_spinlock_t .
The restructuring measures make the Linux real - time developers ' job a lot easier and forms the basis for moving the " sleeping spinlocks " from the Realtime / RT tree into the official Linux kernel .
They also make it possible to interrupt the majority of the spinlocks that have so far used active waiting to gain exclusive access to shared data structures in the fastest possible way – this is the last major component for proper real - time functionality still missing in the official Linux kernel .
Details about the renaming measures can be found in a short message on LWN.
net ; two older articles provide more information about sleeping spinlocks and the RT tree 's current state of development ( 1 , 2 ) .
ACPI , PCI and power management
In future , Sysfs files will show whether the BIOS is using ACPI to block the switch to maximum CPU frequency in certain device modes .
Furthermore , Rafael J. Wysocki had submitted several patches that in certain devices make the kernel suspend or resume in parallel instead of sequentially when switching into or out of standby .
This is intended to speed up suspending and resuming .
Linus Torvalds , however , rejected the changes rather unequivocally ; details about this and the patches can be found in an article on LWN .
net .
As a result , Wysocki has put the changes on hold and submitted several patches which , for instance , offer run-time improvements to the power saving infrastructure for I/O devices , which was reworked in 2.6.32 .
However , Wysocki has since readjusted the " asynchronous suspend and resume " code and is likely to resubmit it for 2.6.34 .
In brief
Minor gems
Many further minor , but by no means insignificant , changes can be found in the list below , which contains the commit headers referring to the respective change .
Like many of the references in the text above , the links point to the relevant commit in the web front end of the Git branch for the kernel sources maintained by Linus Torvalds at kernel.org .

Tom Gillaspy is Minnesota 's State Demographer .
MPR Photo / Toni Randolph
Minnesota is on the cusp of losing a congressional seat based on new state population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau .
Two analysts say it 's close , but it looks like the state is coming up short by about 1,100 people .
Next year , the Census Bureau will conduct its count of the nation 's population , an effort done every 10 years .
When the count is finished , the makeup of the U.S. House of Representatives will change to reflect the population change .
As it looks now , Minnesota is projected to lose one of its eight congressional seats , but it 's close .
" Right now I would say that basically Minnesota is in a dead heat with several other states for that final seat , " said State Demographer Tom Gillaspy .
Gillaspy crunched the recently released 2009 population figures and found that Minnesota would just miss out to Missouri on getting the 435th seat in Congress .

A gift of $ 17 makes a difference .
The difference between California , Texas , Missouri and Minnesota for the last three seats is about 2,200 people -- well within the margin of sampling error , he said .
Gillaspy said his number crunching is just a projection and emphasized the real count will start in mid-March when Americans start filling out their Census forms .
" It 's really going to come down to how well we get counted in Minnesota relative to how well other states get counted , " Gillaspy said .
The stakes in the count are huge .
Not only will Minnesota 's political clout diminish with the loss of a seat , the state also stands to lose billions in federal aid because funding formulas are based on population .
Minnesota 's problem is n't that it 's losing people -- the latest figures show that the population grew by 35,000 .
It 's that it 's not growing as quickly as other states , said Kimball Brace , who runs Election Data Services , a Washington D.C. - based firm that specializes in redistricting and census data .
" What you 're having is the population continuing that trend that we 've had since World War II of people moving from the Northeast and Upper Midwest heading South and heading West , " Brace said .
But both Brace and Gillaspy said the migration is n't as fast as it was in the middle part of the decade .
Both said the economic downturn and the collapse of the housing market created the slowest migration pattern since World War II .
In fact , the figures are so fluid that Brace , who did his own projections , said right now Minnesota would keep its seat based on the latest figures released by the Census Bureau .
" However , when you project that information forward an additional nine months to correspond with the 2010 Census in April , you now see that Minnesota would be losing a seat , " he said .
Both Brace and Gillaspy said Minnesota may have an advantage over some of the other states .
They said in past decades Minnesota consistently had high participation in Census counts .
They said that could boost Minnesota over other states that have under counted their population in the past .
Pope Benedict XVI has a message for priests of the Catholic Church :
They must proclaim the gospel by not only having a website , but by blogging and utilizing new web communication tools .
The 265th Pope of the Catholic Church has been an unexpectedly strong proponent of social media .
Last year , he launched a YouTube channel , and six months ago , he released Facebook and iPhone apps to spread the Church 's message .
It looks like that he hopes Catholic priests will follow his digital example .
In his message , the Pope acknowledges that priests face new challenges due to cultural shifts that have brought the conversation online .
Thus , priests must do more than just take the Word of the gospel to the web .
Here 's a small excerpt from the entire message from the Pope :
" The spread of multimedia communications and its rich ' menu of options ' might make us think it sufficient simply to be present on the Web , or to see it only as a space to be filled .
Yet priests can rightly be expected to be present in the world of digital communications as faithful witnesses to the Gospel , exercising their proper role as leaders of communities which increasingly express themselves with the different ' voices ' provided by the digital marketplace .
Priests are thus challenged to proclaim the Gospel by employing the latest generation of audiovisual resources ( images , videos , animated features , blogs , websites ) which , alongside traditional means , can open up broad new vistas for dialogue , evangelization and catechesis . "
We have to give the Pope high marks for his push to make the Church more effective in the digital realm .
While the Pope is not on Twitter , his Pope2 you initiative is definitely a step in the right direction .
He clearly knows that reaching young believers requires going to the places where they spend their time and converse .
More and more , that is social media .

What is CSS
CSS is a programming language that is used in web development .
It tells the browser how each HTML element on the website is supposed look .
It used to style the text , images and everything else on the website .
You can build a very nice looking and advanced website using nothing but CSS and HTML5 .
CSS is an abbreviation of Cascading Style Sheets .
Which websites use CSS
Almost all websites use CSS .
It is possible to build a website and define the look of each element directly in the HTML but CSS is a much more elegant way to do it .
CSS also gives you a lot better control and a lot more options than those you can use if you use nothing but HTML .
You might encounter very old websites that do not use CSS but 99.9 % of all new website does and you should always use CSS if you are building a new website .
Why you should use CSS
CSS gives you better control over the look and feel of the website then any other available option .
It allows you complete freedom to style the entire website exactly as you want it .
You can create general rules that applies to all elements on the website as well as unique rules that apply only to a single element .
It is a much more elegant and effective solution than styling directly in HTML .
If you style the elements directly in the HTML code then you will need to specify the styling for each element .
This will result in a larger file size than if you use CSS and general styling rules .
CSS makes it easy to build mobile friendly websites that style the website differently depending on the screen size of the device the website is being used on .
This allows you to build a website that looks equally good on a mobile device as it does on a desktop computer .
By not building a mobile friendly website you will lose out on a large potential customer group .
More then half of all web browsing is done through mobile devices .
CSS allows for better SEO
CSS allow you to create a more streamlined more elegant website without unnecessary code .
This helps you rank better in search engines such as Google since all search engines want your website to respond and render as quickly as possible .
This improves the user experience .
In a case study this trading website saw a 35 % increase in traffic after implementing a clean CSS based design .
Other websites i have helped have seen similar or even larger increases in visitor numbers after adapting CSS based designs .
One or several CSS filer ?
A common question is whether you should place all your code in a single CSS file or if you should divide your CSS code over several documents .
The answer to this questions depends on who you are asking .
A lot of developers would say that it is better to divide it into several documents to make it easier to find and edit code .
You place all code related to a certain function in a certain file .
If you ask a SEO ( Search engine optimizer ) then they would say that should combine everything into a single file .
You should minimize the number of resources that has to load before the website can render .
If you have several CSS files then you increase the number of files that the website needs to render .
If you ask me than I will tell you that you should prioritize the user experience above everything else .
This means that you should place all CSS code in one single document to minimize the time it takes for the website to load .
You should make it easy for the visitor .
Not for yourself or the developer .
If you need to spend a little more time to find the code you want to edit then that is a small price to pay if it improves the visitor experience .
There is one exception from this rule .
If you have code that is only needed on one or a low number of pages then you should place the CSS rules for these elements in a separate CSS file that is only loaded on the pages where they are needed .
There is no reason that all visitors should be forced to download the code that is only needed on one page .
This is especially true if the CSS rules needed for this one page add a considerable amount of code to the CSS file .
( more then a couple of kbs ) .
Keep all rules that are need on all or near all pages in a single universal CSS file .
Should you inline CSS or put it in a separate document .
The answer to this question depends on how many pages on your website you think your visitors will visit .
If you think that your visitors will visit only one page or if you think they will come directly to your money page where you hope they will perform a certain action then you should inline the CSS .
In - lining the CSS will allow for that page to load and render faster .
This will improve user experience and maximize the chance that the visitor will perform the desired action .
If you have a website where you think the visitor will spend a lot of time browsing different articles then you should not inline the CSS .
If you think that the visitor will visit several pages then you will reduce the experience by in - lining the CSS .
This is due to the fact that if you visit only one page than it increase speed to inline the CSS .
This is not the case for subsequent pages .
If you chose to have the CSS in a separate file then the browser will have that file cached once it loaded the first page .
It does not need to request it nor download it for subsequent pages on your website .
This allows subsequent pages to load quicker if the CSS is in a separate file .
The Behemoth has been hard at work on the freshly announced BattleBlock Theater , but they ’re also working diligently on the PSN release of their hand - drawn hack - and - slash hit Castle Crashers .
This would include a new Volleyball minigame complete with all the online trimmings .
Unfortunately , the news comes with word that while the game is in full PS3 development , no release date–or month for that matter– has been nailed down , though its still due out this year .

European Central Bank Chief Economist ' Everyone Is a Sinner at the Moment '
In a SPIEGEL interview , European Central Bank Chief Economist Jürgen Stark discusses the threat of a Greek bankruptcy , disruption in the euro zone and the growing problem of excessive national debts in countries that have adopted Europe 's common currency .
According to findings that could have been pulled from a deep - sea sequel to Avatar , bacteria appear to conduct electrical currents across the ocean floor , driving linked chemical reactions at relatively vast distances .
Noticed only when reseachers happened to test sediment leftovers from another experiment , the phenomenon may add a new mechanism to Earth 's biogeochemistry .
" The cycling of elements and life at the bottom of the sea , and in soil , and anywhere else you 're short of oxygen — this could help us understand those processes , " said microbiologist Lars Peter Nielsen of Denmark 's Aarhus University , co-author of the study , published Feb. 24 in Nature .
The original focus of Nielsen 's team was n't seafloor conductivity , but an especially interesting species of sulfur bacteria found on the floor of Aarhus Bay .
To help quantify their chemical activity , the researchers kept a few beakers of seawater and sulfur bacteria - free sediment for comparison .
After those experiments ended , the beakers were almost forgotten .
Then , a few weeks later , the researchers noticed strange patterns of activity .
Changing oxygen levels in water above the top sediment layer were almost immediately followed by chemical fluctuations several layers down .
The distance was so great , and the response time so quick , that usual methods of chemical transport — molecular diffusion , or a slow drift from high to low concentration — could n't explain it .
At first , the researchers were stumped .
Then they realized the process made sense if bacteria in the top and bottom layers were linked .
Anything that affected oxygen - processing bacteria up top would also affect the sulfide - eating microbes below .
It would explain the apparent connection ; and an electrical linkage would explain the speed .
It would also boggle the mind .
" Such hypotheses would at one time have been considered heretical , " wrote Kenneth Nealson , a University of Southern California microbiologist , in an accompanying commentary in Nature .
A half - inch gap " does n't seem like much of a distance .
But to a bacterium it amounts to 10,000 body lengths , equivalent to about 20 kilometers ( 12 miles ) in human terms . "
In recent years , however , scientists have found species of microbes with outer membranes covered by electron - transporting enzymes , or studded with conductive , micrometer - scale filaments .
These are used in driving experimental microbial fuel cells , and are known to be found in the Aarhus Bay mud .
Those sediments also contain trace amounts of pyrite , an electrically conductive mineral .
The top sediment layer also had a low concentration of hydrogen ions , something that could only be explained through an electrochemical reaction , with electrons conducted from a distance , said Nielsen .
Nealson called the findings " astonishing , " and said they " may be relevant to energy transfer and electron flow through many different environments . "
They could eventually applied to bacteria - based schemes for bioremediation , carbon sequestration and energy production .
Asked if he'd seen the blockbuster movie Avatar , with its storyline involving electrochemically linked forests that stored the inhabitants ' souls in a planet - spanning biological computer , Nielsen said , " One of my colleagues saw this , and immediately sent me a message : ' You 've discovered the secret of Avatar !
Go see it !'
The similarities are quite striking . "
He continued , " I do n't think there is much spirit in the networks we 've seen here .
It might be only about energy .
But there are connections . "

McDonnell privately proposes children 's insurance , education cuts
Gov. Bob McDonnell 's finance secretary is expanding his meetings with lawmakers and aides about McDonnell 's proposals for cutting the state budget .
We understand the suggestions are very specific -- about the only people McDonnell has n't shared his ideas with yet are the public .
And because the meetings continue to take place behind closed doors , McDonnell 's ideas are emerging only in drips and drabs .
We already mentioned , for instance , that more than 40 percent of the $ 1.7 billion in cuts he is recommending would come from K - 12 education , largely by moving away from the state 's Standards of Quality mandates .
Those items outline what is considered a basic education in Virginia and funding them has traditionally been shared by the state and local school systems .
Eliminating SOQs would give local school districts more flexibility in how to spend dollars but it would also them a choice : shoulder the full cost with local tax dollars or eliminate spending altogether on items that have for years been considered part of a no- frills , basic education .
Meanwhile , we 're also starting to hear some of McDonnell 's proposals in other areas as well .
For instance , Gov. Tim Kaine ( D ) had recommended a 5 percent cut to local Community Service Boards , which offer substance abuse and mental health programs .
McDonnell says they should receive a 10 percent cut , meaning an additional $ 48 million cut over two years .
He has also recommended cutting $ 30 million over two years from the state 's FAMIS health program , which provides insurance to low - income children and pregnant mothers .
That change would come from freezing enrollment in FAMIS , which is available to children whose families make between $ 30,000 and $ 44,000 .
( Those with even lower family income qualify for medicaid . )
The change would mean poor children would not be able to get health insurance , and the number enrolled in the program would drop from 100,000 .
Virginia also gets significant federal funding for FAMIS in a 2 - to - 1 match for state spending .
That means that cutting $ 30 million from the program would result in Virginia losing $ 60 million over two years in federal money and the program losing $ 90 million in all .
Since each area of the budget has its advocates , you can start to understand why McDonnell would not be anxious to be publicly associated with the controversial proposals .
For example , here 's Jill Hankin , a staff attorney with the Poverty Law Center , on the impact of the possible FAMIS cut : " A freeze means we 're closing the door on uninsured kids who need who need health care ...
For the state to turn its back on low - income pregnant mothers and kids is horrifying . "
Key questions relevant to fundamental physics and cosmology , namely the nature of the mysterious dark energy and dark matter ( Euclid ) ; the frequency of exoplanets around other stars , including Earth - analogs ( PLATO ) ; take the closest look at our Sun yet possible , approaching to just 62 solar radii ( Solar Orbiter ) … but only two !
What would be your picks ?
These three mission concepts have been chosen by the European Space Agency ’s Science Programme Committee ( SPC ) as candidates for two medium - class missions to be launched no earlier than 2017 .
They now enter the definition phase , the next step required before the final decision is taken as to which missions are implemented .
These three missions are the finalists from 52 proposals that were either made or carried forward in 2007 .
They were whittled down to just six mission proposals in 2008 and sent for industrial assessment .
Now that the reports from those studies are in , the missions have been pared down again .
“ It was a very difficult selection process .
All the missions contained very strong science cases , ” says Lennart Nordh , Swedish National Space Board and chair of the SPC .
And the tough decisions are not yet over .
Only two missions out of three of them : Euclid , PLATO and Solar Orbiter , can be selected for the M - class launch slots .
All three missions present challenges that will have to be resolved at the definition phase .
A specific challenge , of which the SPC was conscious , is the ability of these missions to fit within the available budget .
The final decision about which missions to implement will be taken after the definition activities are completed , which is foreseen to be in mid-2011 .

Euclid is an ESA mission to map the geometry of the dark Universe .
The mission would investigate the distance - redshift relationship and the evolution of cosmic structures .
It would achieve this by measuring shapes and redshifts of galaxies and clusters of galaxies out to redshifts ~ 2 , or equivalently to a look - back time of 10 billion years .
It would therefore cover the entire period over which dark energy played a significant role in accelerating the expansion .
By approaching as close as 62 solar radii , Solar Orbiter would view the solar atmosphere with high spatial resolution and combine this with measurements made in - situ .
Over the extended mission periods Solar Orbiter would deliver images and data that would cover the polar regions and the side of the Sun not visible from Earth .
Solar Orbiter would coordinate its scientific mission with NASA ’s Solar Probe Plus within the joint HELEX program ( Heliophysics Explorers ) to maximize their combined science return .
PLATO ( PLAnetary Transit and Oscillations of stars ) would discover and characterize a large number of close - by exoplanetary systems , with a precision in the determination of mass and radius of 1 % .
In addition , the SPC has decided to consider at its next meeting in June , whether to also select a European contribution to the SPICA mission .
SPICA would be an infrared space telescope led by the Japanese Space Agency JAXA .
It would provide ‘ missing - link ’ infrared coverage in the region of the spectrum between that seen by the ESA - NASA Webb telescope and the ground - based ALMA telescope .
SPICA would focus on the conditions for planet formation and distant young galaxies .
“ These missions continue the European commitment to world - class space science , ” says David Southwood , ESA Director of Science and Robotic Exploration , “ They demonstrate that ESA ’s Cosmic Vision programme is still clearly focused on addressing the most important space science . ”

OTTAWA — The Prime Minister ’s Office has warned senior political staff across government not to interfere in the handling of access to information requests .
The warning comes as opposition MPs are calling for an independent investigation into “ all instances of Conservative interference ” to foil the release of information .
Guy Giorno , Stephen Harper ’s chief of staff , penned a memo on Tuesday to chiefs of staff in federal departments reminding them to “ respect ” the access to information process , a senior official said .
And they were pointedly warned that it ’s an offence to deliberately obstruct access requests .
Giorno fired off the memo after the revelation that an aide to federal cabinet minister Christian Paradis blocked the release of a sensitive report requested under freedom - of - information even though it had been approved by public servants .
“ Well unrelease it , ” Sebastien Togneri , Paradis ’ parliamentary affairs director , said in an e-mail obtained by Canadian Press to a senior official in the department ’s Access to Information section .
The document was an annual report on Public Works ’ huge real - estate portfolio , containing information on high vacancy rates and weak returns on investment .
Such reports had never been made public before .
On Tuesday , Harper ’s office sought to distance itself from suggestions of a cover - up , saying political staff should have no involvement in access requests .
“ Obviously , around Access to Information , due diligence is and should be done by public servants and not political staff , ” Harper spokesperson Dimitri Soudas said .
According to a senior government official , Giorno ’s memo warned that the access to information process “ should be followed and respected by all .
“ It applies to everybody across government , including political staff , ” the official said .
And he said that subject to access to information rules , residents have a right “ to be given access to any record under the control of a government institution . ”
“ Access to information is the public ’s right , ” the official said .
NDP Leader Jack Layton said it is “ entirely appropriate ” that interim Information Commissioner Suzanne Legault has given priority to probe a complaint about the handling of the access to request in Paradis ’ office .
“ We hope that it ’s a speedy investigation so we can get to the bottom of this as soon as possible , ” Layton said .
Liberal MP Siobhan Coady has asked Legault to widen her investigation to “ all instances of Conservative interference and order the public release of all politically censored documents . ”
The tough words from the Prime Minister ’s office are cold comfort to critics who have long complained that the access to information process has worsened since Harper took power in 2006 .
They say high fees and long delays are choking the system , cutting off the flow of information .
“ There has been a pattern of delay and obstruction with this government that should worry Canadians with regard to Access to information , ” Layton said .
To back his claim , he cited a memo released to the Military Police Complaints Commission by the Justice Department in May with only a small portion blacked out while the other identical memo received last month by the NDP from National Defence was totally erased .
Layton said it is ironic that it was the Conservative Party that campaigned on a promise to make it easier to peek inside government , “ but they have mostly abandoned the ideas that they were advancing at that time . ”
30,000 tonnes of portable batteries enter the UK market each year New EU rules have come into force that require some stores selling batteries to provide in - store recycling bins .
Anyone selling more than 32kg a year - equivalent to one pack of four AA batteries a day - must comply as part of targets on cutting landfill .
The UK currently recycles only 3 % of portable batteries , but the aim is to raise that figure to 45 % by 2016 .
Battery maker Varta warned that a lack of awareness among consumers could hamper the scheme 's success .
An estimated 30,000 tonnes of batteries - from those in electrical goods like torches , to rechargeable ones in mobile phones - enter the UK market each year .
At present , 97 % eventually end up in landfill sites , where they can leak toxic chemicals into the soil .
The EU Batteries Directive aims to tackle that problem and cut carbon emissions by reducing the need for new batteries to be made from scratch .
' Great concern '
Retailers will be required to provide a recycling point in - store which will be regularly emptied free of charge under the government 's Battery Compliance Scheme .
The hope is that this will see battery recycling levels rise to 10 % by the end of this year and to 25 % by 2012 .
All the evidence shows home collections of recyclables produce the best results
Bob Gordon
British Retail Consortium Environment Secretary Hilary Benn said : " This new legislation will make it easier for consumers to do the right thing whilst ensuring retailers fulfil their part of the bargain . "
But Vince Armitage , divisional vice - president of Varta , said he was concerned .
" The directive places the responsibility of meeting its stringent collection and recycling targets on the manufacturer , but it relies on the co-operation of consumers and retailers to make it work , " he said .
" However , a lack of promotion means that awareness of the directive among these key groups is low .
" This gives us great concern that , as a nation , we are setting ourselves up to fail before we even begin . "
Varta estimates that just meeting the 10 % target will cost manufacturers £ 3 m .
Bob Gordon , from the British Retail Consortium , said retailers were ready for the new requirements , but called for a " comprehensive and continuing " government information campaign to raise awareness among consumers .
He also said shops should not be the only route for collection , adding : " We need an infrastructure to develop which includes workplaces , schools , community centres and kerbside collection .
" All the evidence shows home collections of recyclables are easiest for customers and produce the best results .
Developing these must n't be ignored . "

Rachel Maddow really drew blood last night with her attack on Congressional hypocrite Bart Stupak for sabotaging healthcare reform .
She reminds us exactly how Stupak lied about living at the C Street house belonging to The Family ( registered as a church for tax purposes ) , the right - wing fundamentalist Christian cult that encourages politicians to lie their way into office so they can help form a God-centered government .
She pointed out that he paid only $ 600 a month for a luxury room with meals in The Family 's mansion for many years , calls it what it is ( a " donation in kind " ) and want to know if he paid taxes on it or declared it .
She called on him to disclose whether he reported it and asked just who subsidized him .
I await the IRS investigation .
Oscar nominee Anne Hathaway tells GQ magazine she and her parents have left the Catholic Church because of the religion 's views on gay issues .
Hathaway , whose brother is gay , says she and her parents became Episcopalians shortly after he came out .
" The whole family converted to Episcopalianism after my elder brother came out , ” she said .
“ Why should I support an organization that has a limited view of my beloved brother ? "
Hathaway , who has been a vocal champion of gay rights since starring in Brokeback Mountain , says she is n’t quite at home with the Episcopal Church either : " So I 'm ... nothing [ no denomination ] .
F**k it , I 'm forming .
I 'm a work in progress . ”

With Disney taking a break from making Star Wars movies , there ’s more room than ever to explore new ideas .
There ’s a wealth of science fiction out there , just waiting for some movie studio to pick it up and do something with it .
No more waiting .
Drop that Back to the Future remake Hollywood and do something with these already brilliant sci-fi properties instead .
The Expanse : The Movie
Recently saved by Amazon and given a fourth season , The Expanse is by the recollection of most serious fans , the best science fiction currently on television .
It ’s based on a series of critically acclaimed books , books which the series is still in the early stages of scratching the surface of .
The stories keep getting bigger as it goes on , and The Expanse is from jump a dense narrative examining complicated human politics and dynamics in a far off future where man has begun traveling to the stars .
Despite its futuristic setting the show and the books are propelled by how realistic it is .
The Expanse gets all the little details about both science and human nature right .
When you delve into this world it feels exactly like what humanity colonizing outer space would really be like .
The Pitch : As impressive as The Expanse has been as a TV series , I ’d love to see what it might look like on the big screen .
Each book in the series , while continuing a linear narrative with the same group of characters , also has the ability to stand on its own .
The best move for The Expanse is for them to simply take one of the books the show has n’t gotten to yet , and film it as a feature .
Fans of the show would be more connected to it because of their history with the franchise , but newcomers would still be able to jump in for the movie if its done right .
Stargate : Lost In Space
Stargate started out as a movie , way back in 1994 .
But it was after that movie was over when Stargate became a franchise , thanks to the television series which took the movie ’s premise and ran in a completely different direction with it .
The fans of that franchise deserve a feature film set in that universe .
It should n’t use the same actors , they ’ve grown to old for that .
I do n’t think we need a reboot either .
I ’d position this movie as a sequel to the 1994 film , but skew the style and script of the sequel to fit more in line with the television series .
Better still , the sequel could easily follow a course similar to the one charted by Stargate Universe , before it was cancelled after only two seasons .
The Pitch : Decades after the discovery of a stargate which allows humans instantaneous travel to other planets , a breakthrough happens .
While exploring the universe via the gates a group of humans stumble on an ancient alien starship traveling the galaxy .
When they board the ship , our heroes are stranded there and must use the alien vessel to try and find their way home .
Lost in a hostile galaxy full of strange dangers and incredible creatures they discover the key not only to existence , but themselves .
Orville : The Motion Picture
As the show has progressed , Seth MacFarlane ’s Star Trek homage has become increasingly cinematic .
The Orville ’s focus on delivering a cinema quality product for television has become so intent that the third season will end up taking nearly two years to complete , by the time it ’s finally released exclusively on Hulu some time in 2021 .
If they ’re going to all this trouble to make The Orville look and feel like a movie , they might as well actually make one and release it in theaters .
The Pitch :
The ideal path here is to simply deliver a normal Orville adventure on a movie scale .
They ’ve already had a massive battle on the show , so I would n’t necessarily go that route .
The Orville Movie should be about creating bigger stakes for the characters , not necessarily about bigger special effects or bigger galactic consequences .
If they ’re smart , they ’ll pattern The Orville movie after Star Trek : The Motion Picture , with some sort of existential threat which questions the very nature of their existence and demands a difficult sacrifice .
But since it ’s
The Orville , they ’ll be able to take that concept and make it less boring , with weird humorous quips and snappy crew banter .
The Futurama Movie
Turning in a movie worked for The Simpsons and they ran out of jokes fifteen years ago .
Futurama on the other hand , thanks to frequent network cancelling , still feels young .
Matt Groening ’s other animated masterpiece has never gotten a fair shake , but with its spacey setting and tendency towards blaster fire , it ’s far more suited to the big screen than Springfield ’s favorite family .
It ’s animation , yes , but animation for adults .
Feel free to take things up a notch for the theatrical version , hook Bender up with a three - nippled robot hooker , and slap it with an “ R ” rating .
Or if you ’re really feeling spendy , ditch the animation and give us a live action version .
The Pitch : A pizza delivery boy is accidentally frozen for a thousand years , and wakes up in the future .
There he finds employment at the interplanetary delivery company , Planet Express , and struggles to fit in with the company ’s strange assortment of employees .
His best friend is an alcoholic robot , he ’s in love with a smoking hot kung - fu Cyclops who finds him repulsive , and he ’s employed by a mad scientist with an increasingly bad case of dementia .
Hilarity ensues .
Think Hitchhiker ’s Guide to the Galaxy meets Encino Man .
Quantum Leap : The Movie
We ’re running out of time on Quantum Leap .
Scott Bakula is n’t getting any younger .
In fact we ’re probably out of time and if there ’s any hope that the early 90s most brilliant sci - fi show will ever get its cinematic due , it ’ll have to start all over with a new Sam Beckett .
Much as I love Bakula , I can live with that .
Quantum Leap ’s resonate style of character - driven storytelling is still as relevant as it ever was .
Maybe even more so .
Imagine Sam leaping into 9/11 .
Oh boy .
The Pitch : A botched experiment sends Sam Becket leaping through time .
But Sam can explain it better than I can .
“ It all started when a time travel experiment I was conducting went … “ a little caca ” .
In the blink of a cosmic clock , I went from quantum physicist to Air Force test - pilot .
Which could have been fun… if I knew how to fly .
Fortunately , I had help – an observer from the project named Al .
Unfortunately ,
Al ’s a hologram , so all he can lend is moral support .
Anyway , here I am , bouncing around in time , putting things right that once went wrong , a sort of time traveling Lone Ranger , with Al as my Tonto .
And I do n’t even need a mask …
Oh Boy ”
The Mote In God ’s Eye
It ’s one of the greatest science fiction books ever written , and perhaps also one of the most overlooked .
Written in through a collaboration between Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle , and first published in 1974 , this two book duology charts the first contact between humanity and an alien race .
I know what you ’re thinking , we ’ve seen this before .
No you have n’t , not like this .
Sure , much like Alien this first contact does n’t take place until far off in man ’s future , when we ’ve already explored most of space .
But any similarities end there .
What really sets this apart is the complex , utterly realistic , detailed way in which Niven and Pournelle develop the alien race , known as the Moties , which humanity encounters out there in that far off place .
The Pitch : Popular science fiction usually ends up portraying aliens either as monsters or as something nearly human .
Rarely is there a middle ground .
Avatar ’s Na’vi for instance , are barely alien at all .
They ’re more like some blue African tribe .
Mote presents an intelligent alien species that is truly alien , not just in appearance but in the way they think , and then uses them as part of a gripping tale which asks this simple question :
How can we possibly trust something so alien , let alone understand it ?
Maybe they lack the sex appeal of blue cat people ( you ’re unlikely to be aroused by a Mote ’s gripping hand ) , but the story ’s brilliantly written characters and massive , epic scope could turn the science fiction genre on its head if it ever made it up on screen .
Babylon 5 : The Movie
With all due respect to Star Trek , Babylon 5 ( at least for the first four seasons ) , may have been the greatest science fiction series in the history of television .
At the least , it was one of the most revolutionary .
It was the first television show , for instance , to use computer generated effects on whole sequences .
The show ’s plot plays out as a single complicated , linear story arc of the type now used by Lost and every other show currently on television but unheard of back in the early 90s .
It told a complete story wrapped in a single series .
Most importantly though it ’s character - driven , epic , and utterly compelling .
Many of the show ’s cast members have sadly passed away .
So if you do this Hollywood , it ’ll need to be a total reboot .
The Pitch :
The show began every week with a monologue which , much better than I ever could , tells you all you need to know .
Here ’s how Babylon 5 described itself in Season 2 : “ The Babylon Project was our last , best hope for peace .
A self - contained world five miles long , located in neutral territory .
A place of commerce and diplomacy for a quarter of a million humans and aliens .
A shining beacon in space . . . all alone in the night .
It was the dawn of the Third Age of Mankind – the year the Great War came upon us all .
This is the story of the last of the Babylon stations .
The year is 2259 .
The name of the place is Babylon 5 .
The Hyperion Cantos
There have actually been rumors that Dan Simmons masterful far - future series of novels ( collectively referred to as the Hyperion Cantos ) may be turned into a movie , but it has n’t happened yet , and we ’re tired of waiting .
The material is challenging and heady , but also utterly unique .
It starts out as a group of pilgrims journey to a far off planet called Hyperion , where they ’ll visit the legendary Time Tombs .
The tombs are guarded by the Shrike , an unstoppable , unknowable , spikey , metallic creature which snatches up travelers and impales them on its tree of thorns .
The Pitch : Hyperion tells the story of the pilgrims as they travel , and as the story spans multiple books it goes beyond them .
It works brilliantly because it ’s character - driven , scratch that it ’s more than character - driven , it ’s emotion driven .
Simmons puts his characters through hell and takes us with them through every step of suffering , sadness , and pain which gradually comes together to form a larger picture .
Hyperion is a story with something to say about the human condition , and it does it in an epic , potentially visually stunning , package .
It ’s science fiction ’s Lord of the Rings , and done right , it ’ll win just as many Oscars .
Battlestar Galactica : The Movie
The have been frequent talks about Battlestar Galactica getting the movie treatment .
One problem :
Most of those talks have been about making a movie out of the wrong version .
When the fantastic , award - winning , Ronald Moore reboot of the classic franchise went off the air , Hollywood immediately cast it aside and rehired the creator of the less successful 80s version to start the whole thing all over again .
If this less good goes into production , when you see BSG up on the screen in a few years , Starbuck will be a dude , Cylons wo n’t be sexy , and the plot will be full of all the silly 80s sensibilities Moore worked so hard to get rid of in his modernized version .
The Pitch :
The right version of Battlestar Galactica is about a small group of survivors fleeing the destruction of their home worlds by an army of robotic entities of their own creation .
Their tiny , rag - tag fleet is led by the only surviving fighter carrier , an aging battlestar known as Galactica .
While struggling to survive Moore ’s character driven show also tackles issues of spirituality , morality , and friendship as different personalities are pushed to the limit of human endurance , trapped together in space and on the run .
Farscape : The Movie
Farscape was critically acclaimed from day one , but it ’s so linear and so deeply character driven that missing even a single episode meant finding yourself adrift without a paddle .
A movie presents an opportunity to solve that .
Instead of one story stretched out over several seasons , we have the chance to get a complete story in a single , epic film .
And if you thought Farscape ’s visuals were impressive on a basic cable television budget , just imagine what the geniuses at the Jim Henson workshop could do with a $ 30 million budget .
It seems impossible to do it without the original cast .
Get it done before Ben Browder gets any frelling older .
The Pitch :
It ’s the story of modern day astronaut John Crichton , flung through a wormhole into a distant galaxy .
There , he ’s stuck on a living ship with a group of escaped prisoners who though at first his enemies , become his allies , and eventually his friends .
It ’s the classic tale of a stranger in a strange land mixed with piracy and full of deeply rooted , character drama .
It ’s romantic too , full of realistic relationships against a fantastic backdrop .
Michael Phelps has this week become the top Olympian of all time .
But at what cost ?
It has been revealed that he has a daily intake of 12,000 calories .
So in the name of science , Jon Henley attempted to consume his high - fat diet
I was n’t supposed to be able to tell you about this until Monday , but it looks like the news leaked early so IMFT gave us the green light .
Intel and Micron jointly formed IMFT ( Intel - Micron Flash Technologies ) , LLC back in 2006 .
The two companies share production from the venture .
Intel gets 49 % of IMFT ’s flash production and Micron gets 51 % .
In the usual Intel tradition , IMFT aggressively scales process technology to be competitive .
The company started manufacturing at 72nm , spent 2008 at 50nm and just last year scaled down to 34nm .
The latter is what found its way into Intel ’s X25 - M G2 as well as Micron ’s soon - to - be released RealSSD C300 .
Today IMFT is announcing that it has begun sampling 2 - bits - per- cell MLC NAND flash manufactured using 25nm transistors .
The company believed it had a 6 month head start over the competition in 34nm , and now believes that with 25nm NAND it ’s roughly a year ahead of anyone else .
Volume production will happen sometime in Q2 , with products shipping before the end of the year .
In my last SSD article I mentioned that Intel ’s 3rd generation X25 - M would be shipping in Q4 at 160 GB , 320GB and 600GB .
These drives will use IMFT ’s new 25 nm flash .
The first 25nm product is an 8 GB ( 64 Gbit ) 2 - bits - per - cell MLC NAND flash .
A single 8 GB die built on IMFT ’s 25nm process has a die size of 167mm2 .
Immersion lithography is apparently necessary to produce these 25nm NAND devices , but the extent is unclear .
This is technically Intel ’s first device that requires immersion lithography to manufacture .
25nm IMFT 2 - bit MLC NAND Flash , 8GB , 167mm2
The 34nm flagship was a 4GB ( 32 Gbit ) 2 - bits - per - cell MLC NAND device with a die size of 172mm2 .
At 25 nm you basically get twice the capacity at the same die size , which should translate into twice the SSD capacity at the same price as a 34nm drive today .
34nm IMFT2 - bit MLC NAND Flash , 4GB , 172mm2
Obviously supply and demand economics play their roles here .
We may not see the sort of aggressive pricing we want to on 25nm X25 - M drives if demand remains as high as it has been for the 34nm G2s .
Last year IMFT announced plans to deliver a 3 - bit - per- cell 34nm MLC NAND flash .
Today 's announcement pretty much negates the need to bring those devices to market .
Although at some point we 'll probably see 3 - bit - per- cell at 25nm .
At this point 3 - bit - per - cell MLC flash is only suitable for cheaper or low cycle devices like USB sticks .
In a SSD the performance and reliability tradeoffs just are n't worth it .
34nm IMFT 3 - bit MLC NAND Flash , 4GB , 126mm2
The 25nm IMFT NAND devices support ONFi 2.2 , meaning the interface speed can reach a maximum of 200MB/s .
The other major change to the 25nm NAND is an increase in the page size .
At 50nm and 34nm , IMFT ’s page size was 4KB .
At 25nm on the 8GB device the page size is now 8KB .
Block size has also gone up from 128 pages to 256 pages .
This will obviously have performance implications and require some firmware reorganization , but given that Intel has known this was coming for some time now I would expect that its 3rd generation drives will be optimized for 25nm .
IMFT believes there ’s still hope for scaling flash devices even further .
It 's ridiculous to think about how small these transistors are getting .
As we approach single - digit - nm dimensions we can start counting atoms when we look at these transistors :
Right now IMFT is on a 12 - 15 month cycle , so we can expect the next process shrink to begin sampling in mid-2011 , shipping in 2012 .
If IMFT can ramp up production of 25nm NAND flash , 2012 may be the year of the first truly affordable mainstream SSDs .
So the Bunning blockade is over .
For days , Senator Jim Bunning of Kentucky exploited Senate rules to block a one - month extension of unemployment benefits .
In the end , he gave in , although not soon enough to prevent an interruption of payments to around 100,000 workers .
But while the blockade is over , its lessons remain .
Some of those lessons involve the spectacular dysfunctionality of the Senate .
What I want to focus on right now , however , is the incredible gap that has opened up between the parties .
Today , Democrats and Republicans live in different universes , both intellectually and morally .
Take the question of helping the unemployed in the middle of a deep slump .
What Democrats believe is what textbook economics says : that when the economy is deeply depressed , extending unemployment benefits not only helps those in need , it also reduces unemployment .
That ’s because the economy ’s problem right now is lack of sufficient demand , and cash - strapped unemployed workers are likely to spend their benefits .
In fact , the Congressional Budget Office says that aid to the unemployed is one of the most effective forms of economic stimulus , as measured by jobs created per dollar of outlay .
But that ’s not how Republicans see it .
Here ’s what Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona , the second - ranking Republican in the Senate , had to say when defending Mr. Bunning ’s position ( although not joining his blockade ) : unemployment relief “ does n’t create new jobs .
In fact , if anything , continuing to pay people unemployment compensation is a disincentive for them to seek new work . ”

The Rapa Nui usually carved the heads out of huge boulders in quarries , but apparently they did n't just want a quarry full of stone heads .
They wanted stone heads that stared imposingly over their rose gardens .
After beating their protesting common sense into submission , they decided that apparently the only reliable way to move something that weighed over a hundred tons was to cut down trees and roll the cumbersome things along atop the felled logs .
With each new statue completed , down came another chunk of forest until -- after almost 1000 statues were made -- there was literally no tree left alive .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
When the forest was gone , the soil eroded and a devastating game of dominoes took over that eventually reduced the Rapa Nui to cannibalism , and inevitable eradication .
Think about that .
At some point , a guy actually looked upon the last tree in existence , and made the conscious decision to cut that bastard down .
What was he thinking ?
That surely there were more trees elsewhere on the island ?
That they would all grow back ?
Actually , it just looked silly standing there by itself .

But of course , we know what he was thinking ; we still see it today .
" Environment ?
Sure , I care about the environment .
I 'll be happy to discuss that with you after I cut down this here tree . "
The big picture is just an abstract idea ; you need the tree now .
It 's so hard for humans to connect the two .
And so the islanders ' mortal obsession with long faces , big chins , and little hats made of rock is now forever on display ... so that dudes in loud shirts can take pictures of themselves wackily humping the grim stone mouths of heads more famous than the entire society they murdered .

VIENNA / WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.N. nuclear watchdog said on Thursday it feared Iran may be working now to develop a nuclear - armed missile , as Washington warned Tehran of “ consequences ” for ignoring international demands to stop its atomic program .

In unusually blunt language , an International Atomic Energy Agency report for the first time suggested Iran was actively pursuing nuclear weapons capability , throwing independent weight behind similar Western suspicions .
The IAEA seemed to be cautiously going public with concerns arising from a classified agency analysis leaked in part last year which concluded that Iran has already honed explosives expertise relevant to a workable nuclear weapon .
The report also confirmed Iran had produced its first small batch of uranium enriched to a higher purity and had set aside the vast bulk of its low - enriched uranium stockpile for this purpose even though this seemed far in excess of possible civilian needs .
The developments will intensify pressure on Iran to prove it is not covertly bent on “ weaponizing ” enrichment by allowing unfettered access for IAEA inspectors and investigators , something it rejects in protest at U.N. sanctions .
The United States is already leading a push for the U.N. Security Council to impose a fourth round of sanctions on Iran because of suspicions it may be developing nuclear weapons and has received declarations of support from Russia , which has until now been reluctant to expand sanctions .
“ We always said that if Iran failed to live up to those international obligations , that there would be consequences , ” White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters aboard Air Force One as President Barack Obama flew to a political event .
Senior Obama administration officials , briefing reporters on the IAEA report , said they were struck by the number of significant technical problems Iran appeared to be encountering and the apparently slow growth of its uranium stockpile .
One of the officials , noting Iran had “ increased the level of non-cooperation , ” said it may take Tehran longer to build a nuclear weapon because of the technical problems “ but the pattern of behavior is one that I think is very disturbing . ”
Tehran says its nuclear program is meant only to yield electricity or radio- isotopes for agriculture or medicine .
It took an opposing view of the report ’s conclusions .
“ The IAEA ’s new report confirmed Iran ’s peaceful nuclear activities and the country ’s non-deviation toward military purposes , ” Iran ’s envoy to the IAEA , Ali Asghar Soltanieh , told the state news agency IRNA .
INTELLIGENCE REPORTS
For several years , the IAEA has been investigating Western intelligence reports indicating Iran has coordinated efforts to process uranium , test explosives at high altitude and revamp a ballistic missile cone in a way suitable for a nuclear warhead .
In 2007 , the United States issued an assessment saying Iran had halted such research in 2003 and probably not resumed it .
But its key Western allies believe Iran continued the program -- and the IAEA report offered independent support for that perception for the first time .
“ The information available to the agency is extensive ... broadly consistent and credible in terms of the technical detail , the time frame in which the activities were conducted and the people and organizations involved , ” the report said .
“ Altogether this raises concerns about the possible existence in Iran of past or current undisclosed activities related to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile . ”
IAEA ’s new chief , Yukiya Amano , is seen as more inclined to confront Iran than his predecessor , Mohamed ElBaradei , who retired on December 1 .
“ Now we see from ( available intelligence ) that certain activities may have continued after 2004 , ” said a senior official close to the IAEA .
“ We want to find out from Iran what they ’ve had to do with these nuclear explosive - related activities . ”
The U.S. director of National Intelligence concluded last year that Iran would not be technically able to devise a nuclear weapon before 2013 .
But a new intelligence estimate is due soon .
Iran has dismissed the intelligence reports as fabrication but failed to provide its own evidence .
Tehran has boycotted contact with the IAEA on the matter for 18 months .
The report , to be considered at a March 1 - 5 meeting of the IAEA ’s 35 - nation board , said it was vital for Iran to cooperate with IAEA investigators “ without further delay . ”
HIGHER ENRICHMENT
Last week , Iran announced a start to higher - scale enrichment , saying it was frustrated at the collapse of an IAEA - backed plan for big powers to provide it with fuel rods for nuclear medicine made from uranium refined to 20 percent purity .
The IAEA report complained that Iran had begun feeding low - enriched uranium ( LEU ) into centrifuges for higher refinement before inspectors could get to the scene in the Natanz pilot enrichment facility .
“ We have expressed our dissatisfaction , ” said the senior official close to the IAEA .
“ It is of paramount importance to have this information in a timely way to make sure there are no undeclared activities or facilities in Iran . ”
The big powers accused Iran of reneging on an agreement to ship out two - thirds of its LEU reserve to be turned into fuel rods for the medical reactor .
This would have prevented Iran retaining enough of the material to fuel a nuclear weapon , if it were refined to about 90 percent purity .
Only France , one party to the U.N. draft deal , and Argentina are known to possess the technology .
So analysts ask why Iran would enrich uranium well above its needs , except to lay the groundwork for producing bomb - grade uranium .
The report also said Iran increased its LEU stockpile by some 250 kg ( 550 pounds ) to 2,060 kg since November -- enough for one or two nuclear bombs if enriched to 90 percent purity .
Iran had earmarked 1.95 tons of its LEU for enrichment up to 20 percent , it said , a significant escalation as further refinement to the weapons - grade threshold would need only around six months .
“ This quantity is far in excess of the ( medical reactor ’s ) needs , ” David Albright , head of the Institute for Science and International Security , said in an online commentary .
But the IAEA report also attested to stagnating capacity at Natanz .
It said the number of operating centrifuges had dropped to 3,772 from nearly 4,000 .
This was well under half of all the machines installed in Natanz , the report indicated .
Analysts and diplomats close to the IAEA say Iran may be having serious mechanical problems in keeping thousands of antiquated centrifuges running in unison .
The U.S. official said the Iranians were accumulating LEU “ at a fairly low rate compared to what they should be able to do on paper ” and that Tehran seemed to be “ at least several years ” away from accumulating enough 20 percent enriched uranium that could then be converted into bomb - grade material .
But the senior official close to the IAEA said Iran seemed to be shifting focus to a second enrichment site at Fordow near Qom , which Iran has said will preserve the program if foes bomb Natanz and be operated with advanced centrifuges able to enrich two to three times as fast .
Tucked deep inside a mountain bunker to ward off attack , the plant at Fordow is scheduled to open in 2011 .

Hwaseung OZ vs hite SPARKYZ
Winner : Jaedong
“ My mind has become more comfortable ”
Q : It ’s finally an all - kill .
How do you feel ?
A : Because I was slumping in Winner ’s League , today ’s match was pressuring .
I expected a lot at the beginning of the round and everyone predicted that I would do 2 - 3 all - kills , but I unexpected slumped really hard .
However , the fact that I all - killed on the last match comforts a bit .
I gained confidence for R4 and R5 and I ’m happy that I was able to get the last win of the season .
Q : There was a lot of talk about you due to your slump
A : I was worried .
I dropped from the OSL and I did so badly in Proleague .
I blamed myself so much .
However , because the period of this slump was rather long , I began to forget about all the bad things .
Honestly , OSL was a big shock for me , but my manager advised me well and I did n’t go into the forums
In order to overcome this slump that I got myself into , I tried my hardest to change my mind set .
Although today ’s all - kill is merely 1 win for the team , it ’s a rather satisfying result for me personally .
I regained a lot of confidence and because my game sense was good during the match , I think I can do well despite the long slump .
Q : Your slump was n’t that long
A : I thought that it was long .
People say that I ’m slumping when I get into a 3 - game losing streak .
I think that was embedded in me .
If I perform just a little badly , people around me assume that I ’m playing badly , so it gives me a lot of stress .
This was a hard time .
That ’s why today ’s win means more to me .
Q : You are the first to play 200 Proleague games
A : I did n’t think about it , but it ’s a good record .
When I came down after the 1st set , my manager told me it was my 200th Proleague game .
I wanted to win even more after hearing that .
It means that I was sent out constantly and that there are more open opportunities for me , so I ’m content that I can create my own path .
I want to increase the gap between me and other players .
Q : People say that you ’re being overtaxed ( laughs ) .
A : It ’s an interesting opinion .
I think they say that because there is about a 10 - game difference between me and the older players .
However , I want to compliment myself .
I tried my hardest to get a lot of playing time and my win rate is n’t bad either .
The future is more important .
Q : You ’re now on a 16 - game winning streak against Hite .
It ’s a record against one specific team
A : It ’s good to me , but I think it ’s probably weird for Hite .
It ’s such a bad record for the other team .
However , it gives me confidence because I tried my hardest , and I want to continuously show good games against Hite .
There ’s still R4 and R5 remaining , so I want to win a lot for now .
About 20 straight wins ?
It ’s a really honorable record .
No one should be able to break that .
Q : You seem like you have a lot of greed for records like Flash
A : I think it ’s true for any progamer .
It ’s different for each person , but among people who compete , people who are greedy get the results .
There is no end to greed .
Because I ’m working hard from feeling greedy , it must be true that I ’m greedy for new records .
Q : Did you predict the all - kill ?
A : I felt it .
I knew that I won against Hite a lot and I reverse all - killed them last season .
Hite was our last opponent and because I was the starter , I thought I could do it .
I was really confident , and in addition , the map order was satisfying and my settings were smooth today .
Q : was greedy for an all - kill against Hwaseung after his all - kill against KT
A : I predicted that if I manage to get 3 kills , Leta would come out and do a reverse all - kill .
I heard about his interview from my coach .
I thought that I should play my hardest to get the all - kill and destroy the possibility of a reverse all - kill .
I was determined to let my opponent ’s all - kill not happen .
Q : Hite players all seemed powerless
A : Rather than that , I played with a lot of confidence but my opponents kept on making mistakes .
I did n’t let those go and focused .
As a result , I was able to get an all - kill .
I think my opponents made a lot of mistakes .
Q : Your judgment in the situation against Leta was perfect
A : I had already made Mutalisks .
I would have had over 11 Mutalisks .
Because my main was attacked and my Spire was gone , I thought that I would win if I just destroyed his main .
When my main and natural were being attacked , I did n’t even bother to look at my bases .
The timing was better for me , and the fact that he started off with a disadvantage helped me decide on what to do .
Q : Do you think there is a lot of possibility of advancing to Proleague playoffs ?
A : We think that it ’s definitely hopeful .
We have 22 matches left , and although it seems like a lot of the season has gone by , we only just ended R3 .
We can definitely manage to change the rankings in the next 2 rounds .
Today was a good opportunity to change the team ’s mood so I ’m confident in R4 and R5 .
Although the finals may be a stretch , the 6 teams do n’t have too much difference in records so I think we can definitely manage the post season .
I just have to do well ( laughs ) .
Q : What do you have to say about the Lurker that got stuck against BaBy ?
A : It ’s my fault for morphing there .
Although it ’s disappointing , I would have lost even if it were n’t stuck so I do n’t have anything to say .
I ’m trying to forget about it .
I ’ve gotten the gas bug before too so I ’m thinking that I ’m unlucky ( laughs ) .
However , the situation arose and I did n’t think of it as a bug , so I did n’t think of it as much .
Although I dropped to preliminaries , I can just go back up again .
I ’ve been in this situation a year ago so I ’m not worrying too much .
Q : Anything else ?
A : I ’m happy that I was able to win in my last Winner ’s League match .
The team and I both slumped so I was hurt , and my teammates also got stressed a lot .
I think we can reverse the situation from today ’s win .
I hope all the disappointed fans trust us again .
Although we were n’t really good in Winner ’s League , we ’ll definitely do well in R4 and R5 .
I hope all the fans who watched the Winner ’s League matches rest up well and enjoy R4 when it starts .

- 드디어 올킬이다 .
소감이 어떤가 ?
▲ 위너스리그에서 워낙 부진하다보니 오늘 경기가 다소 부담이 됐다 .
위너스리그 시작 전에 기대를 많이 했고 , 팀 내에서도 2 , 3 회 정도의 올킬을 예상했는데 너무 부진했다 .
그래도 마지막 경기에서 올킬을 하게 되니까 마음이 한결 가벼워졌다 .
4 , 5 라운드에 대한 자신감도 더 생겼고 위너스리그 유종의 미를 거두게 되어서 좋다 .
- 최근 부진에 대해서 주변의 우려가 많이 있었는데 .
▲ 걱정이 됐다.
이제 스타리그에서는 예선까지 떨어졌고 , 프로리그에서도 너무 못했다 .
자책을 많이 했다 .
하지만 그런 기간이 길어지다 보니까 안 좋은 생각을 하지 않게 됐다 .
스타리그는 솔직히 충격이 컸다 .
그래도 감독님이 좋은 말씀을 많이 해주셨고 , 인터넷 커뮤니티에는 아예 들어가지 않았다 .
내 자신이 만들어낸 슬럼프를 스스로 이겨내기 위해서 계속해서 마인드컨트롤을 했다 .
오늘 이렇게 올킬을 한 것은 프로리그 팀 1승에 불과하지만 개인적으로는 굉장히 만족스러운 결과다 .
자신감을 많이 얻었고 경기 감각도 좋았기 때문에 부진은 길었지만 앞으로는 더 잘할 수 있다는 말씀을 드리고 싶다 .
- 부진이 그렇게 길지는 않았다 .
▲ 스스로 그렇게 생각을 하는 것 같다. 주변에서도 3연 패 정도를 하면 슬럼프라는 말이 나오더라 .
그런 생각이 나도 박혀버린 것 같다. 조금만 못하면 못하고 있다고 인정을 해버리니까 스트레스를 많이 받게 되더라 .
이번 기간이 많이 힘들었던 것이 사실이다 .
그래서 오늘 승리가 더욱 값지다 .
- 프로리그 최초 200전을 치렀는데 .
▲ 생각은 하지 못했는데 굉장히 기분 좋은 기록이다 .
1 세트에서 끝나고 내려오니 감독님이 200 전 이라고 말씀을 해주시더라 .
그 말을 듣고 더욱 이기고 싶었다 .
그 만큼 꾸준히 출전을 해왔고 , 앞으로도 가능성이 열려있기 때문에 스스로 내 길을 만들어갈 수 있다는 점에서 만족스럽다 .
다른 선수들과 격차를 더욱 벌리고 싶다 .
- 팬들 사이에서는 혹사라는 이야기도 있다 ( 웃음 ) .
▲ 참 재미있는 의견이다 .
선배 게이머들과 10 전 정도 차이가 나니까 그런 말이 나오는 것 같다.
하지만 나는 스스로 칭찬을 하고 싶다 .
혹사가 아니라 내가 출전 기회를 많이 잡기 위해서 열심히 했고 승률도 나쁘지 않다 .
사실 앞으로가 더 중요하다 .
- 하이트전 16 연승을 기록했는데 , 특정팀 상대 연승 신기록이다 .
▲ 나에게는 좋지만 한 팀을 상대로 그렇게 연승을 했으니 하이트 입장에서는 조금 그럴 것 같다.
반대의 입장이 되어서 생각한다면 상당히 안 좋은 기록인 것 같다.
하지만 나는 최선을 다했기 때문에 자신감이 쌓이고 쌓여서 하이트를 상대로 계속 좋은 모습을 보여주고 있다고 생각한다 .
4 , 5 라운드도 남았기 때문에 지금 생각으로는 계속 이기고 싶다. 20 연승 정도? 그런 기록을 보유하는 것은 굉장히 명예로운 것이다 .
20 연승 정도를 하면 누구도 깰 수 없는 기록이 될 것 같다 .
- 여담이지만 이영호와 함께 기록 욕심이 많은 것 같다 .
▲ 프로게이머라면 당연한 것 같다. 사람마다 다르겠지만 경쟁을 하는 시장에서는 욕심이 많은 사람이 성과를 낼 수 밖에 없다 .
욕심은 끝이 없다고 하지 않나 ?
욕심을 갖고 열심히 하다보니 성과가 나오는 것이고 기록 욕심은 당연하다고 생각한다 .
- 올킬에 대한 예감을 했는지 .
▲ 느낌이 있었다 .
하이트를 상대로 많이 이겼다는 사실을 알고 있고 , 지난 시즌에는 역올킬도 했었다 .
하이트가 마지막 상대고 , 내가 선봉으로 출전하게 되면서 올킬에 대한 생각이 들었다 .
그 만큼 자신감이 있었고 , 맵 순서도 만족스러웠고 세팅감도 좋았다 .
- 신상문이 KT 를 올킬한 후 화승전 올킬에 대한 욕심을 드러냈는데 .
▲ 내가 3킬을 하면 ( 신 ) 상문이가 역올킬을 노리고 나올 것으로 예상을 했다 .
지난 인터뷰 이야기는 코치님께 들었다 .
3 킬 을 하고 난 뒤에 필사적으로 해서 올킬을 달성하고 역올킬의 여지를 없애고 싶다는 생각도 들었다 .
상대의 올킬 의지도 꺾자는 생각을 하면서 각오를 다지기도 했다 .
- 하이트 선수들이 다소 무기력해 보였다 .
▲ 그런 점보다는 자신감을 갖고 임했는데 , 상대 선수들이 계속 실수를 하는 것 같더라 .
그런 점을 놓치지 않고 집중해서 플레이를 한 결과 올킬을 하게 된 것 같다 .
상대 선수들이 실수를 많이 한 것 같다 .
- 신상문과의 경기에서는 상황 판단이 정확했다 .
▲ 뮤탈리스크가 다 찍힌 상황이었다 .
11뮤탈이 넘어갈 정도였다 .
본진이 공격받고 스파이어가 깨졌기 때문에 뮤탈리스크로 상대의 본진만 초토화시킨다면 필승이라는 생각을 했다 .
본진과 앞마당이 깨지는 상황에서 내 본진을 보지도 않았다 .
타이밍도 나에게 유리했고 , 상대가 초반에 불리하게 시작한 점도 그렇게 상황 판단을 할 수 있는 배경이 된 것 같다 .
- 화승의 6 강 포스트시즌 가능성은 높게 보고 있는지 궁금하다 .
▲ 우리는 충분히 희망적이라는 생각을 하고 있다.
앞으로 22 경기가 남았기 때문에 시즌을 많이 치른 것 같지만 이제 겨우 3 라운드가 끝났을 뿐이다 .
남은 두 라운드에서 순위를 얼마든지 바꿀 수 있다고 본다 .
오늘도 팀 분위기를 반전시킬 수 있는 좋은 승리였기 때문에 4 , 5 라 운드도 자신이 있다.
광안리 직행은 무리겠지 만 6 개 팀의 성적 격차가 크지 않기 때문에 포스트시즌은 충분히 갈 수 있다고 본다. 나만 잘하면 된다( 웃음 ) .
- 전태양과의 1경 기 러커 끼임 상황에 대해서 하고 싶은 말은 없나 .
▲ 하필 거기에서 변태를 했기 때문에 끼인 것이다 .
지나고 보니 아쉽기는 하지만 그 곳에 끼이지 않았었다고 해도 졌기 때문에 할 말은 없다고 생각한다 .
잊어버리려고 한다. 예전에 가스 버그도 났었고 재수가 없다는 생각을 하기도 했다 ( 웃음 ) .
하지만 그런 상황이 나왔고 버그라고 생각을 하지 않았기 때문에 별다른 생각은 하지 않았다 .
예선까지 떨어지기는 했지만 다시 올라가면 된다 .
1 년 전에도 이런 상황이 있었기 때문에 별로 걱정하지는 않는다 .
- 더 하고 싶은 말이 있다면 .
▲ 위너스리그 마지막 경기에서 승리를 거두게 되어서 좋다 .
팀도 부진하고 나도 부진해서 속이 많이 상했고 팀원들도 스트레스를 많이 받았다 .
오늘 승리를 계기로 분위기를 반전시킬 수 있을 것 같다 .
그 동안 실망하셨던 팬들도 다시 기대를 해주셨으면 좋겠다 .
위너스리그에서 안 좋은 모습을 보여드렸지만 4 , 5 라운드 활약을 기대해주셨으면 좋겠다 .
위너스리그에서 수고를 하신 관계자분들 , 팬들 모두 4라운드 전까지 재충전을 하시고 다시 활기차게 프로리그를 즐겼으면 좋겠다 .

js-comint.el
Introduction
js -comint.el is a comint mode for emacs which allows you to run a compatible javascript repl such as Spidermonkey or Rhino inside of emacs .
At first blush this may seem a little useless , but when paired with Steve Yegge 's js2 - mode it becomes a useful way of testing non-html - centric javascript code while editing it .
For example , put js - comint.el in your load - path , and then add the following lines to your .emacs :
( require ' js - comint ) ( setq inferior - js - program - command " /usr/bin/java org.mozilla.javascript.tools.shell.Main " ) ( add - hook 'js2 - mode - hook '( lambda ( ) ( local - set - key " \C- x \ C-e " ' js - send- last - sexp ) ( local - set - key " \C-\M - x " ' js - send-last - sexp - and - go ) ( local - set - key " \C - cb " ' js - send - buffer ) ( local - set - key " \C - c\C - b " ' js - send- buffer - and - go ) ( local - set - key " \C-cl " ' js-load- file-and - go ) ) )
You can then try out any piece of javascript code in a javascript interpreter by simply typing C-x C-e at the end of the sexp .
js - comint will use js2 - mode to find the last sexp , run Rhino , and load the sexp it just found into the interpreter .
This , it turns out , is extremely useful , particularly when you 're writing non-domish , algorithmic javascript .
In his book , which has received lavish praise from some quarters , the open - shirted Mr Lévy lays into the philosopher Immanuel Kant as being unhinged and a " fake " .
To support his claims , he cites a certain Jean - Baptiste Botul , whom he describes as a post - War authority on Kant .
The British Library is to make thousands of classic 19th century works available as e-books completely free of charge .
In a joint venture with Microsoft , some 65,000 works will be offered as free downloads in the spring , with authors including the likes of Charles Dickens , Jules Verne and Jane Austen .
The titles , all officially out of copyright , will be available as special digital " first editions " , complete with the original typeface and illustrations , and will significantly bolster the Library 's e-book catalogue .
Besides well - known 19th century literature , the selection will also include so - called " penny dreadfuls " , such as JM Rymer 's The Dark Woman and Black Bess by Edward Viles .
Around 40 per cent of the titles on offer are n't available in any other library .
Alongside the digital titles , supporting paperback editions of many of the works will go on sale through Amazon for around 15 apiece , also featuring the original typeface and illustrations .
The announcement marks the end of a three - year process of scanning in the titles , a project funded by Microsoft .
The 19th century literature was specifically chosen because it is out of copyright so can be copied freely .
With the British Library officially holding at least one copy of every work of literature released in the UK , it claims that 35 to 40 per cent of its 19th century titles are n't held by any other library .
Regarding policy towards Iran , the American national interest would be best served by avoiding any involvement , if only because comments from the White House will be seen as outside interference , strengthening the hands of the conservatives .
But there are many in the United States who do not see it quite that way , hoping to tighten the screws on the rulers in Tehran .
They have been exploiting the so - called deadline of the year ’s end for Iran and the US to enter into meaningful negotiations on Tehran ’s nuclear program .
To be sure , many of those who are pushing hardest for sanctions are really only interested in war and regime change with sanctions as a first step establishing an irreversible course of action based on conflict rather than diplomacy .
Parallel with developments in the political arena , attempts to demonize Iran in the media appear to constitute a growth industry .
False articles about Iran poison the foreign policy discourse because they create a dangerous narrative , that Tehran ’s rulers are irredeemably evil and completely unwilling to compromise .
In intelligence circles this is called disinformation .
Nowhere is this barrage of disinformation more evident than in the media empire controlled by Rupert Murdoch , which includes the Wall Street Journal , the Times newspapers in Britain , and Fox television .
Murdoch ’s media marched in lockstep as a virtual propaganda mill in the lead - up to the Iraq war .
Murdoch himself is much esteemed by Israel and by Jewish organizations and he has been outspoken in his approval of Israeli policies , including the devastation of Gaza one year ago .
He has received numerous awards in Israel and the US for his support of Israel , most recently in November when he was given the Simon Wiesenthal Center ’s Humanitarian Laureate Award .
In March 2009 he received the National Human Relations award from the American Jewish Committee .
Murdoch is generally believed to be extremely close to Tel Aviv ’s intelligence service Mossad and some of the stories featured in the media he controls would appear to be disinformation supporting Israeli government positions .
Over the past month there has been a spate of stories demonizing Iran , often based on evidence that most would regard as dubious .
A December 14th article in the Times of London called " Secret document exposes Iran ’s nuclear trigger " detailed how " confidential intelligence documents obtained by The Times show that Iran is working on testing a key final component of a nuclear bomb . "
The article was attacked by Gareth Porter and myself based on informed sources suggesting that the document the article relied on was a forgery .
The document in question , alleged to be " from Iran ’s most sensitive military nuclear project , " was of unknown provenance and US intelligence agencies do not believe it to be genuine .
Times leader writer and columnist Oliver Kamm in turn unloaded on Porter and me as " Lindberghians , " sleazily insinuating in my case that I was an anti-Semite , while failing to address our legitimate suspicions about the document .
In passing he also trashed Antiwar.com , inaccurately calling it isolationist , and described Ron Paul somewhat bizarrely as " Republican presidential nominee of insanitary political lineage and , ahem , highly imaginative schemes for monetary policy . "
Kamm is a former merchant banker whose understanding of foreign policy apparently derives from his ability to make money in the bizarre financial services world that prevailed prior to the 2008 meltdown .
His neoconish credentials and somewhat bizarre worldview have been examined by Justin Raimondo .
Other stories relating to the alleged threat posed by Iran have appeared recently in the Times .
On December 21st appeared " North Korea weapons aircraft ‘ was heading to Iran . ’ "
The Times conceded that the destination of the flight was a mystery but relied on its sister paper the Wall Street Journal as the source for the story .
The Times then adds its own analysis , " From Iran the weapons could have been passed on to militants in Lebanon or Gaza . "
So the story about a plane that turned out to be registered in Georgia and carrying North Korean weapons becomes a story about Iran with no real hard evidence of Tehran ’s involvement .
Since the account of the arms shipment first surfaced it has vanished without a trace , suggesting that many other media outlets did not find it credible .
But some readers were convinced by it .
The story attracted a comment by one Daniel Evans who wrote " North Korea and Iran are targeting Israeli civilians to be killed by Hamas and Hezbollah .
All in order to facilitate Iran ’s nuclear annihilation of Israel and USA .
Full scale war is the appropriate response . "
On December 31st , the Times featured an article " Peter Moore freed after US hands over Iraqi insurgent . "
The story was about a British contractor who had been held by an Iraqi group for 31 months .
So what does it have to do with Iran ?
According to the Times the extremist Shia group that allegedly held Moore is " allied to Iran , " adding " there were unconfirmed reports that Iran ’s Revolutionary Guard was involved in the kidnapping operation and that the hostages were smuggled into Iran …held in two prisons run by al - Quds , which specializes in foreign operations . "
But both the British Foreign office and no less than General David Petraeus have both said that the alleged Iranian involvement is only speculation .
Unfortunately , true or false the story resonates , convincing some that Iran is outside the pale .
In a comment on the article posted on Times Online , one Daniel Case wrote " I think it is time to go into Iran and change the regime .
I would love to see the religious nutters at The Hague charged with crimes against humanity .
Let them all rot in jail . "
Also on New Year ’s Eve , another Murdoch paper , the New York Post , featured an editorial by Ralph Peters , " O ’s day of reckoning , " calling on President Obama to take action against Iran over the expiry of the end - of - year negotiating deadline .
He cites , inter alia , the Iranian " … attempt to import more than 1,300 tons of make - a- nuke uranium ore from Kazakhstan " and refers to the government in Tehran as " turbaned tyrants " and " authentic fanatics . "
The uranium ore story had surfaced the day before based on an intelligence report that was prepared by a country that " could not be identified because of the confidential nature of the information . "
Both Iran and Kazakhstan have denied that any sale was being discussed and the media outrage is again derived from one anonymous report of unknown reliability .
Is it a coincidence that the story should surface at a time when there are increasing demands for Obama to do something about Iran ?
Bogus stories about Iran have a long history in the Murdoch media empire , most particularly in the Times .
In April 2009 , the newspaper reported that Israel was planning a massive attack on Iran ’s nuclear sites " within days of being given the go - ahead by its new government . "
The article , light on content and heavy on innuendo , undoubtedly was intended to alarm new president Obama to force him to panic and take action against Iran to forestall an Israeli strike .
A month earlier , the Times reported that Iran was supplying the Taliban in Afghanistan with surface to air missiles that could destroy helicopters .
The story was denied by the US and British defense departments and turned out to be untrue , but it left behind the impression that Iran was assisting attacks on allied forces in Afghanistan .
Such a highly emotional story line , which might be reduced to " they are killing our soldiers , " was used subsequently by Senator Joseph Lieberman and others in the US Congress to justify harsh sanctions against Iran .
In July 2008 , the Times claimed that Iran might be developing germ warfare agents because of the reported purchase of 215 wild monkeys from a Tanzanian dealer for drug testing at the Razi Vaccine and Serum Institute in Tehran .
It is unfortunately true that many countries continue to test drugs on primates but testing drugs does not necessarily equate to germ warfare .
The story was never corroborated .
A September 2007 story on the alleged Syrian nuclear reactor included a somewhat implausible account of how Israeli commandoes had seized nuclear material from the site before it was bombed .
The story was unique to the Times and appears to be untrue , almost certainly coming from an Israeli government source .
If Israel had actually seized any compromising material , it would have show it to the world ’s media to bolster its case against Damascus .
The story also provided the opportunity to throw punches at Iran , claiming that Iran , Syria , and North Korea constitute a new " axis of evil " and quoting a source at the neocon Washington Institute of Near East Policy who described Syria as a " client " of Iran .
In April 2007 , the Times featured a shocking article claiming that Iran was assisting al - Qaeda in Iraq to enable it to stage a " Nagasaki or Hiroshima size attack " against a western target , possibly using a dirty bomb .
Most intelligence sources considered the story to be highly implausible , bordering on ridiculous .
A month earlier the Times described the defection of Iranian former Revolutionary Guard General Ali Reza Asgari .
Per the Times , Asgari was the " father of Hezbollah " and was carrying documents proving Iran ’s links to terrorists .
In reality , Asgari was a 43 - year - old businessman snatched off an Istanbul street in a joint CIA Turkish operation .
He had been out of the Iranian government for several years , had no documents , and had not been in Lebanon since 1989 .
Two Times articles in August and September 2006 described how Iran was seeking to buy uranium from the Congo and also attempting to obtain ballistic missiles from criminal members of the security services in the Ukraine that would be capable of carrying nuclear weapons .
Neither article was ever independently corroborated .
The original source of the uranium story appears to have been a memo leaked from the Pentagon ’s Office of the Undersecretary for Defense Policy headed by Eric Edelman , who succeeded Doug Feith .
I am not suggesting for a moment that the Times and other Rupert Murdoch - owned newspapers do n’t do some good reporting , and I would note in particular their exemplary coverage of the Sibel Edmonds story .
But I would warn that the conjunction of Middle East issues , most particularly the " Iranian threat , " and the newspaper ’s editorial slant in favor of Israel and interventionism invite caution .
If a breaking story relates to Iran and appears first in the Times it is probably not completely true and might be completely false , a shaky foundation for building a case for war .
Teaser is a 10 - stone Staffordshire bull terrier cross- breed , flanked like a horse and with a head the size of a rugby ball .
It lives in a small flat in Somers Town , central London , and local kids on the estate often knock and ask to walk it , amazed that the 22 - year - old owner , CJ , can make it sit and give paw .
Many of the kids have their own dogs – staffie crosses , rottweilers , and illegal pit bulls – and the numbers are multiplying as they are bred with other dogs on the estate .
" It 's a status thing – one or two people get them and then everyone 's got one , " says CJ .
" Kids think I 've got a pit and I 'm a hard man , but they 're the ones running around estates being pulled on leads .
[ The dogs ] keep spreading because they 're so easy to get .
Just go on to the internet and type in ' pit bull puppies ' .
It 's not surprising everyone I know has a dog . "
Yet a growing number of dog owners are irresponsible .
In London , the number of dogs seized by the police under the Dangerous Dogs Act ( DDA ) soared from 263 in 2006 - 07 to 719 in 2008 - 09 .
So far this year , 1,000 dogs have been confiscated – a fourfold increase in three years .
The act allows dogs to be seized because they are illegal , dangerously out of control , or if they are used to threaten or intimidate someone .
So legal breeds , such as Staffordshires , can be seized under the act .
Pit bull - type terriers , Japanese tosas , and the dogo Argentino and fila Brasileiro mastiffs are all illegal breeds , but many owners get around the rules by mixing illegal breeds with Staffordshires and calling them crosses .
The increase in seizures in London has been driven by a crackdown and the opening of a Metropolitan police Status Dogs Unit ( SDU ) last March , but national data suggests there has also been an increase in violent dogs on the street .
According to the Ministry of Justice , the number of dog owners prosecuted for causing injury rose by 50 % between 2003 and 2007 .
The RSPCA says that calls about dog fighting have increased massively over the last few years , with two - thirds of complaints now directly connected to young people using dogs as " weapons " in streets and parks .
A series of high - profile attacks have focused public attention on this issue .
Last February , a baby died in south Wales after being attacked by a Staffordshire bull terrier and a Jack Russell .
In November , four - year - old John Paul Massey was mauled to death by a pit bull in Liverpool .
And just before Christmas , a guide dog was viciously attacked by another dog , whose young owner was walking it unleashed by in north London .
CJ says that walking without a lead is too often used as a sign of power and control on the street .
" I 'm always paranoid that some dog off a lead is going to attack Teaser , " he says .
David Grant , director of the RSPCA 's Harmondsworth hospital in north London , picks up the pieces of irresponsible dog ownership every day .
His hospital is full of emaciated staffies that have been abandoned – often in the hospital 's reception – by young men who do n't want to give their names or pay veterinary bills .
Many of the dogs are sick , as their owners have n't had the money or the knowledge to apply for vaccinations .
In the worst cases , dogs have been abused by irritated owners or been forced to fight .
In 40 years of practice , Grant , whose veterinary operations were seen by millions on the BBC's Animal Hospital television series , says things have never been so bad , and he has started documenting the worst cases .
His computer now hold hundreds of images of dogs that have been shot , stabbed or burnt .
" A typical problem owner will be from an inner-city estate , unemployed , without any educational achievements , " he says .
" Young males predominate , although the fighters often register the dog in a girlfriend 's name . "
Names such as ­Terror , Chaos , Killer , Ice and Asbo often tell a dog's story , says Grant , as does evidence of ­harnesses – accessories often used to glamorise dogs before gang fights .
But Grant is keen not to sensationalise or oversimplify .
He wants to distinguish between " fashion dogs " , which are simply part of a craze , and " status dogs " , which are bred for offence and defence .
" Fashion dogs tend to be staffie crosses that are naturally good - natured , turning nasty only when they suffer abuse , or neglect when their owners get bored , " he says .
­" Status dogs , on the other hand , are bred to intimidate .
At the worst level , gangs will use them for mascots , muggings , safeguarding territory , and fighting enemies and other dogs . "
Grant , along with dog wardens and police officers , has repeatedly drawn attention to the parallels between dogs and knives .
Both are carried by young ­people in areas where crime is high , often for defence .
In some cases , even parents have been known to encourage their children – particularly girls – to walk with dogs as a means of protection .
However , in contrast to ­possession of knives , a young person will not face five years ' imprisonment for having a dog .
But if fear and fashion are multiplying dog numbers , so is the potential money that unemployed young people can make from " dog dealing .
Staffordshire puppies and their crosses can sell for £ 400 - £ 500 each , and with an average litter size of eight and a bitch able to produce two litters a year , an owner can earn up to £ 8,000 annually from a single dog .
From his council flat in north London , Dion , 24 , supplements his living by dealing dogs .
He 's got a few scars from violent dogs he 's owned in the past , but now he 's got just one , a mixture of a staffie - pit cross and a presa Canario .
" My dog has had her first litter and two generations of grandchildren , " he says .
" I wanted to keep the bloodline going .
The money 's not the ­priority though – I 'll sell them for half of the £ 350 I could get when I know they 're going to a good home . "
Shredded forearm
Security is another reason Dion hangs on to his dog .
He says : " My dog attacked my stepdad once – for good reason .
He was a bit of an alcoholic , and when my sister got scared of him once she screamed and the dog went straight for him and shredded his forearm before he could hurt her .
It 's another reason to feel safer . "
According to Sergeant Ian McParland , chief officer at the SDU , simply banning more dogs under the DDA is not the answer .
The problem is not genetics , but upbringing , he says .
Most dogs can become aggressive or peaceful , depending on how they 're raised , he says .
" You could go on banning breeds until the cows come home and it wo n't make a difference , " McParland says .
" We 're almost fortunate that the status dog of choice , the pit bull terrier , is illegal .
I do n't know what we'd do if Akitas , German shepherds and rottweilers started becoming fashionable [ as status dogs ] .
Akitas were used by Samurai warriors . "
He points out the threat posed by selective breeding .
" Breeds are getting more dangerous , " he says .
" If you 've got a nasty dog and your mate 's got a nasty bitch , they 're the ones you 're going to breed . "
So far , local authorities ' response to the problem has been mixed .
Last month , ­the London borough of Harrow proposed ­vetting and chipping all dogs owned by people waiting for social housing .
Anyone with a dog that it suspected of being used for fighting would be refused a tenancy , though deputy council leader , Susan Hall , insisted that this would be a last resort .
" We will work with the RSPCA and police to make sure that people in council properties do n't keep dogs that are a menace to others , " she said .
In south London , Wandsworth council is already piloting a programme that will see residents threatened with eviction if they fail to keep their dogs responsibly .
Other London councils employ specialist dog wardens who are on call to answer residents ' problems ; others simply slide dog issues into the files of the resident environment officer .
In Liverpool , following the death of John Paul Massey , councillors voted for an amnesty on illegal dogs , free micro-­chipping , and tougher rules on leads and muzzling .
They are also investigating a dog registration scheme .
Root causes
According to Grant , it will take more than punitive measures to curtail irresponsible dog ownership .
" A lot of the time I feel as sorry for the owners as the dogs , " he says .
" These young men have been on a conveyor belt of social deprivation since the day they were born , and we 're at the end of it , trying to pick up the pieces .
They 've had no upbringing , and they 've got no educational qualifications and no prospects .
Society has let them down .
We need to address the root causes if we 're going to solve these problems . "
Back on estates in north London , young people are talking about breeds , bloods and lineages .
Videos of dogfights recorded on mobiles are changing hands , and an old cage for dog fighting sits in a garage .
Talking to CJ , it is clear that owning dogs is a way of life .
But it is one that he wants out of .
" I want to take my life out of the city so that she 's safer , " he says , play - fighting with Teaser .
" There are so many kids in London with dogs these days , and they all want beef [ trouble ] .
At the end of the day , I love dogs more than people .
I 'd move to the country to keep her safe . "
Some names have been changed .

Efforts to slow the march of old age with a pill have been dealt a blow .
Drugs that might treat disease by tampering with the biology of ageing are being tested , but new research questions whether they work as thought .
The compounds include resveratrol , a much - touted component of red wine that is thought to prevent the cellular damage that underlies ageing .
Also under test are several chemicals intended to mimic resveratrol ’s effects by activating SIRT1 , a protein implicated in ageing .
Experiments have led some to conclude that these drugs ramp up the protein ’s activity , but the new studies suggest that those experiments suffered from errors .
“ I think it ’s a setback because there ’s been a lot of optimism about these resveratrol - like compounds , ” says Matt Kaeberlein , a biochemist at the University of Washington in Seattle who was not involved in either study and has no link with any company developing anti-ageing drugs .
Sirtris , a drug development firm based in Cambridge , Massachusetts , is hoping these and similar drugs will treat age - related disorders such as type 2 diabetes and cancer , and has numerous clinical trials already under way .
The company was bought by pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) for $ 720 million in 2008 .

Bone of contention
The bone of contention in the new studies is a laboratory test meant to measure how far a drug boosts activity of SIRT1 .
Separate teams led by researchers at the drugs companies Amgen in Thousand Oaks , California , and Pfizer in Groton , Connecticut , contend that tests linking resveratrol to certain aspects of longevity turned up false positives .
As part of its own quest for anti-ageing drugs , the Pfizer team tested resveratrol and three Sirtris compounds using several more sensitive methods , and none of the compounds worked as expected .
Furthermore , the drugs seemed to have unintended side effects that could undermine their usefulness to humans .
One of the most promising of the resveratrol - like drugs did not improve the health of mice fed a high - fat diet – the opposite of what a Sirtris team reported in 2007 .
The Amgen team also conclude that resveratrol does n’t activate SIRT1 .
GSK questions the validity of the Pfizer team ’s findings .
The researchers “ set out to prove a negative and fall short of achieving that objective while adding little scientific insight to a complicated and emerging area of biology ” , a representative wrote in an email to New Scientist .
Do n’t give up yet
Even if resveratrol and the Sirtris compounds do n’t combat ageing , this does n’t make them worthless – far from it , Kaeberlein and others say .
It is already known that high doses of resveratrol can limit the toll of a high - fat diet on mice , although the compound does n’t seem to extend the lifespan of healthy rodents .
“ It may be that resveratrol - like compounds are going to be therapeutically useful in people , ” Kaeberlein says .
If they are n’t , Kaeberlein worries that enthusiasm and investment in longevity - boosting drugs could dry up .
That would be a shame , he says , given the promise of another age - hacking drug : rapamycin .
Last year , a group led by David Harrison at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor , Maine , revealed that aged mice given rapamycin , a transplant drug lived 10 per cent longer than other mice .
Rapamycin , Harrison says , blocks a pathway called TOR that responds to nutrients in the environment which may be fundamental to ageing , and a furious search is under way to find chemicals that work in a similar way without dampening the immune system .
“ Right now everybody and his uncle are trying to find something that acts like rapamycin . ”

Jonathan Schwartz , the last chief executive of Sun Microsystems , has become the first Fortune 200 boss to tweet his resignation .
Late Wednesday night , Mr. Schwartz used Twitter to publish a haiku about his exit from Oracle , which just completed its purchase of Sun last week .
“ Financial crisis / Stalled too many customers / CEO no more , ” Mr. Schwartz wrote .
Mr. Schwartz has been fond of using the Internet as a soapbox .
At Sun , he became the first chief executive of a major company to put up his own blog .
Mr. Schwartz also pushed the Securities and Exchange Commission to put blogs on equal footing with press releases and filings when it comes to disclosing critical business matters to investors .
Mr. Schwartz replaced
Sun ’s co-founder , Scott McNealy , as chief executive in 2006 , inheriting a company that had been suffering from declining sales ever since the dot - com bust .
One of the most dramatic moves made during Mr. Schwartz ’s tenure as chief executive was Sun ’s decision to release the vast majority of its top software products under open - source licenses .
The company hoped that broad developer interest in its software products would help attract new customers and translate into sales of other products like computer servers and storage systems .
However , Sun struggled to post consistent results and its sales continued to decline .
The recession only exacerbated matters , as Sun depended on sales to many of the financial companies that were pummeled by the downturn .
I.B.M. moved to acquire Sun , only to have negotiations stall , opening the door for Oracle .
Oracle ’s chief executive , Larry Ellison , is not especially fond of Mr. Schwartz .
In an interview last week , Mr. Ellison said he fully expected Mr. Schwartz to resign rather than play a role in the combined company .
As for what ’s next , Mr. Schwartz said in an e-mail : “ In the short run , I ’m planning to spend some long overdue time with my family .
Longer run , with a few million businesses and a few billion consumers on the Web , rumor has it there are some interesting opportunities to be had . ”
Sometimes cover songs , against all odds , can take a seemingly irreparable original and bring it to glory .
These are our favorite little engines that could :
1. Los Colorados – Hot ‘n Cold ( Katy Perry Cover )
This is incredible .
Los Colorados , a Ukrainian polka band , took a generic pop song and transformed it into a generic polka song .
These four 30 - somethings play it to their large gypsy wives , urging them to prepare a decent sandwich for once .
Admittedly , they prefer hot rather than cold .
Also , the utter sincerity behind the accent cloaked lines , “ We fight we break up / We kiss we make up , ” is almost too much too handle .
2. Daniel Rossen – Too Little , Too Late ( JoJo Cover ) Daniel Rossen ( of Grizzy Bear fame ) performed this rendition of the 2006 JoJo classic for singer Ed Droste ’s birthday .
The words , “ I was young and in love / I gave you everything but it was n’t enough / And now you wanna communicate , ” gain new meaning when sung not by a 16 year - old girl , but rather , a 26 year - old man who believes wanting to “ communicate ” is something different than a really intense AIM convo .
3. Sonic Youth ( as Ciccone Youth ) – Into the Groovey ( Madonna Cover ) Sonic
Youth succeeded in taking a frumpy Madonna tune that involved a matador jacket and an onstage treadmill and turned into a pre-90s shitgazer worthy of a skinhead bubble bath .
That ’s just impressive .
4. Gary Jules – Mad World ( Tears for Fears Cover )
Have you heard the original ?
5. Manfred Mann – Blinded by the Light ( Bruce Springsteen Cover )
By picking a forgettable Bruce Springsteen song and mangling the lyrics from “ revved up like a deuce ” to “ wrapped up like a douche , ” Manfred Mann , along with some cheesy ’ 70s synthesizers , created a beautifully self - aware parody .
This version of the song is also credited as the sole inspiration behind McDonald ’s snack wrap .
Whoever told you it catered to the obesity epidemic is a goddamn liar .
These are the little engines that dropped out of railroad school for a life of petty crime and the chance to turn a good song bad .
1. Fall Out Boy – Love Lockdown ( Kanye West Cover ) Just no .
2. The Killers – Four Winds ( Bright Eyes Cover )
The original Bright Eyes song kind of sounds like the chorus from “ Santa Claus is Coming to Town . ”
Now imagine an uninspired electro - dance version .
Fact : Brandon Flowers has received pure coal for the last two Christmases .
3. Lostphrophets – Cry Me a River ( Justin Timberlake Cover )
This is what happens when an early 2000 ’s nu-metal / hard rock band tries to be “ ironic . ”
Have you ever seen ears cry ?
Now is your chance .
4. Coldplay – Viva La Vida Considering Cat Stevens , The Creaky Boards , and Joe Satriani have all admitted to writing this song , it is a well - documented fact that “ Viva La Vida ” was never created , it simply “ existed . ” Chris Martin just made it worse .
5. A.C. Newman – Take on Me ( A - Ha Cover ) Trying to do a serious rendition of this song is like trying to make Justin Guarini cool .
It simply ca n’t be done .
( Newser ) – Let the Olympics rate each country ’s elite athletes ; the Daily Beast wanted to know which country had the laziest general populace .
So they pitted 24 developed nations against each other in four statistical categories : calories consumed per day , television viewing , Internet usage , and aversion to sports .
The “ winners ” :
The United States of America :
It ’s not even close .
America ranked first in calories per day and TV viewing , and earned bronze in the other two categories , a staggeringly dominant non-performance .
Canada :
They play plenty of sports , but the guys up north spent an average 43 hours online in December , good for gold in that category .
Belgium :
The country known for its chocolate , waffles , and beer ranked second in calories consumed .
Turkey :
The Turks claim gold in sports aversion , and finish just out of medal range in Internet usage .
Great Britain : The British do n’t play sports , either .
Plus , one survey declared English men terrible lovers , because they ’re “ too lazy . ”

A rare salamander is being driven to the brink of extinction in the wild because of internet trading , conservationists say .
The little - known Kaiser 's spotted newt , found only in Iran , is thought to be the first creature to face the threat of extinction from e-commerce – a growing threat to endangered wildlife which authorities are struggling to address .
Because Neurergus kaiseri is very attractively coloured , and also rare , amphibian enthusiasts are willing to pay as much as £ 200 for one .
Dealers can often only find people willing to pay such a price by advertising on the internet .
An investigation into the sale of Kaiser 's spotted newts by the wildlife trade monitoring agency Traffic found 10 websites claiming to stock the species , including a Ukrainian company which said it had sold more than 200 wild - caught specimens in a year .
The demand has been such that the wild population , found only in four streams of Iran 's Zagros Mountains , was reduced by 80 per cent between 2001 and 2005 alone , and is now classed as critically endangered .
It is estimated that fewer than 1,000 mature individuals remain .
Conservationists want all international trade in wild - caught Kaiser 's spotted newts made illegal .
A proposal to ban such trade has been put forward by Iran at the conference of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( Cites ) , in Doha in the Arabian gulf .
" The internet itself is n't the threat , but it 's another way to market the product , " said Ernie Cooper , of Traffic Canada .
" The Kaiser 's spotted newt , for example , is expensive and most people are not willing to pay $ 300 for a salamander .
But through the power of the internet , tapping into global market , you can find buyers . "
Kaiser 's spotted newts were being advertised for sale on numerous websites yesterday , but the animals did not appear to be wild - caught .
Babies were being offered for £ 40 each for delivery anywhere in Europe , with North American sellers asking for around twice that price including free next - day shipping .
Some sellers claimed their salamanders had been captive - bred in 2008 .
Illegal wildlife trade is gaining ground on the internet , according to Cites .
Officials say that while wildlife law enforcement has made gains in policing physical markets for wildlife , the online world – with its " virtual " markets that have yet to be properly regulated – presents a set of new challenges .
US drone attacks are being stepped up along the Afghan - Pakistan border
A missile attack by a US drone aircraft has killed at least 15 people in north - west Pakistan , officials say .
Four missiles hit the house of a local tribesman in Shaktoi , South Waziristan , near the Afghan border , an official told the BBC .
The official said all those killed in the attack were militants .
Last week an attack in the same area reportedly targeted Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud , but the Taliban say he survived .
" Now the death toll is 15 .
It could rise further .
People are still busy removing rubble , " a senior security official told Reuters .
Most of the casualties were foreign fighters , he added .
Another report said the house was being used by Uzbek militants fighting with the Taliban .
Hakimullah Mehsud has led the Pakistani Taliban since former leader Baitullah Mehsud was killed in a drone attack last summer .
The US has stepped up drone attacks in north - west Pakistan since a suicide bomber killed seven CIA agents across the border in Afghanistan last month .
Technically , neither stars nor angels belong to any particular religion .
But to the mind of Mr. Sutley , 65 , a veteran who has fought to keep religion out of public meetings and buildings , the symbolism was clear .
Image Sonoma County in California banned symbols like angels and stars from its buildings .
Credit ... Jeff Kan Lee / Press Democrat
“ For most people , a star atop a tree at this time of season represents the star of Bethlehem , which is a cult symbol , the cult being Christianity , ” he said , adding that the government should be neutral on religion .
Sonoma County officials conferred with their lawyers , and on Monday the acting county administrator , Chris Thomas , asked county departments to remove stars , angels or any other religious symbols “ so that we can celebrate the season yet not appear to endorse Christian or other religious doctrines . ”
Mr. Thomas cited a 1989 Supreme Court decision , Allegheny v. A.C.L.U. , which stated that while Christmas trees could be seen as secular , they could also be seen as religious if decorated with religious symbols .
All of which pleased Mr. Sutley , who said he had found about a half - dozen stars on other trees around the building in Santa Rosa .
He said he found none in the social services department , in which he found a religious placard during the holidays last year .
( It , too , was removed . )
For years , it 's been called the fuel of the future .
But I was n't expecting THIS vision just yet .
Hydrogen fuel cell technology was first embraced a few years back by carmakers eager to go green .
The big obstacle ?
Hydrogen at the pump was n't available , and was expensive to produce .
But one inventor hope to change that .
Hubbing through Hong Kong , Taras Wankewycz showed me a table - top hydrogen power station that can extract hydrogen from water to be used in fuel cells .
The Hydrofill uses electricity from the outlet ( as well as solar panels if you 're particularly green ) , and produces hydrogen that can then be stored in refillable cartridges .
The system can pump out 2.5 watts of power .
( And brushing Hindenburg nightmares aside , the company insists the technology is safe . )
No word yet on the cost .
Online chatter puts it at about $ 200 for the whole kit , but Taras himself is mum on giving an exact number because he 's still in talks with retailers .
He expects to have it on shelves at the end of the year .
Taras ' company , Singapore - based Horizon Fuel Cell Technologies , is also pushing out a range of products which can use the cartridges to power up smartphones , lights and other devices including a zippy RC hydrogen fuel cell car .
Taras is confident his invention is the very first step to a so - called hydrogen economy where hydrogen displaces oil as our chief source of energy .
One interesting upside — hydrogen is a compact and relatively light source of power … which is why the US military has been developing hydrogen - powered drones .
Of course , the obvious big upside of hydrogen is that it 's clean .
Hydrogen fuel cells produce only water vapor as a by - product .
But power is still needed to produce the stuff .

Pachauri refuses to step down
( 01:03 ) Report
March 16 – Chairman of the International Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , R K Pachauri , said he would not resign for making claims that the Himalayan glaciers would melt by the year 2035 , which he termed as “ one mistake ” .
Some climate researchers have criticized the IPCC in recent days for over - stating the speed of shrinking of Himalayan glaciers , whose seasonal thaw helps to supply water to many nations including India and China .
An ANI Report .
Maybe I look too deeply into things , but this sturgeon got me thinking about fate and odds .
For 100 years it has eluded capture , and just like that , it falls on Saturday , February 13 , 2010 .
Sometimes when I catch a fish , I can't help wonder where it was yesterday , or even an hour before I showed up .
Back in September , I was on the boat when a 600 - pound marlin came onboard .
We were in 6,000 feet of water , 85 miles offshore , and even though it was a big boat , in the overall scheme of things we were a tiny blip in the vast blue .
Do you realize the odds of the marlin being at the right depth , in the right spot at exactly the same time our trolling lines came through ?
If you think about it too hard , it might bake your noodle .

1 . The oldest known camel is Protylopus , appeared 40 - 50 million years ago ( Eocene ) in North America .
It had the size of a rabbit and lived in forests .
Later , camels spread to the savanna and increased their size .
In Oligocene , 35 million years ago , Poebrotherium had the size of a roe deer , but already resembled a camel .
Between 24 and 12 million years ago , various types of camels evolved .
Stenomylus was a gazelle like camel .
Alticamelus , which lived 10 to 2 million years ago , had a long neck similar to a giraffe ones .
Procamelus , just 1.2 m tall ( like a modern llama ) evolved in the Camelus genus ( to which modern camels belong ) .
Camelus passed from North America in Asia through Behringia 2 - 3 million years ago .
2 million years ago , the ancestors of lama and vicugna passed into the Andes coming from North America .
The last camel surviving the cradle of the camel evolution , North America , was Camelops hesternus , which disappeared 12 - 10,000 years ago together with the whole megafauna of North America ( mammoths , mastodons , giant sloth and saber toothed cats ) .
In 2005 , scientists discovered in Syria a fossil dromadery species twice the size of the modern species .
2 . There are 17 million camels worldwide .
90 % are dromedaries or Arabian camels ( with one hump ) and 75 % of the dromedaries are found in North / East Africa .
50 % of the world 's dromaderies are found in Sudan and Somalia , in semidesert areas .
15-20,000 bewildered dromaderies roam western and central Australia .
Wild dromedaries are long extinct ( the so - called wild dromedaries in some areas are just bewildered ) .
Wild Bactrian camels still survive in the Gobi desert ( between China and Mongolia ) , but they are endangered , the population being under 1,000 .
This wild Bactrian camels are not the race from which the domestic form comes .
That type is believed to be extinct now in the wild .
There is the concept that camel is a strictly desert animal .
Some say that camels are at the origin savanna animals , but wild camels were eliminated in the savanna by lions , against which they were defenseless , resisting in the desert due to the lack of big predators .
This is proved by the fact that dromedaries thrive better in less arid areas of their range : 3.6 individuals / square kilometer in Eastern Africa , 8.7 in Somalia , 1.7 in India , while their densities plummet to 0.4 in de deserts of west Africa , 0.14 in North Africa and Arabia and 0.08 in Sahara .
An interesting issue : the dromedary embryos have the bud for the second hump , but it remains undeveloped in this species .
3. Dromedary could have been domesticated in southwestern Arabia between 6,000 to 3,400 years ago , initially for their milk , while the larger and slower Bactrian camel ( with two humps ) in Northeastern Iran and southwestern Central Asia about 3,500 years ago .
From Arabia , dromedaries entered Somalia , 3,500 years ago , and by 500 BC they reached the Atlantic coast .
4,000 years ago , Bactrian camels were spread with the Indo - Iranian invasion from Mesopotamia to the Indus valley and Afghanistan and reached 3,700 - 3,200 years ago western Siberia and Ukraine .
2,300 years ago they were present in China .
In the ninth century BC , dromedaries were involved in warfare , to carry archers and transport heavy loads .
In 853 BC , the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III fought an army made of Syrians and Jews joined by the Arabian king Gindibu , with his army of 1,000 ... camel riders .
The Assyrian chivalry was spooked by the sight of the unusual beasts and ran away .
On the ruins of the city of Nineveh ( the ancient Assyrian capital ) , on a relief can be seen the chivalry of king Assurbanipal ( 669-627 BC ) fighting Arab camel riders .
The conquests of the Persian king Cyrus the Great ( 559 -530 ) were based on the logistical support of dromedaries .
In c.547 , he fought against king Croesus of Lydia ( modern western Turkey ) and employed these animals in what was to become one of the most famous stratagems of Antiquity : " He gathered all the dromedaries from his army train , took off their burdens and set cavalry men upon them .
Having thus furnished them , he ordered them to go in front of the rest of the army towards the horsemen of Croesus [... ] .
He did this because horses are afraid of dromedaries and can not endure to see or smell them . "
The Persian king Cambyses ( 530 - 522 BC ) introduced for the first time dromedaries in Egypt .
The Persian king Xerxes ( 485-465 BC ) was proud of his camels and their Arabian riders .
Domesticated camels were used through much of North Africa , and the Romans had a corps of camel warriors to patrol the edge of the desert .
Camels were also used by Romans for transportation , especially in the eastern provinces of Egypt , Arabia , Judaea , Syria , Cappadocia , and Mesopotamia .
The Persian camels , however , were not particularly suited to trading or travel over the Sahara ; rare journeys through the desert were still made on horse - drawn chariots .
Julius Caesar considered the greatest war catch after the defeat of the Numidian king Juba 's camels .
( Numidia is today northern Algeria ) .
In 363 AD , general Romanus asked as a war tribute to the dwellers of the city Lepcis Magna ( today Libya ) 4,000 camels , for the transport of his army .
Much later , the Muslims claimed that Allah first created the camel , and after that the mountains , the deserts , the plains , the rivers , the seas and the other living things .
Muhammad itself is said to have escaped from Mecca to Medina on the back of a camel .
The Muslim supersition says that the left fore limb of the dromedary belongs to Satan .
The Islamic conquest of North Africa brought Arabian camels , fit to long desert journeys carrying a great deal of cargo .
This boosted trade over the Sahara .
Arabs also introduced the dromadery to Europe : 1020 in Spain , 1059 in Sicily , and by 1136 they reached the Rhine , but later disappeared from Europe .
Still , a fossil species of camel , Camelus alutensis , related to modern species , inhabited Europe 2 million years ago .
The Bactrian Camels were the main burden beast on the Silk Road , linking China to Middle East .
Camel milk is the basic food of the Somali people , and many nomad tribes of the desert depend on the camels , like the Tuaregs of Sahara and Arab Bedouins , for transporting , milk , meat , wool ( 1.5 kg fro a dromadery , 4.5 kg fro a Bactrian camel ) and leather .
In Mongolia , the Bactrian Camels offer the hair from which the felt , the material for traditional yurt tents , is made .
Camel meat is taboo for the Non-Muslim populations of the Middle East and North Africa : Jews , Egyptian Copts ( Christians ) , Zoroastrians ( Iran ) , Mandaeans ( Iraq , Iran ) , Neo -Assyrians ( Syria , Iraq , Turkey ) , Ethiopians ( Christians ) , while for Muslims in Egypt and other countries of Near East , basturma ( salty camel meat ) is considered a delicacy .
In many areas , camels were used for paying the bride 's price .
4.Camels are gregarious and well adapted to their environment , the desert .
They can carry heavy cargoes , stand sand storms and large temperature differences .
Camels are called the " desert ships " , and they can swim when they encounter water .
The north Egyptian Lake Borollos has a depth varying between 20 cm and 2 m ( 0.6 to 6 ft ) .
It can not be crossed by boat or vehicles , and only camels can be used in this case .
A camel can resist 17 days without drinking under a scorching heat .
It was wrongly believed its resistance resided in the water kept in the hump or in a stomach pouch .
If it does n't drinking anything for 17 days , a camel can lose a third of its weight , without being affected .
But when it catches the opportunity , in can drink 104 liters of water at once ( the Bactrian Camel , which is larger , can drink up to 120 liters ) , in 7 - 8 minutes !
But three days later , there is no sign of water in its stomach or hump .
To resist the lack of water , the camels have several means of adjusting to the situation .
Their body temperature varies depending on the environment : in the cooler morning is of 34o C , whereas during the hot afternoon it goes up to 40 - 41o C. The kidneys ' function is regulated depending on the water availability : they produce 7 liters of urine when water is abundant , and 500 g when it does not drink for days .
When thirsty , transpiration is reduced towards zero .
Camel 's feces are dry ( and used for fueling fire when drought ) compared to another ruminants ( just 40 - 60 % water ) : a dromadery loses 2.5 kg liters of water daily though feces while a cattle 20 - 40 liters !
Camel feces are consumed by insects and gerbils ( desert rats ) ( which recover this way a part of the water ) .
A camel 's thick coat maintains an insulating layer , and it also reflects sunlight .
A shorn camel has to sweat 50 % more to avoid overheating .
It also insulates them from the intense heat that radiates from hot desert sand .
Their long legs help by keeping them further from the hot ground .
This ability to fluctuate body temperature and the efficiency of their sweating allows them to preserve about five liters of water a day .
The rest of the camel 's body is adapted to the conditions in the desert : the hoof is perfect for the soft , instable sand , and the digits are wrapped in an elastic tissue that isolates the foot from the hot ground ( while impeding deepening in the sand ) ; the thick eyebrows and eyelashes protect the eyes against sand and sun ; the nostrils are moved by muscles that can close them hermetically at will and the ears are filled of hairs that impede the sand to get in .
This helps them retain expiration water and protects the animal during the sand storms .
Horny layers on the chest , elbows and knees protect the camels against the scorching heat and insect .
Camels avoid stony deserts , as the gravel harms their feet .
Another issue : camels never run , they just speed up , in their typical gait of moving simultaneously the feet of the same part of the body .
Running would raise transpiration .
They can make daily 160 km ( 100 miles ) with a speed of 16 km ( 10 mi ) / hour .
In caravans , they make 30 - 40 km ( 18 - 25 mi ) per day , with an average age of 3.5 km ( 2.2 mi ) per hour .
The maximum speed achieved by a camel is 25 km ( 16 mi ) per hour , but they get tired quickly .
Dromadery inhabits just warm deserts , as it cannot stand temperatures under 0o C , while the Bactrian camel resist to - 25 o C during the winter .
5 . The camels ' humps are reservoirs of fatty tissue .
A full hump has 10 - 15 kg ( 22 - 33 pounds ) .
When this fat is metabolized , it is not only a source of energy , but yields through reaction with oxygen from the air 1,111 g of water per 1,000 g of fat converted .
After drinking , water is spread uniformly in the body and it is lost gradually , about 100 liters in 17 days .
The average water content of the camel 's body is low : while the cow 's tissues contain 80 % water , the donkey 's ( another desert animal ) 65 % , and the camel 's just 50 % .
A camel crossing a desert loses in 24 hours only 2 % of its bodyweight , while the donkey at least 8 % .
Curiously , wild Bactrian Camels from the Gobi desert ( China - Mongolia ) can drink saltwater .
Camels can withstand at least 20 - 25 % weight loss due to sweating ( most mammals can only withstand about 3 - 4 % dehydration before cardiac failure due to the thickened blood ) .
But how can camels drink over 100 liters of water at once without serious consequences ?
This is the same as a human drinking 20 liters of water in 10 minutes .
This would induce water intoxication in us .
The red blood cells of the camels ( and lamas , too ) have an ovoid shape and the property of swelling round , till achieving a double volume and after that gradually release the stored liquid .
The red blood cells are extremely small and numerous ( 132.5 million per cubic millimeter ) .
In their native lands , camels feel by far the presence of a fountain or river .
They never forget the place where they have found water .
7. Camels walk 3 km ( 1.8 mi ) per day looking for food , on average 3 hours , and disperse when food is scarce .
They require 10 - 20 kg ( 22 - 44 pounds ) of fresh food daily ( or 5 - 10 kg ( 12 - 24 pounds ) of dry food ) , depending on the animal 's size .
If working , the food requirement is of 30 - 50 kg ( 70 - 110 pounds ) per day .
They spend 8 - 12 hours per day eating .
Camels eat from small grasses and herbs ( Convulvulaceae , Plantaginaceae ) to bushes , trees ( Acacia ) ( camels can pick up leaves at heights of up to 3.5 m ( 12 ft ) ) , and plants growing on salty lands ( Chenopodiaceae ) and , as a camel 's mouth is extremely tough and pain resistant , they can eat easily thorny desert plants , avoided by other animals .
Some of their spines so hard they can penetrate through a shoe 's sole .
Camels literally can survive on plant wastes , like an old twig basket or a mat .
Bactrian camels eat wild garlic , saxaul ( Haloxylon ) , and poplar .
Camels can chew gazelle bones ( for completing minerals ) , and even fish waists ( especially in Southern Arabia , where fish is abundant ) .
If food has enough moisture , camels can withstand a month without drinking water .
A density of 2 - 3 kg ( 4.5 - 6.5 pounds ) of food per hectar means good feeding condition for the camel ; 1 - 1.5 kg ( 2.2 - 3.5 pounds ) per hectar represent poor feeding conditions .
8. Camels mate all year round , but they have a favorable period when vegetation is lush .
The male is extremely aggressive during mating period ( he can bite by the foot his rider ) .
During the arousal , he shows off his teeth , salivate abundantly , and the epidermic glands of the neck and shoulders are extremely active .
He urinates frequently , and keeps the head and the fore limbs as raised as possible .
Males possess an organ called dulla , like a pink bladder , normally harbored in the throat .
During the rut period , the male throws the dulla out of his mouth in a display dominance .
Dulla hangs like an inflated pink tongue and at the same time the male burbles , a disgusting sight to most humans .
Male combats for females can be deadly , due to the sharp teeth and to the mouth with the largest opening amongst all ruminants ( the male can grab in the mouth the head or the neck of his adversary ) .
The Jacobson organ from the roof of the mouth is employed by the male ( like in many mammals , a behavior called flehmen ) to assess through urine hormones if the female is receptive ( ovulating ) or not .
If the female is receptive , mating occurs on the place .
Camels mate laying on the ground !
( in decubitus position ) .
Camels and lamas are the only mammals employing this position for mating .
Mating lasts 10 - 20 minutes , and is extremely noisy , the male making a call like " duloo " .
The young at birth has 25 - 50 kg ( 60 - 120 pounds ) and it is 1.2 m ( 4 ft ) tall .
The female has 4 tits , and produces 15 liters of milk daily ( 87 % water , 3.5 - 5 % fats and lactose ( milk sugar ) , 3 - 4 % proteins .
Weaning occurs when the young is one year old ( rarely at 3 years old ) , but people force it at 7 - 10 months , to use the mother 's milk .
Camels are sexually mature at about 4 years old .
Females reproduce till 30 years old , delivering one offspring at two years , and even more if food is abundant .
The dromedary and the Bactrian camel can hybridize , and the hybrid is fertile .
The hybrid has a high fore hump and a tiny , undeveloped rear hump .
The mix mating is dangerous .
The male of the Bactrian camel has short feet , and loses balance on the dromedary female , falling .
The dromedary male can smash the second hump of the Bactrian female .
That 's more : even hybrids between camels and llamas , called camas , have been obtained .
They are born via artificial insemination due to the huge size differences of the animals which impedes natural mating .
Camas usually lack the hump , have the power , short ears and long Tails of a camel but the cloven hooves and wool of a llama .
9 . Camels are gregarious .
Free roaming camels form groups of 6 - 30 individuals , made of one male , several females with offspring .
The rest of the males are solitary of form bachelor groups .
There may be groups of females lacking males .
10 .
One of the worst habits of the camels is spitting .
A distressed camel will spit a fetid stream coming from its first stomach chamber , especially when angry , frustrated or spooked , a real chemical bomb .
Camels can spit also as a method of establishing hierarchy , especially during the feeding time as a way of disciplining lower - ranked individuals in the herd .
Females also spit to chase away insistent males .
This second type of spit is less smelly .
All camels - including the South Americans llamas , guanaco , vicuna , and alpaca - spit .
Game on .

This blog is a
record of what I eat for dinner every day , and an experiment to see if I can shame myself into becoming a better cook .
Or even just someone who sets foot in the kitchen once in a while .
When you buy eggs in America , the carton usually carries this warning message :
SAFE HANDLING INSTRUCTIONS :
To prevent illness from bacteria : Keep eggs refrigerated , cook eggs until yolks are firm , and cook foods containing eggs thoroughly .
I always wondered why .
I eat raw eggs over rice almost every day when I 'm visiting my parents in Tokyo , and then I fly back to California and promptly switch to scrambled eggs because of this fear that I 'll get sick from eating raw eggs in America .
Tamago kake gohan
Scoop some rice into a small bowl , and dig a hole in the middle .
Crack an egg into the hole .
Add a dash of soy sauce .
Mix everything together .
Optional : Add furikake , pickles , sour plum , fried fish , cod roe .

There 's a 1 in 20,000 chance that an egg might contain salmonella , according to the American Egg Board .
" The risk of getting a foodborne illness from eggs is very low , but the nutrients in eggs are also a good growth medium for bacteria , " says Elisa Malobert , director of egg product marketing at the AEB .
" To eliminate risk , we do not recommend the consumption of raw or lightly cooked eggs . "
It does n't matter , she adds , whether you 're eating organic and free range $ 8 - a - dozen farm fresh eggs or super - processed $ 2 eggs .
( Egg " grades " are determined by appearance and yolk - to - white ratio , not content quality . )
Hens are n't affected by salmonella , so they can carry it and pass it onto egg yolk without anyone knowing .
And if that does n't happen , salmonella could enter through the shell after the bloom — the natural coating that protects the inside — is washed off after collection .
Egg shells are super porous ; there are anywhere from 7 -17,000 pores on a single shell .
My brother got salmonella once from eating raw chicken at a high - end yakitori restaurant in Tokyo .
I know , I know .
Raw eggs are debatable , but nobody in their right minds eats raw chicken !
This might imply that the Japanese are less concerned about food safety , but on the other hand , most restaurants there will never wrap up food to go precisely because food can go bad once it's no longer fresh and they do n't want to be liable for that .
If I can guess at any reason why the Japanese are more inclined to eat raw everything , it might be because the culture inherently appreciates and celebrates the purity of unprocessed , uncooked flavors .
I do n't have any numbers for the incidence of salmonella in Japanese eggs , but I 'm assuming that , like American eggs , it 's not that common .
Raw eggs are a great source of Vitamins B12 and D ; they also have tons of protein .
If you 're willing to see past the USDA warning and try it , I highly recommend making tamago kake gohan — raw egg on rice — for breakfast .
Every installment of Taste Test will explore recipes , the science , and some history behind a specific food item .
BLANTYRE , Malawi  Tiwonge Chimbalanga looked like a man but said he was a woman .
He helped with the cooking and dressed in feminine wraparound skirts .
Steven Monjeza was a quiet , sullen man often intoxicated on sorghum beer .
He said he had never been happy until he finally met the right companion .
The two celebrated their engagement  their chinkhoswe , in the Chichewa language  with a party at a lodge here in Malawi ’s commercial capital .
It began cheerfully enough .
But later , gawkers pushed their way inside , some shouting taunts , others just staring through despising eyes .
Then the electricity failed .
The band stopped playing , and the bride collapsed in tears .
Someone had tipped off a newspaper , The Nation , for this betrothal was extraordinary in a conservative African nation .
The resulting front - page story began with the phrase “ gay lovebirds , ” adding that the chinkhoswe was “ the first recorded public activity for homosexuals in the country . ”
Readers were reminded that homosexuality carried a sentence of 5 to 14 years in prison .
Two days later , on Dec. 28 , the couple was arrested on charges of unnatural acts and gross indecency , and they have been in jail since , denied bail ostensibly to keep them safe .
Sometimes I wonder if the American Family Association ’s Bryan Fischer ultimate goal is just to make his organization look foolish by writing pieces like this one claiming that the death of a trainer at Sea World yesterday was the result of a failure to abide by Biblical mandates .
Fischer cites this article noting that the whale in question was considered particularly dangerous and had a history of violent incidents to claim that the death can be chalked up to “ animal rights insanity and to the ongoing failure of the West to take counsel on practical matters from the Scripture :
What about the term “ killer whale ” do SeaWorld officials not understand ?
If the counsel of the Judeo - Christian tradition had been followed , Tillikum would have been put out of everyone ’s misery back in 1991 and would not have had the opportunity to claim two more human lives .
Says the ancient civil code of Israel , “ When an ox gores a man or woman to death , the ox shall be stoned , and its flesh shall not be eaten , but the owner shall not be liable . ” ( Exodus 21:28 )
So , your animal kills somebody , your moral responsibility is to put that animal to death .
You have no moral culpability in the death , because you did n’t know the animal was going to go postal on somebody .
But , the Scripture soberly warns , if one of your animals kills a second time because you did n’t kill it after it claimed its first human victim , this time you die right along with your animal .
To use the example from Exodus , if your ox kills a second time , “ the ox shall be stoned , and its owner also shall be put to death . ”
( Exodus 21:29 )
If I were the family of Dawn Brancheau , I ’d sue the pants off SeaWorld for allowing this killer whale to kill again after they were well aware of its violent history .
If Fischer thinks we ought to be following Scripture here , then why is n’t he calling for Sea World ’s owners to be put to death instead of merely sued ?
After all , he ’s the one who cites Exodus 21:29 which mandate a death sentence for the animal ’s owners .
One rule of budget reporting is to watch what the politicians are spending this year , not the frugality they promise down the road .
By that measure , the budget that President Obama released yesterday for fiscal 2011 is one of the greatest spend - while - you - can documents in American history .
We now know why the White House leaked word of a three - year spending freeze on a few domestic accounts before this extravaganza was released .
No one would have noticed such a slushy promise amid this glacier of spending .
The budget reveals that overall federal outlays will reach $ 3.72 trillion in fiscal 2010 , and keep rising to $ 3.834 trillion in 2011 .
As a share of the economy , outlays will reach a post - World War II record of 25.4 % this year .
This is a new modern spending landmark , up from 21 % of GDP as recently as fiscal 2008 , and far above the 40 - year average of 20.7 % .
In the " out years " in mid-decade , the White House promises that spending will fall all the way back to 23 % of GDP .
Even if you choose to believe such a political prediction , that still means Mr. Obama is proposing a new and more or less permanently higher plateau of federal spending .
And here you thought the " stimulus " was supposed to be temporary .
This is also before the baby boomers retire and send Medicare and Social Security accounts soaring .
REPUBLICANS VS . THE MILITARY ….
For much of the Bush - Cheney era , Republican leaders characterized themselves as more than just allies of the military establishment , but also deferential to the military ’s judgment on national security matters .
“ Listen to the commanders on the ground ” became a common adage in GOP circles .
But over the last year or so , it ’s become increasingly apparent that it ’s President Obama and his team that are aligned with the military establishment , leaving Republicans at odds with the brass they used to revere .
CNN ’s John King asked Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) an interesting question yesterday about trying terrorist suspects in criminal courts , as has long been in the norm .
KING : If you ask the White House about this , it highlights — they say it ’s not just the president , it ’s not just Attorney General Holder , that General David Petraeus says he believes a public trial at a federal courthouse is the best way to do it so that it ’s not an al Qaeda recruiting tool .
That Secretary Gates , a holdover from the Bush administration at the Defense Department , also they believes a trial in the federal court system is preferable to a closed trial in the military commission .
And that the CIA operatives leading the fight against these guys in Yemen , in Somalia , in Afghanistan and elsewhere , also believe that if you did it in a closed setting in a military commission it would be a powerful recruiting tool .
If General Petraeus , Secretary Gates , and the intelligence leaders say , do it in court , why do you say that ’s a bad idea ?
MCCONNELL : I simply disagree and so do the American people .
Keep in mind , it was n’t too terribly long ago that Democratic politicians simply were n’t supposed to say that Petraeus , Gates , and intelligence leaders were wrong about national security matters .
Indeed , for Dems to say that they knew better than Petraeus , Gates , and intelligence leaders — that their judgment was superior to military leaders ’ — was grounds for mockery , if not condemnation .
And yet , Obama has spent a year following the guidance of military leaders , and Republicans have spent a year breaking with the judgment of the military establishment .
It ’s a fascinating dynamic .
On everything from civilian trials to Gitmo to torture , we have two distinct groups — GOP leaders , the Cheneys , Limbaugh , and conservative activists on one side ; President Obama , Gen. Petraeus , Secretary Gates , Colin Powell , Adm. Mullen , Adm. Blair , and Gen. Jones on the other .
To be sure , endorsements do not necessarily reflect merit .
Obama ’s position on any national security issue can enjoy support from the likes of Petraeus , Powell , Mullen , et al , but all of them can be collectively wrong .
It ’s lazy to think the president is right just because David Petraeus and Colin Powell say he ’s right .
But that ’s not the point here .
McConnell and his Republicans cohorts are reluctant to admit it , and political insiders have been slow to acknowledge it , but what we ’re witnessing is exceedingly rare — the Republican establishment openly rejecting the judgment of the military establishment .
Imagine if the situations were reversed , and Democratic lawmakers were on the opposite side of the Commander in Chief , the Centcom commander , the Republican Defense Secretary , and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs — in the midst of two wars .
Might we hear a little more talk about why Dems were at odds with the U.S. military establishment ?
And if so , why is n’t the GOP break with the military a bigger deal ?

This article is more than 10 years old
The Chelsea captain John Terry was involved in an accident which resulted in one of the club 's security staff suffering a broken leg after the Champions League defeat to Internazionale last night .
Sky have reported that Terry was later given a breath test by the police .
The Metropolitan Police confirmed a collision and reported the victim suffering a broken leg .
" Police were called at 23.13 pm on Tuesday , 16 March to Stamford Bridge , Fulham Road , SW6 to reports of a collision between a car and a pedestrian , " said the police .
" A 35 - year - old man suffering a broken leg was taken by ambulance to a west London hospital where he is in a stable condition .
The 4x4 car did not stop at the scene .
Enquiries into the incident continue . "
The players ' spokesman , Phil Hall said : " John was coming out of the car park and he was surrounded by paparazzi photographers .
He was not driving very fast and a security guard waved him through .
" There were some fans there and they were telling the photographers to get out of the way .
John had no idea that he had hit the man , until he received a phone call from the club an hour or so later .
John volunteered to go to the police station , and was breathalised in his home at 1.30 am . "
Terry was not aware of the injury at the time but spoke to the police and the member of staff when he was made aware of the incident .
A Chelsea spokesman said : " We can confirm there was an unfortunate accident as John Terry left Stamford Bridge last night .
" When driving out of the stadium at approximately 1 - 2 mph in a queue of traffic exiting the ground , his car was surrounded by photographers and fans .
" In the melee that ensued a member of Chelsea 's security staff was knocked to the ground , making contact with the car .
He suffered a badly bruised leg .
" John was aware at the time that there was a lot of contact with his car during the incident , but not that anyone was injured as a result .
" Upon hearing of the injury , John spoke to the police .
He has also been in contact with the staff member to check on his welfare . "
The update will only affect older machines Sony has said it will disable a feature on its PlayStation 3 ( PS3 ) console in a move some consider to be a pre-emptive strike to guard against games piracy .
The firm said that an update to be released on 1 April will prevent people using a function that allows them to install alternative operating systems .
Sony said it had made the decision to address " security concerns " .
The move comes after a US hacker released the first code that he claimed bypassed the PS3's security systems .
The exploit , released by hacker Geohot , used a machine running a variant of the Linux operating system .
One gamer , commenting on Sony 's blog post , said : " The funny thing about this is that users that legally enjoy this feature will suffer its loss and the hackers will find some way to have the update plus the feature . "
Another said : " This is so stupid .
I spent $ 500 on this system to be able to use whatever features it came with .
Preventing hackers is one thing , but taking away a feature that I paid for is another . "
Geohot , also known as George Hotz , gained notoriety for unlocking Apple 's iPhone as a teenager .
He has said that he will work on a method to bypass the new update and allow gamers to retain the ability to install other operating systems .
" This is about more than this feature right now , " he wrote in his blog .
" It 's about whether these companies have the right to take away advertised features from a product you purchased .
" Imagine if an exploit were found in Safari on the iPhone , but instead of fixing it , Apple decides to pull web browsing altogether . "
Playback problem
The " Other OS " feature on the PS3 allows gamers to install a version of Linux on their machines .
The feature has been used by researchers who want to tap into the PS3's processing power .
The latest update will be rolled out on 1 April , making many gamers think it was an April Fool 's joke .
Sony has said the update is optional , but those people that do not install it will no longer have access to features , such as its online games network and the ability to playback certain games or Blu-ray DVDs that require the most up - to - date firmware .
A Sony spokesperson said that gamers would have to " accept " the update before it begins to install .
The update only affects older machines .
The newer " slim " models of the PS3 do not have the " other OS " feature .
Sony will not say how many people it believes will be affected by the update , although the figure is thought to be relatively small .
The firm advised people using a machine running another operating system who want to install the update to back up any data on their machine .
The firm has sold more than 33 million consoles worldwide .

London , England ( CNN ) -- Bindi Dupouy , an Australian living in Paris , and her French husband , just had their first child , a son born in the country .
Dupouy , a 28 - year - old lawyer , got almost five months paid maternity leave from her company for the birth .
She can take another seven months off beyond that -- a year total -- unpaid , if she wants , with her job guaranteed under French law .
When her son Louis was born , healthy and by way of a normal delivery , she got to stay in her local French hospital , around the corner from where she lives , for five full days , to rest .
Welcome to France , voted the best place in the world to live for the fifth year in a row by International Living magazine , which has been analyzing data and publishing its annual Quality of Life Index for 30 years .
One of the reasons France keeps winning the ranking is its world - class health care system , which Dupouy just experienced first - hand .
" They treat expecting mums like treasures here , " Dupouy told CNN from her Paris apartment .
" They take really good care of you .
The health care system is just amazing . "
She said she would n't have gotten the same maternity leave -- or care -- back home in Australia .
At her job , Dupouy also gets seven weeks paid vacation a year , although it 's her first job as an attorney since graduating with a law degree in Australia .
She does n't think twice about taking the Metro across town -- for just $ 1.37 a ride -- to visit a friend .
Or she picks up a rental bike at one of the many computerized bike hire racks in town to get around .
France scores high marks across the board in the survey , which is done every January , from health care ( 100 points ) to infrastructure ( 92 points ) to safety and risk ( 100 points ) .
" No surprise , " said the magazine in its report .
" Its ( France 's ) tiresome bureaucracy and high taxes are outweighed by an unsurpassable quality of life , including the world 's best health care . "
" The bread , the cheese , the wine , " Dan Prescher , special projects editor at the magazine , told CNN , when asked why France just keeps on winning year after year .
" That weighs pretty heavily in quality of life . "
Prescher admitted the magazine had an " American bias " since the vast majority of its subscribers are Americans spending in U.S. dollars .
" France is one of those golden places in the American consciousness , " he said .
The annual index ranks 194 countries and comprises nine categories : Cost of Living , Culture and Leisure , Economy , Environment , Freedom , Health , Infrastructure , Safety and Risk and Climate .
The Index analyzes data from several official sources , including government web sites , the World Health Organization , and several media sources .
Following France in the top ten are Australia , Switzerland , Germany , New Zealand , Luxembourg , the U.S. , Belgium , Canada and Italy , in that order .
" France always nets high scores in most categories , " the magazine said .
" But you do n't need number - crunchers to tell you its ' bon vivant ' lifestyle is special .
It 's impossible to enumerate the joy of lingering for hours over dinner and a bottle of red wine in a Parisian brasserie .
Or strolling beside the Seine on a spring morning , poking through the book vendors ' wares . "
Other European countries slipped a little in the magazine 's rankings this year , with the exception of France and Germany .
Britain dropped to 25th place from last year 's ranking of 20 .
Variety is also seen as a major factor in France 's appeal , with the survey noting that " romantic Paris offers the best of everything , but services do n't fall away in Alsace 's wine villages , in wild and lovely Corsica , in lavender - scented Provence . "
The United States dropped from third to seventh place in this year 's rankings , largely because of the grinding economic crisis last year .
" Sustaining the American dream has escalated out of the reach of many , " the magazine said .
" The depression hit the United States and Great Britain hard , " Prescher told CNN .
" That weighs down the ratings . "
Of course , France too has its problems .
The country suffers from high youth unemployment , particularly among the disaffected young people who live in its equivalent of the projects , known as les banlieues .
Late last year , the French government opened a national discussion about national identity , which has evolved into debates over whether immigrants , and particularly Muslim immigrants , are French enough .
The country has the highest Muslim population of any European country , with an estimated six million living in the country .
But for the most part , French people enjoy a good lifestyle .
International Living says that during their large chunk of leisure time , the French enjoy visiting the country 's many beaches and Alpine ski resorts .
Dupouy -- like more famous expats Ernest Hemingway and Julia Child before her -- agrees .
She and her husband vacation every year at the seaside near Bordeaux , in the southwest corner of France , where her husband 's family has a home .
They also go skiing in the Alps during the winter .
She says that even if she and her husband decide to leave France for awhile during their lives , they 'll always come back -- every year , probably .
" The culture , the food , the family , it 's all just really nice here , " said Dupouy .

There were a lot of TV stars at FOX's TCA ( Television Critics Association ) party this week , and wherever you looked , you could see the likes of Katee Sackhoff ( 24 ) , Jane Lynch ( Glee ) and Tim Roth ( Lie to Me ) speaking to the press .
But probably the largest group of press ( myself included ) was gathered around a guy who most TV viewers would n't recognize - J.J. Abrams .
Having conquered TV and film and with a ton of projects in development , Abrams has become a huge figure in Hollywood , and there is always plenty to talk to him about .
Abrams was at FOX 's party to support his series Fringe , and spoke about that show 's plotlines and it's ratings struggles on Thursday nights .
Abrams was also asked about the impending end of Lost , which he co-created -- before moving on to other projects -- and also discussed his new NBC pilot , Undercovers , which brings the Alias creator back to the spy world .
To see what Abrams had to say at this same event about the next Star Trek film , check out IGN Movies [ Click Here ]
J.J.+Abrams+at+FOX's + Winter +2010 +TCA + party
There is some pretty cool stuff that 's going to happen , by the end of the second season .
Then again , Jeff [ Pinkner ] and Joel [ Wyman ] , who are really running the show , have threatened to kill me , if I reveal anything .
I will say that the plot that they had , at the beginning of this season , that we all talked about with Akiva Goldsman as well , will be coming to a really cool conclusion .
I 'm very excited about it .
There is a shot of that , for sure .
I do n't want to say for sure , either way , but it 's definitely a possibility .
We start shooting on Monday .
So , we 're farther ahead than I even feel like we are .
No .
It 's a romantic show that 's a comedy - drama about a couple who are spies .
No .
Jack Bender has really been the guy on that show as the directing producer , so it would be wrong for me to come in and be like , " Oh , move over , I 'm going to direct .
" I know , but it would somehow be spoiling all this amazing work that he 's done .
The fact is that he 's been living in Hawaii with the cast , so he 's going to do the last episode .
I 'm doing the pilot of Undercovers , yeah .
They were a welcoming place when they bought the pilot , so I 'm thrilled to be there .
There 's suddenly more hours available per week , which is good , but it does n't make it any more or less welcoming .
The people at NBC have been extraordinarily nice and really supportive of this pilot .
It 's the beginning of a relationship .
It 's a weird thing .
When you do a pilot with a new network , or even with a familiar one , with actors you have n't worked with , it 's always a leap of faith .
You 're rushing into a marriage with people that you believe will be great partners , but you just do n't know for sure .
All you can do is , day - to - day , go " How is it ?
This feels good .
That bugs me , so let 's talk about it . "
It 's literally like being in a relationship .
So far , we 've had no fights .
We 're still in the honeymoon period .
If it 's not in the next 24 hours , I 'm going to kill myself .
[ Editor 's Note : Luckily , Abrams did n't have to kill himself , as the female lead for Undercovers was announced the very next day [ Click Here ]
One of the fun things about this new series that we 're doing is that it 's much more fun , light and escapist than heavy , intricately complex drama .
For me , the idea of grappling with anything that feels like real terrorism , that 's not what I want to be watching , at the moment .
I 'm not saying that it 's not something that I would n't watch , if someone else did it , but it 's something that I 'm not focusing on right now .
In terms of what people have gone to see at the movies , at least , it 's been harder to do stories that are war - centric .
But , one of the great things that TV allows is a chance , not only to learn the news and what 's happening right now , anywhere in the world , but also escape from that .
Getting a dose of wish fulfillment , escapist fun is something that , as a fan of television , I can understand , now more than ever .

First there 's the majestic beat by 40 and Swizzy , then there 's Drake 's uniquely female - friendly verse .
Throw in Tip 's straitjacket flow and Mary J Blige 's ear - grabbing vocals and you 've got the makings of a hip - hop anthem .
46 of 50 Celph Titled & Buckwild - " F- ckmaster Sex " No Sleep Recordings Nineteen Ninety Now is mostly Celph Titled and Buckwild tapping into the sepia - toned past of hip - hop when smooth basslines and over - the - top boasts ruled the menu .
That jewel spawned some fine cuts , including the clever , laugh - out - loud hilarity that unfolds throughout " Funkmaster Sex . "

42 of 50 Canibus - " Ripperland " ( Feat . Psalm One )
Well , excuse me for including such an ominous track on 2010 's best rap songs list .
It 's worth the inclusion because Psalm One likens herself to an oasis in the wilderness .
' Bis adds to the sinister vibe with a visual portrait of " little green men with big eyes . "
41 of 50 The Roots - " Dear God 2.0 " Def Jam Taken from The Roots ’ How I Got Over , “ Dear God 2.0 ″ is a perfectly layered track with an otherworldly , futuristic vibe to it .

33 of 50 Eminem - " Despicable " Freestyle Redferns / Getty Images
There 's a hip - hop sport called " Let 's see who can out - rap Drake on his own beat . "
Royce da 5 ' 9 " and Consequence played this game in 2010 , but Eminem plays it better than most .
It was n't just " Over " that got bent out of recognition .
It was also Lloyd Banks ' " Beamer , Benz or Bentley . "
Nothing personal , guys .
Just Shady business as usual .
Listen

31 of 50 Reflection Eternal - " Ballad of the Black Gold " WireImage / Getty Images Talib Kweli excels at weaving rhymes around rhythmic roomy tracks with bursts of soul and crisp percussion , and here , he offers some of the finest lyrics on Revolutions Per Minute as a narrator .
Inspired by a 2008 visit to Nigeria , the Brooklyn MC chronicles the struggles of the African oil power that goes back to the colonial days .
30 of 50 Black Milk - " Black and Brown " ( Feat .
Danny Brown )
Remember when Black Milk was the hottest young producer in the game ?
Now that Boi -1da has snatched that title from him , Black needed a bold move to rise above the fray .
He found it in the form of a solid third solo outing , which produced this rousing collaboration with fellow Motor City native Danny Brown .
29 of 50 Fat Tony - " Luv It Mayne "
You can't make an omelet without breaking eggs .
And you can't talk about southern rappers without alluding to wood grain and candypaint .
Unless you 're talking about Fat Tony .
You wo n’t hear Tony bragging non-stop about his chain , on his debut LP RABDARGAB .
No candy - painted Cadillacs here ; he prefers skateboards .
What you ’ll hear on " Luv It Mayne " and other RABDARGAB standouts , though , is a student of the game who has a knack for making even the mundane sound profoundly exciting .

Dig in slowly .
Son is nasty .
26 of 50 PackFM - " Nasty " QN5 Music PackFM hates rappers .
He made an entire album deriding negative trends in the genre .
" Nasty " provides a brief moment of brilliance where he 's not calling out rappers .
Instead , he puts himself in centerstage and proceeds to make a case for his own greatness .
25 of 50 Freddie Gibbs - " The Ghetto " Freddie Gibbs ' fascination with the harsh realities of street life may put off those who do n't live it .
And the music here , in its gorgeous monstrosity , wo n't change that .
But it will make you respect him as an MC .
24 of 50 Joell Ortiz - " Sing Like Bilal " ( Feat .
Sheek Louch ) Joell Ortiz was relatively quiet in 2010 .
Yet , his lone contribution , Farewell Summer , spawned a flurry of hits that kept him relevant all year .
Standing tall is the Premier - laced " Sing Like Bilal " which comically pits guns as a synonym for lungs , a concept previously visited by fellow Slaughterhouse members Royce da 5 ' 9 " and Crooked I on " Gun Harmonizing . "
23 of 50 Blu - " Keep It Going " ( Feat .
U - God ) " Keep It Going " is a throwback cut reminiscent of Eric B & Rakim 's " Do n't Sweat The Technique . "
It 's unfortunate that this one slipped under the radar because it knocks harder than feds at a kingpin 's door .
22 of 50 L.E.P. Bogus Boys - " Chicago Ni--az " L.E.P. stands for Lower End Professionals , a hat tip to the lower South Side of Chicago where the L.E.P. Bogus Boys originated .
" Chicago " is a hard - hitting anthem that paints a vivid portrait of inner-city frustration .
If the Boys sound genuinely shock - free , it 's because they 've been on the receiving end of the misgivings .
Larro , an original member of L.E.P. , was gunned down in the Windy City in 2007 .
21 of 50 Yelawolf – " I Wish " ( Feat . Raekwon ) Raekwon plays Obi Wan Kenobi to Yelawolf 's Luke Skywalker on " I Wish , " taken from the latter 's Trunk Muzik mixtape - turned - album .

On " Walk Alone " the Roots lead MC proceeds to split the difference between singing and speaking to great effect .
19 of 50 Co$$ - " Fake Kings "
It 's nothing new for rappers to refer to themselves as royalty .
It 's also commonplace for rappers to chastise peers who peddle materialism , as Co$$ does on " Fake Kings . "
But there 's something fresh and exciting about the way he does it .
He stuffs every crevice in the Numonics beat with a breathless flow giving you the impression that he could go on for days .
18 of 50 Ghostface Killah - " Troublemakers " ( Feat .

15 of 50 Danny Brown - " Greatest Rapper Ever " Hybrid Music " Greatest Rapper Ever " is the eye - popping opening track on Danny Brown 's The Hybrid CD .

Brown has a way of making the familiar sound stunningly refreshing .

Jean Grae , Jay Electronica , Joell Ortiz )
If you slept on Ski Beatz 's 24 Hour Karate School , you probably missed out on some of the best production of 2010 , including the steely drums on " Prowler 2 . " Jean Grae and Jay Electronica take turns doing the beat justice with memorable punchlines .
13 of 50 Reks - " Pray for You ( The Homicide Letter ) " Reks is trying to stay awake .

Crooked politicians , small - minded rappers , and Waka Flocka Flame .

12 of 50 B.o.B. - " Airplanes II " ( Feat . Eminem ) " Airplanes II " finds Bobby Ray Simmons and Marshall Mathers envisioning life without music .
This gem from B.o.B.'s solid debut excels mostly because Marshall still does n't know how to waste a good beat .
11 of 50 Big Boi - " Lookin ' 4 Ya " ( Feat .
Andre 3000 & Sleepy Brown )
Big Boi starts the show by offering to " give you one to grow on . "
He 's a liar , because " Lookin ' 4 Ya " is an instant banger .
Andre 3000 complements his partner - in - rhyme with a light - hearted verse about doing it in IKEA 's showroom , while Sleepy Brown sets the mood with a catchy hook .
It 's truly a shame that this remarkable collaboration failed to make Sir Lucious Left Foot because of silly label politics .
10 of 50 Tyler the Creator - " Bastard " Odd Future Tyler the Creator , leader of the L.A. outfit OFWGKTA , kicks off his rap career by spewing venom at everyone and everything who 's ever disappointed him : bloggers , the school system , his father , shallow rappers .
That last group seems to inspire much of the vitriol on " Bastard " and its accompanying mixtape .
Or as he simply puts it : " I created O.F. because I felt way more talented than 40 - year old rappers talking about Gucci . "
09 of 50 J. Cole - " Premeditated Murder " Roc Nation
You could hear minds getting blowed from coast to coast when Hollywood Cole unleashed his breakout mixtape , The Warm Up in 2009 .
He turned heads again when he followed it up with one of 2010 's best mixtapes , Friday Night Lights .
" Premeditated Murder , " a standout from the latter , stands as evidence that Cole has n't lost the spark that propelled him into hip - hop consciousness .
08 of 50 Nas & Damian Marley - " As We Enter " UMG Nas spews a torrent of fiery rhymes on this triumphant buzz single from Distant Relatives , while Damian Marley rides shotgun .
07 of 50 Shad - " Rose Garden " From one of 2010 's best hip - hop albums comes this catchy , slaphappy dose of conscious rap sentiment .
06 of 50 Freddie Gibbs - " National Anthem ( F - - k the World ) " Decon
No other song exemplifies Gibbs ' raw emotion better than " National Anthem . "
Listen to how he infuses his rhymes so that each line starts where the previous one ends and then gradually switches into double - time mode .
The urgency of his flow gives each verse the sense of a grand epiphany .
As subtle as a shot to the dome .

2010 marks the centenary of a number of great events , including the first air to ground radio message .
Exactly 100 years ago , a gray tabby named Kiddo became the first cat to cross the Atlantic Ocean by dirigible .
Kiddo belonged to one of the crew members of American explorer Walter Wellman 's airship America .
In 1910 Wellman attempted to cross the ocean , leaving from Atlantic City , New Jersey on 15 October that year .
Kiddo stowed away in one of the lifeboats , and was after his discovery turned out to be as big a pain as only an angry , claustrophobic cat can be , scratching , mewing , and howling and generally bugging the heck out of everybody on board .
The America carried radio equipment — the first aircraft so equipped — and apparently the historic first , in - flight radio message , to a secretary back on land , read : ' Roy , come and get this goddamn cat '
More information on this momentous event is here .
MAK PRAING , CAMBODIA — “ I ’m going to get my votes ! ” cried Mu Sochua as she stepped into a slender rowboat , holding one side for balance .
“ One by one . ”
She was crossing a small river here in southern Cambodia on a recent stop in her never - ending campaign for re-election to Parliament , introducing herself to rural constituents who may never have seen her face .
The most prominent woman in Cambodia ’s struggling political opposition , Mu Sochua , 55 , is campaigning now , three years before the next election , because she is almost entirely excluded from government - controlled newspapers and television .
“ Only 35 percent of voters know who won the last election , ” she said .
She has no time to lose .
Ms. Mu Sochua is a member of a new generation of women who are working their way into the political systems of countries across Asia and elsewhere , from local councils to national assemblies and cabinet positions .
# 1. Laphraoig .
I had some .
# 2 . “ But its very name implies that it will be difficult , nay , impossible , to obtain ! ”
Even if you know that the rich vein of MacGuffin ore located in the planet is called “ unobtainium ” – which , yeah , not Cameron ’s word , it ’s a long - standing nerd joke , whatever – the first time Giovanni Ribisi leans over a mystical floating space rock and pronounces the word with deep , Ribisian seriousness , the merriment is irresistible .
# 3 . The Ultimate Intimacy .
Okay , so , what the mystical tribal people of ( blue ) color do instead of sex is to stick their exposed nerve clusters ( they have them in their hair ! ) together and connect to each other ’s nervous systems .
That does n’t seem all that exciting to me – although maybe it would if the nerve system you were connecting to were being stimulated by some extremely pleasurable activity , like , say , actually screwing – but they are hippies and mostly I ’m just glad they ’re not blowing bong hits into each others ’ mouths and talking about their deep spiritual connection to the trees .
Well : not talking about that more than usual .
Talking about the deep spiritual connection to the trees is foreplay , as it turns out .
But you know about the nerve - clusters - equals - fucktimes thing , yes ?
It ’s on the Internet ; it will be on the DVD ; James Cameron has made it explicitly clear by this point that , when you directly access another entity ’s nerve clusters with your nerve clusters , you are in fact engaged in fucking .
So , imagine my surprise when , about an hour in , our hero does it to a horse .
# 4 . My excuse for the drinking .
It went as follows : “ What ?!
It ’s gonna be a space movie , with some pretty aliens , and some dragons , and some explosions .
I just need to see it , I do n’t need to think about it .
It ’s not like there ’s gonna be subtitles .
Unless the aliens turn out to have their own special Elvish Klingon imaginary language that the dorks can all speak to each other at summer camp . ”
Ha ha , WHOOPS .
Or , as the Na’vi would say , GRFLDSHAAAAAAGN’UH-OH .
# 5 . The Dragonriders of Perndora .
So , do you remember The Dragonriders of Pern ?
You know , that science - fiction book series ?
This is deep dork territory we are talking about ; even knowing the name of the series singles you out as a current or former sad child who has trouble finding people to sit with in the cafeteria .
But , among young dorks of a certain era , The Dragonriders of Pern was actually a really big deal .
There are these special telepathic dragons , and they have to “ choose ” you , and once your dragon has “ chosen ” you are mated to it for life , and you belong to a special dragon - centric warrior society , and also there ’s a weird dick - measuring internal hierarchy of dragons where having the biggest and rarest and most impressively colored dragon makes you , like , King of the People Who Also Have Dragons .
Truly , Pern is a unique and mystical world of dorkchantment .
So , anyway , guess which books James Cameron ’s been reading ?
Although , to give him credit , he did invent the bit where you have to battle your dragon for the right to stick your weiner nervous system into its special bonding orifice .
That was fun .
# 6 . Mystical tribal religion dance party !
The most sacred activity these people share is gathering around Ye Olde Spirit Tree and , basically , doing Pilates at it .
Maybe , if things get really spiritual , they wind up doing the Wave .
Who knows , you guys ?
Theology is complicated like that !
# 7 . “ You may now choose your woman . ”
Is there a single white - straight - dude fantasy of being abducted into an perpetually - topless mystical tribal people of ( blue ) color society where the WSD does n’t get invited to “ choose his woman ? ”
Basically , this movie seems very much like some guy – let us call him , for legal reasons , “ Phlames Phlameron ” – sat down and was like , “ well , I like Star Wars .
And I like masturbating to old copies of National Geographic .
If only there were some way for me to combine these interests ! ”
# 8 . When they say “ choose your woman , ” they ’re not fucking around .
So , I am sorry to keep going back to the sex thing , but the second that our hero , Jake , finally gets around to doing it with Space Zoe Saldana , she utters the words – with no small amount of seriousness , might I add – “ we are mated for life now . ”
The VERY MOMENT HE GETS IT IN , she says this .
Ladies : do you date dudes ?
Do any of these dudes like Avatar ?
Do you think that , at any point , you might have sex with a dude who likes Avatar ?
Because , if so , you need to say this shit during sex .
I know I ’m going to .
I ’ll adopt the deep , tranquil , stalkerly tones of mystical communion , give him the zonked - out blue - person googly - eye , all of it .
Just to see how quickly he flies screaming out of the apartment , and whether he bothers to put on pants .
# 9 . VENN .
AHH .
ZWAYYY .
LA .
You guys , I was totally sad when I heard that Billy Zane was not going to be in this movie .
I mean , of course I was !
Who was going to be my ridiculous cartoon villain if the Zane did n’t show up ?
That ’s what I was thinking .
Little did I know , however , that this movie offers two – yes , two – Billy Zanes for the price of one .
First , we have Billiani Zanebisi , who is playing the Chief Executive Officer in Charge of Being Incredibly Evil All the Time for Whatever Reason , who has a deep and murderous connection to the Sharper Image floating - rock paperweight on his desk , conveyed to us through Zanebisi ’s patented “ naturalistic ” style of acting , which is to say everything twelve times and enunciate it really weirdly .
( “ Naaauh .
Nah , nah , nahnahnah ! ” “ So , um … ‘ now , ’ sir ? ” )
And then !
As if this were n’t enough !
We have Corporal Zane , of the United Airborne Being Incredibly Evil All the Time Division !
And he is , if possible , even more ridiculous !
The scene in which he pronounces the name of a certain South American country as if it were four separate words , each one of which makes him want to vomit , before proceeding to climb into a gigantic mecha suit and rant against “ limp - dicked science majors , ” will uplift and delight you , and also haunt your dreams .
# 10 . I am immune to awe , beauty , and magic .
Well , sort of !
Avatar really did look like a Lisa Frank binder had sex with a mid-’80s sci- fi paperback cover and their baby threw up on your face , which was great .
And my eyes really were zipping all over the screen trying to catch the details , and I honestly was amazed by how many ( fluorescent ! ) details there were , and how seamless it all looked .
And I will probably see it in IMAX , if I get the chance !
Because we were seated too close to the screen , as it turns out , so a lot of the 3 - D effects just looked blurry and hurt my eyes .
But also , when I see it in IMAX , I will still laugh when that one dude screws a horse .
Because , yes , I am dead inside , but I submit to you that nothing is going to make that less than redonk .
As a society , we ’ve always idolized the embodiment of the headstrong cowboy gunslinger anti-hero .
From John
Wayne ’s many iterations of Western sheriffs and outlaws to Clint Eastwood showing us the good , the bad and the ugly — we ’ve always adored and admired the lone gunslinger .
The outlaw .
The take no prisoners — ask no questions — shoot - first outlaw hero .
The wise - cracking cowboy as quick with a sideways comment as with a six - shooter .
Or laser pistol .
As our imaginations turned to space , it was only natural that eventually we ’d have our share of space cowboys — in the gunslinger good - at - heart outlaw type .
The space cowboy evolved from star - cruising heroes such as Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon , who took on strange enemies and toppled space dictators .
Where they were closer to the definition of a space pirate , it was n’t until a certain Enterprise captain came along that we truly got our first glimpse of a space cowboy .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .

James T. Kirk was brash and emotional .
He preferred to fight battles with his fists rather than with words or diplomacy , though knew how to use both when needed .
He was a natural - born leader and defied the stereotype of the cowboy loner when he took command of the Enterprise .
Kirk took pleasure in doing what any ships ’ captain should never do , go straight into battle with only a small posse at his side .
The captain ’s place is generally at the helm , commanding his troops .
Not Kirk , however : Kirk scoffed in the face of danger and laughed in the face of aversion .
In the realm of science fiction and geekdom , he was one of the greatest space cowboys .
He was n’t the last , though ; he just led the way for two of the greatest .
The two that set the tone for this edition of GeekDad ’s Great Geek Debate : Han Solo vs. Malcolm Reynolds .
Outlaw in Command
When fellow GeekDad writer Chuck Lawton ( whom you can yell at on Twitter if you do n’t enjoy this particular debate ) suggested I do a Han vs. Mal Great Geek Debate , I wondered how to approach it .
Both men have very similar traits and , at this point , are endeared in geek culture and beyond .
I chose the path of the lone gunslinger , the cowboy outlaw , in the sense that neither men is a cattle herder ( the classic definition of a cowboy ) , but both men are rule - breakers .
Both men have reckless streaks and have no problem conning their way to greater profit and personal gain at the expense of their own lives .
They are egotistical and commanding .
Han and Mal prefer things be done their way , especially on the ships they command .
Each member of their crew serves a purpose — if someone is n’t useful , then they have no business on the ship .
Han loved the Millennium Falcon as though it was his child .
He had complete faith in the Falcon and her limitations and advantages .
Even when the hyperdrive was n’t working properly , he knew that with a couple of whacks on the instrument panel , it would kick on .
Not to mention some spot - on repairs from his trusty companion and sole crew member Chewbacca .
Chewbacca ’s role on the Falcon was more than just being the repairman , he was the conscience and devil ’s advocate as well .
This is the same role embodied by Zoe on Serenity as well .
She questioned Mal ’s authority from time to time , to be sure he was making the right decision and not acting solely on impulse .
Mal had a more complete crew , each member serving a direct purpose and he made it clear on more than one occasion if they do n’t pull their weight , they can take leave .
Mal even went so far as to kick River and Simon off the ship when he had decided that they were no longer of any purpose to him .
Of course , once he realized that River ’s existence agitated the Alliance so much , he took them back .
His loyalty to the rest of the crew wavered from fierce to precarious .
For example , his trust in Jayne as a backup gunslinger was unwavering , but there was no question that outside of that purpose , Jayne was not to be completely trusted .
When it came to straight - up command of their ship and crew , Han had complete control and the easier command .
He had the loner lifestyle up until Leia and Luke joined his crew for a short time , but they were more passengers than crew when it came down to it .
Mal ran his ship and crew with a common goal , money in their pockets and food on their plates .
His crew respected him and listened to him , knowing he would risk his life and theirs for the pursuit of their goals and the survival of the ship .
Advantage : Mal Reynolds
Conversely , neither man would abandon his crew without a means to survive .
They were n’t cold - hearted .
They were profit - driven but protected what was theirs and had a proven soft spot for their crew .
This was especially seen via the women in their lives .
The Women
There was a great exchange between Han and Leia in A New Hope that pretty much summed up their relationship .
Han Solo : Look , Your Worshipfulness , let ’s get one thing straight .
I take orders from just one person : me .
Princess Leia :
It ’s a wonder you ’re still alive .
This continued through Return of the Jedi and beyond ( based on the novels ) , after they had married and had children of their own .
What this shows is an immediate bond spanning back to the days of pulling on a girls ’ hair on the playground .
Watching this behavior as an adult , you can immediately spot the sexual tension and the eventual pairing of the two was inevitable .
Every outlaw gunslinger has a tough spark of a woman in their life and for Han Solo , his foil came in the form of a young and just - as - brash princess .
He never tamed her , and she never tamed him .
Instead , they came to a mutual ground , whether based on the adrenaline of the adventure or eventual attraction , it was undeniable .
When Leia released Han from the carbonite in Jabba ’s palace , you knew that it was true love .
Of course , it all started with the selfish pursuit of profit .
Leia was a payday to Han at first , but little did he know that the cost would be falling in love with a princess .
He was simply hoping for a bag of gold .
This is similar to how it started for Mal and Inara .
Having a companion onboard Serenity enabled Mal and his crew to gain access to planets they may not have had access to before , plus she paid her rent .
There was always sexual tension between the two , but sadly , it was never truly resolved .
We all knew Mal felt for her and wanted to succumb , but his outlaw nature would n’t let him .
In the end , even though we still felt it — their romance was left unresolved .
So which defines the outlaw cowboy lifestyle better ?
Falling in love with the romantic foil or denying the love to fully embrace the outlaw and individual lifestyle ?
Consider the tension and stress that Mal put upon himself by denying his feelings for Inara and her for him .
Han had no such stress .
Leia annoyed him , but he was aggressive in pursuing her and finally won his prize .
Advantage : Han Solo
The Outlaw Hero
A great geek sub-debate is whether or not Han shot Greedo first in the famous Mos Eisley bar scene .
I think it ’s generally agreed that they either both shot at the same time and Han had better aim , or Han did shoot first and Greedo ’s shot was a death spasm .
Either way , the point is that Han took no chances .
As Robert De Niro ’s character said in the film Ronin , “ I never walk into a place I do n’t know how to walk out of . ”
Basically , this implies that while Han ’s actions seemed impulsive and reactionary , it was all part of the plan .
In fact , several times over the lifespan of his adventures ( whether they be movies or books )
Han refers numerous times to a “ plan , ” and things maybe not going according to it .
No matter the failure or who was shooting laser blasters at him ( with terrible aim ) , Han seemed to at least have the outline of a plan .
Of course , he was n’t the one who noticed the garbage chute .
He was an outlaw in the greatest sense of deception and cunning .
He tricked the Empire ( under Vader ’s Sith - enhanced nose nonetheless ) more than once and took a freezing in carbonite to spare the lives of his friends , but most importantly because he did n’t pay back a debt .
While Han liked to believe he had a plan , Mal Reynolds was much more impulsive .
His plans came to him at the last possible moment , with few details outside of a general idea and direction .
Deciding to fly through Reaver space to defy the Alliance , Mal risked his life and the crew .
This impulsive and defiant behavior solidified him as an outlaw hero , as if the smuggling and cargo runs did n’t already .
While those actions were for profit , his true mission was taking down the Alliance .
For a while , similar to Han , outrunning and evading the Alliance / Empire was enough to survive and eke out a living .
Eventually however , Mal had to become a hero to the galaxy , the eventual rise of a true outlaw hero .
In the end , Han was a hero to the Rebel Alliance .
A medal was draped upon his chest and he received the recognition and wealth he had been fighting for .
This does n’t make him any less of a hero in the classical sense .
Though , as evidenced by the Man With No Name in Sergio Leone ’s classic films , the true outlaw hero does n’t seek recognition and accolades .
He only seeks resolution to his problems to get back to doing what he does best , making profit and shooting those who get in his way .
This is how Malcolm Reynolds ended his adventure , as the broken , bruised and nameless hero to the revolution , his livelihood of smuggling restored for the time being .
Advantage : Mal Reynolds
In the end , and only considering the categories above , this debate goes to Mal Reynolds .
However , I ’d be just as glad to call it a tie , for if I was to expand the categories and go on for a couple thousand more words , we ’d probably reach an impasse at some point .
Also , I am keenly aware that this particular debate has taken place many times on the internet , but not here at GeekDad .
So vote and keep up the debate in the comments !
SOFIA , Bulgaria —
Hours after radio host Bobbie Tsankov was assassinated in broad daylight in central Sofia , Bulgaria 's capital , on Jan. 5 , cops arrested reputed mobster Krasimir Marinov for allegedly masterminding the shooting .
On the same day , they also announced a dragnet to find Marinov 's younger brother and alleged co-conspirator , Nikolay .
But two weeks later , Marinov , nicknamed " The Big Margin , " was released on bail because the judge said prosecutors lacked evidence to detain him .
His brother , known as " The Little Margin , " remained at large .
On Jan. 21 , the elder Marinov was again arrested , this time on drug - related charges .
Since then , he 's stayed in jail .
His brother is still on the lam .
It 's not the first time the Margin brothers have treated the Bulgarian judicial system like a drive - through .
They have been in and out of court of since 2006 on allegations of plotting other midday street shootings .
Because they claim to suffer from ill health , their trial has been postponed several times while they have been under house arrest , where they have continued to oversee their alleged criminal empire .
Sofia City Prosecutor Nikolay Kokinov shrugs when asked why he can't make charges against the brothers stick .
" I 'm not able to say where the mistake was , " he said .
" It is hard to prosecute such a case when there is a person who ordered the murder , and you do n't have the person who perpetrated the crime . "
Crime and corruption have again become a crisis in Bulgaria since Tsankov 's death .
On Jan. 19 , the country 's foreign minister , Rumiana Jeleva , resigned after withdrawing her candidacy for a seat on the European Commission amid accusations she lied on her financial disclosure forms .
The scandal suggested that high - level political corruption was resurgent while hitmen were gunning down well - known figures in the streets .
Last year , the U.S. Embassy in Sofia released a list of about 140 contract murders in Bulgaria between 1993 and 2008 .
Authorities arrested numerous suspects connected to those public shootings , but no high - level bosses have been convicted .
The incidents rekindle memories of the unsolved shootings that led the European Union to suspend 500 million euros in aid to Bulgaria in 2008 because of officials ' failure to end the country 's ongoing crime spree .
The move humiliated Bulgaria , the EU 's poorest member , and was a key factor in Prime Minister Boyko Borisov 's win last year over the then - Socialist government .
Ready to live up to his image as a tough guy , Borisov recently dressed down the country 's top law enforcement officials at a press conference , calling for significant convictions by next year .
His ministers vowed to end the complacency on crime that has bedeviled past governments .
" Some 250 to 300 emblematic figures of Bulgaria 's underworld have been tormenting the country for the last 20 years , " said Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov at the event .
" We are facing difficulties because of all the time that has been lost . "
Further delays could also be pricey .
Much of the previously frozen EU money has since been released , but European Commission spokesman Dennis Abbott said Brussels is considering suspending as much as 1 billion euros in EU funding for water treatment and other projects because Sofia wo n't produce audits , raising suspicions about the fate of previously transferred cash .
" Not enough of this money is reaching the actual beneficiaries on the ground , " said Abbott .
Experts also said the global recession — which arrived late to Bulgaria — could exacerbate relations between mafia clans and lead to more violence , making Borisov 's job still harder .
Criminologist Tihomir Bezlov at the Center for the Study of Democracy , a Sofia think tank , said recent internecine fights over shrinking spoils have resembled those among criminals after the fall of communism .
" We see more rude relations , more brutality , " said Bezlov .
" Maybe we 'll have some return of the middle 1990s . "
Borisov also must depend on judges in order to fulfill his pledges , but it 's not clear he can count on them .
Younger Bulgarian magistrates and United States federal justices who have participated in U.S. - funded training missions have said many senior Bulgarian judges are unreconstructed communists with little interest in the law beyond enriching themselves .
Over the past year , those claims have been underscored by a scandal involving influence peddling that has rocked the Bulgarian judiciary .
Prosecutors have accused 27 - year - old disco owner Krasio Georgiev of offering to help judges secure promotions for hundreds of thousands of euros .
It 's not known if Georgiev wielded such influence or was a scam artist , said Bezlov , but phone records show he had thousands of conversations with jurists throughout the country .
Never before have judges been so implicated in corruption .
" The Krasio case is very important , " Bezlov said .
" It broke the ice . "
Sofia City Prosecutor Kokinov also expressed optimism .
The government is giving him more support than ever , he said .
Proposed reforms stemming from the Georgiev case might erect better firewalls between judges and profiteers , he added .
And while the Margin brothers have escaped convictions , Kokinov said their recent legal hassles have disrupted their operations .
That means new , less experienced bosses are assuming more responsibilities , giving him more opportunities to catch them .
" They 'll make more mistakes now , " said Kokinov .
" They 're becoming new , and when a person is new , they make more mistakes . "
You press a button ; a character on the television screen jumps .
You press the same button again , while the on - screen character is in the air ; the character jumps again .

In video - gamer vernacular , this is called a " double jump . "
To a gaming outsider , the concept might not make any sense .
It might even be flagrantly ridiculous .
To a gaming outsider , actually , that a game character encounters so many situations wherein he needs to jump in order to proceed might in itself be foreign or bizarre .
Before we can properly talk about double jumping , we probably have to talk about jumping .
Advertisement
The fact seems to be that , in games of ancient times , jumping was a chief mechanic because it offered a moment - long variation in what would otherwise be a game about getting from point A to point B .
The ancient game template calls for a hero beginning at an origin , seeking a destination , impeded by obstacles .
" Obstacles " can be either dangerous objects or bottomless pits .
" Dangerous objects " can either be barrels rolling down ramps in Donkey Kong , bullet - like projectiles of mysterious or known origin , or enemy characters .
The player deals with dangerous objects by avoiding them .
In a two - dimensional game presented at a side - on angle , this means jumping .
In a two - dimensional game presented by a top - down angle , this means walking around it .
" Enemy characters " can either be grunts , mini - bosses , or bosses .
Grunts are easy to deal with .
Mini - bosses are more harrowing experiences , and bosses are occasionally cinematic in the struggle they put the player through .

Super Mario Bros. allows the player to surmount obstacles mostly by jumping .
In fact , you do n't have to kill a single enemy in Super Mario Bros .
You can jump over or otherwise avoid every one of them .
Super Mario Bros. is also elegant enough to make the jump function an attack in itself .
Most enemies are killed or otherwise dealt with by jumping on top of them .
Jump on top of a mushroom - like Goomba , and it flattens and dies .
Jump on top of a turtle - like Koopa , and it retracts into its shell .
Now you can touch the shell to send it flying in one direction .
If it touches other enemies , they die .
However , it can ricochet back and hit you , either hurting you or killing you .
If you are Little Mario , it kills you .
If you are Big Mario , it turns you into Little Mario .
If Little Mario eats a mushroom , he turns into Big Mario .
If Big Mario touches a Fire Flower , he can throw fireballs , which can kill all enemies on contact , except the black beetle things , which are an exception , because a game like this needs one little exception of every flavor in order to stay spicy .
Oh , and there are also the Hammer Brothers , who jump near - randomly and throw hammer projectiles at an eclectic angle .
You can kill them by jumping on them , by jumping up at a block they are standing on , thus hitting them from beneath , or by throwing fireballs .
Super Mario Bros. is not the bad guy .
In fact , Super Mario Bros. is the ultimate good guy .
I might have mentioned it before , though I am adamant in my belief that Super Mario Bros. is a perfect video game design .
It is not , however , an inimitable miracle .
The problem is that game developers , including Nintendo themselves , have been trying to imitate it in the wrong ways .

What 's perfect about Super Mario Bros .
is that it teaches you how to play in its opening ten seconds .
We have a character on the left side of the screen , facing right .
We instinctively know that we have to move to the right .
We move to the right .
A block with a question mark on it floats in the air above our character 's head .
Two steps to the right of this block is a series of many blocks , some with flashing question marks , and some of solid , scary - looking brick .
Floating above this series of blocks is another question mark block .
Just as we see this buffet of blocks , a mushroom - shaped monster - like thing becomes visible , moving from the right to the left .
Advertisement
This thing is moving , then , in the exact opposite direction of the hero .
This subliminally communicates to us that this Other Moving Object is our enemy .
We simultaneously wonder : how do I reach that block ?
And how do I kill that enemy ?
Advertisement
In the old times , we only had two buttons on the controller .
We 'd have plenty of time to press one of them before the enemy killed and / or ate us .
This is how we 'd learn that we can jump .
The hero 's head bonks into the question mark block .
A deliciously crispy ping sound echos as a golden coin pops up and disappears .
Where did the coin go ?
Who knows !
At the top of the screen , we see a coin symbol and a number : " 01 " .
We realize we should get more of those .
Advertisement
The enemy is drawing nearer .
The only thing we know how to do is jump .
We press the jump button .
We jump just high enough to jump over the enemy , and survive .
Or maybe we land on the enemy 's head , and he dies .
Points are added to our score .
We think , " Cool " .
Advertisement
By now , we know that question mark blocks give us good things .
What about the ugly brown bricks ?
We jump at one .
It throbs .
It does n't break .
We hit the next question mark block , and a mushroom pops out and begins spontaneously sliding across the ground .
Of course , we pick it up , because the last question mark block only gave us good things .
Mario grows larger .
If we jump at a solid brick again , we find that we can break it .
Advertisement
The player will learn , when he makes contact with an enemy , that being Big Mario means you can survive two hits before dying .
If the player does n't pick up the mushroom and instead touches the first enemy , he will also learn that being Little Mario means you die after touching one enemy .
So what we have here is a game with a strictly limited move set ( walk , run , jump ) in which two of the three actions ( walk , run ) serve the short and long - term goals ( get from point A to point B ) , albeit in different capacities ( run to move quickly , walk to line yourself up minutely for tricky jumps ) and the last of the three actions ( jump ) is linked to multiple ( nearly all ) immediate - term goals ( avoid enemies , kill enemies , avoid obstacles , obtain items ) .
Advertisement
In this game , the character 's vital status is portrayed entirely through the game graphics : if Little , Mario dies in one hit ; if Big , Mario survives two hits .
If Big and White , Mario can survive two hits and throw fireballs .
What if the player manages to complete the entire game on his first play - through , without touching a single enemy or even falling into a bottomless pit ?
Even as a person who has seen or experienced many improbable events , I can't imagine this ever actually happening .
Has a human being of such impeccable reflex and intuition ever existed ?
This is a crucial question , and the answer is " I do n't think so " .
If you or someone you know is this particular human being , plz upload something to YouTube plz .
I 'd love to see how gracefully you can tie your shoes ( winking smiley face ) ( note to many curious readers who emailed me last month : no , " ( winking smiley face ) " is not a bizarre copy - editing tick ; it 's just something I 've been doing on the internet for a couple of years ) .

Let 's go one further , and say that this genius player does n't even ever pick up the Fire Flower .
Let 's say he never uses the warp zone , and he is n't particularly bent on picking up every last coin .
He takes his time — though not too much time , of course , because his time is somewhat strictly limited .
Let 's also say that he only kills enemies on accident , or when it feels as though it could n't be avoided ( even though we 've established that it can be avoided ) .
Advertisement
At any rate , if the player is good enough to play the game straight through , without dying or even being injured , on his first time ever playing through the game , would that necessarily make it impossible for him to feel tension , pressure , or event delight at his own success ?
In a bad game , he could probably get away with not enjoying the experience .
In Super Mario Bros. , I 'm pretty confident that even the virtuoso / jackpotman / idiot savant would enjoy the experience thoroughly .
The reason why is so difficult to articulate that even Nintendo has failed to replicate Super Mario Bros. universal success in the ( nearly ) twenty - five (! ) long years since its release .
I am pretty sure that I have n't gone a single column on this website without mentioning Super Mario Bros .
and why it 's a great game , though for the sake of those who came in late , let 's go over it again :
1 . It 's simple : you can proceed entirely to the end of the game by only walking , running , and jumping
Advertisement
2 . It 's elegant : it provides the player with a robust , flowing experience that requires him / her to use every imaginable permutation of the small set of player character actions
3 . It 's " artistically " confident : the game is about a man in overalls who grows to twice his normal size when he eats a mushroom , and it does n't dare to explain the reasons why

In 2005 — again , I realize I 'm repeating myself — Nintendo proclaimed that many gamers had lost touch with the games of today , and that they sought to win those players back .
Their proposed solution was to make games that appealed to people who did n't play games .
Someone at Nintendo must have said , during an important meeting , that people who did n't play games had played Super Mario Bros .
( proof : Super Mario Bros. was a lot of people 's first game ) .
Nintendo's knee - jerk reaction to this reality was to release Super Mario Bros. , perfectly as - is , as a budget - priced Gameboy Advance cartridge .
Okay , that worked a little bit .
Eventually , Nintendo began to make games that were n't games , like Brain Training .
These sold hugely .
In board rooms around Japan , game developers conspired to " think like Nintendo . "
Instead of interpreting " think like Nintendo " as " think of good ideas that might appeal to people the way Brain Age appeals to people " , they instead seemingly interpreted it as " rip off Brain Age " .
I guess this mostly brings us to the present .
People from outside the gamesphere climb over one another to inform us that games are not art .
Maybe they will be , someday , some say , though by and large , at this very moment , they are not .

Gamers get all up in arms whenever someone says games are not art .
Roger Ebert got truckloads of hate mail for daring to insinuate that games are not art .
I read through a lot of blog posts or comments around the time Roger Ebert said that .
Most of the enraged kids were quick to point out how the games industry is making so - and - so many billions of dollars more per year than the film industry , and that was a little weird .
Since when does monetary worth translate to art ?
Whatever happened to artists being starving ?
Some say , games do n't have an equivalent of " Citizen Kane . "
I say , games do n't have an equivalent of " Ben Hur , " either .
The problem is consistency , " artistic conscience " .
Man , I feel like I talk about this all the time .
People ask me about this on the street , sometimes .
It 's weird .
Sometimes they say that I only like Super Mario Bros.
because I was a kid when I played it .
No , I 'm immune to the nostalgia thing .
Also , I have n't matured emotionally since about age five ( I was a mature kid ) , and I 'm not afraid to admit that .
Super Mario Bros. had the formula perfect .

What happened , though ?
Super Mario Bros. took an industry that was basically a fat and ugly infant , and turned it into a toddler with a popsicle addiction .
Twenty - five years later , games are making more money than movies .
They are not , however , making All The Money In The World .
So maybe people could be making better games .
It 's not vilification to portray game developers as money - grubbing businessmen .
This is , after all , a business .
However , it maybe it vilification ( in the most awesome way ) to insinuate that , in the videogame industry , the games are often being made by the types of general - entertainment " fanboys " that , in the movie industry , would consider it the highest honor to get paid a salary to fetch Steven Spielberg his coffee .

Maybe that sounds meaner than I intended it to .
Oh well !
Too late !
It 's all typed out now , and god knows I still have n't found my " delete " key .
I like to mention this interview with Tetsuya Nomura that I read in Weekly Famitsu a couple years ago , on the subject of Kingdom Hearts II .
In this one issue of Famitsu , Mr. Nomura , a man who found fans after designing the characters for Final Fantasy VII , is interviewed twice — once on the subject of the upcoming Blu-ray release of a special edition of a film he had " directed " about what happens to the Final Fantasy VII characters after Final Fantasy VII ended , and once on the subject of the Final Mix re-release of Kingdom Hearts II .
A few huge things pop out and touch index fingertips to the readers ' maybe - moist eyeballs :
In the interview re : " Advent Children " ( the Final Fantasy VII movie special edition / re-release ) , he talks about how the computer graphics will be more detailed , to truly wield the power of a larger storage medium ( Blu-ray , in this case ) .
For example , the main character , Cloud , has dirt on his face during one particular scene , to " better illustrate the intensity of his struggle . "
Mr. Nomura then quips that these are " details that only the true fan will appreciate . "

Furthermore , on the subject of " Advent Children " , Mr. Nomura explains , when asked if both language tracks ( English / Japanese ) will be available on the disc , that only English will be available , because of both " storage issues " and the fact that , and I quote , " we estimate that most of the buyers of this special edition will be people who already own the movie on DVD " , so they want to give them a language track they have n't heard before .
On the subject of Kingdom Hearts II : Final Mix , Mr. Nomura was asked why they made a " Final Mix " after saying , in a Famitsu interview on the subject of the original Kingdom Hearts II , that the goal with Kingdom Hearts II was to make a game that would not need a " Final Mix " .
Mr. Nomura 's answer is that , sadly , without actually releasing something and seeing how the world perceives it , it 's nearly impossible to tell what could be improved or added to it ; " And , of course " , he adds , crucially , " I thought of my own ideas for new content , as well " .

The biggest fire alarm rings when Mr. Nomura says , of the joy of developing Kingdom Hearts II , that nearly every interviewee during the team - expansion phase clapped his or her hands with joy , reported that they were huge fans of the first Kingdom Hearts game , and / or ( this is crucial ) , asked Tetsuya Nomura for his autograph .
What I 'm saying is , can you trust such people to give an objective opinion during the game development process ?

In short , games are made by fans , for fans .
The would - be critics are , more often than not , fans .
Despite being fans of games in general , game developers often fear the outside world of game fans to a point of near - absolute subservience .
I COULD PROBABLY SAY A LOT MORE ABOUT THAT
I 'm not going to say any more about that .
We 're going to leave the tip of that iceberg uncovered and do a little bit of stargazing .
LET'S TALK ABOUT JUMPING
( Jerry Seinfeld voice )
What 's the deal with jumping ?
I mean , who does that ?
Who jumps everywhere they go ?
Have you ever noticed just how much you jump in most video games ?
Advertisement
I 've been over this before : characters like Nathan Drake and Lara Croft appeal to us because they are realistic human beings with flawed and amusing personalities or wicked pyramidal breasts .
They draw us into their real - like - rule - having real - like worlds , and then they do maybe sixty - six explosive pull - ups in the space of three minutes , pulling themselves up so hard that they spring high into the air , grabbing onto the next ledge .
We either see this the first time and lol , because we know this can't happen in real life , or we keep playing the game without thinking about it , because we 've never tried to do a pull - up in real life , and that if we ever try and fail to do one , we will no doubt attribute our failure to the fact that we do n't have breasts like Lara Croft .
For the former type of gamer , the games ' ridiculousness escalates until we obtain a shrewd enough detachment from the proceedings , at which point we are maybe - sanctimoniously able to " sit back " and " relax " and " enjoy " it because , after all , it 's " just a game . "
In the case of the latter type of gamer , they will grow up to think that this is what games are , this is what happens in games , and if this sort of thing does n't happen in every single game on earth , the game is stupid and / or for losers .
So , why do action / adventure game characters jump so much ?
In short , it 's because games since Super Mario Bros .
tend to be about moving from point A to point B . Name me one action game where your long - , short - , or immediate - term goals at any given time do n't include a Point B .
You can 't !
It 's just not possible !
( Tower defense games do n't count ! )

Games are about moving .
And not just any moving .
No mainstream hit game has managed to perform the feat of being about merely walking or running at one speed along featureless terrain .
Games need to give us terrain , obstacles , and opponents , in order to make our journeys interesting .
If the journeys are n't interesting , we would n't be taking them .
Games are entertainment .
The journeys they present us are wholly optional activities , in the context of human living .
Games are wallpaper , or ornamentation , for the rooms of our lives .
Films , too , are wallpaper for the rooms of our lives .
Films contribute to the human maturation process so profoundly that modern philosophers ( some of whom are n't dead yet , so it would n't be kind to name - drop them ) have even taken to acknowledging their influence as vital .
The best way to approach this point is to quote a minor character in Edward Yang 's film " Yi Yi , " who tells a girl , on a date , that his unseen , unnamed uncle says " People live four times longer these days because of movies . "
How scary , and true .

Do we live longer because of videogames ?
Games are wallpaper for bare rooms of our life - chapters .
They 're a hobby ( , though , like all hobbies , they might also be a job ) .
Games are entertainment .
Movies play out in front of us .
Games do not .
Movies are passive entertainment .
Games are active entertainment .

You can construct a film entirely out of scenes where characters sit at a table , talking to one another .
You can sit at a table in real life with your friends , talking about whatever .
However , it will never be exactly like a scene in a film .
Maybe , in the film , every character in a conversation knows something that one other character does n't know .
Maybe someone 's life is at stake .
Films have taught us how much it sucks when someone 's life is at stake .

You can't make a game about people sitting at a table , talking .
Buried deep in the psychology of games is this absolute , burning need to see something move .
Remember the first time you ever used a television remote to turn a television on , or change channels ?
You might have been three years old , or you might have been nine .
Games speak to the part of your psychology that was ecstatic at that precise moment .
The need to move something that is n't yourself , to actively participate in something , is so deeply buried in the psychology of games that no game controller since the Atari 2600 has lacked an input device whose purpose is innately understood as solely to move your main character .
Maybe it 's hard to think back this far :
When was the first time you realized that the joystick moved Pac - Man , or that the control pad moved Mario ?
With Pac - Man , it was easy ; you might have been in an arcade , and the joystick was the only input device .
Well , there was also a start button .
Arcade games were easy to understand , because the function of each button was written right there next to the button .
Advertisement
Or maybe you first played Pac - Man on an Atari 2600 .
The shape of the standard Atari 2600 controller communicated so much to the player .
The joystick was this big tall skinny smokestack of a thing , and the only button was this little dime - sized red thing .
It was red , a stark contrast against the black plastic of the controller , so as to stand out just enough , and tell you , " Hey , I 'm important , " though it did not dare approach the monumental majesty of the joystick .
And what a word , " joystick " !
It 's a stick , which brings you joy .
What is the joy ?
The joy is that you are remotely making something inside your television screen move .
After all those years of watching news anchors discuss earthquake or fire death tolls , or watching game show contestants flub simple questions and miss out on Brand New Cars , now , you finally had the opportunity to direct the action inside the television screen .
Advertisement
It 's obvious that the joystick was the most important part of the controller , just as it was obvious that the button was absolutely essential .
In many games , the button served only to start the game .
In some games , it allowed you to shoot .
So there we had the birth of most modern genres of game , in Space Invaders :
You move , and you shoot .
You can even take cover under little shields .
Wow , Gears of War is such a Space Invaders rip - off ( lol ) .
The Nintendo Famicom / Entertainment System arrived at a point when game designers were so good at making the same old games that the people started revolting at the sameness of them all .
They call this the " crash " of the games market .
It must have been right around Super Mario Bros. that Nintendo realized it was probably best to not make too many new franchises , to keep the cards close to their chest and only release new games when they were significantly big and ground - breaking enough .
Too many games tired people out .
Advertisement
That said , around the time of Super Mario Bros. , games were facing an evolve - or - die situation .
The public reputation of games in general had fallen through the floor .
People needed a really good reason to care again .
Super Mario Bros. was that really good reason .
Twenty - five years into the future , we have lots of games , and even more people playing them .
I have a friend whose daughter is old enough to play and enjoy Pokemon .
We 're passing games on as a tradition , a habit , or a traditional habit .
Well , hey , traditions are just habits we can share .
Advertisement
The games market is always looking for ways to get More Money .
The two methods for getting More Money are :
1 . Make people who like games buy more games
2 . Make people who do n't like games like games
Advertisement
Accomplishing # 1 is easy : Make games that people who like games would probably like .
# 2 , however , is something no one seems to have worked out a perfect formula for .
Meanwhile , twenty - five years in the past , we had Super Mario Bros .
After nearly a decade of games where either movement or shooting were the chief joys , we finally had a game where the movement felt amazing ( Mario accelerates , he slides to a stop , he squeaks when he turns around , he jumps higher the longer you hold the button ) , and where the shooting ( of fireballs ) felt genuinely unique ( they bounce at such neat , quirky angles ) .
What we had , in Super Mario Bros. , was a game of " artistic conscience . "
Advertisement
A year later , we had Castlevania .
Oh man .
I 've been waiting for this part !
I love the Castlevania games ; I love them enough to pick them apart viciously .
Castlevania games are invariably about a hero on a quest to kill Dracula or someone who is good enough friends with Dracula to be dangerous .
Most of the time , the journey leads through Dracula 's castle , colloquially referred to by Transylvanian residents as " Castlevania , " because it 's a landmark and they have to be proud of something .
Advertisement
In the original Castlevania , the hero , Simon Belmont , did a lot of stair - climbing .
Staircases were represented graphically as diagonal lines with little individual stairs etched into them .
To ascend a staircase , you approach it and press up on the control pad .
The hero begins walking up the staircase .
He ascends the stairs slowly , " realistically " .
He can't jump while ascending a staircase .
He can , however , swing his whip at monsters who might be flying or jumping in his direction .
Some of the most ferocious memories of the original Castlevania are n't of large set - pieces , or even any particular small set - pieces .
They are of single repeated moments of dread , of when you 're climbing up some stairs and you see a bat flying at you from the right side of the screen .
Bats do n't fly in a straight line .
They kind of wobble up and down a bit .
In your brain , you do a quick calculation :
If the bat wobbles a little bit down or a little bit up before his flight path intersects the staircase , at your current speed of ascent , you would not be able to move , from your current location , to a position higher or lower than that bat 's trajectory .
So you are going to have to either
# 1 take the hit , or
# 2 kill the bat
Now comes brain calculation # 2 : The business end of your whip is only so - and - so pixels high .
The bat is about six times higher than your whip 's height .
So where do you need to stand , on this staircase , to be able to destroy this bat with the highest probability ?
Advertisement
Thankfully , in the original Castlevania , a shrewd player can always kill the bat .
No evil variable will ever tumble out of nowhere and render the act impossible .
The game is impeccably balanced , though it may seem cruel and unforgiving .
The secret is that the bats , though wobbling in flight pseudo - randomly , only spawn from pre-determined parts of the screen .
All you need to do is put two and two together , position yourself accordingly , and press the kill button .
The feeling of hesitating just too long on a staircase , performing some unnecessary calculations , thinking way too hard , and then failing to turn around in time , so that the bat whaps you in the back and Simon cringes , hops back , and falls like a sack of potatoes right off the side of the staircase — it 's burned into the classic old - school gamer 's brain .

Later years would equip us with such rollicking , frustrating , sticky friction - memories as : Trying to walk up a hill in Super Mario 64 , trying to ascend up a hill from a walking speed in any Sonic the Hedgehog game without pressing the jump button , et cetera .
In Super Mario 64 , it 's maddening .
In Sonic the Hedgehog , it 's like we 're trying to make things hard on ourselves .
Castlevania planted the seed in us .
We want , we need , to feel that friction .
And Super Mario Bros. planted the seed in Castlevania : Games are n't just about moving , they are about rubbing against the surface of the world .
Advertisement
Castlevania released to a soon - to - be - devoted cult audience , wearing its flashy quirks on its sleeves and pants and on the back of its shirt .
The whip was a weird weapon .
Previous games had featured guns that fired projectiles out of a location in the middle of the character 's body ( ship ) in a straight line .
Those projectiles generally continued until they hit something .
In Castlevania , the whip fires at about the character 's chest height , it stretches only so far , and its effective area is only so high and so wide .
In order to get anywhere in the game , the player had to master the knowledge of the precise tiny pixel block that represented his avatar 's offensive influence .
Most crucial to this knowledge was how far said pixel block existed from his character .
Then there were the stairs .
And the quirks of all the secondary weapons .
And the jumping physics : Simon jumps up in what looks like a crouched position ; you can control the length of the jump until a certain precise point , after which he falls straight down like an axe .
It 's pretty safe to say that Castlevania was made this way on purpose .
If they did n't want friction and physics in their game , they would have made something bland and simple .
Japanese side - scrolling games had existed for several years without friction , or even without specific quirks .
Games like Dragon Buster , where your character floats mouse - cursor - like over a featureless world , swinging a sword at a boring angle .
And some side - scrollers had remarkable quirks , like Legend of Kage , where your character can jump two screens straight up , albeit without any really interesting physics .
( Also , Legend of Kage scrolls from right to left , instead of from left to right . )
Castlevania must have been made the way it was made on purpose : Eschewing huge game - mechanic related gimmicks for general friction .

What was the selling point of Castlevania ?
Well , it was a game about horror movie monsters .
The schlock - smiths at Konami saw fit to craft a game that found a perfect excuse to fit Dracula , werewolves , Frankenstein 's Monster , Medusa , and the Grim Reaper into the same story .
They figured that this level of instant familiarity would translate to perfect success .
Actually , wait , where did Castlevania really start ?
Konami seem to have the information under some kind of G - 14 classification , so let 's make up theories : Maybe it was the music .
Maybe the music composer was tooling around with the sound chip and was like , " Whoa , listen to this horror - movie - music shit I have going on right here .
It sounds like a pipe organ . "
Or maybe some game designer went , " Oh , man , this simple character I created has really weird jumping physics and his weapon is quirky as hellllllllll , " and some other guy was like , " Okay , let 's fit this into something .
Hey , that dude over there got something to sound like a pipe organ , and that guy is drawing sprites of werewolves , so let 's see what we can do " .
( Actually , I just looked up the music composer on Wikipedia , and it turns out she was a . . . she .
I just added her as a friend on Facebook !
I love Facebook friends !
If you 're reading this , be my Facebook friend ( so lonely ) . )

I 'd like to think Castlevania began with the staircases .
Simon Belmont is a more old - world , realistic kind of dude than Mario .
Something tells me that a game programmer at Konami played Super Mario Bros .
and found it funny that Mario jumps all the time .
One of the more iconic images of Super Mario Bros. is the staircase at the end of each stage .
It 's as high as the screen .
There 's a flagpole on the other side of it .
You climb the stairs , and then you jump off , trying to hit the top of the flagpole .
Or , well , technically , if you are a kid with an imagination , you try to jump over the flagpole .
Hell , twenty - five years later , if you are an adult who was once a child with an imagination , you still try to jump over the flagpole .
Traditions are habits that so do n't hurt us , we just have to share them .
So , wait , why are the " stairs " on this staircase as high as Little Mario 's head ?
Even Big Mario , who is technically a giant , has to jump to climb each individual stair .
Is n't that a little weird ?
One answer would be that the " staircase " is n't actually a " staircase . "
" Staircases " are architectural features that facilitate movement between one floor of a building and another .
Without stairs , we 'd have to learn how to jump .
I had a dream just two weeks ago , to be honest , where I got home to find that the landlord had demolished the staircase leading up to my apartment , and informed me that he'd drilled a hole in the middle of my living room floor , and that I would need to learn how to jump three stories straight up .
In the dream , I kicked him in the nuts and started crying , though in real life I probably would have just started crying .

The staircases at the end of the stages in Super Mario Bros. are not actually staircases .
They 're just the rare case of a Rorshach test in which everyone gives the exact same answer ( you know , like that one that looks like a dead dog ) : this arrangement of blocks Looks Like a Staircase .
The brain is triggered : Jumping , eventually , comes to feel weird and ridiculous .
So maybe some hotshot at Konami goes , " You know , stairs exist in real life as real things .
It feels like work to climb a staircase , just like it feels like work to walk or run long distances .
Super Mario Bros. made running and walking into fun .
Maybe we can make staircases fun ? "
Maybe this maybe - plan backfired , depending on your perspective .
You might have thought the original Castlevania was a bone - crushing , too - difficult experience .
You 'd also be a rube , unable to wrap his head around simple genius !
Okay , that was mean .
Let 's say something I do n't like about Castlevania :
The very beginning of the game .
You 're outside the castle .
The first time you play the game , you do n't know who the hell you are , or why the hell you are who the hell you are .
You press one button , and you jump .
You press another button , and you lash out with your whip .
Congratulations , you now know how to play .
Now , right in front of you , there 's a candle .
The candle is glowing , the flame flickering with a brilliant two - frame animation .
Okay .
Maybe you walk right past it .
The game is , if nothing else , atmospheric .
That much you can tell already , just standing outside the first level .
Hell , you might play Castlevania for ten minutes , performing pretty poorly at the first stage , before your friend comes in and shows you that you can whip the first candle , and a power - up falls out .
Touch it , and your character freezes for an instant .
Now his whip is , like , twice as long .
Wait , why would you give me that right away , before I have even had an occasion to use the whip to kill anything ( aside from a candle ) ?
That 's weird .

Did you know that , in a Japanese game development environment , the word used to describe " level design , " since the Famicom era , has been " haikei , " meaning " background " or " scenery " .
This is very important to understanding the way the Japanese have historically approached making games .
Advertisement
I 've personally had the postmodern pleasure of having to explain to a few Japanese game developers that " level design " does not , in the West , mean what the level looks like :
It means the things that happen in the level , and how they are laid - out .
In Devil May Cry , " level design " is deciding that the first stage is going to look like a church .
Level design in modern Japanese games , by Western standards , is pretty abysmal .
In the first stage of Devil May Cry 4 , we have a part where the player comes into a circular plaza , which is then surrounded by a glowing red wall .
Enemies then appear out of mostly nowhere .
The " producers " — the " brains " behind this schlock — have seen fit to solve the puzzle of the moment by deciding that the enemies are demons , and everyone knows that demons have the power to basically materialize out of the ground or thin air .
We fight them until they stop appearing .
When they are dead , the glowing red wall vanishes .
We are now free to move forward into the only path forward .
Advertisement
Eventually , we 're inside a building .
We walk by a door .
We look at it .
A message tells us : " It 's locked by a mysterious power . "
We continue down the hallway .
There 's another door .
We look at it .
A message tells us : " It 's locked .
You need a key . "
Then the camera pulls back , and we see the mysterious - power - locked door slide open .
There 's a box behind it .
We walk back .
We open the box .
The box has a key in it .
We go back into the hallway , unlock the door in front of us .
We exit into a circular plaza .
A red , glowing wall appears around us .
Enemies materialize .
We fight them until they die .
The wall disappears .
We are now free to move forward .
Et cetera .
Why are Japanese games able to get away with this ?
The reasons are simple , and huge :
1 . The character designs / setting / story are meticulously researched to appeal to the target demographic
Advertisement
2. Something in the game ( in Devil May Cry , combat ) is polished / nuanced to a point where players will not complain if anything / everything outside that thing ( combat ) is bland
What 's alarming is that all signs point to Japanese games being made this way entirely on purpose .
I once suggested to a Japanese game developer , many years ago , that we try to make the levels interesting , in addition to making the combat fun and the story appealing to the target demographic , and the immediate response was " Why ? "
The ultimate form of the refusal was , " Devil May Cry does n't bother , so we wo n't bother . "
In Devil May Cry , the tasks between battles really are tiny and asinine .
Find an orb in a risk - free environment where the biggest challenge is figuring out where your character is on the screen and then use it to somehow open a door , et cetera .
Your reward is more of the combat that you crave .
Advertisement
We can find hints of the Everything Disease in this , again .
Many of the players playing these games might not care about the graphics or the character designs , though can you really blame developers for maintaining their conviction that the players all care about everything in the game ?
Some players merely appreciate the challenges posed by the battles .
They may like the feeling that they have achieved a level of super - legitimate competence at the labyrinthine reflex - oriented tasks the game sets before them — revving up a motorcycle - sword while dodging enemy attacks , stringing together hits of a combo , avoiding detection from enemy AI patterns just long enough to execute unanswered strings of button - press - triggered combinations .
Good money says that a decent percentage of Street Fighter IV players could n't care less about the characters or the graphics or the music — they just want to play online , and win , and know that they are doing something better than someone else , someone who exists in the real world .
It helps to know that the " something " is difficult .
We know something is difficult when we fail at it at least once .
We know something is very difficult when we fail three or four times .
In Devil May Cry , the naturally emerging " level design " is basically a commercial break between delicious opportunities for failure .
Usually , it 's the " scenery " department that slaps these segments together .
That 's kind of how it was in the old days , though maybe not quite .
Advertisement
Back in the old days , games were smaller .
Programmers , level designers , and game designers tended to be the same people as the play - testers .
In the case of Castlevania , you 've got a guy with a whip , and you 've got some stairs , and some enemies coming at him , and he can either climb the stairs , stay and fight , or get hit .
The challenge of developing a game like this is laying it out in a reasonable fashion , so that it gets harder as it goes along .
You want the hardest bosses to be at the end .
You want the hardest platform segments to be later than the segments obviously constructed to help the player learn how to jump .
In the original Castlevania , the team likely sat down once they knew the game was about a big castle full of horror movie monsters , and decided what the motif for each stage would be .
Stage one would be a hallway .
Stage five would be a clock tower .
Advertisement
Back then , the game design vocabulary was limited .
You hear a lot of people talk about how the Nintendo sound chip was so primitive that a composer needed to make a really good track or the music would fall flat .
The corollary is that " restriction forces ingenuity " .
Ingenuity is . . . probably better than " innovation . "
Yes , what I 'm saying is that " older games were better " — though mostly by default !
Castlevania was such a simple game that , unless all of the obstacles were laid out in a common - sensically escalating manner , people would have freaked the hell out and hated it .
Super Mario Bros. was the same way , technically , though Castlevania is more interesting in a modern light because it cutely tried to tell a film - like story , and its stages were home to background art that grew increasingly more portentous of some bombastic finale .
Advertisement
The original Castlevania did n't set the world on fire .
It was quirky and well - made , though its horror - movie setting might have put some people off .
It carved out a niche , and its developers no doubt felt that they could eat off it for a while .
Other game developers saw Castlevania and knew that they could n't make games about horror movie castles themselves , and that a whip was too obvious a thing to imitate , so they resigned to make their own game in a unique kind of setting .
We ended up with lots of games .
Some of them were great .
After maybe five years , we had a lot of games with enough unique hooks to populate one really huge , bombastic , great game .

Eventually , what happened , was the Feature Snipers showed up , and nobody ever needed to do anything original ever again .
These trained eyes took aim on the whole of game history , and picked out the targets that could be separated neatly from their respective games ' settings and never be noticed .
LET'S TALK ABOUT DOUBLE JUMPING
One of the features to be famously and widely sniped was the double jump .
Many snipers sniped it from Super Ghouls ' n ' Ghosts , which was in itself a non-numbered Super Famicom sequel to a non-numbered MegaDrive sequel of a Famicom version of an arcade game .
The truth is that Super Ghouls ' n '
Ghosts actually sniped it from someplace else .
It might have been Dragon Buster , which I conveniently mentioned earlier in this wall of text .
Advertisement
Why in the flaming hell could you double jump in Dragon Buster ?
Some old arcade game connoisseur is probably going to lecture me for this .
I do n't care .
The feature is superfluous .
You jump , and then you jump again .
In Super Mario Bros. 3 , you can land slowly by flapping a raccoon tail as you jump .
Okay .
That feature probably came out of the same psychological place as mushrooms that make a man instantly grow to twice his size .
The feeling of using a raccoon tail to float is not without nuance .
You need to press the button repeatedly ; the desperation of Mario 's situation on the screen translates into the desperation of your fingers , translates into the desperate solution on the screen .
The best games play desperation ping - pong with us .
In Super Mario World , it 's arguably dumbed down :
When Mario is wearing a cape , you just hold a button , and he floats slowly down .
Advertisement
In Super Mario World , you can kind of double - jump , by jumping off Yoshi's back .
That does n't count as a true double jump , because you can't do it any time , at will .
No , the first Real Double Jump in games was in Super Ghouls ' n ' Ghosts , in which King Arthur fights zombies and monsters in an effort to rescue a princess who you see in the opening scene , so you do n't feel too bad if you give up without ever rescuing her ( most people do ) .
In Super Ghouls ' n ' Ghosts , you jump , and then you jump again .
You can do this whenever you want .
The Japanese instruction manual calls this the " Harrier Jump " .
The distinction is important .
The Harrier Jump only allows you to increase the vertical element of your jump .
It 's so full of nuance it 's almost sick .
Before a certain point in your jump trajectory , you can't initiate the Harrier Jump ; past a certain point in your jump trajectory , you can't initiate the Harrier Jump .
You have a short window .
And anytime you do it , all it does is boost you up vertically .
Advertisement
It constitutes a huge risk .
You can survive two hits before suffering scary death in this game .
Enemies and their projectile spawn litter the screen .
You need to master the precise feel of the Harrier Jump in order to use it effectively .
" Effectively " means any manner that wo n't get you killed .
Super Ghouls ' n '
Ghosts represents an important point in the timeline of action game evolution because the idea of an idiot - savant playing entirely through it on his first try is damn near inconceivable to any self - respecting astropsychologist .
Learning to come to grips with the " feel " of the character is even more essential in this game than in the earliest Castlevania titles .
You could conceive of someone accidentally understanding all of the necessary skills of the first Castlevania game between the castle door and the first zombie .
Super Ghouls ' n ' Ghosts is too chaotic .
Advertisement
The funny thing is , after Super Ghouls ' n ' Ghosts , people started generally making easier games .
They did not , however , stop making games with double jumps .
I said earlier that even if a savant played through Super Mario Bros .
on one life on his first try , he would still understand and maybe appreciate the unsettling feelings of challenge .
A psychological Grand Canyon separates Super Mario Bros. from Super Ghouls ' n ' Ghosts in this regard , and a psychological Pacific Ocean separates Super Ghouls ' n '
Ghosts from every other game that has sniped the double - jump feature .

Sensing an opportunity to make " more money " on a " new game console " , Konami set about making Castlevania : Symphony of the Night " something different . "
The market research apparently showed that Role - Playing Games were popular , and previous Castlevania games , such as the acclaimed Castlevania III : Dracula 's Curse had flirted with non-linearity , multiple playable characters , and development of said characters .
So Symphony of the Night emerged as a kind of lumbering RPG / action game chimera .

Symphony of the Night is one of the names that gets thrown around whenever fourteen - year - olds argue about the " best game ever . "
One of the names it gets thrown against with great vigor is Super Metroid .
If you ask me , both of these are very nice games , maybe even great games , though neither of them is the best game ever , because they are deceptive and insincere .
You might as well just go ahead and declare The Jam 's cover of the " Batman " theme song the " best rock song ever , " if you 're going to say Symphony of the Night is the " best game ever " .
Maybe I confused someone when I said that .
I 'm sorry .
Though my extemporaneous prose style might lead you to believe otherwise , I am actually a proponent of simple , clean , shimmering game mechanics .
I like games to be about progress .
About moving forward , either by chunking forward , clunking forward , frickting forward , crunching forward , or whatever have you .
I do n't like when games glide on by , and I do n't like it when they throw me against the wall , nor do I like it when they waste my time .
I especially do n't like when they piss on my lawn and say they 're the sprinkler repairman .
My favorite game of all - time is Out of This World , which I understand a lot of people pretend to like .
I am not pretending .

What 's disingenuous about Symphony of the Night ?
It has a double - jump .
The double - jump is something it gives you later in the game .
Prior to getting the ability that enables the double jump , you might have come across a wall or obstacle just too high for you to jump over .
So the game gives you this supernatural power , tosses off an in - game - world explanation for its existence , and then you 're off .
You get the double jump ability , you test it out .
You sure can jump high !
This should help you get somewhere previously unreachable .
Maybe you get the double jump ability and turn the game off ( unlikely — getting new abilities , market research shows , instantly renews a player 's interest in the game ) .
Maybe you leave the game turned off for several weeks .
When you turn it back on , you sure as hell can't remember where any previously - too - tall obstacles had been .
So you open the map , and check out where the " explored " areas end .
You can " solve " the " overlying puzzle " of the game by going to every dead end and seeing if the reason for your previous failure to explore that area had anything to do with not possessing the double jump ability .
Eventually , with every little ability the game gives you ( the ability to turn into mist , et cetera ) , you can solve every level - design - centered " puzzle " in the game .
It 's not so much solving a puzzle as unraveling a sweater .
Now , of course , this game has neat little action challenges , too , and monsters to kill .
It 's just — there are no Castlevania staircases .
All the stairs are Super Mario Bros. stairs — you have to jump to get up each stair — or they 're bland inclines .
The game takes the Castlevania wallpaper and transplants it into a wider - audience - friendly game .
People love this sort of stuff .
They love watching numbers go up .
Why ?
I guess I can understand .
I have this tape measure that I can operate with one hand .
It has a little fastener on it .
I can put it around my waist or chest or upper arm , and measure the growth of my muscles .
I measure them every Sunday night , to see if my week in the gym paid off , and how .
Grinding is part of life .
It can be for money or for health .
Then it finds its way into our entertainment .
People like watching numbers go up in RPGs , they like watching their dudes do more damage .
They like getting new items in Zelda so that they can use them to defeat previously invincible enemies , or bridge previously impassable chasms .
Symphony of the Night gives players the ability to double jump before giving them the ability to turn into mist , before giving them the ability to fly like a bat , all in the name of making different areas accessible .
The player eventually comes to sense his " ownership " of the game environment .
This type of lock and key game design , super - commonly called " gating , " is all over , and it works on lots of people .

Why does n't it work on me ?
I do n't know .
I 'm not pretending , here : It 's never worked on me .
I also never believed in Santa Claus , the Easter Bunny , the Tooth Fairy , or God .
I 've never been scared during a horror movie .
I guess I 'm the target audience for the " Saw " movies .
It 's like , when I fight a really hard boss and am then awarded with a double jump ability that allows me to jump over a tall wall way back earlier in the world of the game , all I can think about is how dumb it is that I 'm tracking back through the easier segment of the game , only now it 's maybe a little easier because I can jump higher .
I 'm actually fairly confident in saying that the earlier areas of Symphony of the Night are n't any easier because of the double jump , though let 's imagine for a second that they were .
Now , when you jump over that tall wall and enter the next part of the castle , maybe the enemies in there are harder , meaner , or stronger than the enemies were in previous areas .
Usually , they 're just stronger .
That means , if they hit you , they do more damage .
If you 've already gotten good at avoiding taking damage , that might not matter so much .
Why would you want to make the game easy after a hard part ?
That 's weird .
That 's like shuffling a deck of cards , asking me to put them in order , and then taking them back when I 'm done and immediately shuffling them again as soon as you 've confirmed that they are indeed in the right order .
It 's not sincere .
It 's mean .
If I need a break from the game , I 'll pause it .
You know what 's a good way to handle this sort of thing in an action game ?
Split the game up into combat - heavy segments and then exploration segments .
Uncharted 2 does this fairly well — it 's fairly evenly striped : action , exploration , action , exploration .

I said that escalating skill acquisition makes people feel like they " own " a game world or character .
It never makes me feel that way .
I know the game is n't real .
I know I 'm just playing a game .
When a Zelda game gives you the hookshot and teaches you how to use it over the course of a fairly long dungeon , it feels like something .
And then , later in the game , you 're in a dungeon , fighting some monsters .
There 's a spike pit .
On the other side of the spike pit is a panel on a wall .
You know that this panel is the kind of panel you can hookshot over to .
You kill the monsters , open the menu , choose the hookshot , aim it , and pull yourself over .
This is what bothers me :
There 's no risk .
There 's just a reward .
You open the menu , choose the hookshot , and grapple over .
The " challenge " is " remember what this thing is ? "
The " solution " is " open the menu and equip the hookshot " .
The reward is invariably " Yay Unlocked : You Are Going Where the Game Designers Want You To Go " .
In Super Mario 64 , we have a righteous double jump of justice , its reward being twice the height of a single jump , its risk being that you need enough solid ground in front of you to properly land and use precise timing in order to execute it .
Then you have the triple jump .
And you have the amazing sliding long jump , and the excellent wall jump , and the delicio - awesome squatting super - high jump : these all have their own little unique physical quirks .
They are available to you , the player , from the very start of the game .
The game is so confident that just moving the character is fun and can provide for a million great level design situations that it gives you a playground to move around in freely right at the beginning of the game .
( Quick aside : why does n't New Super Mario Bros. feature the sliding long jump ?
That 's the greatest , best , and tastiest jump , damn it ! )
Advertisement
Then we have psychological accidents like Banjo - Kazooie , where you have to earn the double - jump , and Donkey Kong 64 , where if I 'm not mistaken you have to collect a few hundred items simply to unlock the regular jump and attack functions ( that 's a joke ( not a good one ) ) .
This is all in the name of " replay value , " all in the name of hinting at an illusion of depth .
Though I tell you , man , every time a game like Zelda makes me take out the hookshot and use it because , what the hell , the dungeon designer figured that you might not have used it in a while , or the game designer might not want you to be doing the dungeons out of order , every time a so - totally - not - the - game - of - the - decade game like BioShock shows me a guy standing in water and then has a voice - over chew my ear off with hints about how I can equip my lightning ability to electrocute people standing in water , all it does is strip away a layer of the wallpaper , and reveal another layer of wallpaper underneath .
Playing games like these , I always get the impression that it 's all wallpaper , and no walls .
All reward , no risk .
And , most importantly , it 's never my choice .
Moments like these reveal — to me — a weird little inferiority complex .
The games are deadly desperate to mask their existences as merely simulations of making some character move .
And you know what ?
Noticing how flimsy some games are kind of makes me hate all games .
Uncharted 2 makes me press the X button just to step up onto any platform higher than the hero 's waist .
Zelda : Ocarina of Time let me pull myself up just by walking toward such a platform .
Why Uncharted 2 makes me press a button is wholly understandable :
It makes me feel like I 'm doing something .
It 's great , and it works , though if I 'm having a bad day ( most days ( so lonely ) ) , I might be in a mood to sit there and think that 's dumb .
It 's basically like , you 're making me press a button just to move .
Is n't that what the analog stick is for ?
And then , the devil on my left shoulder realizes that there is n't an angel on my right shoulder and decides to say something halfway nice :
Would you rather the game 's hero be a gray sphere in a world full of other gray spheres ?
And sometimes I 'm feeling in the mood to say " Yes !
I would ! "
And then there are those times in Uncharted when there 's a " puzzle " , when the character says " Hmm , I bet if we do something here in this room , we could open the way forward " , and I 'm like , " I 'm pretty sure all I have to do is look at the place I 'm supposed to go and then scan the walls for hand - holds , and then try to find where the lowest hand - hold is so that I can then jump onto a box or something and start climbing over there . "
Can't I just have an " I get it " button ?
Sometimes , as Nathan Drake himself says halfway through Uncharted 2 , " I 'm so tired of climbing shit . "
The " I get it " button — listen to me , over here .
Before someone tells me I should go watch a movie , or something , I 'll tell myself .

( Quick Aside : Hey , why has n't EA Sports ever made a marathon running game ? )
(( Quick Aside # 2 : If Sega approached the next 3D Sonic the Hedgehog game from the jumping - off point of " Hold a button to accelerate " , maybe they could get somewhere . ) )

So here 's a big , ugly problem .
Gating manifestations such as earned double jump techniques have become , in and of themselves , traditions .
In The Legend of Zelda : A Link to the Past , you do n't actually have to get the blue or red clothes , which increase Link 's defensive power .
However , in Super Metroid , you do have to get the Varia Suit in order to survive the high temperatures of Norfair .
When and why did this shift happen ?
A basic law of capitalism is that businesses need to grow every year , or they 're not doing it right .
I have a friend who makes clothing by hand .
Her business is growing steadily in popularity , gaining a larger helping of fame with every passing month due to her devotion to making original clothing by hand with a staff of fewer than ten .
The more famous her brand gets , the more the demand grows .
The more the demand grows , the more tempted she is to hire more staff and make more clothing .
However , she knows she would be spreading herself too thin .
World fame means people would be ordering her clothes from around the world , consistently depleting her stock to zero while removing the clothes entirely from the streets of Tokyo , the place where word - of - mouth spawned its original popularity .
If her business stays the same size , then imitators , backed by larger companies , will step in to make similar clothes and sell them at lower prices to a wider audience .
The decision is to either stick to your guns and keep doing what you do , until eventually someone else does it better , for more people , or " sell out " and grow , possibly alienating your friends and definitely inspiring competition .
At the end of the day , it 's sheer luck of the draw that something like a fashion brand manages to survive as " the real thing " in a sea of imitators with all its original intentions intact .

Back in 2002 , Sega released a followup to their Panzer Dragoon series .
Panzer Dragoon Orta was developed by Smilebit , of Jet Set Radio , who were not the original developers of the Panzer Dragoon series .
The previous shooting game in the series , Zwei , had been a masterpiece .
It was all about shooting — pointing , aiming , shooting , locking on , firing crazy missiles .
The challenge ramped up evenly , until eventually the game was coasting up into the stratosphere of sweetness .
Depending on your play style , the dragon your avatar rides would change shape and color at the end of every stage .
It was neat .
The overall game did n't change much :
You were still flying , and shooting .
Orta was not nearly as good a game , probably because the new developers figured they had to " add " something to the game , or die .
So they added this thing where you had three types of dragons : the big one , the medium one , and the little one .
The big one was painfully slow and fired powerful shots and devastating lock - on shots .
The medium one could move alright , and fire pretty good shots and normal lock - on shots .
The little dragon was really fast , and could only fire weak regular shots .
What you do in Panzer Dragoon Orta is you press a button to change the type of dragon you are at any given time .
However , there are parts of the game that are literally impossible to pass without taking damage unless you change into the speedy little dragon , just as there are parts where only the big dragon 's lock - on fire can hurt a certain type of enemy .
This is beyond the game designers saying , " Hey , check out this thing you can do " — it 's them saying , " Hey , we made this cool thing for you to do , and now you have to do it or die . "
Super Mario Bros.
never made you throw a fireball , and people loved it !

The train of thought seems to be that games are like businesses .
They 're not .
Games are much more like films than fast food chains .
Like , well , the film industry is hooked on remakes , and sequels , too .
You know what is like a business , though ?
The games industry .
You know , all Orta needed to be was Zwei with better graphics and maybe better level design .
Advertisement
Then again , we 've established that some video game developers still do n't " believe in " level design .
This would be like a film studio saying a movie did n't need a script — just put the actors in front of a green screen , tell them they 're in the desert and that they 're thirsty , and see what they come up with .
SHOW THE PLAYER SOMETHING HE CAN'T DO
Many games show the player something he can't do , only to let him do it later .
Zelda games will usually show you doors you can't reach , only to allow you to access them later via use of some item .
Lots of the time , in Zelda games , the finally accessed room or cave leads to some optional item , like a piece of a heart container — collect four ( or five , these days ) to increase your maximum hit points by one .
Zelda games manage to be quite thrilling in spite of themselves , sometimes , despite all the weird disconnects running rampant .
You might be able to see the entrance to a cave , and just not possess the ability to hookshot over to it .
Sometimes , you get the hookshot , swing over , enter the cave , and see a wall that requires a bomb for you to open .
Sometimes it feels really good to throw down a bomb and uncover the loot — like a real good experience in the toilet .

However , it strikes me that games , these days , use these weird gating techniques so that they do n't have to bother thinking about how their game is laid out , or even what 's in their game .
Why can't every game have one Really Fun Thing in it , like the Portal Gun in Portal ?
Sometimes , though , gating the player beyond his will can still translate into a wonderful game experience .
Dragon Quest famously shows players locked doors in the earliest stage of the game that you 'll return to every time you get a new key , just to be told that the key does n't fit .
Eventually , when you get the key that fits , it feels like something huge .
Dragon Quest games also have characters with personalities and histories .
The story moves forward , and time ripens in the world of the game .
When the time is right , the key is yours .
Advertisement
Then there are games like Final Fantasy VI .
I loved that game .
It was about something — a Dickensian , fantasy history opera - thing .
It told you a story , and eventually it gave you keys to the world and told you to solve the puzzle .
In the second half of the game , all the characters are spread apart .
You play as one character bent on killing the despot ruling the world .
You can go straight to him and try to kill him if you want .
You probably wo n't be able to .
Or you can fly around the world in your big flying boat and try to reunite your party members .
If you go for that , that 's literally tens of hours of game , right there .
They 're not side - quests :
They 're optional game segments .
LET'S TALK ABOUT SPEED
I 'm going to begin to turn this cruise ship back around !
Be prepared :
I 'm going to copy and paste ( and bold the interesting parts of ) a paragraph from the Wikipedia page about Symphony of the Night , which is , among other things , longer than the Wikipedia entry about the film " Patton " , which was , incidentally , the only film that my father 's father , who loathed entertainment in all forms ( except those tobacco - related ) had ever watched in its entirety ( and he watched it twice ) :
Symphony of the Night has a liberal control scheme compared to its predecessors in the Castlevania franchise .
Aside from attacking , jumping , and basic movement , Alucard is inherently able to perform both a downward flying - kick and a back - dash .
While the downward kick may never be discovered or employed by a player , the back - dash ( activated by a single button press ) is an easily employed method of evading enemy attacks .
Because it is faster than Alucard 's normal walking speed , a player may back - dash as a slightly faster method of travel through the flatter areas of the castle .
Yet another use of the back - dash is attack canceling , a technique common in fighting games : by activating the dash just after an attack lands Alucard 's attack animation is interrupted , allowing the player to bypass the attack 's recovery animation and instead perform another action .
Evasive dash moves also appear in later Igarashi - produced Castlevania titles .

Do you find yourself doing things like this in videogames ?
I find myself doing it all the time .
I might have mentioned before that my first priority when playing a new game is to make it look as ridiculous as possible .
Usually , all this requires is to twirl the analog stick in circles and marvel at the lack of a cornering animation ( which , remarkably , Bayonetta has — maybe that 's why Famitsu gave it a 40/40 ) .
I do n't make games look dumb because I am a mean person — no , I do it tentatively , like dipping my toe into a swimming pool .
I want to know if it 's safe to let myself go ahead and be immersed into the experience .
I do n't want to jump in only to find out later that I can conjure intense silliness out of thin air at a crucial part of the game .
Advertisement
Sometimes , like in Symphony of the Night or Super Mario Sunshine , there 's a weird little game mechanic like the back - step or the belly slide that allow you to move through the game at a far breezier speed .
This makes the game look ridiculous ; however , once you realize just how efficient it is , you will find yourself unable to stop doing it .
Of course , the developers do n't intend you to do this , though it'd be hard to believe the testers did n't discover it and do it themselves .
This sort of thing has built up to a weird crescendo , of late .
Games like Star Ocean 4 give you a run ability partway through the game , and then let you use it all you want .
The run ability happens to look ridiculous .
If you keep jabbing the button , it looks like your guy is having a seizure at the speed of sound , just floating frictionlessly along the ground .
I mean , this thing was programmed in intentionally .
You will never be penalized for using it .
And it looks ridiculous .
Therefore , we must conclude that the developers wanted it to look ridiculous , maybe because ridiculous - looking fast methods of travel existed in popular games like Super Mario Sunshine .
Advertisement
This is getting weird .
It 's way too weird , now .
Why would you want a feature like that ?
Why would you think that the kids would be enraged if you did n't have a feature like that ?
Then we have games like Oblivion , where the player has the option to just open the menu at any time and warp anywhere in the game world at the touch of a button .
They call this " quick travel " or " fast travel " .
It 's the video - game - world equivalent of a word processor 's " search " function .
Hey , consider this , genius game developers :
When your game world is so large that fast - traveling within friendly areas is considered a necessary design element , maybe your slow travel sucks and / or your game world carries the tone of a theme park after hours , with you playing the role of a widowed octogenarian with a broom and dustpan .

THE ACTION BUTTON
Games are active forms of entertainment , mainly about movement .
Movement is the point of games .
It should be fun .
Films are static , and can be about anything , really , so long as they have a beginning , a middle , and an end .
My favorite game of 2009 might be Canabalt , which is about a guy running from an unseen threat .
We never see the threat , though we do n't doubt its scary nature , because our guy is running so fast that he literally can't stop .
All we do is jump .
The presentation is beautiful .
Just looking at this game , you can say it 's a complete piece of work .
You need only glimpse three seconds of it in action to know the full scope .
You do n't even need to see the character die to know that death is imminent , and that , maybe , this guy 's attempt at escape is futile .
It tells you a neat little story , and impresses you with a cute little catharsis , in about as much time as it takes you to tap your finger on an iPhone screen .

When you jump through windows , glass shatters with a perfect sound effect ; when you land on a roof where white doves are perched , they scatter randomly and flutter away .
Then we 've got Kingdom Hearts II , where you have two buttons : Yay and Awesome .
Press
Yay , and your hero just completely flips the fuck out all over the screen .
Keep pressing it and eventually all the enemies will evaporate .
Sometimes , a huge triangle appears on the screen .
Press the Awesome Button to make Something Awesome happen .
Then there 's Bayonetta , where , sometimes — it 's like a pachinko jackpot , really — you can summon a " torture attack " , where you press a button within a somewhat lenient window , causing an iron maiden or guillotine to materialize out of nowhere and destroy an enemy .
How does this work ?
Well , of course , the story deals with supernatural things , so just take the game 's word for it — our heroine is a person who can materialize torture devices out of nowhere , just because , why the hell not ?

In Shenmue , they called these Quick Timer Events .
In the current Japanese games industry , they call them Action Button Events .
ABEs are a cancer in the duodenum of game design .
They 're all over God of War and , well , anything else , really .
Sometimes , even fantastic games like Uncharted 2 wedge these in , only in dull no -risk situations .
Like , you have to crank a lever to open a door , and you have to crank it really hard , so you have to press a button a whole bunch of times .
Maybe this is to keep players from getting through the door before killing all of the enemies in the area , in which case I guess it 's kind of neat , because it adds context to something ( having to kill all the enemies in an area before being allowed into the next area ) that many games sometimes do n't give context for .

Developer Ninja
Theory put an ABE about three seconds into their game Heavenly Sword , prompting Ninja Gaiden director Tomonobu Itagaki to call the game a load of bullshit .
Itagaki reported that ABEs were a waste of time .
Representatives of Ninja
Theory said that ABEs are used to make the player feel like he is part of the dynamic cinematics happening on the screen , rather than sit passively as an audience member .
Itagaki did n't comment further .
He very well could have .
I 'm no Itagaki - worshipper , though I like to think his games exhibit a stellar sense of being in control of your character , and they manage to let you do all kinds of sweet little things like intuitively run up walls .
Then again , Itagaki also once said that Resident Evil 4 sucked because your guy had to stand in place to shoot , and that was " unrealistic " ; the man obviously learned the majority of his life lessons from John Woo films and / or Contra III : The Alien Wars , so maybe I 'm giving him too much credit .
( Just kidding , Itagaki !
Call me !
( Do n't say you do n't have my phone number ( even though you do n't ( it 's such a boring excuse ) ) . )
Publisher From Software , in the same year that they released the excellent Demon 's Souls , put out a misunderstood little ABE - heavy ninja game called Ninja Blade .
Do n't play it — it sucks .
Oh , that was mean .
Well , it does some neat things , at least .
Early in the game , there 's a boss that spits shock waves at you .
You have to run down a hallway , dodging the shock waves .
Get to the end of the hall , and you can wail on the boss .
Eventually , he does the shock wave thing again .
Now the camera zooms into your character .
He 's got his sword against the shock wave .
Press the sword button repeatedly to push against the shock wave with your blade .
When the camera zooms out , you find that your dude has been pushed down the hall .
If you failed to hit the button enough , you might be pushed all the way back to the end of the hall , meaning you 'll have to dodge all those shock waves again .
This is neat — a progressive ABE .
Advertisement
Then there are moments like in Dead Space , where a monster grabs your leg with some tentacle .
After a moment , you realize that despite the cinematic camera angle , you can still aim and shoot your gun .
Uncharted 2 does the same thing a couple of times .
It always manages to feel kind of neat .
" The ideal game " , I guess , would be a sublime mix of rock - solid game mechanics and lots of neat little interactive movie sequences where you 're basically doing only things that your character does repeatedly in the game ( like shooting ) .
Advertisement
ABEs are designed to allow the player to " feel " ( not " be totally " ) " in control " of something far more nuanced and dynamic than what goes on in the game .
Maybe we 'll be seeing a BioWare RPG at some point soon , where dialogue is all ABE - activated .
That could be hilarious .
Right now , we have games like Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2 , games centered on simple though deep play mechanics and an online community element .
Though we In The Know know that the makers of Left 4 Dead are also genuine crafters of entertainment masterpieces like Half - Life .
Valve is shrewdly using Left 4 Dead to boost their reputation .
One day , they 'll make a big - scale Half - Life - level event again , and " artistic conscience " will enter the feature snipers ' list of " things to watch . "
Maybe overnight — or maybe over a couple of nights — everything in the games industry will change .

RUBIK'S CUBING ON THE BUS
When I was in a hospital recently , I noticed lines of colored tape on the floor .
At one junction , the red and purple tape veered off to the left , and the orange and blue tape veered off to the right ; the black and green tape pointed the way forward .
No doubt these lines of tape point out the way to various departments of the hospital , guaranteeing that those in charge of transporting patients get them to a doctor 's care as quickly as possible .

When I was in Shanghai last month , I noticed that every street sign contains a compass , pointing out which direction you are headed , and on which street .
One of the things that originally helped me decide to live in Japan was the feeling of being able to get lost .
Tokyo has very few named streets , and everyone navigates by landmarks .
I know my way around by now , and I rely on fabricated entertainment to fulfill my desire to get lost in something .
Lately , it 's the old Russian novels .
I read both Anna Karenina and War and Peace while riding trains , planes , taxicabs , or toilets during 2009 .
Why do games always have to have mini-maps and navigation arrows ?
Mini-maps are the game equivalent of dozens of dog-eared pages in a thousand - page book .
Ten years ago , mini-maps felt like game -y touches ; now , in the era of GPS , it makes them feel too real .
Games are an escape from a world where jumping is not a mode of transportation ; why is movement always something handled in such a businesslike fashion ?
Why mini-maps ?
Why fast travel ?
Fast travel is a quiet admission that the Slow Travel Is n't Always Fun .
Why ca n't the Slow Travel always be fun ?
Did you ever play Breath of Fire III on the PlayStation ?
There was a part where you have to navigate through a desert by the stars .
Okay , so that part probably infuriated a lot of people — not me , though !
These days , we 've got great graphics — why not give me big horizon - filling landmarks , and make them be my only guide ?
Let me figure things out , let me enjoy moving .

Two more things : last year , I was on a subway train that stopped in a tunnel in mid-voyage .
Across from me sat a woman who was busy tooling with a Rubik 's Cube .
She had a knit in the center of her forehead and was biting her bottom lip so hard I was on edge , waiting for blood .
She had no idea what she was doing .
No rhythm , no reason .
She was just clicking that thing around like crazy .
At one point , the announcer came on to apologize — apparently someone had committed suicide in front of the train before ours , so we would be held up for a little while .
The woman looked up , just then , and saw me looking at her .
Instantly , her face turned red .
She got up , ran to the next car of the train , in which there were no available seats , and stood with her back to the glass , continuing to click around on the Rubik 's Cube .
Then , two nights ago , I stood on the same subway train , going in the opposite of the direction I 'd been going a year ago .
Seated in a corner was a clearly autistic man , quickly solving and then unsolving a Rubik 's Cube using a tried and true method .
He might have been a tournament - level Rubik 's Cube solver .
The thing is , once you know the method , it 's just a matter of plugging away .
Did you know there are kids who speed - run Portal ?
That 's so weird .
I looked at that guy and I thought about the woman in the train roughly a year ago , and I thought about people 's grandmothers pretending to like Wii Sports simply because they relished the opportunity to converse with their grandchildren , and I realize that , really , any given one of us , at any given time on any given day , is a mere psychological molecule away from being that guy , repeatedly solving and unsolving a Rubik 's Cube on a bus or train .

Five men have been cleared of raping a woman after it emerged she had spoken online about group sex fantasies .
The 24 - year - old from Liverpool claimed she was raped after visiting one of the men at his home in Bolton , after making contact on the internet .
But the trial at Preston Crown Court collapsed when computer evidence was produced showing her entertaining the prospect of group sex .
Judge Robert Brown ordered the jury to return not guilty verdicts .
Prosecutor Michael Leeming told a jury the case involved allegations of rape and conspiracy to rape at a house in Great Lever , Bolton , on 19 June .
' Wholly different light '
But he formally offered no evidence after reading excerpts of MSN chatlogs of her conversations before the alleged offence .
He said : " It is right to say that there is material in the chatlogs from the complainant , who is prepared to entertain ideas of group sex with strangers , where to use her words ' her morals go out of the window ' .
" This material does paint a wholly different light as far as this case is concerned .
" We take the view that it would not be appropriate to offer any evidence . "
Not to put too fine a point on it , her credibility was shot to pieces
Judge Robert Brown Judge Brown ordered the jury to return not guilty verdicts for rape and conspiracy to rape against five men .
They were : Kelvin Chinakwe , 26 , of Brook Hey Avenue , Bolton ; Olatunji Owolabi , 28 , of Bradbourne Close , Great Lever ; Afolabi Sanyaolu , 29 , of Laburnum Road , London ; Senthil Venkatachalam , 30 , of Wigan Road , Deane , Bolton ; and Funsho Bello , 26 , of Atherstone , Rochdale .
A sixth man - Ganiyn Conteh , 32 , of Abbeywood Avenue , Abbey Hey , Manchester - was formally cleared of conspiracy to rape .
The woman said she had agreed to visit Mr Owolabi after meeting him on MSN .
She alleged she wanted to just have sex with him , but was then raped by the others .
Judge Brown told the jury : " This case depended on the complainant 's credibility .
" Not to put too fine a point on it , her credibility was shot to pieces . "

In this story of the early days of daylight bombing raids over Nazi Germany , General Frank Savage must take command of a " hard luck " bomber group .
Much of the story deals with his struggle to whip his group into a disciplined fighting unit in spite of heavy losses , and withering attacks by German fighters over their targets .
Actual combat footage is used in this tense war drama .

Those of you who are regular readers of Ars ' science content are probably aware of our use of Digital Object Identifiers , or DOIs , which act as online reference information , taking readers directly to the papers being discussed .
Readers almost never comment about that feature , except when it fails , in which case we invariably hear about it — and it fails at least once a month .
We 've tried explaining both our reasons for using them and the reasons they break in the forums , and have recently linked to Ed Yong 's excellent discussion of the system and its problems .
Within a week , we were dealing with complaints due to a broken DOI .
So , this is an attempt to provide a comprehensive description of the DOI system , why we use it , and why it does n't always work smoothly .
Referencing , effort , and reward
For most of our readership , reading an Ars science article is the beginning and end of their exposure to a topic .
But we also have a notable population of scientists who read , and they may find themselves interested in reading the academic paper that led to our coverage .
There are any number of good reasons for doing that : the paper may be relevant to their work , they may want details we did not provide in our coverage , they suspect we might have gotten something wrong and want to correct us , etc .
As a result , some form of reference to the paper is a definite good — it's a benefit for some of our readership , and may help correct errors that are read by the rest of our audience .
Traditionally , academic references have been handled with text that identifies ( at a minimum ) the journal , authors , and time of publication .
There are several problems with using this .
For starters ( as anyone who can remember the pre-PubMed days knows ) , it 's error prone .
Since it 's a lot of work to get right , it would add significantly to the workload of our authors , who already go well beyond the call of duty when it comes to effort .
It also adds to the effort involved in navigating to the appropriate issue of the journal and finding the paper , so it does n't serve our readership .
Finally , this approach is simply becoming obsolete .
Many online - only journals , including a number from the Public Library of Science , have given up on the idea of publishing in volumes and issues — when a paper is ready , they simply publish it .
It 's also future - proof , as DOI 's should still function if scientific publishing switches to video or some format you can just download directly to your brain .
The DOI system as a solution
For precisely this reason , PLoS handles publishing documents using DOIs .
Each manuscript , prior to publication , is given a string that acts as a unique identifier and helps you locate the document .
In short , it is a reference , updated for the digital age .
If you have a DOI , you can visit dx.doi.org , plug it in , and you will be taken to the paper .
This will happen even if the journal that originally published it has changed names , changed owners , or moved its servers to a different country .
Better yet , you can simply append the DOI to dx.doi.org , and you 'll be redirected to the document .
This works because the first portion of a DOI identifies the organization that owns the document , and what the relevant URL is .
So , if a publisher decides to move or rename their server , they can simply update the DOI record for that organization , pointing it to the new location .
On the receiving end , the second part of the DOI record comes in , as the server must implement a document resolver that takes the unique identifier and directs a browser to the appropriate document .
If everything 's working properly , the DOI system should be the perfect balance of convenience ( it 's relatively easy to create a DOI link for an article ) and utility ( the link is more convenient than a traditional reference , and more likely to persist than a standard URL to a publisher 's website ) .
Why DOIs fail
If it 's the perfect system , why the regular complaints that a DOI is n't working ?
To begin with , a DOI does n't eliminate the possibility of error , either on our end or at the journal's .
We simply copy and paste the DOI from the original document , however , so the errors on our end have been rare .
Instead , problems typically arise because , as press , we 're given full access to both papers and their DOIs well before they appear online .
Most journals provide this access under an embargo : we agree not to release our articles until the time that the journals specify .
Unfortunately , even for the most fast - moving journals , that time is typically several hours before the actual articles appear on the journal 's website .
So , anyone who 's reading quickly is likely to find that the DOI fails .
But that rule only applies to the fast - moving journals , like Nature and Science .
Many other journals can take a few days between when they allow journalists to write about a paper and when it becomes available to the scientific community — PNAS , which is a major source of material for us , falls in that category .
Ed Yong noted one case where it took months .
Ethically , it 's debatable whether it makes sense to give journalists access to papers ahead of the community that those papers are intended to inform .
But it 's definitely not appropriate to allow extensive public commentary on a research publication without allowing any working scientists the opportunity to vet the accuracy of that commentary .
When the embargo lifts , the paper should be available .
If it 's not , your best course of action is n't a complaint to our writers or in our forums .
It 's to contact the journal involved , and let them know that their system is creating problems .
Unless they hear from the community that they are ostensibly serving ( scientists ) , they 'll have little impetus to fix the system .
The leading House Democrat on military policy said Friday that he opposes repealing the law that bans openly gay people from serving in the military .
Seventeen years ago , Rep. Ike Skelton ( D - Mo. ) played a major role in crafting the controversial law known as " Do n't ask , do n't tell . "
When President Bill Clinton William ( Bill ) Jefferson ClintonNew poll finds Biden narrowly leading Trump in Georgia Changing the climate of presidential debates Davis :
My advice to Joe Biden on eve of the debate — be Joe Biden MORE wanted to lift the ban preventing gay people from joining the military , Skelton opposed the move .
The end result was a compromise under which gay service members would conceal their sexual orientation .

Now , after Presidentpledged during his campaign and first year in office to repeal the law , Skelton finds himself on the opposite side once again .
" I am personally not for changing the law , " he said during a C - SPAN " Newsmakers " interview that will air Sunday .
Because the military is engaged in two major conflicts , in Afghanistan and Iraq , changing the law would create " disruption " that can cause some " serious problems , " Skelton said during the interview .
He said the full House Armed Services Committee wo n't hold a hearing on the repeal of the law .
Rather , the Personnel subcommittee will hold the hearing at some point this year .
Skelton also said he would oppose efforts to repeal the law in Congress — setting the stage for a potentially intense debate within his own committee with Democrats who want to see the law repealed .
Meanwhile , Skelton 's Senate counterpart , ( D - Mich . ) , said that the Senate Armed Services Committee will hold a hearing on the issue at the end of January .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Friday that he and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm .
Mike Mullen are prepared to testify before the Senate .
Gates said at a press briefing that there are continuing conversations within the Pentagon about " implementing the president 's intent . "
Obama has come under increasing pressure from gay - rights advocates to move on the repeal .
Gay - rights advocates are eyeing the change in law for this year , but it is unclear how Obama will proceed .
The Pentagon has moved slowly on the issue and there have been reports of internal dissent on how fast changes to the law should be instituted .

A California company is set to read human genomes for a price that many individuals could afford , but will they understand the results ?
( Image : Wikimedia Commons )
The price of sequencing a human genome is about to plummet .
A company called Complete Genomics , based in Mountain View , California , says it can read entire human genomes at $ 5000 a shot .
When James Watson – co-discoverer of the DNA double - helix – became the first individual to have his genome sequenced , in 2007 , the cost was around $ 1 million .
But several companies are now working on advanced technologies to allow faster and cheaper sequencing .
Last year , for instance , Applied Biosystems of Foster City , California , announced that it had sequenced the genome of a Nigerian man for less than $ 60,000 .

Complete Genomics says it can beat that cost by more than a factor of 10 , and it is putting its business plan where its mouth is : companies and academic researchers will be able to start placing orders at the quoted $ 5000 price tag from June this year .
Try before you buy
When New Scientist interviewed Watson in 2007 , he predicted a revolution in understanding human genetic variation once reading each person ’s genome “ gets down to the cost of a Chevrolet ” .
Complete Genomics ’ sequences will be cheaper than many second - hand cars , and prospective customers can now kick the tyres of the company ’s product – CG ’s first human genome sequence has been released on its website .
The initial genome sequence , announced on 5 February at the Advances in Genome Biology and Technology meeting on Marco Island , Florida , is from a blood sample collected in 1980 from a 63 - year - old man from Utah .
“ This is as good a quality genome as has ever been produced , ” claims Clifford Reid , the company ’s president .
There is scope for improvement , however , as meeting attendees have noted that the technology has problems dealing with repetitive DNA sequences .
The company ’s technology relies on immobilising amplified fragments of DNA on a high - density silicon array , so that the fragments ’ sequences can be read quickly and efficiently .
To do this , circles of DNA about 230 bases long are copied multiple times to form “ nanoballs ” that stick to the array .
Price no barrier
The first customers are likely to be academic researchers interested in uncovering the genetic roots of complex conditions such as cardiovascular disease , and drug firms that want to understand how genetic variation affects people ’s responses to their products .
But as prices continue to come down , the technology could also be attractive to companies that are already offering more limited genome scans to members of the public .
Such companies are currently studying up to a million single - letter variants in the genetic code known as single nucleotide polymorphisms .
Sean George , chief operating officer of Navigenics in Redwood Shores , California , expects his company to start offering genome sequencing to its customers by early next year – although no decision has yet been taken about which technology they will use .
So far , personal genome sequencing has been the preserve of the super - rich .
Knome of Cambridge , Massachusetts , today offers the service for $ 99,500 , through a contract with a team at the Beijing Genomics Institute in China .
X - Prize potential
One of Knome ’s founders is George Church , a specialist in sequencing technology at the Harvard Medical School in Boston , who is also an adviser to Complete Genomics .
Discussions are underway between the two firms .
Still , Knome president Jorge Conde warns that the price to its customers will remain higher than the basic cost of sequencing a genome , as much of the value comes from the expert analysis needed to interpret the sequence .
“ The average person cannot speak the language of As , Cs , Gs , and Ts , ” he says .
If Complete Genomics delivers as promised , the company could also be eligible for the Archon X Prize for Genomics , which will give $ 10 million for the first team to sequence 100 human genomes in less than 10 days for less than $ 10,000 each .
Complete Genomics has not yet entered the competition , however , as it intends to concentrate on fulfilling commercial orders .
The company aims to sequence up to 1000 human genomes in 2009 , and 20,000 in 2010 .
More and more homeowners in California are walking away from their mortgages , even though they can technically afford them .
This is a trend that 's been happening for awhile , but it 's picking up steam , and in part these homeowners see it as a big middle finger to the bailed - out banks .
LA Times :
[ Wynn ] Bloch paid $ 385,000 for the two - bedroom in 2006 , when prices were still surging .
Comparable homes are now selling in the low - $ 200,000s .
At 66 , the retired psychologist doubted she 'd see her investment rebound in her lifetime .
Plus , she said she was duped into an expensive loan .
The way she sees it , big banks that helped fuel the mess all got bailouts while small fry like her are left holding the bag .
No more .
" There was not a chance that house was ever going to be worth anywhere near what my mortgage was , " said Bloch , who is now renting a few miles away after defaulting on the $ 310,000 loan .
" I have n't cheated or stolen . "
Says Luigi Zingales in the piece : " The fact that people are strategically defaulting -- there is no question ...
The risk that the number of people doing this might explode is significant . "
Perhaps most worrisome , though , are the preliminary results of the multinational Interphone study sponsored by the International Agency for Research on Cancer , in Lyon , France .
( Scientists from thirteen countries took part in the study , the United States conspicuously not among them . )
Interphone researchers reported in 2008 that after a decade of cell - phone use , the chance of getting a brain tumor — specifically on the side of the head where you use the phone — goes up as much as 40 percent for adults .
Interphone researchers in Israel have found that cell phones can cause tumors of the parotid gland ( the salivary gland in the cheek ) , and an independent study in Sweden last year concluded that people who started using a cell phone before the age of 20 were five times as likely to develop a brain tumor .
Another Interphone study reported a nearly 300 percent increased risk of acoustic neuroma , a tumor of the acoustic nerve .
As more results of the Interphone study trickled out , I called Louis Slesin , who has a doctorate in environmental policy from MIT and in 1980 founded an investigative newsletter called Microwave News .
" No one in this country cared ! " Slesin said of the findings .
" It was n't news ! "
He suggested that much of the comfort of our modern lives depends on not caring , on refusing to recognize the dangers of microwave radiation .
" We love our cell phones .
The paradigm that there 's no danger here is part of a worldview that had to be put into place , " he said .
" Americans are not asking the questions , maybe because they do n't want the answers .
So what will it take ? "
To understand how radiation from cell phones and wireless transmitters affects the human brain , and to get some sense of why the concerns raised in so many studies outside the U.S. are not being seriously raised here , it 's necessary to go back fifty years , long before the advent of the cell phone , to the research of a young neuroscientist named Allan Frey .
In 1960 , Frey , then 25 , was working at General Electric 's Advanced Electronics Center at Cornell University when he was contacted by a technician whose job was to measure the signals emitted by radar stations .
At the time , Frey had taken an interest in the electrical nature of the human body , specifically in how electric fields affect neural functioning .
The technician claimed something incredible :
He said he could " hear " radar at one of the sites where he worked .
Frey traveled to the facility and stood in the radar field .
" And sure enough , I could hear it , too , " he said , describing the persistent low - level hum .
Frey went on to establish that the effect was real — electromagnetic ( EM ) radiation from radar could somehow be heard by human beings .
The " hearing , " however , did n't happen via normal sound waves perceived through the ear .
It occurred somewhere in the brain itself , as EM waves interacted with the brain 's cells , which generate tiny electrical fields .
This idea came to be known as the Frey effect , and it caused an uproar in the neuroscience community .
The waves that Frey was concerned with were those emitted from the nonionizing part of the EM spectrum — the part that scientists always assumed could do no outright biological damage .
When Frey began his research , it was assumed that the only way microwaves could have a damaging biological effect was if you increased the power of their signals and concentrated them like sword points — to the level where they could cook esh .
In 1967 , this resulted in the first popular microwave oven , which employed microwave frequencies at very high power , concentrated and contained in a metal box .
Aside from this engineered thermal effect , the signals were assumed to be safe .
The dengue virus is spread by infected female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes Scientists are breeding a genetically altered strain of mosquito in an effort to curb the spread of dengue fever .
The dengue virus is spread by the bite of infected female mosquitoes and there is no vaccine or treatment .
Experts say the illness affects up to 100 million people a year and threatens over a third of the world 's population .
Scientists hope their genetically altered males will mate with females to create female offspring that will inherit a gene limiting wing growth .
The study is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The scientists say their approach offers a safe , efficient alternative to harmful insecticides and could be used to stop other diseases spread by mosquitoes , like malaria .
Current dengue control methods are not sufficiently effective , and new ones are urgently needed
Researcher Professor Anthony James
They estimate that if released , the new breed could sustainably suppress the native mosquito population in six to nine months .
Researcher Professor Anthony James , of the University of California , Irvine , said : " Current dengue control methods are not sufficiently effective , and new ones are urgently needed .
" Controlling the mosquito that transmits this virus could significantly reduce human morbidity and mortality . "
Grounded
The plan is to release genetically - altered male mosquitoes who will mate with wild females and pass on their genes .
The scientists have shown that females of the next generation who inherit the gene are unable to fly because it interrupts normal wing growth .
Male carriers of the gene remain unaffected .
Lead researcher Luke Alphey , of the University of Oxford and his own spin - out company Oxitec Ltd , said the approach was highly targeted .
" The technology is completely species - specific , as the released males will mate only with females of the same species .
" Another attractive feature of this method is that it 's egalitarian - all people in the treated areas are equally protected , regardless of their wealth , power or education . "
Dr Hilary Ranson , of the Liverpool School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , said the work was a major step forward .
" This is a significant advance .
It will be logistically challenging to make and release enough of the male mosquitoes and it's not going to be cheap .
But it can be done with the right resources . "
She said dengue fever was an ideal disease to tackle in this way because it is spread by only a couple of species of mosquito .
She said malaria would be harder to beat because of the variety of mosquitoes carrying the disease .

The Australian Parliament website has again been shut down by hackers protesting against the Federal Government 's plans to block certain internet sites .
The website and another linked to the Department of Broadband and Communications were shut down for long periods yesterday after their servers were overloaded .
Both websites were offline again this morning .
A group of hackers calling itself Anonymous has claimed responsibility for the interruptions , which it has called Operation Titstorm .
Anonymous claims the attacks are also to highlight moves by the Government to ban the import of pornograhy featuring female ejaculation as well as small - breasted women over fears such films were simulating child pornography .
Critics say the Government 's internet filter amounts to censorship and will slow down internet speeds .
The Government says the filter is necessary to block websites containing child pornography and other criminal activity .

-- Genesis , " Second Home By the Sea " 1983 - 84 must seem the ultimate dream season to Oiler fans who were n't there .
Indeed it still feels that way to those of us who were .
Setting NHL records for team offence that remain unchallenged to this day , the mighty Oilers finished first overall by 15 (! ) points before racing through the playoffs to their first Stanley Cup .
Almost lost in that wonderful dream but not quite forgotten by at least one of us who survived it , was a brief but frightening nightmare which ended just before it hit the pavement .
Wayne Gretzky scored 100 goals all by himself that year ( including playoffs ) , an underappreciated feat which stands in my personal " Gretzky collection " as one of his greatest milestones .
The Great One dominated in all situations , leading the league in even - strength goals ( 55 ) , powerplay goals ( 20 ) , and shorthanded goals ( 12 ) .
He led the league in shooting percentage ( 26.9 % ) while finishing all the way down in second for shots on goal and game - winning goals .
Oh yeah , he led the league in goals , assists , points , and plus-minus with 87-118-205 , +76 .
I feel ' 83 - 84 was Gretzky 's greatest season : the year he was passed the torch as Oilers ' new captain , the year of the 51 - game scoring streak , the year he won his first Stanley Cup .
Great as they are , his stats would have been even better if not for 6 games missed to injury , which left his raw numbers just short of his own accomplishments in other , complete seasons .
As it was , Gretzky set a modern ( post Joe Malone / Newsy Lalonde ) record for goals - per - game ( 1.18 ) and the still - extant NHL record for points - per - game ( an astounding 2.77 ) .
Indeed , he was producing an even 3.0 points per game through that season - opening 51 game point streak , and I was frankly expecting him to go the full 80 and hit the 240 - point mark .
Then the injury happened .
It was Game 49 actually , a non-televised affair from Los Angeles where Gretzky got drilled by future linemate Dave Taylor , by all accounts a solid , legal hit of the type for which the honest warrior Taylor was known and respected .
What was unusual was for Wayne to be caught , though .
( A frustrated opponent once described body contact with Gretzky " like hitting a rope " . )
Wayne had already scored earlier in that game , and then dragged himself into Vancouver for Game 50 where somehow he managed to put up 2 - 2 - 4 and all seemed right with the world .
But it clearly was not ; back home for Game 51 against the Devils he scored early in the first period but was clearly struggling badly , and it was sad but unsurprising when the streak was ended the very next night by who else but the L.A. Kings , backstopped by the immortal Markus Mattsson .
The streak now over , it was announced Gretzky would take a couple weeks off to rehab his aching shoulder , but first he would play in the All - Star Game !
Think about that in light of modern practice , where any little ding will keep a lot of players out of the ASG even as they play league games immediately before and after .
But Gretzky was bigger than the league at that point , and his presence in the Meadowlands was central to the showcase game 's success .
So he gutted it out , made the trans - continental flight , suited up for the Campbell Conference , and played ( like shit , but he played ) .
My heart was in my throat the whole time that anybody would even touch him , but this was after all the All - Star Game , and his opponents were on best behaviour .
For all of Gretzky 's phenomenal accomplishments in 1983 - 84 , perhaps the most astonishing was the effect his absence had on the team over those 6 games that immediately followed .
At the time it seemed like we had leaped into an alternate , bizarro Universe where good turned to bad , hope into dread .
Follow the story after the ( quantum ) jump ...
With the Great One joining his faithful sidekick , the great Jari Kurri ( injured a few games previously ) , on the sidelines , the Oilers suddenly appeared vulnerable .
Oilers had run up a few scores over those years and there were more than a few teams ready and willing if not able to return the favour .
First up were the Calgary Flames , who rolled into Edmonton after the All - Star break on a 9 - game undefeated streak and openly talked in that day ’s papers how they were looking forward to taking it to the Oilers .
Big mistake .
There was still a lot of talent on that Oiler squad , and they came out loaded for bear , scoring on the first shift , running the lead to 5 - 0 by the first intermission and 8 - 0 early in the second before cruising to a very comfortable 10 - 5 victory .
Punctuating the event with a big exclamation mark was Lee Fogolin , the slow - to - anger hard rock defenceman , blowing his top at Flames ’ goofball Paul Baxter and totally cleaning his clock in one of the most one - sided fights I ’ve ever seen .
Oh yeah , and the scoring hero was third - liner Pat Hughes who had an out - of - body experience , scoring 5 goals to join Gretzky and Kurri in the team record book .
That was quite a night ; who needed Gretzky ?
We did , that ’s who .
After that emotional highlight the Oilers headed out for a fast tour through the toughest cities in the Eastern Conference : Washington , Long Island , Philadelphia , Boston , with the only potential softie being Hartford at the tail end .
It was a brutal schedule : the home game on the Friday night , then Sunday afternoon , Tuesday night , Thursday night , Saturday and Sunday afternoon .
It was like a perfect storm .
Adding to its potential were those three afternoon games , which for whatever reason were anathema to the Oilers in those days .
Did n’t matter how good the team was , if it was a day game they would always suck and usually lose .
The only saving grace was that none of those afternoon games was televised .
I listened to the first one , and it was a massacre , a 9 - 2 Washington runaway .
Oilers bounced back somewhat from this shellacking and played hard but lost close games in Nassau Coliseum and the Spectrum , 5 - 3 and 4 - 3 .
By the weekend my personal life had intervened to the point I did n’t even care about the games , especially since the news was all bad anyway .
My Dad suffered a severe stroke that week , one which nearly killed him and left him seriously disabled for the rest of his life .
Hockey time became hospital time .
I barely noticed that the Oilers lost 4 - 1 in Boston on Saturday .
Come the Sunday and I did n’t even want to know what would happen in Hartford , but I was pretty sure it would n’t be good .
That was a very bad week , full of images of sorrow and longer nights of gloom .
Things that go to make up a life .
The one highlight was that I had concert tickets on that Sunday night to see the English prog rock group Genesis .
Those tickets were bought and paid for , and there was no way I would – or should – miss it .
My soul needs music always , but never more than during trying times .
So I headed off to the familiar Coliseum , but without so much as a thought for hockey .
It was February 12 , 1984 : 26 years ago today .
Genesis had been my favourite band in the 70s , and even in that post - Peter Gabriel stage they were a terrific group .
With drummer Phil Collins ( pictured up top ) having become the new singer and front man , they were still putting out terrific tunes like " Home by the Sea " and had that great catalog of earlier material .
I quickly became thoroughly immersed in the music , and in my thoughts which strayed far outside of the Coliseum .
Hockey was the furthest thing from my mind .
Suddenly Phil Collins of all people jerked me back .
During between - songs banter he talked about playing in this building , home of the world - famous Gretzky and the Oilers , soon to be home of the Stanley Cup ( he hoped ) .
Then he said something about how they seemed to have lost their way , and mentioned the score of that afternoon ’s game , the one I had completely forgotten had already been played .
" Eleven to nil for bloody Hartford ! "
Well that was going to hit me hard no matter who told me , and to hear it directly from one of my heroes in a completely different avenue of my life was probably for the best .
Hear it , accept it , and move on .
I ’m going to enjoy this concert , Oilers or no Oilers dammit .
So I did .
Later accounts of the game filled in the details of the massacre .
Whatever could go wrong , went wrong .
Oilers took two ( 2 ) penalties in the second period and Hartford scored five ( 5 ) powerplay goals , I kid you not .
20 - year - old Ron Francis scored four all on his own .
And every time the Whalers scored , their silly celebration song " The Brass Bonanza " would play .
Again and again and again .
I ’m glad I missed it .
Fortunately , this embarrassing blowout was not just the nadir of the crash but it signalled the end of it .
The Oilers had left town flying high with a 39 - 9 - 5 record , limped home barely a week later with a road trip of 0 - 5 - 0 .
A measly 9 goals scored , 33 allowed !
These results were far worse than any road trip any of the terrible Oilers teams of 2007 or 2010 have undergone .
The last , most humiliating blow had been struck by one of the league ’s worst teams .
" Bloody Hartford " had an awful season in 1983 - 84 , posting a 28 - 42- 10 record and finishing a distant last place in the Adams Division , missing the playoffs that hardly anybody missed in the 21 - team NHL .
Even with the 11 - 0 triumph over the league ’s best team on the books , the team finished with a goal differential of - 32 ; their top 15 scorers were all minus players .
Their season highlights consisted of one shining moment ... but what a moment .
As for the Oilers , in the first home game back both Gretzky and Kurri returned to the line - up , Edmonton stomped the Winnipeg Jets by a very typical 7 - 4 score , and those of us who lived and died with the team ’s fortunes were magically transported back through the portal to that world where the Oilers kicked butt .
They would tear off 7 wins in a row , scoring 53 goals as if to make amends for the fiasco .
Gretzky ’s scoring rates dropped from 3 points a game during The Streak to a mere 2.4 or so down the stretch , but he and Jari were healthy enough to play and all was well in Oilerland .
Better still , my Dad was slowly but surely on the road to his own ( remarkable ! ) recovery , and I was able to enjoy the games again .
By season ’s end Gretzky had posted " WOWY " ( With Or Without You ) stats that were just mind - boggling .
Check this out :
GP W-L - T PTS % GF GA GF / G GA/G GD / G With 99 74 56-13-5 .791 427 276 5.77 3.73 +2.04 Without 99 6 1-5-0 .167 19 38 3.17 6.33 - 3.17
More than 5 goals per game difference .
WOWY , indeed !

The Hughes Brothers ' Book of Eli is n't all post - apocalyptic Samurai sword action and ipods .
Mixed in with the violence and sepiatones is one giant religious symbol that we just had to quiz the Brothers about in our exclusive interview .
We spoke to each brother separately — which is why a few questions are repeated below — but they each seem to have their own take on the religious , or non-religious , undertones that run through their post - apocalyptic film .
They struggled with keeping the film from being one - sided while tackling the always difficult job of keeping Eli spiritual but not preachy .
Warning some light spoilery talk .
Why did you want to make Eli ?
It 's been many years since your last film .
Why was Eli special ?

Albert : I did n't get it right away , my brother did .
And I said , " I do n't know about the religious stuff or the spiritual stuff . "
And then I went to sleep and woke up after a few hours of dreaming about it and thought , " Okay , I get it . "
Creatively , I get it .
Visually , I get it .
Story - wise , I get it .
It hit all cylinders .
For some unexplained reason , in a way .
You just said that you had trepidation about Eli , and I read that the project went through a lot of rewrites , we 're curious as to what went in and what had to go to keep you interested ?
What did you change ?
Advertisement
Albert :
It was more the things that came off as preachy .
It 's not about that .
We tried to tone that down and make it about the mission , and the faith in that mission , as opposed to coming off righteous .
Eli really walks the line of being an evangelical film , versus a movie that 's just about a mysterious new hope in a post apocalyptic world .
So what had to go , in order to keep it from being too preachy ?
Advertisement
Albert :
It was more the things that the main character [ Eli , Denzel Washington ] should be saying , it could turn the audience off a bit , if they do n't believe in that .
The movie is not about that .
So you want people to enjoy it , no matter what .
And it 's not about watering it down , it 's just not that character .
Then why did you guys choose to have the book [ that Eli carries across America and Gary Oldman 's character covets aid him in ruling the world ] be the Bible ?
Advertisement
Albert :
That was there when we got the script .
That was part of the attraction to it as well .
It 's incendiary sometimes , depending on what you believe and kind of appealing because of the controversy in that and how you look at that .
And how the story is constructed around it .
If you do it right , if it 's handled right , and how the audience will respond .
If it 's handled wrong then that 's a bad thing .
And you felt it was handled right because they used the Bible ?
Albert : I think the first draft was great , it just needed to be nuanced that 's all , because it 's dealing with anything sacred .
If you talk about anything sacred , you have handle it right .
You can't just go in there and make a movie and be careless about it because you are stepping on people 's beliefs .
You can't go into something like that being silly about it , no matter what you believe .

Did you discuss using other religious texts ?
Like the Koran or maybe the Torah ?
What about another literary work like Thomas More 's Utopia or a classic Plato text ?
Albert : No , we never thought about changing it .
It was what it was when it came to us , and that was part of the appeal when it came to us .

This book , which is n't revealed to be the Bible before you see the film , but is clearly noted as the Bible close to the beginning , is being described in the synopsis as a work that " provides knowledge that could redeem society , and the source of all their pain knowledge , " what is that knowledge exactly , and how is that more important than knowledge of building an irrigation system , or medicine or anything survivalist ?
Albert :
It depends on what you believe .
It could be about irrigation , if you want that kind of irrigation for your mind .
Some people need to read to stimulate themselves .
It could be that book or another book .
That character [ Eli ] believes that he was told to take it somewhere .
I can agree with the intent of that question , you know ?
But as a filmmaker , you have to believe in the story and that translation .
If you 're making Lord of The Rings , you have to believe in Middle Earth .
If you are making Star Wars , you have to believe that there are spaceships up there going around in space , even though it 's not reality .
You have to believe in the mythology of that movie in order to do it .

I 'm just curious .
For you , why was it more important to have a character carrying a book with a message of spirituality , versus a message of " This is how you purify water ? "
Albert : I would say it 's the same thing nowadays .
Why is it important that people are holding that book in such high regard , or thinking that it should be spoken from , or told to others as opposed to building a church talking about irrigation ?
You can pose that question to anybody in any time period , post - apocalypse or now , about any religious text , or any text of any sort .
" Oh , it 's more important to survive .
We need food .
So why not build churches about survival and food ? "
Advertisement
So I guess you could say that any form of learning is a spiritual experience or should be ?
Albert :
No , not really , I agree with your intent behind your question , I 'm not trying to be vague .
It depends on who the person is and what their want is .
Let 's say they found water .
Then what ?
They may need to feed their soul , and then what ?

Let 's talk about the other characters and their reaction to the book .
The reason Gary Oldman wants the Bible so bad is because he believes it will help him rule , can you elaborate on that at all , or on his character 's convictions ?
Why does he believe this will help him , what leads him to believe that ?
Albert :
Well I think if you applied it to nowadays , even misguided people who truly believe in one word over the other , think that their word is better than another person 's word and they want to build a bomb and go run into a place and kill people .
I think his character realizes how powerful that is .
It 's so powerful that it makes people even kill themselves over one word or one type of faith .
His character says , " Ha , I 've never seen anything that powerful that can move people to do things that are crazy , or move people to do things that are good . "
Depending on how you use that tool , which his character considers is a tool , you can either use it to manipulate in a good way or manipulate in a bad way , or not manipulate at all .

In the movie they state that all the Bibles , and a lot of other religious texts , were burned after the " last great war , " because many people believed that religion was a catalyst for this war .
If religion did n't help the people of Eli 's fictional past , why do you guys as filmmakers think it will help their future ?
Albert :
You have some very deep , profound psychological questions there !
You 're applying logic to something that there is no logic in .
That 's part of my struggle .
If you apply logic to a faith based religion — any of them — it will slowly start to fall apart .
If you apply logic to Star Wars or Lord of The Rings , it will slowly start to fall apart .
But if you go into it as a movie experience , as entertainment , [ as ] a mythology , and you do n't look for the holes , and you go and believe then that 's a different experience .
But you 're like me , I can tell by your questions .
[ Laughs ]
I can't even answer that .
I can't answer some things in all of the movies that we 've made .
Ok , there 's a good point in that .
I would n't call it cynicism , because I 'm a very cynical person , but there 's that side of me where I say , " Well if it caused the problem then why do you think it 's going to help anything ? "
Well there 's those people that use it to cause problems and those that use it to solve problems .
That 's the only thing logically that I can say to myself to help me with that .

One of the great things about post - apocalyptic films , whether people want them to or not , they usually make some sort of social commentary about today 's times , be it our dependence on oil , electricity , our dependance on paper currency .
What do you think Eli is making a social commentary on ?
Albert : I think it 's people and what people do .
George Carlin had this great quote , " the concept of people is great , people just fuck it up . "
People with too much time on their hands , too much money in their hands and maybe too much religion on their hands can do some pretty sick and crazy things .
And that goes for now and the future .
For me personally , I come from the cynical side of things , [ so ] ... some of your questions are the same questions I had .
So that 's how I went into the movie , thinking like this .
I 've seen the posters of Eli with the words " deliver us " in the background and could n't help but think of Moses ...
Advertisement
Albert :
There 's a lot of that in there .
That 's marketing right there .
I think they did a great job of marketing .
Then there 's the passings that came from Kung Fu .
He 's a monk but he's not preaching to people to act , he 's preaching people more to be a pacifist .
There are these great wanderers who impart wisdom — to us Eli was more of a pacifist .
He 's delivering certain information .
Some people have brought up Moses before , because he 's delivering certain information behind a certain faith or belief in something .
But to us , he 's more of a Monk .
" I 'm going here to do this , but if someone gets in my way I 'm going to have to use violence but I 'm not going to throw the first punch . "
And that was the sort of stuff we grew up with .
Even Clint Eastwood 's The Man With No Name , he was n't looking to shoot somebody in the back .
Somebody always brought it to him first .
He 's definitely not very religious , he sees someone get raped and murdered and does n't do anything about it .
Why have that duality — is it because he 's only human or is this the state of a modern day prophet ?
Is Eli a modern - day prophet because he is flawed ?
Advertisement
Albert :
You have some very deep , deep questions .
No I would n't consider him that at all .
No .
I think it 's more subtle and not so on the nose .
The deal is I want people to go into the movie and read into it what they want to read into it .
There are certain things that are ambiguous about certain questions that I have the answers to for myself , but I want the audience to make up their own minds on .
You can't give the audience all the answers .
Some people think you should , but you should n't , and that 's what an audience should do , answer that question for themselves , not as the filmmaker .
Through the years I 've been more frustrated with director 's commentaries and things like that , " why are we explaining a film , nobody had to explain films in the past . "
You should n't have to explain anything — poetry , art on the wall , a movie , whatever it is .
You should n't have to explain yourself .
But here I am , being a hypocrite .
ALLEN HUGHES
Allen , your brother mentioned that you brought him this script .
Why did you want to make Eli ?
Advertisement
Allen :
It spoke to me because when I got to page 45 and Carnegie [ Gary Oldman ] said " this is not just a book , it 's a weapon aimed at the hearts and minds of the weak and desperate .
It will give us control , " I said , Oh my God , what is this ?
There are certain things that are inexplicable I just knew in that moment that I had to do it .
This is so important .
There are things that I can't even articulate that this movie is doing , what it has to say about human beings .
We all see things through our own emotional principles and disposition .
Using that book — one of the biggest selling books of all times one of the greatest influences of other literature of all times as well — it just made it that much more impactful and powerful .
Let 's talk about that line .
How is The Bible a weapon ?
Allen : Carnegie is just talking about bending humanity to his will , he knows how powerful those words are and he wants to be the ruler , he 's not talking about physically killing people .
He 's not a bad guy in the traditional sense .
He 's trying to restore civility , for lack of a better word .
He wants civilization to be civilized .
And he 's demented , obviously , and he 's distorted and demented , he 's delusional .
But I think he 's in it for the right reasons .
Jim Jones was in it for the right reasons , and then thousands of people ended up dying from poisonous Kool - Aid .
That 's what happens with that shit .
Doctors do it all the time , they get god complexes .
I read an interview with you guys in Maxim , where it mentioned that a lot of audience members might think that this is Mad Max meets The Passion of Christ , and that that is a wrong assumption to make .
Why ?
Advertisement
Allen : Yeah I do n't think that [ describes ] the movie at all .
I do n't believe you can even make comparisons .
First of all , Passion of the Christ is an anomaly , it 's a one all .
That will never happen again .
That was a situation that no one ever would have foresaw .
I do n't think you can compare any movie to that movie .
Whether you loved it or it was n't your cup of tea .
As far as Mad Max , I prefer Road Warrior .
Our movie has a bit of Road Warrior in it .
Was it important to make Eli flawed ?
Allen :
It was very important , if you are a believer or not .
I can only speak to if someone is a human being and they are blessed , there 's something about them that 's magical .
Whether it 's Michael Jackson , or your neighbor that every time he comes out , certain birds appear .
I do n't know how to explain it .
But the point is they both are human beings and have flaws .
And if you do n't show that , how would someone relate to them ?
Advertisement
What had to be cut to keep this film from being overly evangelical ?
Allen : I think it 's definitely very difficult to walk that line .
Even with the music , if you play one note while he 's talking about the Bible it can become very Christian .
Music can do that alone .
If you play it one way , it can be very corny [ and ] Christian .
If you play it [ a different ] way , it can be very nondenominational or spiritual .
So I went to test , and I made sure , sonically speaking , that the movie is about oneness .
It 's about accepting the common human spiritual condition .
And let 's not split hairs over who God is or what God is , we 're all going to assume coming in , even non-believers , that there 's something going on .
There 's some energy , life force or interconnectivity we all have .
We 're all related , we 're human beings .
I paid close attention , and Albert , to what we were editing out and putting in .
And what you were hearing , and what you were n't .
Advertisement
It is a dangerous walk , but I believe and I know in my heart it was the best hands it could have been in , because you can't buy us , and you can't make us do anything for money or politics .
We 're not going to move , unless something moves us .
What was the message of Eli ?
Allen : I think the bottom line is , these words , whatever the sacred text are , in our lives as human beings , it 's precious .
All of it 's precious .
The things that matter most — our water , our history , our lives , our families , our souls — it 's all precious , and we need to get back to the elemental fundamental appreciation of that .

Do you think Eli will be seen as a Christian movie ?
Allen :
We specifically directed a movie to pitch you the way a book — like the Bible , or the Koran or the Torah , or any sacred words — that whatever you bring to it , that 's what you 're going to come out of it with .
If you 're that dogmatic about what your thoughts are about things and you want to have preconceived notions , then one will come out and say " this is a Christian movie , " and they 'll either be happy about it or be pissed about it .
But if you 're open minded and you sit back and watch it , maybe watch it again because there are so many subtle things that are happening that are worthy of a repeat viewing .
I do n't think you 'll walk out with that feeling at all .
Some personal injury firms work hard to take as many cases as they can .
At the law firm of Thomas J. Ueberschaer , P.A. , in Pensacola and Panama City , Florida we are known for delivering a high level of service , not for running a high - volume business .
We encourage people everywhere to “ Ask Tom ” because all of our clients actually get to work with Tom .
By taking on a relatively small number of injury cases , our lawyers are able to spend considerable time communicating with every one of our clients .
Our focus on service also enables us to successfully handle cases that are complicated , large , unusual or difficult .
A Caribbean octopus has been spotted disguising itself as a flounder , most likely in an attempt to avoid predators , researchers have announced .
Over the past decade , several Atlantic longarm octopuses have been captured on video imitating the sand - dwelling peacock flounder , mimicking not only the shape of the flatfish but also its color and swimming style .
Octopus mimics have been reported off the coast of Indonesia since 1998 .
( See a picture of an Indonesian octopus mimicking a sea star . )
This study marks the first case found in the Atlantic — and the fourth octopus species known to adopt a disguise .
( Related : " Newfound Octopus Impersonates Fish , Snakes . " )
Normally Atlantic longarm octopuses swim with their arms trailing behind their heads .
But the newly released video shows the cephalopods folding their arms back into flounder shapes and undulating in a way that resembles flounder fins .
" It 's a very athletic move , " said study leader Roger Hanlon , of the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole , Massachusetts .
When stationary , the octopus seems content to just be itself .
The animal only assumes flounder form when it's on the move , the scientists observed .
( See pictures and watch video of " bizarre " octopuses that carry coconuts as instant shelters . )
Hanlon thinks the soft , squishy octopus uses flounder mimicry to avoid predators , which might be alerted to potential prey by motion .
A hungry sea creature might not think twice about biting off an arm or two from a passing octopus .
But a rigid flatfish like a flounder would give a predator pause .
Octopus Hardwired for Flounder Form ?
How exactly the octopus picked up its flounder - like behavior is still a mystery .
In the 1980s Hanlon had captured Atlantic longarm octopus larvae and brought them back to his lab , eventually raising one to adulthood .
The captive animal displayed a weird swim pattern , but the scientists did n't recognize it as mimicry at the time .
When Hanlon saw the wild Atlantic octopuses " becoming " flounders like the species in Indonesia , he went back and looked at snapshots of the lab animal taken in 1985 .
" It had never seen another octopus or a flounder , but it did this flounder mimicry , " he said .
" We did n't know what that meant in the mid-1980s .
But it gives a hint that there might be an innate component to this swimming behavior ... that maybe this is hardwired . "
Overall , he added , the research shows that " camouflage is more than looking like the background .
There are more sophisticated things going on here . "
WASHINGTON --
The government ordered Toyota to turn over documents related to its
massive recalls
Tuesday , pressing to see how long the automaker knew of safety defects before taking action .
Toyota , concerned about unsold cars , said it would temporarily idle some production in three states .
The Transportation Department is demanding that Toyota reveal when and how it learned of problems with sticking accelerators and with floor mats trapping gas pedals , and the company must respond within 30 to 60 days or face fines .
Those defects and problems with brakes on new Prius hybrids have now led to the recall of 8.5 million vehicles .
The intensifying investigation and the production halts at Toyota 's assembly plants are fresh signs of the ripple effect the recalls are having on the world 's No. 1 automaker - even as car - owners are streaming to dealers for fixes .
Toyota faces separate probes by the Obama administration and Congress as it struggles to maintain its loyal customer base and its reputation for safety and quality .
Toyota said it was halting production temporarily in San Antonio , Texas , and Georgetown , Ky. , to address concerns that too many unsold vehicles may be building up at dealerships because of the large recalls .
Company spokesman Mike Goss said the Texas plant , which builds the Tundra pickup truck , would take production breaks for the weeks of March 15 and April 12 .
The Kentucky plant , which makes the Camry , Avalon and Venza vehicles , plans to take a non-production day on Feb. 26 and may not build vehicles on three more days in March and April .
Toyota employs 1,850 workers at the San Antonio plant and about 6,600 at the Georgetown facility .
None will be laid off during the production interruptions .
In addition , the company 's plant in Huntsville , Ala. , will idle some production during the same time as the San Antonio facility , according to company spokeswoman Stephanie Deemer .
The Alabama factory makes V - 8 engines for the Tundra pickup trucks that are assembled in Texas .
About 300 workers will be affected but will still be paid and may perform other tasks , Deemer said .
In late January , Toyota halted production of recalled brands throughout the United States for about a week .
The demands from the government for information , similar to a subpoena , follow criticism from consumer groups that the Transportation Department has been too soft on automakers and has failed to fine the companies or seek detailed information through legal powers .
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood has defended his department 's handling of the Toyota investigation , calling the Japanese automaker " a little safety deaf " about the problems .
LaHood said the government urged Toyota to issue recalls and sent federal safety officials to Japan to warn company officials of the seriousness of the problems .
LaHood has said the government is considering civil penalties for Toyota over its handling of the recalls .
The maximum fine is more than $ 16 million .
The largest auto industry fine came in 2004 , when General Motors paid $ 1 million for responding too slowly on a recall of nearly 600,000 vehicles over windshield wiper failure .
Under federal law , automakers must notify the department 's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration within five days of determining that a safety defect exists and promptly conduct a recall .
The probe extends beyond Toyota 's U.S. operations , a request that safety experts said was unprecedented for a federal agency tasked with regulating vehicles domestically .
The agency is seeking information on Toyota vehicles that were sold overseas and also subject to U.S. recalls for problems with sticking gas pedals .
Toyota told NHTSA in January that the problem appeared in Europe beginning in December 2008 .
NHTSA also seeks overseas vehicle information in its investigation of potential electronic problems .
Government investigators are looking into whether Toyota discovered the problems before , during or after production of the affected vehicles , whether their recalls covered all affected vehicles and whether the company learned of the problems through consumer complaints or internal tests .
Toyota said in a statement that it " takes its responsibility to advance vehicle safety seriously and to alert government officials of any safety issue in a timely manner .
We are reviewing NHTSA 's request and will cooperate to provide all the information they have requested . "
Federal officials are focusing on the two major issues behind the recalls - gas pedals that can become lodged on floor mats and pedal systems that are " sticky , " making it harder for drivers to press on the pedal or ease up on the gas .
The information requests seek detailed timelines on when Toyota first became aware of the problems , how it handled complaints , how much it have paid out in warranty claims over pedal problems , what internal communications there were about pedals and which company officials were involved in making decisions about the issue .
NHTSA also wants to know how seriously Toyota considered the possibility that electronics of the gas pedal system might play a role .
The company has said tests show that electronics were not to blame .
But federal safety officials want to know how Toyota dealt with complaints that might not be related to floor mats or sticking pedals .
Kathleen DeMeter , the director of NHTSA 's Office of Defects Investigation Enforcement , wrote that the agency was " seeking to determine whether Toyota viewed the underlying defects too narrowly ... without fully considering the broader issue of unintended acceleration and any associated safety - related defects that warrant recalls . "
Congress is also investigating .
The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is holding a hearing on Feb. 24 , and the House Energy and Commerce Committee has scheduled one the next day .
Toyota Motor North America chief executive Yoshi Inaba , LaHood and NHTSA Administrator David Strickland are expected to testify at both meetings .
The Senate Commerce , Science and Transportation Committee has scheduled a March 2 hearing .
Toyota has stepped up its lobbying ahead of the hearings by highlighting its workers and U.S. production .
It flew production workers into Washington a day before a blizzard last week to highlight the company 's commitment to quality and safety .
The company also received help from the governors of four states with Toyota plants - including Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear - who called on Congress to be fair to the automaker .
Toyota has been fixing vehicles under recall .
Toyota Vice President Bob Carter told reporters at the National Automobile Dealers Association convention in Orlando , Fla. , on Monday that the company had repaired about 500,000 of the 2.3 million vehicles recalled over a potentially sticky gas pedal .
Toyota president Akio Toyoda is expected to answer questions in Japan Wednesday about the company 's recalls .
He dashes curse words in the classroom .
He beats students with a shovel .
And students love him .
What 's the secret here ?
Woo Hyung - chul , 46 , teaches math at a private institution or hakwon in Seoul that prepares students to get into colleges .
There are many teachers like him in Korea where education is a religion .
But Woo stands out among them because his pedagogical approach is different .
" Do n't throw an unrealizable goal to students on the first day . "
That 's one of the lessons he shares in an interview with Donga Ilbo on Saturday .
" Students will find it beyond their reach and give up . "
Most of Woo 's students are " problem kids " by some definition .
They do n't do well academically .
Their attention span is short .
But when they come to Yoo , their grades improve .
If not , they at least have a good time laughing a lot .
And as days go by , these students ' grades also tend to pick up eventually .
So , he 's special .
Woo believes that when students do n't do well academically , it 's partly the teachers ' fault .
" You need to understand the teen culture to motivate them .
When you motivate them , they do better academically , " he said .
The secret of his approach lies in his three - step formula of " first apply sticks , then carrots , and show a vision . "
He prepares his lecture by watching a comedy program .
He uses the jokes he picked up from the comedy show in " disarming students and opening their hearts . "
He also uses " shock and awe " strategy .
This includes intentionally cursing them and an exaggerated gesture of beating them with a shovel .
If it were in the U.S. , he would be probably in jail for doing so .
But yeah , it 's Korea .
The chemistry he creates with such non-conventional methods is formidably effective and his income proves it .
Students who gave up on math call him a " messiah " for redeeming them from the deep , dark valley of hopelessness and a state of utter lack of motivation .
Being a good deliverer of knowledge is n't enough , he says .
" Students are not a memorizing machine .
You should guide them to help find a life goal by meeting them on their terms , " he said .
" Creating a common ground of understanding between you and students is critical . "
The whistleblowing site Wikileaks has apparently raised the money it needs to continue operating for the time being , according to a message the organization sent out Wednesday night on Twitter .
" Achieved min. funraising [ sic ] goal .
( $ 200k/600k ) ; we 're back fighting for another year , even if we have to eat rice to do it , " read the tweet , without specifying whether it had raised the full $ 600,000 or just $ 200,000 .
The site announced last December that it was ceasing day - to - day operations to focus on raising money .
It said contributors could still send documents and tips through its anonymous submission tool .
Last week , it was ceasing operations indefinitely because it had raised only $ 130,000 of the $ 200,000 it needed to maintain base operations annually .
The site says it requires $ 600,000 to operate if it pays its staff of technologists and curators who sift through submissions to provide context for documents and other information valuable to its users .
The announcement page , beginning with : " We protect the world – but will you protect us ? " has not changed , except to add that Wikileaks " will be back soon . "
" We have received hundreds of thousands of pages from corrupt banks , the U.S. detainee system , the Iraq war , China , the UN and many others that we do not currently have the resources to release , " the pages reads .
" You can change that and by doing so , change the world .
Even $ 10 will pay to put one of these reports into another 10,000 hands and $ 1,000 , a million . "
The site takes donations through PayPal , Moneybookers and TipiT , as well as checks and bank transfers .
Its online TipiT tipjar indicates it has raised $ 31,000 using that method .
Donors to its tipjar leave such messages as : " Keep scooping us – we 're very grateful for your persistence . "
" Keep up the good work , shining light in dark places . "
" You may be the most important resource on the net in the long term . "
The site was formally launched in 2007 as an online clearinghouse for anonymous submissions of documents , images and other data .
It has received awards from Amnesty International and has been praised by media groups and others for giving whistleblowers and political dissidents a forum to expose corruption and suppression and foster transparency .
It 's run by the Sunshine Press , said to be supported by anonymous human rights activists , investigative journalists , technologists and members of the general public around the world .
The site has scooped mainstream media outlets a number of times in obtaining documents and information on controversial topics that have then become the source of mainstream media stories .
In 2007 , the site published a 238 - page U.S. military manual detailing operations of the Defense Department ’s Guantánamo Bay detention facility .
It also posted a manual for operating the CIA 's rendition flights , which involved undocumented detainees who were kidnapped in various locations and flown to countries outside the United States for interrogation and torture .
Wikileaks was among the first to publish data from Sarah Palin 's private Yahoo e-mail account after a Tennessee college student gained unauthorized access to the account two months before the 2008 presidential election .
The site has been the target of numerous legal challenges .
In 2008 , a judge tried to shutter Wikileaks by ordering its U.S. host to take it offline after a Cayman Islands bank complained that the site was publishing proprietary documents .
The judge reversed his decision a week later following criticism of numerous groups that said the judge ’s decision constituted prior restraint , a violation of the First Amendment .

Garrett should resign over his bungled scheme that ignored warnings from Minter Ellison and which ultimately caused the deaths of four people and has increased rapidly the chances of tens of thousands of homes burning down .
That , in a nutshell , is the line the mainstream media in this country has pursued for nearly a week – with The Australian taking the lead role and the rest of the MSM herd dutifully following them down into what we now know is a cul - de-sac of complete and utter incompetence .
There is simply no other way to put what has gone on here .
Let us be clear – the insulation scheme was only shut down after the Minter Ellison document became a pivotal issue , suggesting that Garrett not only failed to read a document back in April 2009 that seemingly highlighted every problem – both real and imagined ( but more on that later ) – that has come to pass in the scheme , but that if he had read the Minter Ellison document and acted upon it , if he had followed the advice of Minter Ellison , homes would not have burned , people would not have died , the scheme would not have failed .
It was definitive proof , so the media narrative went , that Garrett was a poster boy for ministerial incompetence writ large .
It was this Minter Ellison document and the plague like , hysterical misreporting of its contents , that forced public opinion to run so strongly against Garrett ( with his approval rating of 28 % ) and the government that they were forced to shut it down – just as all governments shut down medium sized programs when public opinion gets beyond rational ; witness the politicians superannuation scheme in 2004 and the Howard fuel excise indexation in 2001 .
If the Minter Ellison document was reported accurately , the program would still be operational .
This scheme was shut down and the jobs of at least 5000 people and the immediate living standards of another 12 - 15 thousand family members got sent down the toilet because journalists were incompetent .
On their heads rests the economic consequences of these ostensibly low income , lowest skilled people getting sacked .
This Minter Ellison Risk Register was a report that , according to The Australian , “ warned of an “ extreme risk ” of house fires , fraud and poor quality installations ” .
On top of these frightening risks , The Australian stated that , “ Peter Garrett was kept in the dark by his department about warnings it received that the home insulation scheme should be delayed for three months because of “ extreme risks ” . ”
The only problem here is that this – and I mean all of this – is complete and utter bullshit .
But before we get to what the risk assessment actually says – because , let ’s be frank , you wo n’t see that written anywhere in The Australian – what is worth mentioning first is the nature of the report for some context .
Garrett ’s department commissioned one - stop consulting shop Minter Ellison for a risk assessment on the insulation program , a report it delivered to the department in April 2009 .
This report only cost the department $ 28,985 .
About now , some of you will be thinking “ 29 K !!
Outrageous !! ” – but far from this being an expensive report , it ’s actually very cheap in the broader scheme of government consulting work .
That cheap price reflects the very nature of the report ’s contents ( and goes to the heart of why top level public servants leave the PS for consulting work ! ) .
It was n’t a comprehensive “ The Final Word ” style report – it was basically an appraisal of the risks that might pop up when it comes to rolling out the insulation program , a rough estimate on the costs that may be involved from those risks should they eventuate , and a short evaluation of the risk mitigation programs that the government had in place for each area as of April 2009 .
In Question Time on Tuesday , it was revealed that the report took less than six days to produce – highlighting the serious but not definitive nature of the document .
If Minter Ellison spent more than 50 hours on this report , I will eat my laptop .
So the report is n’t comprehensive – nor is it meant to be – it ’s simply a professional brainstorm done up into a nice report with some smart people in charge of the whiteboard and the pens .
That is what $ 29 K buys in the world of the modern consultant .
What the MSM has been suggesting is that not only does the continuation of a multi-billion dollar program – the insulation rollout – pivot on the contents of a $ 29 K report of programmatic risk , but that Peter Garret ’s very tenure as Minister pivots on whether or not he actually read the thing .
That is pretty much one of the more ludicrous ideas you ’ll ever come across – a multi billion dollar program and a Ministers tenure being determined by a report smaller than your average miscellaneous expenses budget – but none - the - less , this is The Australian and the herd of the mainstream media we ’re talking about here .
Who really gets surprised these days when you find that your already low expectations are still a little on the high side with this lot ?
As the Senate committee into this demonstrated clearly ( transcript available here soon ) , when this program was being developed by the Dept , they went out and collected a substantial array of information and policy advice to assist not only the Minister in the rollout of the program , but also to assist with the department ’s own preparedness for implementing the policy .
The department undertook internal research , they consulted widely with industry and other relevant government organisations like the ACCC and departments like DEEWR .
They also engaged with third party specialists – one of which was Minter Ellison .
The department then collated and condensed this wide array of information from a wider array of sources into a set of advice briefs for the Minister .
You see , that ’s actually what government departments do .
From the idiot commentary in the press you ’d think that Departments should be abolished since the Minister apparently does everything – although as Bernard Keane regularly points out in Crikey , journalists failing Public Service Operations 101 is neither new nor irregular .
The Minter Ellison report was but one , small piece of info that went into this mix that made up the advice the Department provided to Garrett .
That gets us on to the actual Risk Register document itself .
You can download it here , and use the explanatory cover email available here as a key to some of the abbreviations in the register .
Remember , this document is n’t the be all and end all , it is but one piece of information the Department was using to identify areas of risk that needed to be managed .
Also remember that the role of this report is to identify as many risks as possible .
When Minter Ellison talks about risk , they mean a professional definition of risk , not a literal definition of risk that you might find in a dictionary .
That is something that ’s important to keep in your though orbit as you go through the document .
The first thing to notice is that nowhere in this document does Minter Ellison warn of the dangers of workplace deaths or worker safety .
The reason is obvious – existing generic workplace regulations were adequate enough to prevent deaths as long as employers abided by existing law .
In the Risk Register , Minter Ellison did not identify any additional systemic risk of workplace deaths and safety becoming an issue .
Next up , you ’ll notice that there are 19 specific and separate issues where risk factors are identified , the inherent nature of that risk is described , the risk mitigation strategies in the program as of April 2009 are rated on their strength and a rating is given on whether the risk is tolerable or not for each specific area .
As of April 2009 , there were only 3 areas where the risk was not considered to be tolerable – as in , further strategies had to be developed in order to expect a successful outcome for that particular area of the program .
These specific areas were :
Area 2 . Procurement / Licensing .
This specific area was about how licenses were going to be provided and as of April it had yet to be fully determined by the department .
Similarly , business model planning was at the time being undertaken by KPMG over procurement issues .
Minter Ellison recommended for this specific area that delaying the program to September or starting a partial rollout with Sydney / Melbourne metro areas first was an option .
The consequences of getting this wrong was that there would be delays when it came to getting insulation into ceilings – to the point where it may not occur at all .
This option of delaying the program was based on what had occurred up to April 2009 .
Between April and July , the Department obviously developed procurement / licensing policy appropriately , since – and the pudding is in the eating – insulation was rolled out into ceilings with no major delays .
Area 3 . Time .
This was specifically about the internal mechanisms of the administration of the policy and how the time lines being so tight , there was a concern that the management and the actual policy administrators would be too green to deliver the policy out the door .
Between April and July of 2009 , we know the Department mitigated these risks successfully as , again , the proof of the pudding is in the eating .
The program pushed insulation out the door on the deadline date of July .
Area 7.Political .
This was specifically about the government ’s public relations and risks to their political standing and had absolutely nothing to do with the actual program of getting insulation into ceilings .
It was all about government communications management with the press and other people that might want to have a whinge about something .
Every other area , including installation quality and compliance , fraud , legal , regulation , industry capacity , outcomes ( actual ) , delivery , take - up , training mechanisms and product quality were all given a tolerable risk rating by Minter Ellison .
They were all given a risk approval by Minter Ellison .
Let me say that again , every one of those areas just mentioned were all given a risk tick .
What you have been reading from the press is ill - informed , pig - ignorant bullshit .
Let ’s go to a few examples .
Dennis Shanahan
Garrett led a department charged by cabinet with implementing a scheme for which it was not equipped , and which was warned there would be fraud , fires , waste and accidents if it did not delay the start of the scheme by at least three months .
No – that is a totally and utterly incorrect .
Minter Ellison did not say that fraud , fire and waste would occur if the program was not delayed , they stated clearly ( although obviously not clear enough for some ! ) that delaying the program was an option to guarantee procurement / licensing issues were fully developed and for internal administration to be effectively put in place .
However , those issues were fully developed between April and July , such that we saw the program rollout on time .
Minter Ellison said the risk of fraud , fire and waste was acceptable , and did n’t mention “ accidents ” in the risk register at all !
5 arse - hats , go stand in the corner Dennis .
Courier Mail Editorial
This document , which is more than 10 months old , was drawn up by a major Australian law firm , Minter Ellison , and was comprehensive enough to foretell just about every disaster that has befallen Mr Garrett ’s housing insulation program
That was its job – to predict every foreseeable risk .
It also stated the risks were acceptable in 16 of 19 areas , and in those 3 that were not acceptable at the time , the department successfully met its deadline for rollout , demonstrating that the risk was mitigated .
Andrew Bolt
Garrett ’s own department commissioned a report from Minter Ellison Consulting last year on whether its free - insulation scheme would work , and in April last year the report was sent to both Garrett and Rudd ’s office , warning the scheme was in fact dangerous and could waste hundreds of millions of dollars .
Minter Ellison never anywhere in the report stated that the scheme was dangerous .
We ’d get you to wear the dunce cap but there ’s only so many a single person can have on their head at a given time .
ABC Online :
Mr Garrett is under pressure to reveal when he was first briefed about the Minter Ellison safety risk assessment , which warned of shonky installation and house fires
The report did not warn of shonky installation and house fires , both of those areas got the risk assessment tick .
The Oz
The advice from top - tier law firm Minter Ellison outlined strategies to tackle serious risks in the program .
It warned that the government ’s timeline was too tight for the program to be delivered in a “ properly controlled way ” and said the Environment Department was ill - equipped to roll out such a massive program .
What it actually said – specifically on the issue of time , was : “ time available to develop and deliver the program in a properly controlled way may be inadequate ”
Compare that to the dross above : “ It warned that the government ’s timeline was too tight for the program to be delivered in a “ properly controlled way ”
Anyway , that ’s enough of these fools – let ’s now move on to looking at some actual numbers suggesting that far from the insulation program being the cause of a dramatic increase in hell , fire and brimstone breaking out in the nations ceilings , it actually reduced the rate of installation caused fires .
Yes , you read that right .

Several days ago , RAW STORY reported on a proposed law in Uganda that would execute homosexuals thought to be HIV positive , or for repeat “ offenses . ”
According to U.S. author and Harper ’s contributing editor Jeff Sharlet , a secretive group of American politicians are supporting the Ugandan lawmakers who are leading the charge to see the draconian bill become law .
ADVERTISEMENT
Speaking to MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow on Monday , Sharlet revealed even more about the connections between The Family , the secretive religious group which runs the C Street house in Washington , D.C. , to the Ugandan officials .
Specifically , Sharlet claimed that the nation ’s president and his ethics minister , both key players in pushing the vicious legislation , are official members of the powerful fundamentalist Christian group .
The man who introduced the legislation , Ugandan ethics minister and member of parliament David Bahati , was has strong ties to the U.S. religious right through a group called the African Student Leadership Program .
In other words , he is “ one of [ The Family ’s ] key men in Uganda . ”
Maddow could n’t help but wonder : “ Why is The Family interested in Uganda ?
Why are they interested in operating there and what are their goals there ? ”
“ The Family has always viewed its religious outreach , it ’s ‘ Worldwide Spiritual Offensive ’ as they describe it , in very clear geopolitical terms .
Uganda right now is an incredibly important country for world politics .
It ’s functioning in many ways as a U.S. proxy with Sudan , with Congo , with Rwanda .
There ’s oil in that general region and The Family needs to have a presence out there , and they have in Uganda since 1986 , when they sent over a man to recruit [ Ugandan President Yoweri ]
Museveni , then the new leader who then looked like a bright , democratic spot in African leadership .
They recruited him to be one of their ‘ main brothers , ’ as they put it , for the whole continent . ”

A few weeks ago , I linked to a picture of civil rights activist John Salter being attacked by a mob during a lunch counter sit - in during the 1960s .
I also linked to a newspaper op - ed in which Salter explained how he and other civil rights workers used firearms for protection from Klansmen and other terrorists — when Klansmen knew that a homicide would not be witnessed by the news media .
Since that blog post seemed to draw great interest from the readers , I thought that some persons might be interested in the longer version of Salter ’s history of the role of armed self - defense in the Civil Rights Movement .
The longer version is John R. Salter , Jr. , “ Social Justice Community Organizing and the Necessity for Protective Firearms , ” which is chapter 2 of The Gun Culture and Its Enemies 19 - 23 ( William R. Tonso , editor , Merril Press , 1990 . )
( Merril Press is the press for the Second Amendment Foundation . )
The chapter was first published as an article by Salter in Against the Current , July / August 1988 .
The magazine describes itself as an “ analytical journal for the broad revolutionary left . ”
http://www.solidarity-us.org/current/publications
Unfortunately , neither version is available on - line , so I will provide a summary .
In the mid-1960s , Salter was a full - time community organizer for the Southern Conference Educational Fund , in the very poor and highly segregated North Carolina black belt .
Klan activity was heavy , and “ Local law enforcement was almost completely dominated by the United Klans of America . ”
Klan dues were collected at the police station in Enfield .
Having received many death threats , Salter carried a Smith & Wesson .38 special in his attaché case .
One night , on a long stretch of isolated country road , a Klan vehicle tried to force Salter ’s car into a high - speed chase , by tailing him nearly bumper - to - bumper .
“ But I continued to drive sedately , mile after mile … with my revolver in my hand . ”
Salter and the other community organizers had put out word on the grapevine that they were all armed , and he surmises that this was the reason that the Klansmen did not try to shoot him that night .
Soon after , “ a local civil rights stalwart , Mrs. Alice Evans , of Enfield , opened fire with her double - barreled 12 gauge , sprinkling several KKKers with birdshot as they endeavored to burn a cross in her driveway one night and , simultaneously , approaching her homes with buckets of gasoline . ”
The Klansmen fled and went to the hospital .
Mrs. Evans donated the cross to the Smithsonian Museum .
Salter then recounts the story of the armed students and teachers who protected Tougaloo College , near Jackson , Mississippi , when Salter taught there in 1961 - 63 .
That story is recounted in the op-ed to which I linked in the previous post .
In late 1964 , the Klan was scheduling a state - wide rally in Halifax County , near a black residential area .
Rally posters were displayed at “ most law enforcement offices in the county . ”
Salter and his fellow organizers asked the office of Governor Terry Sanford to provide state police protection for the black residents .
Sanford ’s office ignored the requests , until Salter went to Sanford ’s office , got a meeting with the chief of staff , and told him that if the state police did not provide protection , “ our people , armed to the hilt , would have no hesitation about utilizing armed self - defense in the event of Klan violence .
Visibly shaken , the aide left me and conferred with Sanford .
He returned quickly to promise the state police . ”
Klan rallies continued for several more months in the area , and so did state police protection .
In 1965 in North Carolina , the FBI and Justice Department told Salter than an informant inside a United Klans klavern had reported on a plan to bomb Salter ’s home in Raleigh .
The FBI agent told Salter and his wife that the federal government could not do anything about it .
Of course , “ Local law enforcement was not reliable .
Fortunately , we lived in the middle of a heavily armed Black community , ” and Salter ’s neighbors were “ very protective . ”
They and Salter put out the word that the community was armed for defense .
Thus , “ We were not surprised when the bombing effort never materialized . ”
In the summer of 1970 , Salter was Southside Director for the Chicago Commons Association .
As such , he was a community organizer for mostly “ Black , Puerto Rican , and Chicano ” people .
On the South / Southwest side of Chicago , the racism was “ often more violent and sanguinary than the Deep South of the previous decade .
The Richard Daley machine was openly antagonistic to us . . . ”
In some but not all districts , the police were in league with the racists .
Death threats were frequent .
When they were phoned in , Salter told the callers , “ that I had a ticket for them , a pass to permanent eternity via my Marlin .444 . ”
One day while Salter was at work and his wife was at home , some men with knives came to the home , but a vigilant neighbor with a revolver frightened them away .
In Chicago in 1973 , Salter ’s community network of nearly 300 block clubs “ set up public citizen ‘ watch - dog ’ patrols . ”
These were generally unarmed , with “ primary backup from a network of armed citizenry in the neighborhoods , ” with whom the patrols stayed in contact via Citizens Band radio and telephone .
“ The effects of this well known campaign in deterring while racial violence were consistently substantial . ”
Soon , and as a result , politicians “ forced in effect increasingly responsible and egalitarian law enforcement practices .
But the patrols and vigilance of armed neighborhoods continued . ”
In conclusion , Salter writers that firearms are not an absolute guarantee of safety for community organizers ; Medger W. Evers ( NAACP Field Secretary for Mississippi ) was murdered in June 1963 , but being armed had helped him to live for nine years longer than most people expected he would when he took the job in 1954 .
In sum , “ I am stating categorically that the number of fatalities ” was “ much smaller ” because “ organizers and their grassroots groups ” were “ sensibly armed for self - defense . ”

The death toll in flash floods on the ­Portuguese holiday island of Madeira rose to at least 42 as search teams began digging for survivors and environmentalists blamed greed and overbuilding for the scale of the tragedy .
Army and police rescue teams from mainland Portugal started sifting through mud and debris left behind by flooding and mudslides after a torrential storm ravaged the island on Saturday .
Authorities warned that the death toll in the island 's worst tragedy for a century would increase as rescuers travelled to towns and villages cut off by floods and rockfalls .
Several villages remained inaccessible yesterday and telephone services were still cut in some areas .
More than 120 people , including visiting tourists , were injured and an unknown number of others were missing , possibly swept away or smothered .
The Foreign Office tonight confirmed that a Briton had died following the flooding .
Authorities said the breakdown in telephone services meant it was impossible to estimate exactly how many people were still missing .
" The death toll will probably increase , given the circumstances , " regional social services spokesman Francisco Ramos said .
A further 250 people were evacuated from homes , with the local government providing emergency accommodation in temporary shelters .
Military engineers arrived yesterday to start emergency repairs on bridges damaged by torrents of water .
Sniffer dogs and military divers were also called in to help look for bodies as the weather improved late yesterday .
The island 's airport was reopened in the morning and was packed with tourists , many of them British , trying to get home .
Streets in Funchal , the island capital , were littered with debris and coated with mud .
Many deaths were caused by torrents of water washing off the steep slopes of the dormant volcano at the centre of the island .
One of the most terrifying scenes was at a junction on the main road above Funchal , where a wave of water washed cars on to the roofs of houses .
A driver saw his wife and five - year - old child swept away .
There were also reports of panicked calls from inside road tunnels as trapped drivers warned of rising water levels .
In one spot the water washed away a fire engine that reportedly took several cars with it , trapping those inside , including one child who died .
Three rivers cross Funchal in deep channels supposedly designed to cope with flash floods .
These rapidly overflowed , sending torrents of water down streets and flooding downtown areas .
Drains burst under the pressure of the water , which punched holes in the tarmac of some streets .
Rescue workers were yesterday ­trying to get through to several towns and ­villages still trapped by mudslides .
These were mostly along the south coast of the island though there were also reports of problems in inland villages and at Seixal , in the north .
Pedro Barbosa , deputy chief of the regional civil protection service , told Reuters that one village , Curral das Freiras , was still cut off and could only be contacted by radio .
" We know there are some victims there , not a high number , but we will only know the details when rescuers reach the village later today , " he said .
Prime minister José Sócrates said he was " profoundly shocked " by the severity of the mudslides .
He promised the government would provide help to ensure Madeira could begin recovery work as quickly as possible .
Environmentalists blamed overbuilding along rivers that flow down deep ravines from the extinct volcano at the centre of the island .
" There have been innumerable failures in the way land has been developed which we have seen happening over many years and which , finally , are proving the consequences of working this way , " Helder Sinola , head of the Quercus environmentalist group , told Lusa news agency .
Sinola blamed authorities for allowing building in areas liable to be flooded .
This had been made worse by the dumping of rubble and earth in riverbeds and by overdevelopment that prevented water from draining into the ground .
" It is absurd to be talking about these things now , " retorted the mayor of Funchal , Miguel Albuquerque .
The people of Madeira , a small , mountainous Atlantic island 560 miles off the south - west coast of Portugal , said they were suffering a double blow .
Not only did they have to count the dead , but they also had to cope with the future impact of the storms on tourism – one of their main sources of income .
Eyewitness : ' Torrents of water appeared suddenly '
It had been raining heavily for much of the week , and already local people were complaining this was unusual .
But nobody was prepared for what happened early yesterday morning when a wild Atlantic storm struck .
The wind howled and the heavens opened .
It was a torrential downpour , more like being caught in a South Asian monsoon than on an island famed for gentle weather and winter sun .
And once it had started , it went on , and on .
Madeira is a vast volcanic rock that sits in the sea .
The water came cascading down the steep slopes of the mountains .
Huge brown torrents of water swept angrily down the ravines .
By mid-morning yesterday there were mudslips and bits of mountain were coming down .
The island 's infrastructure began to buckle .
Mobile phone signals disappeared , landlines stopped working and there were electricity cuts .
The airport was closed .
Torrents of water appeared suddenly , catching drivers in their cars .
The worst story was told by Norberto Castro , who was driving with his wife and child on a road outside Funchal .
" The car began to slide and I saw that I was losing control , " he said .
" I told my wife to get out with the child .
I saw them fighting against the water and a man trying to help them .
They were washed away . "
The body of his five - year - old son was found pinned against some railings by the water .
His wife and the man who tried to help her are still missing .
There was damage all across the island and today rescuers were still trying to get through to remote parts of Madeira .
In Funchal much of the damage was caused by the main river , which normally flows along the bottom of a channel that runs through the town .
The storm turned it into a river of sludge , overflowing its banks and sweeping away bridges .
Trees and masonry were swept along , getting tangled up in bridges until they gave way under the force of the water .
The water and mud flowed out onto the two main roads on either side of the channel , the Rua 31 de Janeiro and the Rua 5 de Outubro , and down into neighbouring streets .
Two other channels that pass through the city were also reported to have overflowed .
The lower down the slope you were , the more terrifying it was .
The worst damage was by the seafront , where it looked like the sea had risen , swallowing up the promenade , the marina and the restaurants along it .
All that could be seen of the cars were their roofs , a British - style red pillar box poked its head just above the murky water and all the restaurants and bars were flooded or closed .
Today the airport was packed with tourists trying to get home .
Portuguese authorities said it was the worst tragedy on the island for almost a century .

Effective use of biometric data could have prevented the apparent theft of Anglo - Israelis ’ identities , MK Meir Sheetrit ( Kadima ) , the architect of the country ’s Biometric ID Law , and a former minister of intelligence services , told Thursday evening .
Sheetrit said the identification documents – identity cards and passports – that would come into use as a result of his law would “ be impossible to forge .
” “ People attacked the law because they were afraid that someone could ‘ break in ’ to the biometric database and steal identities , ” said Sheetrit , arguing that it would be harder , not easier , to do that once the law went into effect .
“ Someone could steal a biometric identity card , but they simply could not make their fingerprint match the one stored in the government ’s databases , ” he said .
“ Once we have the smart chip in passports and identification cards , we will finally be part of the developments that we are beginning to see throughout the world , ” he added .
“ It will become increasingly difficult to cross international borders with fake identification once more and more countries install fingerprint - reading devices at border crossings .
” Sheetrit said there were an estimated 350,000 people living in Israel who used stolen or forged identities to acquire government services or for other criminal purposes .
“ Beyond those run -of - the - mill criminals , there is no doubt that this law will also make it more difficult for terrorists and spies , as well , to steal Israelis ’ identities , ” Sheetrit claimed .
He did , however , warn that “ the period in which the new documents are being issued is the time in which criminals will make an effort to secure false IDs with their own biometric information listed on the chip inside the document .
On Thursday , Interpol Secretary - General Ronald K. Noble said that “ it is becoming clear that those who carefully planned and carried out the murder of Mahmoud al - Mabhouh most likely used forged or fake European passports of innocent citizens whose identities were stolen .
” A number of the identities stolen belonged to Israeli citizens , causingalarm among many who hold foreign passports , particularly those fromthe United Kingdom and Ireland .
“ The majority of states in the world , including the United Kingdom andother European countries , are going in the direction of biometricidentity documents and biometric scans at borders , ” said Sheetrit .
“ Anda fingerprint is something that no one , no matter how good a wig or acostume they put on , can fake . ”
The National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre says alcoholic energy drinks are a growing danger because they fool people into thinking they are less drunk than they really are .
New research in the United States has found the caffeine in energy drinks is negating the sedative effect of alcohol , but not the intoxication .
The Research Centre 's Dr Lucy Burns says the drinks give people the false perception that they are safe and in control .
" They feel that the energy drinks are in fact negating the effect of the alcohol , perhaps making them more alert , and that 's not in fact true , " she said .
" People can find themselves in high risk situations , such as driving a vehicle ... [ or ] particularly girls in at - risk sexual situations . "
The national peak drug and alcohol research body is calling for a new education campaign into the dangers of alcoholic energy drinks .
Dr Burns says young people are unaware of the danger of such energy drinks .
" There 's this sort of subjective perception that people [ believe ] 'oh fine , so you can keep on drinking , ' " she said .
" What they find is in fact people do keep on drinking , so they 're drinking for a longer amount of time which means also they 're drinking more alcohol , so they are in fact at more risk rather than at less . "
France has become the first country in the world to remove gender identity disorder , also known as transexualism , from its list of officially recognised mental illnesses .
This is huge news but seems yet to have been picked up by English language news sources .
The news was reported yesterday in the French national daily Le Figaro and by the AFP newswire in French and English , so my details are from the Spanish language report ( e.g. this report in Colombian national El Tiempo ) .
My translation of an excerpt from the Spanish - language AFP newswire report :
The Minister of Health , Roselyne Bachelot , had announced on 16th May 2009 , before the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia , that transexualism would not be not considered a psychiatric disorder in France .
On that occasion , numerous personalities from the world of politics and science had signed an article that appeared in the press to petition the World Health Organisation to stop “ considering transexuals as affected by mental illness ” .
“ France is the first country in the world that does not consider transexualism as a mental illness ” said Jo√´l Bedos , French representative of IDAHO ( International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia ) , to AFP on Friday .
“ It ’s historic ” , added Philippe Caste , spokesperson for the ‘ Interasociativa lesbiana , gay , bi y trans ’ .
“ It was something very important and was greatly anticipated since the promise was made ” added Roselyne Bachelot .
This move will likely be widely supported by the transgender community .
However , the prospect of the diagnoses being removed in all countries might be a double - edge sword for some .
Although the fact that being diagnosed as mentally ill is a requirement to obtain sex- reassignment in some places has been resented , the removal of the diagnosis could raise fears that the procedure may become less accessible .
Simply being transgendered or having trangender desires itself does not currently qualify for the diagnoses , as it requires significant psychological distress to also be present .
However , campaigners argue that this distress is largely caused by discrimination and stigma , to which the diagnosis contributes .
The move by France , however , does not de-list the diagnoses from the World Health Organisation ’s ICD - 10 classification or the American Psychiatric Association ’s DSM and , in fact , the draft DSM - V only slightly modifies the criteria for the diagnoses in children and adults although does rename it ‘ gender incongruence ’ .
Nevertheless , this will put pressure on both the World Health Organisation and the American Psychiatric Association to remove the diagnoses which have a long - standing target of criticism from the LGBT community .

People across the town have been sampling the gifts of bread
Residents of a Cornish seaside town have been left mystified by personal gifts of bread left on their doorsteps .
The self - named " Phantom Breadmaker " has been making repeat visits to some homes in Fowey .
When the local town crier first opened his door to the little loaves he was surprised by the personally - addressed parcel .
Having jokingly asked for a special order , he was stunned when on Thursday , it arrived .
' Lovely idea '
Town crier Michael Penprase said : " It was beautiful - looking bread .
My wife put a notice in the window asking for a sliced loaf .
" Sure enough , this morning in a bag on the door handle were three sliced loaves of bread . "
People across the town have been sampling the gifts , left with a note from The Phantom Bread Maker of Old Fowey Town pictured as a cloaked figure .
Some have their own theories about who the Phantom is , but no - one is letting on .
Boutique owner Belinda Weatherall said : " It could only happen in a place like Fowey .
" I think it 's a lovely idea and I hope he never gets discovered . "
Police in the town warned people not to eat the bread in case it was contaminated .
" It is absurdly premature to think of withdrawing stimulus while bank credit is still sliding .
To have allowed this monetary collapse to occur a full 18 months after the financial cataclysm is extreme incompetence .
They seem to have forgotten that the lesson of the 1930s was the falling quantity of money , " he said .
Fox News ’ Glenn
Beck became a rabid critic of President Barack Obama Wednesday after the president said that there had been relatively little stimulus money wasted .
Literally .
The Fox host –whom a Huffington Post blogger once blasted as a “ somewhat mediocre comedian ” — decided that animal noises could best express his displeasure .

Obama said that critics who thought there would be a lot of waste were wrong : “ I ’m grateful that the Congress agreed to my request that the bill include no earmarks , that all project received funding based solely on their merits .
And despite that , I still was concerned — Joe and I were just talking in the back — when this thing passed we said , ‘$ 787 billion .
Somewhere there ’s going to be some story of some money that ended up being misspent . ' ”
“ $ 787 billion being spent out of 18 months .
That ’s a lot — that ’s a lot of money .
And it is a testimony to Vice President Biden and his team that , as Joe puts it , ‘ The dog so far at least has n’t barked , ' ” the president said of the stimulus naysayers .
To prove the president wrong , Beck launched into a fit of uncontrollable barking .
“ The dog has n’t barked ? ” he screamed .
“ It ’s like a pack of wild Cujos ripping up the flesh of the American people . ”
“ We ’ve given you a dozen examples over the past year .
Stimulus debacles .
How about the wasteful programs ?
How about the incestuous handouts to invented congressional districts ? ” asked Beck .
“ Oh .
And here ’s my favorite .
Lawnmowers that magically created 50 jobs , ” Beck sneered .

The Fox News host again barked uncontrollably at the screen that recently showed Obama speaking .
“ He ’s ignoring the giant Rotweiller attached to his leg , ” exclaimed Beck .

Justin Garcia , 30 , allegedly slashed his cousin during an argument Sunday afternoon about whether almond milk or whole milk was the better milk .
Japan and China are vying for the rank of the world 's second biggest economy Japan 's economy grew by a better - than - expected 1.1 % in the final quarter of last year , according to official figures .
This is the equivalent of an annualised increase of 4.6 % .
However , despite the growth in October to December , the economy contracted by 5 % over the whole of 2009 .
China now rivals Japan for the rank of the world 's second - biggest economy , and is on course to overtake Japan .
China 's economy expanded by 8.7 % in 2009 .
" The Japanese population has become quite sober about themselves and relatively pessimistic about the country 's outlook , " said Takuji Okubo , chief economist at Societe Generale in Tokyo .
Japan 's return to growth has been led by exports , particularly to China , which is now its largest overseas market .
Cautious consumers Consumer spending , which accounts for about 60 % of the Japanese economy , rose 0.7 % from the previous quarter as shoppers took advantage of government incentives on cars and home appliances .
However , consumer spending remains weak in general .
Corporate capital spending rose by 1 % in the quarter , seeing the first expansion since the three months to March 2008 .
Public investment fell 1.6 % , while exports jumped 5 % .
Last month , China said its economy expanded by 8.7 % in 2009 , exceeding even the government 's own initial expectations .
This led many analysts to believe that Japan 's latest figures would confirm that China had overtaken it to become the world 's second - biggest economy .
However , China and Japan 's figures are now so close , and the ways of measuring economic growth are so complex and variable , that their relative rankings are still within the margin of error .
Both countries ' figures are also based on preliminary data and subject to revision .

Here is a video that presents a satirical take on the whole Google Buzz privacy scandal .
We obviously can't say which one , but yes , a source from one of Google 's long - time competitors sent this video to us .
That 's why they call it " Valleyfreude , " folks .
Watch :
A SOLDIER allegedly waterboarded his four - year - old daughter because she failed to recite her ABCs .
Joshua Tabor , 27 , flew into such a rage that he submerged her face about three or four times , Britain 's Daily Mail reported .
He admitted to police that he chose the CIA torture technique because his daughter was terrified of water .
Mr Tabor , who is a soldier at a base in Tacoma , Washington , is said to have grabbed his daughter and submerged her face - up into a bowl of water .
Police said that they saw bruising on the girl 's back and scratch marks on her throat , and when they asked her how she got them , she said : " Daddy did it . "
Police arrested Mr Tabor after neighbours reported seeing him walking around the neighbourhood wearing his Kevlar helmet and threatening to break windows .
President Barack Obama has outlawed waterboarding but it was used frequently by the CIA on terror suspects while George W. Bush was in office .
Suspects would have water poured over their faces , giving them the sensation that they were drowning .
Mr Tabor has been charged with second degree assault .
His daughter has been taken into care .
ALL 4 INVOLVED IN SENATE HOMELAND SECURITY BREAKIN CIA “ N - O - C ” AGENTS
–
CIA PROGRAM MAY HAVE TRAINED DOMESTIC “ DEATH SQUADS ”
–
By Gordon Duff
Last week ’s breakin at Senator Mary Landrieu ’s office in the New Orleans Federal Building was more than it seemed , much more .
All of the 4 arrested had been trained by the CIA and , possibly , Israel .
One arrested , Stan Dai , is listed as an Operations Officer of the Department of Defense Irregular Warfare Program and a known expert and lecturer on , not only surveillance but explosives training , assassinations and “ false flag operations . ”
If you wanted a plane to crash , an enemy to get sick and die or a building to blow up , Dai would be the man to know how to make it happen .
Problem is , his skills were being used as part of a criminal conspiracy inside the United States against members of our own government .
Original reports on the “ break - in ” were also wrong .
One of those arrested was found blocks away with a covert receiver , managing the office bugs .
The man in the car is identified as Stan Dai , Operations Officer for the Department of Defense Irregular Warfare Program :
“ one of the four was arrested with a listening device in a car blocks from the senator ’s offices . ”
The FBI ’s affidavit noted that Flanagan and Basel were in the building with O’Keefe , and a federal law enforcement official confirmed to AP that Dai was the one in the car . ”
What is not initially known is whether this was the first attempt or , as is much more likely , an additional incursion to plant new bugs as the ones in place were missing key conversations .
Also , it is not known how many “ black ops ” crews are being run by the CIA inside the United States in violation of their charter or if their operations are being limited to spying on Democratic lawmakers or if operations of a more threatening nature have been performed but remain undiscovered .
Additionally , as this was a covert op against US government investigations of , not only terrorism and terrorism funding but major financial crimes against the United States , it is unclear who the recipient of the “ product , ” an intelligence industry term for “ output ” or information put up for “ distribution ” might be .
Potential buyers could be the Republican Party , Israel , Turkey , India , Russia , China , Venezuela , North Korea or financial institutions involved in massive money laundering schemes being investigated by the Senate ’s Committee on Homeland Security of which Senator Landireu is a member .
Learn how the Intelliegence Community Center for Academic Excellence ( IC CAE ) at Georgetown University and the CIA got involved in this seedy domestic “ black ops ” group .
In a story broken this week :
Dai ’s links to the intelligence community appear to be particularly strong .
He was a speaker at Georgetown University ’s Central Intelligence Agency summer school program in June 2009 , and is also listed as an Assistant Director at the Intelligence Community Center of Academic Excellence at Trinity in D.C. ( note the parallels between the Georgetown program tied to “ conservative think tanks ” and the GWU program with similar ties and the same characters where we trace Dr. Hasan , Ft Hood mass murderer to )
The university ’s president Patricia McGuire told The Associated Press that it promoted careers in intelligence but denied that it trains students to be spies .
( a seemingly meaningless statement considering what has happened )
The Trinity program received a “ $ 250,000 renewable grant from the U.S. Intelligence Community ” upon launching in 2004 , according to its Web site .
The program ’s goals are stated :
The IC CAE in National Security Studies Program was established during 2005 in response to the nation ’s increasing need for IC professionals who are educated and trained with the unique knowledge , skills and capabilities to carry out America ’s national security objectives .
The CIA summer school packet also notes that Dai “ served as the Operations Officer of a Department of Defense irregular warfare fellowship program . ”
Dai has been an undergraduate fellow with the Washington - based national security think tank Foundation for the Defense of the Democracies ( FDD ) , according to his College Leadership Program award biography at the Phillips Foundation — as Lindsay Beyerstein first reported .
FDD claims that it ’s partly funded by the US State Department .
Its Leadership Council and Board of Advisers comprise many high - profile conservative politicians and public figures — including former House speaker Newt Gingrich , Sen. Joseph Lieberman ( I - CT ) , Weekly Standard editor William Kristol , Rep. Eric Cantor ( R - VA ) , former Bush official Richard Perle and columnist Charles Krauthammer .
Operatives recruited in universities and managed thru conservative think tanks receive paid “ vacations ” to Israel and elsewhere , places where they are trained in silent killing , use of poisons , explosives and other potentially useful skills whether their career is in intelligence or politics .
As with other terrorist suspects such as those who travel to Afghanistan for their training , these domestic types are funded covertly through the US government but , as we see in New Orleans , rented out to either Israel , India or the Republican party .
This history of this program parallels one from the Nixon administration after the Vietnam War.
CIA recruiters subsidized hundreds , perhaps several thousand veterans , Marines , Special Forces and Army Rangers who served in unofficial and semi-official capacities in and out of the US .
Some serve to this day .
Today ’s , if current bio’s are any indication , depend more on ideology than physical bravery or intellectual qualifications .
Perhaps the “ purity ” test left little room for battle hardened veterans who might choose country over party and loyalty over cash .
In a “ clarification ” of how Israel is involved and sees their cooperation in this domestic terror organization as part of their support of the United States as a trusted ally , we received the following story :
Dai traveled to Israel for two weeks in 2004 on an FDD ( Foundation for the Defense of the Democracies , a conservative Washington based “ think tank ” with CIA ties ) - sponsored trip , the Daily Herald reported .
“ All expenses ( room , board and travel ) will be assumed by FDD , ” FDD ’s Web site said of its Israel program .
A host of FDD testimonials from Academic Fellows reveal that many fellows have traveled to Israel for training and field trips .
The Foundation says the course includes “ lectures by academics , diplomats , military and intelligence officials , and politicians from Israel , Jordan , India , Turkey and the United States . ”
FDD proclaims that “ Like America , Israel is at the forefront in the war on terrorism . ”
Further explaining its interest in Israel , FDD declares :
“ Both the United States and Israel are democracies , and both face the same enemy .
It is this connection between Israel ’s experience and the future of the United States that is the essence of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies . ”
One FDD testimonial , by 2004 - 2005 fellow Dr. Cathal J. Nolan , highlighted the group ’s bond with high - level intelligence and government officials in Israel :
“ The access which FDD provided to top government officials–and to academic , police , security service , and intelligence experts at the highest levels –was truly remarkable .
I know of no other foundation or fellowship program which is able to provide so much top - level access and first - hand intelligence and security service information in so compact a form , or in such an intellectually stimulating environment . ”
No explanation was offered as to how this “ stimulating environment ” managed to foster attacks on high security government offices , filled with vital intelligence .
If Israel and the United States face the same enemy , why is Israel training Americans to attack America ?
One ca n’t help but see parallels between “ junkets ” to Israel for “ intelligence training ” and Islamic militants who go to Afghanistan for “ terrorist ” training .
How few Islamic terrorists would we catch if they were aided by Washington “ think tanks , ” guided by the Department of Defense or funded by the CIA ?
Last week , Veterans Today outlined the many high security projects being monitored from Senator Landrieu ’s office which included , not only terrorist money laundering and other security issues but investigations targeting tens of billions of dollars being hidden offshore illegally by Americans , many with ties to Israel .
The projects subject to spying by this CIA / Israeli operation are , among others : ( source : Department of Homeland Security and the United States Senate )
SENATE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE
Current hearings held by the Senate Homeland Security Committee chaired by Landireu , hearings subject to this espionage attack involve :
Intelligence reform in the aftermath of the Christmas terrorist attack
Overviews of contracting corruption in Afghanistan
Planning for securing America ’s diplomats around the world
The Terrorist Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act ( IRTPA )
Investigating the root causes of the Ft. Hood attack
Securing America from financial crimes
America ’s Defense from Cyber Attack
Development plans for “ post surge ” Afghanistan
Current investigations by the Sub -Committee on Investigations are :
Speculation in trading and how it effects national security
How US banks help overseas corporation dodge US taxes
Report on Tax Havens hiding billions from the IRS
Massive abuses of government credit cards by employees
Ending “ offshore secrecy ” to allow the US to recover billions in tax shortfall
Shell Oil credit card interest abuses
Medicaid abuse and equipment overcharges
Billions in unpaid taxes on Medicaid income by American doctors
Speculation in the energy markets costing American consumers billions a year
Failures in United Nations reform , waste and corruption
Speculation and manipulation that controls and rigs crude oil and gasoline markets
and many many more
9/11
The Senate HSC is responsible for implementing all intelligence reforms resulting from the findings of the 9/11 commission especially in light of continued failures as demonstrated by the Ft. Hood tragedy and the Detroit terror attack .
Current contracting oversight responsibilities :
Overseeing all USAID reconstruction contracts in Afghanistan
Investigating massive corruption tied to the US Embassy in Kabul
Overseeing all US contractors used in Iraq , Afghanistan and around the world in regard to corrupt practices and cost overruns
Detecting and Prosecuting Contractor Fraud
No information has been given as to how Federal authorities came to break up this terrorist operation but we are told that informants inside the CIA still loyal to the United States were involved .
The arrest of Dai , a highly trained operative blocks away from the scene opens a number of scenarios .
With much of the CIA ’s former leadership now employed by Blackwater / Xe , a company owned and controlled by Republican party leadership , the lines between domestic and foreign intelligence operations have become blurred .
“ CIA agents ” killed in Afghanistan recently may all have been Blackwater / Xe employees , some or all former CIA operatives seeking the higher salaries of the private security industry .
Has the CIA become “ interchangable ” with a mercenary group tied to a political party and available for hire by anyone with enough money ?
The deteriorating security sitiuation in Afghanistan and Pakistan gives creedence to this hypothesis .
The use of forces designated only to be used against American enemies outside the United States against elected officials of our own government , possibly on behalf of an unfriendly foreign government , is a total indictment of the usefulness of our entire intelligence community .
Attempts to centralize intelligence resources only tied those resources to individuals whose political ideologies surpassed loyalty to the United States or were superceded by moral flexibility , so often the case with politicians , now popularly described under the term “ situational narcissism . ” ( believing one ’s position places one above any moral code or ethical standard )
Significant polarization within the political community during the Bush administration encouraged members of the intelligence community to look on members of the opposition political party as terrorist sympathizers .
We are told that many members of the military and intelligence community may be actively involved in “ extracurricular ” activities , freelancing for individuals no longer in government .
Those co-opted by extremist views are vulnerable to ploys from foreign intelligence agencies who represent themselves as part of “ right thinking ” or “ conservative ” patriotic groups .
This is a common ploy , developed long ago by the KGB in the Soviet Union and now SOP , ( Standard Operating Proceedure ) for agencies of friend and foe alike .
It is now a subject for a legitimate investigation as are such “ accidents ” as the Ohio plane crash that killed Mike Connell , GOP “ vote rigging ” guru who asked for police protection from Karl Rove tied to rigging the 2004 Presidential Election .
Connell ’s family believes his death was murder .
US Senators , investigative reporters , whistleblowing scientists , “ girlfriends ” and so many other categories seem to die in numbers well beyond any actuarial table .
We are already spending billions of dollars a year hunting foreign terrorists that threaten the United States .
Do we need to double this and go on a “ witch hunt ” within our own agencies , the ones we entrust with our own security ?
There is only one answer :
Yes , of course we must .
We may not have a few “ bad apples , ” we may have a diseased orchard .

The 19 - year - old gunman , believed to have deserted in protest against the Gaza pullout this month , opened fire as the bus passed through Shfaram .
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon called the incident a reprehensible act by a " bloodthirsty terrorist " .
The gunman was beaten to death by a crowd of people who stormed the bus after his weapon ran out of bullets .
Israel is preparing to pull its settlers and soldiers out of the Gaza Strip and correspondents say there have been fears of attacks by Jewish settlers opposed to the pullout .
' Deserter '
The gunman , Eden Nathan Zaada from the Jewish settlement of Tapuah in the West Bank , wore his army uniform and a skullcap .
According to one eyewitness , the soldier opened fire while talking to the bus driver , who is thought to be one of those killed .
The 19 - year - old is said to have deserted his army unit with his gun
At least 12 people were wounded in the shooting , some seriously .
Mohammed Barakeh , an Israeli Arab member of parliament , said at the scene that the dead were Israeli Arabs and all residents of Shfaram .
Israel media are reporting that the army said Mr Zaada had a " problematic background " .
He was believed to be a member of the outlawed extremist Kach party .
He is said to have deserted his unit a few weeks ago , after refusing to take part in the evacuation of Jewish settlements .
The father of the gunman , Yitzhak Nathan Zaada , said he had asked the army to find his son .
" I was n't afraid he would do something , " he told the Associated Press news agency , adding that his son had told him he would find the time to return his gun .
Protest fear
Israel 's chief of police has dispatched an extra 2,000 officers and urged all Israelis to remain calm .
Moshe Karadi asked people to await an official inquiry into the incident .
Mr Sharon condemned the attack .
" This terror incident is a deliberate attempt to harm the relations between the citizens of Israel , " he said .
" Terror between civilians is the most dangerous thing for the future of Israel and its democratic stability , " he added .
Settler groups have also denounced the violence .
" Murder is murder is murder , and there can be no other response but to denounce it completely and express revulsion , " Bentsi Lieberman , the head of a settlers ' council , told AP .
The bloodiest single attack on Palestinians by a Jewish extremist dates back to 1994 when US - born Jewish Baruch Goldstein shot dead 29 Muslims at a mosque in the West Bank city of Hebron .
