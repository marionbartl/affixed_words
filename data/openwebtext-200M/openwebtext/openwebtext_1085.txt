In this post guest poster Prajneet Singh from BeyondMegapixels takes a look at the humble 50 mm lens .
In today ’s digital world , technology has made everything easier to reach , with many devices working as more than one device , and universal remotes to control them .
The simple purpose – convenience .
And that is what happened with the advent of zoom lenses .
In today ’s date , with high zoom compacts flooding the market , and manufacturers making lenses that zoom in far enough to bring a bird sitting 50 feet away seem as if it is sitting in front of your lens , a lot of us are so used to zoom lenses that we simply cannot imagine having a lens without a zoom , however much it may be .
But , it is for a fact that the best optical quality is delivered by prime lenses ( fixed focal length , no zoom lenses ) .
Why ?
In simple words , because they use a smaller number of glass elements inside the lens , which means lesser loss of quality , and hence better pictures .
Anyways , this post is not to highlight the advantages of primes over zooms , but to highlight one particular prime lens that I feel is a must use for everyone with an SLR , at least for some time .
I am talking about the 50 mm prime lens – or the nifty fifty as it is rightly called .
At this focal length , these lenses show the same view that you see through your eyes , and so are also referred to as normal lenses .
The 50 mm f/1.8 is the least expensive lens at this focal range .
And this , dear readers , is a marvel .
I ’ll keep it very simple … why the 50 mm is a must :
At under $ 100 starting , it is very very cheap , and an easy buy for the hobbyist with a budget .
, and an easy buy for the hobbyist with a budget .
Do n’t let the price fool you .
The optical quality of even the cheapest 50 mm is amazing to say the least , owing to its rather simple design .
Much better than many expensive zooms even , this lens is loved mostly for its sharpness and bokeh .

The nifty fifty is light , small and so very convenient to carry around , whether in your bag , or on your camera .
to carry around , whether in your bag , or on your camera .
Primes in general , and the 50 mm especially , are fast lenses i.e. they have bigger apertures that allow you to shoot at high shutter speeds even in low light – one major aspect where most zooms lack .
The fastest telephoto I ’ve heard of has a max aperture of f/2.8 , and the fastest prime I ’ve heard of is a 50 mm f/0.95 !

Perhaps the most important attribute of all primes , after their optics , is the learning they offer .
With a fixed frame of view , the only zoom you have at your disposal is your feet .
With this ‘ restriction ’ one ends up being very careful , and also very creative , with their compositions , and also more involved in the whole photographic process .
With time you ’ll find that even with zooms , you ’ll end up getting more ‘ keepers ’ because of this .
In essence , primes are great exercise for your composition muscles .
Last but not the least , we bust the myth that the 50 mil is used only for portraits and street photography .
Mentioned below are some points that show just how versatile this little wonder is :
Shooting in low light :
As mentioned above , the wide aperture lets in more light , allowing you to shoot without flash in low light .
This lens is great for shooting indoors where a flash sort of ruins the feel .
Of course the wide aperture also means that you ’ll have a very shallow depth of field , and hence you need to compose your shot such that you get the subject completely in focus .

T he Reversed Macro :
Not all of us can afford a dedicated macro lens .
And the good news is that you can use this 50 mm as a macro lens by reversing it .
You ’ll need a reversal ring for that .
You lose autofocus , but that ’s not all that bad when you ’re getting a macro lens at this price .

The Wide effect :
If you do n’t have a dedicated wide angle lens , do n’t fret .
You might not get as wide an angle as with a dedicated lens , but you can still get a wide angle look by moving farther from your subject , and using a smaller aperture ( larger f number ) .
This covers a wider area and gives a larger zone of sharpness , just like a wide angle lens .

The Telephoto effect : Just like above , you can also simulate a telephoto effect by getting close to your subject and opening up the aperture .
This gives a nicely blurred background which is a characteristic of telephotos .

Candid Camera :
The fact that this lens offers a field of view just like that of the human eye* i.e. you get what you see , plus the lens ’s small size make it a great lens for getting candid shots without getting noticed .
In fact , since it sees what you see , you can even shoot without using the viewfinder .
Simply point your camera in the direction you ’re looking , and click !

DOF :
The large aperture offers extremely shallow depth of field which is another creativity stimulator .
One can get some very nice looking photos with imaginative use of the shallow DOF .

Portraits and Streets :
This lens is by far most used for portraiture and street photography and gives some great results in both fields .
* The 50 mm replicates the human eye field of view on 35 mm film cameras or full frame dSLRs like the Canon 5D and Nikon D3 .
To get the same field of view on an APS - C camera like the Rebel XSi ( 450D ) or Nikon D90 , you ’ll need to get a 35 mm lens .
But even then , the field of view of 50 mm lenses on cropped sensors is very good to work with .
I ’ve heard some people say that primes are made of cheap glass and are used only to take fancy pictures where half the objects in the frame are blurred .
That is clearly the result of ignorance and lack of ( correct ) information .
Agreed the 50 mm is affordable , but primes going up to 500 or even 600 mm can be the most expensive lenses in your kit , if you can afford them !
Back in the old days , 50 mm used to be the norm in lenses .
Today , the zooms have gained mass popularity , and rightly too for the convenience offered .
But even then , the 50 mm remains a brilliant piece of optical engineering , and I recommend that you try it , especially if you ’re a hobbyist or serious amateurs .
It wo n’t cost you that much , and I guarantee that you ’ll love it !

For over a decade , Judid Angamarca lived in a wooden shack on stilts next to an old waste pit , where for years oil sludge from drilling was dumped .
The patch of land , the size of a tennis court , was cleaned and covered with earth in 1996 .
But it stubbornly refused to produce anything she tried to grow .
Her three children played in the grass as babies ; her animals roamed around , too .
The residents living in and around San Carlos have long lived among the wells , pipes , and waste pits laid down for the oil bonanza in the Ecuadorean Amazon .
But two years ago , from a six - inch hole , oil waste emerged – and so did Ms. Angamarca ’s doubts about her dead pigs and chickens and her children ’s rashes and coughs .
The government relocated her family to a new home recently .
“ You get mad , you want to leave [ the area ] , but you have nowhere to go , ” says Angamarca .
San Carlos sits in the middle of more than 100 wells drilled in the Sacha field by Texaco , which pumped oil as the sole operator of a consortium here from 1972 until 1990 .
At the time , it was one of the highest concentrations of wells in the Amazonian region , and today this remote town finds itself in the middle of what could be the largest damage claim against the oil industry in its history .
The landmark lawsuit , which began in 1993 in New Yo rk and is now in an Ecuadorean court in this jungle region , alleges that Texaco , which was acquired by Chevron in 2001 , knowingly unleashed toxins across an estimated 1,700 square miles – roughly the size of Rhode Island .
This allegedly occurred in one of the most biodiverse forests on the planet .
Plaintiffs ’ lawyers say Texaco ’s dumping represents 30 times more than the crude spilled in the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska .
According to a report by a court - appointed expert , Chevron could face $ 27 billion in damages to soil , groundwater , and drinking water – and even for cancer - related deaths .
The decision is expected any day .
Chevron says Texaco cleaned up its share of damage after leaving the country and that the state oil company , which took over its operations entirely in 1992 , has not fulfilled its environmental obligations .
If Chevron loses the case , it will affect more than its finances :
It could reverberate throughout the industry at a time when companies big and small are searching for oil in ever more remote areas , including the Amazon basin .
“ This will definitely make it harder on oil companies working in these areas , ” says Fernando Santos , a former Ecuadorean energy minister and oil analyst in Quito .
“ It brings them uncertainty .
It sets a precedent that if you leave , it does not end the story .
Anyone can open it up again . ”
The lawsuit names 48 plaintiffs who represent approximately 30,000 residents .
Plaintiffs ’ lawyers claim that , contrary to standard US practice at the time , Texaco dumped more than 18 billion gallons of toxic waste ; left more than 900 waste pits of toxic sludge , like the one in Angamarca ’s front yard ; and flared millions of cubic yards of poisonous gasses into the atmosphere .
That , they say , has led to 1,000 - plus deaths from cancer and to ecological damage beyond repair .
“ There was almost no escape for people living [ with ] all of this , ” says Steven Donziger , a New York - based attorney and legal adviser to the plaintiffs ’ case .
Texaco saved some $ 8 billion by using substandard practices , according to the report issued by the court - appointed expert .
Chevron denies liability
The science to assess damages is at best faulty , at worst fraudulent , Chevron says .
Chevron claims the report ’s author , selected by an Ecuadorean judge , sides with the plaintiffs .
It also says that public statements by Ecuador ’s president , Rafael Correa , in favor of the plaintiffs makes the trial a farce .
The oil company ’s defense centers on the fact that Texaco spent about $ 40 million in the mid-1990s cleaning up more than one - third of the waste pits , more than its share of the consortium at the time .
State - owned Petroecuador owned the other two - thirds .
“ Texaco did its job , now the state has to do its part , ” says James Craig , Chevron ’s lead spokesman for the case , standing in front of an open waste pit that is about 200 feet long and 75 feet wide , a dark brown pit with a layer of degraded petroleum five feet deep .
It is an example Mr. Craig uses to show what Chevron says are Petroecuador ’s unmet responsibilities .
The pit , surrounded by giant palms and Heliconia flowers that hang like racks of red bells , is outside the small town of Shushufindi .
It illustrates the seemingly irreconcilable views on either side of the courtroom .
The day before , plaintiffs ’ supporters had accompanied visitors to the same site to present the opposite argument .
This , they said , exemplified the damage wreaked by Texaco – the exclusive operator of this area – for one purpose : to cut costs .
Far - reaching implications for a decision against Chevron
The local community here is not completely united against Chevron .
Some residents are n’t even aware of the case .
Others dismiss the claims that the water is unsafe .
Johana Mantuano , who lives near the Victoria River , where children dive off oil pipelines into the water below , says she worries little .
Some even quietly say that Petroecuador is far worse than Texaco ever was .
Mr. Santos , the former energy minister , agrees .
Still , a decision against Chevron would reverberate across the oil industry , says Santos , especially at a time when oil companies from China to Argentina are voraciously exploring petroleum sources in the Amazon , one of the largest unexplored areas for hydrocarbons after Antarctica .
Locals hope it echoes in areas where foreign oil firms still operate .
Luis Yanza , of the Amazon Defense Coalition , the group leading the fight against Chevron , says his community used to kowtow to oil companies .
When oil first started to flow from wells here , residents say they had little idea of its impact .
Mr. Yanza says he would go to school with red blotches all over his body , and so would everyone else .
“ We looked like fish , ” he says .
“ We would laugh at each other . ”
It is the first time that indigenous people of the Amazon have made an American oil company submit to jurisdiction in their country ’s court system , plaintiffs say .
“ The most important impact is giving people the confidence to demand that oil companies change their practices , ” Yanza says .
The plaintiffs are supported by US - funded environmental groups , and celebrities such as Sting have spoken out on their behalf .
Still , a strong current of David vs. Goliath runs through this stretch of the country .
The case ’s lead lawyer , Ecuadorean Pablo Fajardo , worked as a laborer in the palm and oil industries , and says he became a lawyer because the local community did not have one .
To put himself through school , he relied on donations from local priests and friends , who collected money for his studies .
This is his first case .
He closes his eyes when asked what it means to him : “ Chevron is fighting for their reputation and for money , ” says Mr. Fajardo .
“ We are fighting for life . ”
Chevron on the defensive
Chevron has fought back mightily .
The corporation has taken visitors to the sites they have cleaned up and point out rivers where fecal matter , not hydrocarbons , they say , has made the local population sick .
It has taken out quarter - page ads in local newspapers with headlines such as “ the fraud of the century . ”
Chevron recently tucked 280,000 supplements into four Ecuadorean papers , highlighting the impact that relocation programs – instituted by a government desperate for the prosperity oil would bring – has had on this once pristine region .
“ We expect the judgment here will be against us , ” says Chevron spokesman Craig .
“ If we do n’t find justice in Ecuador , we will go abroad . ”
Residents here say it is neither revenge nor money that inspires their fight , but a desire for safe water for drinking , cooking , bathing , and washing their clothes .
They blame the government just as much as big oil .
They say they have long been abandoned by both .
“ What do I want ?
I just want them to come here and clean up so we can all move on , ” says Angamarca .
“ So that I know my children will be OK . "
Flapjack lovers , rejoice .
Now you can make fresh , 97 % fat - free pancakes in as little as 30 seconds using the ChefStack Automatic Pancake Machine ( $ 3,500 ) .
This microwave - sized wonder uses no-mess batter pouches to crank out stack after stack of four - inch diameter pancakes , and does n't even require supervision , letting you cook up breakfast for you and your crew while you get your other morning activities out of the way — like taking a shower , brushing your teeth , or downing a half - dozen mimosas .
This is my suggestion about what needs to go into the Haskell Platform .
Consider the following extremely simple program :
s = " λ " main = do write
File " test.txt " s s2 <- readFile " test.txt " print ( s == s 2 )
No prizes for guessing that the output of this program is not “ True ” .
It highlights an essential problem with the Haskell standard library — many of the functions provided by the Prelude , System .
IO , System .
Posix and many others are completely broken ( by design ) and silently corrupt your data , unless it is composed only of ASCII characters .
The problem is that these APIs use Strings for operating system calls ( such as reading / writing files , reading environment variables etc ) .
A String is a list of unicode Chars , but none of the operating system calls have a clue what unicode chars are — they work entirely with bytes , which are a completely different kind of thing .
Result : your program breaks without warning if you do n’t happen to be using ASCII .
And even worse , many libraries are built on the use of Strings and standard library functions , and they inherit these same problems , so as a user of those libraries , you can end up with problems that you ca n’t even work around .
For the library developer , too , it can be a very nasty problem — you start developing code using Strings , which works fine for ages , but a long time later you realise you ca n’t support just ASCII , and really you need Data .
ByteString , which requires changing function signatures or duplicating existing code if you do n’t want to break compatibility .
This is a rather embarrassing situation for the standard library of a modern language .
What ’s worse is that even if you include the Haskell Platform as it currently stands , as far as I can see there is no solution to this bug — no correct way to simply write a string out to disk and read it back !
I presume this is because there is no universally accepted library for dealing with encodings .
Personally , I ’d like to see the standard library change to remove the pretence that you can talk Unicode to the operating system , but at the very least we need a standardised way of doing the right thing , so that developers ( of both programs and libraries ) do n’t have to use those broken functions , and know what the correct alternatives are .

Unix had computer networking built in from the start
The computer world is notorious for its obsession with what is new - largely thanks to the relentless engine of Moore 's Law that endlessly presents programmers with more powerful machines .
Given such permanent change , anything that survives for more than one generation of processors deserves a nod .
Think then what the Unix operating system deserves because in August 2009 , it celebrates its 40th anniversary .
And it has been in use every year of those four decades and today is getting more attention than ever before .
Work on Unix began at Bell Labs after AT&T , ( which owned the lab ) , MIT and GE pulled the plug on an ambitious project to create an operating system called Multics .
The idea was to make better use of the resources of mainframe computers and have them serve many people at the same time .
" With Multics they tried to have a much more versatile and flexible operating system , and it failed miserably , " said Dr Peter Salus , author of the definitive history of Unix 's early years .
Time well spent
The cancellation meant that two of the researchers assigned to the project , Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie , had a lot of time on their hands .
Frustrated by the size and complexity of Multics but not its aims of making computers more flexible and interactive , they decided to try and finish the work - albeit on a much smaller scale .
The commitment was helped by the fact that in August 1969 , Ken Thompson 's wife took their new baby to see relatives on the West Coast .
She was due to be gone for a month and Thompson decided to use his time constructively - by writing the core of what became Unix .
He allocated one week each to the four core components of operating system , shell , editor and assembler .
It was during that time and after as the growing team got the operating system running on a DEC computer known as a PDP - 7 that Unix came into being .
It got us away from the total control that businesses like IBM and DEC had over us
Peter Salus , author
Bill Thompson on " The enlightenment 's operating system "
By the early 1970s , five people were working on Unix .
Thompson and Ritchie had been joined by Brian Kernighan , Doug McIlroy and Joe Ossanna .
The name was reportedly coined by Brian Kernighan - a lover of puns who wanted Unics to stand in contrast to its forebear Multics .
The team got Unix running well on the PDP7 and soon it had a long list of commands it could carry out .
The syntax of many of those commands , such as chdir and cat , are still in use 40 years on .
Along with it came the C programming language .
But , said Dr Salus , it was n't just the programming that was important about Unix - the philosophy behind it was vital too .
" Unix was created to solve a few problems , " said Dr Salus , " the most important of which was to have something that was much more compact than the operating systems that were current at that time which ran on the dinosaurs of the computer age . "
Net benefits Back in the early 1970s , computers were still huge and typically overseen by men in white coats who jealously guarded access to the machines .
The idea of users directly interacting with the machine was downright revolutionary .
" It got us away from the total control that businesses like IBM and DEC had over us , " said Dr Salus .
Word about Unix spread and people liked what they heard .
" Once it had jumped out of the lab and out of AT&T it caught fire among the academic community , " Dr Salus told the BBC .
What helped this grassroots movement was AT&T 's willingness to give the software away for free .
DEC 's early computers were for many years restricted to laboratories
That it ran on cheap hardware and was easy to move to different machines helped too .
" The fact that its code was adaptable to other types of machinery , in large and small versions meant that it could become an operating system that did more than just run on your proprietary machine , " said Dr Salus .
In May 1975 it got another boost by becoming the chosen operating system for the internet .
The decision to back it is laid out in the then - nascent Internet Engineering Task Force 's document RFC 681 , which notes that Unix " presents several interesting capabilities " for those looking to use it on the net .
It did n't stop there .
Unix was adapted for use on any and every computer from mainframes to desktops .
While it is true that it did languish in the 1980s and 90s as corporations scrapped over whose version was definitive , the rise of the web has given it new life .
The wars are over and the Unix specification is looked after by the Open Group - an industry body set up to police what is done in the operating system 's name .
Now Unix , in a variety of guises , is everywhere .
Most of the net runs on Unix - based servers and the Unix philosophy heavily influenced the open source software movements and the creation of the Linux desktop OS .
Windows runs the communication stack created for Unix .
Apple 's OS X is broadly based on Unix and it is possible to dig into that software and find text remarkably similar to that first written by Dennis Ritchie in 1971 .
" The really nice part is the flexibility and adaptability , " said Dr Salus , explaining why it is so widespread and how its ethic fits with a world at home with the web .
" Unix is the best screwdriver ever built , " said Dr Salus .

The major drawback of rimless semi-auto cartridges in revolvers is that they require specially made revolvers .
These low - production , somewhat scarce and highly - specialized revolvers are limited to sometimes fragile and expensive moon / half moon ammunition clips .
Generally , only revolver aficionados and collectors bother with ( . 45ACP and 9 mm Parabellum ) rimless revolvers .
While they may sometimes be fired without the specialized moon clips , generally the ejector rod will not eject the free - floating fired cases .
But Charter Arms has come up with an affordable revolver that chambers rimless semi-auto rounds in the same manner as a standard rimmed - cartridge revolver .
They will first offer the .40 S&W chambering ( see availability below ) followed by the .45ACP and 9×19 mm Parabellum ( the 9 mm Parabellum revolver will also chamber factory .380ACP ) .
All three of Charter Arms ’ Rimless Revolvers ( 9 mm , .40 and .45 ) are rated for higher velocity + P loadings .
Now the average gun owner can own an affordable , trouble - free revolver chambered in these popular semi-auto rounds without the need for specialized ammunition clips and a specialized gun .
If more power is needed , step up to +P ammo .
The advantage with Charter Arms Rimless Revolvers is they will fire any mix of cartridges while maintaining 100 % reliability .
For plinking with .45ACP or 9 mm surplus and discounted military type ammo , the affordable Charter Arms Rimless Revolver will prove to be very economical and it ’s also a .380 revolver .
The secret is the patent - pending Charter Arms Rimless Revolver Round System .
Basically , when a round is loaded into the chamber a specialized spring engages the cartridge ’s ejector groove .
When the cylinder is opened and the ejector rod operated , it extracts and ejects the fired cases .
Availability : First quarter of 2009 the .40 will be available , about 90 - 120 days later the .45ACP and 90 - 120 days after the .45ACP will come the 9 mm .
Please see above models for more information .
MSRP Prices : 9 mm $ 399.00 , .40 $ 449.00 , .45ACP $ 449.00

( Recasts , adds details from latest data )
NEW YORK , June 11 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet shrank in the latest week as banks borrowed less from the central bank , suggesting less stress on the financial system , Fed data released on Thursday showed .
Its book of assets and liabilities , while more twice the size than a year ago due its unprecedented bailout of the banking sector , contracted to the smallest level in three months .
The Fed ’s balance sheet -- a broad gauge of its lending to the financial system -- shrank to $ 2.036 trillion on Wednesday from $ 2.062 trillion on June 3 .
It peaked at $ 2.179 trillion on April 22 .
Much of the week ’s decline came from less longer - term borrowing from banks , the latest Fed data showed .
Their daily borrowing at the Fed ’s Term Auction Facility eased to $ 336.57 billion a day in the week ended June 10 , down from a daily rate of $ 372.54 billion in the prior week .
Banks ’ overnight borrowing at the Fed ’s discount window fell too .
Those direct loans averaged $ 119.61 billion per day in the week ended June 10 , down from $ 126.05 billion per day in the previous week .
Some other Fed financings also declined on the week , signaling the availability of credit in the open market rather than a reliance on the Fed as a lender of last resort .
For example , the U.S. central bank ’s Commercial Paper Funding Facility , which funds top - notch short - term corporate debt , totaled $ 138.44 billion on Wednesday , down from $ 142.64 billion a week earlier .
The Fed 's credit extended to troubled insurer AIG AIG.N was valued at $ 43.13 billion on Wednesday , little changed from last week .
Its holdings of agency mortgage - backed securities were $ 427.42 billion on Wednesday versus 427.63 billion last week .
Earlier Thursday , the Fed reported a net purchase of $ 23.02 billion in mortgage bonds guaranteed by housing agencies Fannie Mae FNM .
PFNM.N , Freddie Mac FRE.NFRE.P and the Government National Mortgage Association , or Ginnie Mae .
The Fed ’s Term Asset - Backed Securities Loan Facility , or TALF , grew to $ 25.24 billion from $ 15.38 billion a week ago .
Earlier this year , the government introduced TALF with the goal to jump - start the securitization market , which has remained dormant since the collapse of Lehman Brothers last fall .
In the heyday of securitization , Wall Street packaged hundreds of billions of dollars worth of consumer , mortgage and business loans and sold them to investors as securities .
Some analysts have blamed the huge sums of money raised from the bundling of high - risk loans for the credit crisis .

It looks like the realists are growing weary .
The venerable Landrum Bolling has produced a new video , New Hope for Peace : What America Must Do To End The Israel - Palestine Conflict , that looks aimed directly at the Obama White House .
In it Bolling interviews Jimmy Carter , James Baker , Brent Scowcroft and Zbigniew Brzezinski , all of whom offer their advice for the current Obama efforts .
There seems to be tinge of concern that the administration is n’t willing to do what needs to be done .
Scrowcroft says we have to change the way we have been doing things , while Brzezinski says frustration is widespread .
Jimmy Carter takes the cake with the quote that became the title of this post .
The message is clear – the US needs to speak clearly about Israel and apply pressure to change conditions on the ground .
All speakers agree that things will not move forward without US leadership .
Most specifically they point towards opening dialog with Hamas in the belief that everyone has to be at the table .
Does this video represent a sign of despiration that Obama is getting weak in the knees ?
Not sure , but I ’d feel better if one of these old hands were whispering in Obama ’s ear on the subject and not Dennis Ross .
The Secret of World - Class Performance
“ If a man loves the labour of his trade , apart from any question of success or fame , the gods have called him . "
Robert Louis Stevenson
I have n’t gone for a run since high school .
My family moved to New London ( a one - stoplight town in northern Ohio ) just before I started 7th grade .
To meet some friends , my mom suggested that I join the cross country team .
For such a small town , the New London High School cross country team was very good - the year before I moved , the high school boys team won the state championships .
The coach , Bob Knoll , was one of the most respected high school coaches in the state .
Before joining the cross country team , my previous running experience was limited to playing recreational soccer .
I was a dorky little kid ( 4 ’ 10 “ ) with thick glasses , and as my first cross country practices started , I did my best to stomp my way down the pavement and try not to vomit all over my clunky , non - broken - in running shoes .
I was miserable .
My Short Long Distance Running Career
Bob Knoll is a man who , in private , has a heart of gold .
Some of my best memories from cross country are when I had to miss a practice in the morning , and my mom would drop me off at his house in the evening for a make - up workout .
He ’d pedal beside me on his bike , and we ’d chat as we wove our way through the Ohio countryside .
During normal practices , however , Bob Knoll was merciless .
He was ultra-competitive , tough as nails , and did his best to foster a competitive attitude among the team .
I knew he liked me as a person , but it was clear he did n’t think highly of me as a competitor .
Truthfully , I was n’t competing at all - I did n’t care .
I did n’t care if people were faster than me .
I did n’t care if someone else won the race .
I did n’t care if I had to stop to catch my breath instead of running the whole way .
Running was always hard work for me - something that must be endured until it was over .
I stayed on the cross country team until 9th grade .
During my last year on the team , I wanted to get better , so I started pushing myself .
I still hated it , but I thought that if I could tough it out , I ’d improve .
My body rebelled against me .
I developed exercise - induced asthma - after running for 10 minutes , my lungs would start to close .
I injured the bones in my left foot , and was out for two weeks .
When I tried to get back into shape after my foot recovered , I pushed myself so hard that I passed out on the side of the road , and was eventually found unconscious by one of the members of the girls team , who was running a different route .
I quit .
Hurdles Can’t Stop Me
Track & Field was much better - I ran hurdles , which appealed to me .
I was just crazy enough to think that sprinting full - speed toward a waist - high barrier was fun .
I was n’t spectacular , but I won my fair share of races .
It was challenging and a little quirky , so I kept doing it , and I got better a little each day .
The day of my senior conference track meet was the last day I laced up my running shoes .
I have n’t run for nine years … until this past Saturday .
Born to Run
To change things up a bit , I ’ve been listening to the audio version of Born to Run , a book about ultra-marathoners .
Most of the book focuses on a tribe of native Mexicans called the Tarahumara , who are arguably the world ’s best long - distance runners .
The author , Christopher McDougall , spent years trying to figure out how he could run without constantly hurting himself .
His search led him into the middle of Copper Canyon , the remote and treacherous wilderness the Tarahumara call home .
The Tarahumara do n’t train for peak performance .
They do n’t wear high - tech running shoes .
They do n’t optimize their diet - more often than not , they smoke and pound corn beer minutes before the " race " begins .
They are n’t “ in it to win it " - there ’s a bit of friendly competitiveness , but hard - core competition is unheard of .
The Tarahumara simply start running , and by the time they stop , several hours ( or days ) have passed and they ’re tens ( or hundreds ) of miles from where they started .
It ’s not uncommon for them to run the equivalent of several marathons back - to - back , take a break , then go for another run .
The Tarahumara do n’t do a lot of things , but what they do is essential : they just relax and enjoy the feel of moving .
You ’ve Got to Enjoy It
Coach Joe Vigil has been studying peak performance in distance runners for decades , and has trained several Olympians .
Over the years , he ’s come to the conclusion that optimizing biomechanics can only do so much .
To become world - class , you ’ve got to enjoy it .
One of the things that struck me while reading Born to Run was the section in which Coach Vigil talks about the influence of sponsorship money on distance running .
Long distance running started as something a few crazy people did just for fun .
As the sport gained attention , sponsorship dollars starting flowing , with a surprising result : performance suffered .
For many people , running stopped being fun and started being work .
One of the first things Vigil does is encourage his runners to make running fun again .
Here ’s his perspective on how sponsorship deals stack up against enjoying yourself :
“ There are two goddesses in your heart : the Goddess of Wisdom and the Goddess of Wealth .
Everyone thinks that they need to get wealth first , and wisdom will come .
So they concern themselves with chasing money .
But they have it backwards .
You have to give your heart to the Goddess of Wisdom , give her all your love and attention , and the Goddess of Wealth will become jealous , and follow you . "
Wise words from a wise man .
“ I Think I ’ll Go For a Run … "
This past Saturday , I ran a little over three miles - my first distance run in nine years .
My only intent was to have fun - and I did !
I ran mostly barefoot ( I wore a pair of fun and funky Vibram FiveFingers ) , so I could actually feel the ground underneath my feet .
It was a beautiful day - clear and warm , with a slight breeze - and I wove my way through Central Park , sprinted across the Great Lawn , and ran around the Jacquline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir .
I ran at whatever pace I felt like ; when I started breathing too hard or felt a cramp coming on , I stopped and walked .
There was no competition , no times to beat , nothing to accomplish , and nothing to prove .
It was great .
Running was fun again .
I never thought I ’d say it , but I ’m actually looking forward to my next run .
What Does This Have To Do With Business ?
Just like distance running , the world of business is often characterized as being ultra-competitive by nature .
Here ’s an interesting question to consider : does it have to be ?
Could it be true that uber - competitiveness is a detriment instead of an asset ?
Elite performers in every area of life have one thing in common : they really enjoy what they ’re doing .
Not in the narrow sense of liking to win , but actually enjoying the act of doing the thing they ’re good at doing .
Tiger Woods enjoys hitting golf balls , and his control is legendary .
Warren Buffett enjoys researching companies to invest in , and he finds them .
Lance Armstrong enjoys pedaling his bike up hills , and he ’s unbeatable on an incline .
Steve Jobs enjoys building cool new computers , and he produces masterpieces .
Audra McDonald loves performing in front of an audience , and she wows the crowds .
Yo Yo Ma loves playing the cello , and his skills are world - renowned .
These superstars do n’t “ have to " do these things - they want to and they like to , so they do - and do it well .
Think of all of the things you “ have to " do right now .
What would it look like if you took away the pressure and performance anxiety and maximized the fun ?
May you never work another day of your life .

The latest mayhem started at the end of March , when 21 - year - old Sean Murphy , a popular former high school hockey player , drove into a withering blast of gunfire near Bateman Park .
He was probably dead before his car coasted to a stop in the weeds .
That same night , Ryan Richards , 19 , abruptly left a friend ’s house after getting a cellphone call .
His body was found the next morning behind a rural produce store .
The stab wounds on his hands told the tale of a furious fight for his life .
The undertaker apologized to his family for not being able to conceal them .
The bodies of two local high school seniors , Dilsher Gill , 17 , and Joseph Randay , 18 , were found May 1 in their car on a remote road just outside this normally quiet town of 134,000 near Vancouver .
The boys had been seen driving away with an armed man the night before .
This crisp region of polished high - rises , emerald spruce , azure waterways and feel - good vibes finds itself in the midst of a gang war that has killed at least 18 young people this year .
Drug dealers are gunning down women ( one in a car with her 4 - year - old son in the back seat ) , high school students with no gang allegiances and , especially , one another , in broad daylight in and around the city that will host the 2010 Winter Olympics .
It got so bad this spring that police erected concrete barriers outside the homes of two gangsters to slow down potential drive - by assassins .
“ Let ’s get serious .
There is a gang war , and it ’s brutal .
What we have seen are new rules of engagement for the gangsters , ” Vancouver ’s chief police constable , Jim Chu , told reporters in March .
Authorities trace the violence to the recent government crackdown on cocaine traffickers in Mexico , which has squeezed profit margins for cocaine north of the U.S. border .
Canada ’s outlaw retailers are fighting to the death over market share , police say , a situation exacerbated by personal vendettas and power vacuums left by the arrests of gang leaders .
“ The war in Mexico directly impacts on the drug trade in Canada . . . .
There ’s a complete disruption of the flow of cocaine into Canada , and we are seeing the result , ” said Pat Fogarty , operations officer for the Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit , British Columbia ’s main law enforcement agency targeting organized crime .
The province became an important player in the Mexican cocaine marketplace in part by bartering its powerful home - grown marijuana , “ B.C. Bud , ” which helps fuel what is estimated to be a $ 6.3 - billion - a - year industry .
Canadian drug organizations now use planes , helicopters and , in one case , a tunnel to move drugs .
They have equipped trucks with secret panels and devices to avoid detection by X - rays and drug - sniffing dogs .
The Lower Mainland has become a playground for young up - and - coming gangsters , who speed around town in armor- plated Cadillac Escalades , Porsche SUVs and BMW sedans .
The worst violence can be traced to the verdant Fraser Valley southeast of Vancouver , where the Red Scorpions gang has been at war with a multi-ethnic criminal organization called the United Nations .
The founder of the U.N. is Clayton Roueche , 33 , son of a scrap metal dealer from Chilliwack , population 80,000 .
Authorities believe Roueche was going to attend a wedding and meet trafficking associates in Mexico in May 2008 when authorities there turned him away .
He was flown to Dallas , where U.S. agents arrested him on a drug indictment out of Seattle .
He pleaded guilty in April to conspiracy and money - laundering charges and faces as many as 30 years in prison .
Two months later , the man he allegedly was going to meet in Mexico was shot to death in a Guadalajara restaurant , along with another U.N. associate .
The U.N. adopted its name in honor of the variety of nationalities it encompasses , including Iraqis , Chinese and Guatemalans .
It is known for its Asian mystic - themed motto of “ Honor - Loyalty - Respect , ” created by Roueche , who has a passion for martial arts and Buddhism .
The cemetery in Chilliwack is dominated by the graves of two former U.N. members , flanked by a pair of 5 - foot - tall granite monuments inscribed with the same “ U.N. ” monogram found on the gang ’s packets of cocaine .
The phrase “ Warrior of the United Nations ” is engraved in Chinese characters .
At the foot of the graves , a pair of stone Chinese foo lions stands guard .
The carnage between the U.N. and the Red Scorpions is believed to stem from the fatal shootings of six men in an apartment in the comfortable suburb of Surrey in 2007 .
Five associates of the Red Scorpions have been arrested in the case .
One pleaded guilty and was sentenced in April to life in prison .
Dozens of other slayings followed , many of them retribution killings and commercial disputes between the U.N. and three Abbotsford men associated with the Red Scorpions : the Bacon brothers .
Jonathan Bacon , 28 , and his brothers , Jarrod , 26 , and Jamie , 23 , are the rock stars of the Fraser Valley underworld , their exploits and the efforts of the police to keep them alive documented regularly in the media .
Jamie Bacon , who was charged in April in one of the Surrey Six slayings , survived a mid-afternoon shooting at an Abbotsford intersection Jan. 20 , when a gunman fired as many as eight bullets into his Mercedes .
Jonathan Bacon was shot and wounded in the driveway of his parents ’ home in Abbotsford in 2006 .
Not surprisingly , the Bacons have changed residences several times , and their car has armored plating and bulletproof windows .
They kept an arsenal for protection :
As part of a plea bargain for an associate in 2007 , Jonathan Bacon delivered to police 114 sticks of dynamite , a grenade , seven handguns , two shotguns , a rifle and an Uzi submachine gun .
With so many people apparently eager to kill a Bacon brother , police took the unusual step this year of warning citizens to avoid the family or risk being caught in the crossfire .
That is what happened to Jonathan Barber , 24 , who ran a custom stereo business in Abbotsford .
One night in May , Barber picked up a Porsche Cayenne SUV belonging to one of the Bacon brothers to install a new audio system .
A gunman opened fire , killing Barber and injuring his 17 - year - old girlfriend .
“ Young people in the past used to have a fight in the schoolyard .
In a park or something .
But now everyone seems to have a gun , ” Barber ’s father , Michael , said one recent afternoon .
“ There used to be a code in gangs : Do n’t touch the women , do n’t touch the children .
But no one is safe anymore .
No one is safe in our city . ”
Mathea Angelica Sturm , a 17 - year - old student at W.J. Mouat Secondary School , started a Facebook page recently to memorialize the young people who have died in Abbotsford and Chilliwack .
The names quickly numbered in the dozens .
Among them were Dilsher Gill and Joseph Randay , the two teenagers found dead in their car in May .
Both were seniors at Mouat .
“ You see it in movies and stuff , but you never think it ’s going to happen in your town , ” Sturm said .
“ Especially in Abbotsford .
It was a pretty peaceful town , and then all of a sudden , it was like a big swoop of something came in . ”
Her mother , Wendy , said : “ It kills me that every week my child comes home in agony , in tears , that she lost another friend .
And to have the three most notorious gangsters [ the Bacon brothers ] living in our own town ?
My other daughter is terrified to go to her own high school reunion because she went to school with one of them . ”
Police , the mayor and the school board chairman recently issued a letter warning parents and students that even the slightest involvement in drugs or gangs can be dangerous .
Neither Gill nor Randay was a known gang member , friends say .
Ryan Richards , the 19 - year - old whose body was found behind the produce shop , got involved with the Red Scorpions only because he could n’t get financial aid for college , according to his mother , Wendy , who was hospitalized after her son ’s death and still breaks down in sobs .
“ He said he wanted out , ” she said .
“ He told another kid , ‘ Do n’t do it .
It ’s not a very good life .
I ’m getting out of it , ’ ” Wendy Richards said one recent afternoon , sitting on the front porch and hugging her knees .
Richards said she believes her son was a low - level salesman who may have come under suspicion within the Scorpions .
He had been taken into custody a few weeks before his death , and his cellphones were confiscated .
“ They might have thought that he ratted them out , ” said her boyfriend , Ken Peters .
“ So they sent somebody out .
Somebody who has no remorse . ”
On a Friday night in the Lower Mainland , two teams from the integrated gang task force patrol the restaurants , clubs and bars where gang members drink , spar and sometimes kill .
With the Winter Olympics only a year away , officials in British Columbia have made it clear that the gang problem must end .
Money has poured in for new officers .
Legislation is being proposed to expand surveillance capability , toughen sentences , crack down on firearms smuggled in from the U.S. , and outlaw armored cars and flak jackets .
There have been successes :
In May , police arrested eight senior U.N. members , including the new reported leader , Iraqi immigrant Barzan Tilli- Choli , 27 , on charges of conspiracy to kill the Bacons .
A month earlier , Vancouver police announced a series of arrests that they said had “ functionally dismantled ” the notorious Sanghera crime group , whose conflict with other gangs in southeast Vancouver had led to nearly 100 shootings in the last few years .
“ We targeted them for whatever kind of offenses we could get them for , from minor charges like causing a disturbance to attempted murder .
We ended up incarcerating literally the whole group , and the result of that has been a decrease in shootings , ” said Mike Porteous , who led Project Rebellion , the gang sweep that netted the Sanghera group .
“ I call it death by a thousand cuts , ” said Cpl. A.C.J. Coons , head of the four - vehicle gang patrol on the Friday night shift .
Coons and his partner , Constable Michael Clark , execute sharp U - turns when they see a suspicious Escalade or BMW and start checking IDs .
They prowl the bars , scrutinizing driver ’s licenses and ordering known gang members to leave under laws similar to U.S. gang injunctions .
The bouncer at the Canvas Lounge in central Vancouver ’s Gastown district reports that one of the Skeena Boys ( named for the apartment project in east Vancouver where the gang originated ) challenged him when he would n’t let him in .
The man grabbed his hip , as if signaling he would have a gun when he returned , the bouncer said .
Coons and Clark head off on foot to corner the young man , who is wearing rhinestone earrings and a T - shirt with a jeweled tiger .
He and two companions smirk and stare at the sidewalk ; they insist they were simply looking for someplace else to drink .
“ In some ways , we ’ve lost this generation of gangsters , they ’re so immersed in the gang world , ” said Sgt. Keiron McConnell , standing nearby in the red- and - blue glare of the police lights .
“ About the only thing we can do is incarcerate them . ”

Puralotor filters are OK , I guess .
I ’ll defer to our Best and Brightest on that score .
The company ’s claims do n’t seem particularly boastful —
“ Purolator filtration products provide high quality performance for everyday driving ” — or , let ’s face it , exciting .
And so the company ’s ad agency has convinced their client to take a walk on the weird side .
“ Keep it Pure ” is a series of vignettes that thinks outside the bun — although it ’s less Dada then da - da - da - da .
Anyway , when the ad folks offered us otherwise restricted access to some of these , uh , pronouncements , I said “ damn , did I forget to put that up ? ”
Actually , before that , I said , “ This campaign was born for our Whiskey Tango Foxtrot ” category .
Or vice versa .
While we await our TTAC - exclusive ’round three “ Keep it Pure ” moment , here ’s one from Purolator ’s YouTube channel .
I bet you ca n’t wait for the next installment .
In a strange sort of way , neither can I . Despite Mel ’s antagonism , despite Detroit ’s nationalization , do n’t you just love corporate America ?

A chat with Pamela Adlon , Pamela Adlon interview , Californication , King of the Hill
TV Home / Entertainment Channel / Bullz - Eye Home
As an actress , Pamela Adlon has been treading the boards since the early ‘ 80s , doing time on “ The Facts of Life ” and “ Wiseguy ” and securing small roles in films like “ Grease 2 , ” “ Say Anything , ” and “ Sgt. Bilko , ” but it ’s arguable that her most famous work has occurred in the recording studio .
As a voiceover actress , she ’s contributed to several Disney series ( “ 101 Dalmatians , ” “ Recess , ” “ Pepper Ann ” ) and a few for PBS , too ( “ WordGirl , ” “ Jakers ! ” ) , but her longest running gig – playing Bobby Hill on Fox ’s “ King of the Hill ” – will be coming to close on September 13 , when the one - hour series finale airs .
Fortunately , Adlon will still be able to keep busy with the new season of “ Californication , ” which returns to Showtime on September 27th , and Bullz - Eye talked to her briefly about what we can expect from Marcy Runkle this time around .
Unfortunately , the key word is “ briefly , ” since most of Season 3 is still being kept under wraps , so the majority of our conversation was about the significant developments in Marcy ’s character during Season 2 … which , not coincidentally , was released on DVD this week .
But do n’t worry , we also found time to ask a bit about her favorite Bobby Hill moments as well as her experiences on the short - lived but fondly - remembered HBO sitcom , “ Lucky Louie . ”
Bullz - Eye :
It ’s a pleasure to talk to you .
I ’m a fan of both “ Californication ” and “ King of the Hill . ”
Pamela Adlon : Awesome !
BE : And “ Lucky Louie , ” too , for that matter .
PA : Thank you !
Me , too .
I miss it .
( Laughs )
BE : I can imagine .
In fact , that was one of the first things that one of my Facebook friends posted when I mentioned that I was going to be talking to you : “ Ask her about ‘ Lucky Louie ’ ! ”
PA : I know .
( Sadly ) I know .
It was so good .
BE : So Marcy had quite a year on “ Californication ” this season .
PA : Oh , yes , sir , she did .
( Laughs )
BE : When did they approach you about the cocaine - addiction storyline ?
How far in advance did you know that was going to be happening ?
" I had E - mailed Tom Kapinos before we started production for the second season , and I was , like , ' Come on , give me a little taste !
Let me know what ’s going on !'
And he said , “ I do n’t know if you ’re aware of this , but Marcy had a bit of a drug problem back in the ‘ 80s .
And she gets into that again . '
And I went , ' Oh … .!'
I wrote him back and said , ' Yes !
Marcy had a thirsty little nose ! ' "
PA : Actually , I guess I had E- mailed Tom Kapinos before we started production for the second season , and I was , like , “ Come on , give me a little taste !
Let me know what ’s going on ! ”
And he said , “ I do n’t know if you ’re aware of this , but Marcy had kind of …well , she had a bit of a drug problem back in the ‘ 80s .
And she gets into that again . ”
And I went , “ Oh … . ! ” I wrote him back and said , “ Yes !
Marcy had a thirsty little nose ! ” ( Laughs )
And we just kept E-mailing .
So I knew that it was coming up , but I did n’t know that I would end up ingesting copious amounts of this big vat of white powder that the prop girl would bring me …without having it analyzed or anything !
BE : Given the relationship between Charlie and Marcy during Season 1 , I guess it was n’t the biggest surprise in the world that there would ’ve been divorce proceedings by the end of Season 2 , but were you surprised by it ?
Did you think that they might have a bond that would continue to survive , given that it had survived so much already ?
PA : No , I actually …every single week , I would be be , like , “ What ’s going to happen ? ”
And you always think , as an actor , “ Well , there ’s got to be something that keeps me in this world , so I can come back and do this show . ”
So I guess they leave it hanging , so you never know what ’s going to be .
But I was n’t surprised by it .
I actually liked the way it ended .
BE : How quickly did you and Evan Handler develop your relationship onscreen ?
Did it come together pretty easily ?
PA : Yeah .
Y’know , it ’s just one of those things : when it ’s on the page , it ’s on the stage .
And Tom Kapinos just makes that so easy .
BE : The character of Daisy was an interesting addition to the cast in Season 2 .
PA : Oh , yeah .
( Laughs )
BE : Did you get any feel for how her storyline was going to play out when her character was first introduced ?
Was there any forewarning that she was going to stick around for more than just a single episode ?
PA : Not at all .
I never knew that I was going to become as big a part of this show as I have , either !
I just was offered a role in the pilot , and I never thought I ’d be in any more .
Tom Kapinos just kept writing for me , and it became , like , the biggest present ever .
But Carla Gallo , who plays
Daisy , I guess we knew that she was gonna be in a couple , but then she ended up doing that whole storyline , and she ’s fabulous .
I just think she did such a good job .
And I love it .
I loved how it played out , and how we ended up shooting the porno in my house , and I ended up financing it !
It was really funny .
Well , I found it funny …and , usually , when you ’re acting in your own stuff , you kind of look around and go , “ Can somebody give me the Kool - Aid ?
‘ Cause I do n’t get it . ”
But this is something where I drank the Kool - Aid , and I think it ’s just amazing stuff .
BE : That actually ties into something I was going to ask .
Where do your comedic sensibilities lie ?
Because this is definitely a darkly funny show .
Does your sense of humor generally tend to veer toward the black ?
PA : I would say .
I would definitely say .
I like finding flowers growing up out of poop .
It ’s my favorite thing .
BE : ( Laughs ) Continuing about the Daisy storyline , I thought the whole thing with her former manager showing up for reparations , and the realization of just how much cocaine Marcy had purchased over the course of time , was pretty awesome .
PA : Yeah , exactly .
It ’s just unbelievable .
And I ’ve known people who ’ve done that !
I had a friend when I was growing up whose mom gambled away all of their money , and those kind of addictions … it ’s a really insane thing that I guess a lot of people do n’t know about .
But it ’s just around you all the time .
You can blow all your money on something really stupid .
BE : I ’m presuming that , at least at some point during your career in Hollywood , you ’ve endured some experiences resembling those on the show .
I mean , as far as drugs and the people around you .
PA : Absolutely .
BE : So is there at least some semblance of reality to “ Californication ” ?
" I never knew that I was going to become as big a part of ( ' Californication ' ) as I have .
I just was offered a role in the pilot , and I never thought I ’d be in any more .
Tom Kapinos just kept writing for me , and it became , like , the biggest present ever . "
PA : Um … I think it ’s , like , a heightened reality .
A heightened L.A. Like , people are just kind of giving in to things , throwing morals out the window to a big extent , exploring as much as you possibly can .
And when you read the scripts , you ’re , like , “ I do n’t think they ’re gonna go there , ” but then you get the next script , and you go , “ Okayyyyyyy , they went past there .
It ’s a little crazy now ! ” ( Laughs )
BE : With the detox portion of your storyline …well , you did n’t really get to play that part of Marcy ’s story .
PA : No , I do n’t think they really showed too much of that .
It just goes from , like , total debauchery to rehab .
And then it ’s …said .
I mean , I talk about what I did to get where I was .
But you never know when she ’s gonna fall off the wagon or anything .
BE : Were you at all concerned about the possibility of having to play that aspect ?
PA : Uh , yes .
( Laughs )
You always white - knuckle it before you get the scripts , but then …actually , there were a couple of situations this year where I had to call my producer and say , “ Um , how is this gonna be shot ? ”
And he would say , “ Do n’t worry about it .
We ’ll take care of it with that in mind . ”
BE : What ’s been the most disconcerting scene for you to have to film ?
PA : Oh , God .
There have been so many !
I guess in the first season , when we had the threesome with the nipple clamps , I was , like , “ I do n’t get this , I do n’t know how you ’re gonna do it . ”
And then , all of a sudden , there ’s a crane with a camera hanging over our heads , and you ’re , like , “ Okayyyyyyy .
But how are you gonna sell this ?
How are you gonna make it work ? ”
And they end up shooting it brilliantly , cutting it together , and it just all ends up working without me having to compromise my own personal morals .
( Laughs )
BE : “ Californication ” definitely seems like a show which requires a lot of trust in its creators .
PA : Absolutely .
BE : Given that you ’re a fan of the show yourself , do you have any regrets about any plot developments this season ?
I know a lot of people have complained about the fact that Lew , who was a very interesting character , was killed off .
PA : Yeah , and it was so amazing to watch that play out , because it really … for me , I loved it .
I loved that whole storyline .
But at the beginning , I was , like , “ This is …why is he kind of like the Hank Moody character ? ”
It was a little bit crazy .
( Hesitates )
Can you hold on for just a second ?
BE : Sure .
PA : ( Vanishes for a few moments , then returns ) Okay .
I ’m running in and out .
I ’ve locked myself in a closet so that I can talk to you … ( Laughs ) … because my kids are out here !
So , yeah , the Lew Ashby character just became a prolific , enduring beacon , and it was just … I loved that storyline .
I mean , we shot it in a house that I had been driving past for the past twenty years .
I could n’t even believe this house .
It was in Laurel Canyon , and it was just unbelievably epic to be there and to be a part of it .
So , yeah , that was the choice they made , and it ’s hard , but nowadays there ’s a lot more license .
You do n’t have to hang on to people to have them endure and survive in your show .
BE : Was that a development , though , that left you going , “ Aw , that ’s a shame ” ?
Or if not , were there any developments that made you react that way ?
PA : No , I just take it as it comes .
I always expect it to be me !
( Laughs )
So I ’m just grateful that it was n’t !
BE : Okay , I have to ask you a little bit about “ King of the Hill , ” because I ’m extremely depressed that it ’s going off the air .
PA : Oh , I know !
BE : I was actually there for the table read that you guys did during the TCA tour , when you guys read the script for the 250th episode before an audience .
PA : ( Excitedly )
Oh , you were there ?
BE : I was .
And it was awesome .
" For years , Fox moved ( ' King of the Hill ' ) around .
We were n’t even prime time .
They would say , ' Prime time starts at 8 PM , ' and we ’d be on at 7:30 .
And they pushed us around so much that we were canceled four times before this .
But we kept growing back up from the pavement , like a flower .
It ’s just a testament to the show itself and its writing that it ’s survived this long . "
PA : Oh , my God , for us , that was just the most incredible experience , being able to do that live .
We ’d been wanting to do that for years .
For years .
And a lot of the animators brought their kids , and …it just felt so good , to be able to share that with everybody .
BE : I even had a piece of the show ’s birthday cake .
PA : Oh , awesome .
* I* did n’t !
BE : So have you guys more or less been waiting for the other shoe to drop for some time now ?
Because the show has felt like the red - headed stepchild of the Fox animated line - up just by virtue of the fact that it was n’t “ The Simpsons ” or created by Seth MacFarlane .
PA : Oh , yeah .
And it ’s always been that way .
For years ,
Fox moved us around .
We were n’t even prime time .
They would say , “ Prime time starts at 8 PM , ” and we ’d be on at 7:30 .
And they pushed us around so much that we were canceled four times before this .
But we kept growing back up from the pavement , like a flower .
It ’s just a testament to the show itself and its writing that it ’s survived this long .
BE : Do you have any particular Bobby - centric episodes or plotlines that stick with you ?
PA : Oh , sure .
I love the one where they choose him as the new Dalai Lama .
And the one when he falls in love with the mannequin head .
And the Husky Bobby episode .
And where Bobby goes nuts .
There are so many .
I love the one where Hank and Peggy are trying to quit smoking .
BE : I will tell you that our personal favorite episode here at Bullz - Eye is probably when Bobby is put on Ritalin .
Specifically , when he says , “ There 's some milk in the fridge that 's about to go bad ... ”
PA : ( Bursts into laughter )
Oh , that ’s funny !
Oh , God , that ’s so funny .
I ’d forgotten that !
That ’s hilarious !
BE : “ … and there it goes . ” ( Laughs )
Anytime the words “ King of the Hill ” are mentioned to our music editor , David Medsker , that ’s the first line that comes out of his mouth .
PA : Hilarious .
I love that !
BE : I should also mention that I keep waiting in vain for more seasons of the show to come out on DVD , because they stopped dead in their tracks after Season 6 , and even then , the last few seasons were totally devoid of special features .
I guess
Fox was n’t putting up the dough to pay for them ?
PA : Oh , no .
I mean , one of our producers … the fact that any DVDs are out at all are amazing , because he ’s the one who ’s responsible , doing it all on his own .
BE : Wow .
So all things considered , if Fox did come to you and say , “ We ’d like to do a full - length ‘ King of the Hill ’ film , ” would you be in ?
PA : Oh , are you kidding ?
In a heartbeat .
All of us would .
BE : So let ’s get back to “ Lucky Louie . ”
It seemed like the show did n’t really get a chance to breathe , which is surprising , given that most cable shows are at least given a second season to find an audience .
PA : Absolutely .
I mean , it ’s generally just , like , either “ right place , right time ” or “ right place , wrong time , ” but in terms of “ Lucky Louie , ” the whole thing about it was that we were at least given a chance , but then the network kind of imploded after that , and now four people do the job that Chris Albrecht used to do .
It was just one of those things where …I mean , I kind of called it .
I knew that we would do something and it would kind of resonate for a long time after , but it was too good , almost .
Too raw and too great to survive .
Like a , uh , butterfly .
( Laughs )
BE : You ’ve done a lot of other voice acting besides “ King of the Hill . ”
For one thing , you were on “ The Oblongs , ” which I always thought was pretty underrated in its own right .
PA : Absolutely .
Great show .
BE : Do you have any other cartoon work that you ’ve done that you ’re particularly proud of but that we might not have seen ?
PA : Oh , yeah .
Well , for one thing , I ’m in these new “ Tinkerbell ” movies .
I do n’t know if you know about the one that came out last year on Disney …
BE : I do , because I have a 4 - year - old daughter .
PA : Okay !
Well , yeah , I love that .
And I have three daughters , too , so for me , being a part of that is awesome .
I ’m Vidia .
I ’m the one who ’s , like , Tinkerbell ’s nemesis .
I love being able to do stuff that my kids can watch .
I ’ve also been doing a lot of “ Phineas and Ferb , ” and all that kind of stuff that my kids can see .
So that ’s fun .
BE : I ’m also very pro-“ Jakers ! ”
PA : Yeah !
That ’s a good one .
( Adopts her character ’s voice ) “ I ’m Hector ! ” I think I ’m a badger .
( Laughs )
BE : Last one : what ’s your favorite project that you ’ve worked on that did n’t get the love you thought it deserved ?
PA : It would have to be “ Lucky Louie . ”
Hands down .
BE : Excellent .
Well , it ’s been a pleasure talking to you .
Have you got anything else in the works besides the third season of “ Californication ” ?
PA : No , that ’s about it !
I ’m just concentrating on my kids and on making other things happen .
BE : Anything you can tell us about the upcoming season that you wo n’t get shot for telling us ?
PA : I can tell you that Marcy is trading one addiction for another .
It ’s not drugs anymore .
It ’s exercise !
BE : So has that forced you to get into shape , then ?
: Yeah , but , y’know , I run around so much with three daughters , anyway , that I stay in shape just from doing my mom stuff !
Structural Shifts
The issue of a future in which there are large parts of the economy that are underemployed , unemployed , or unemployable is a serious issue .
And the data already suggests this :
( source ) Notice how after the last recession in 2001 the number shifted upwards .
The boom year of 2006 have an additional 5 % long - term unemployed than the boom years of 1998 .
If you go back even further in that graph , to the 1960s , you see an even larger structural shifts upwards .
Here 's University of Chicago Economist Kevin Murphy thinking through this issue .
It 's difficult to look at , for example , the very low unemployment rates we saw in the early 2000s and say that represented an economy in which everyone was working .
Unemployment rates were at roughly the same level that they were in the late 1960s , but if you look at prime - age males , the fraction actually working who were , say , 30 to 40 years old was quite a bit lower in 2001 because there was a big increase in the number who were out of the labor force in that age category ...
It was primarily low - skilled workers who had withdrawn from the labor market ... the opportunities in the labor market for low - skilled workers had deteriorated quite a bit with the rise in demand for skill and fall in demand for low - skilled workers ... What that meant was , from a pure labor market perspective , the unemployment rate really was n't indicative of what the economy was like .
Unemployment in an economic sense was n't as low as unemployment in a measured sense .
The blogosphere is taking note : Add Kevin Drum and Reihan Salam to people who are also concerned about the growing rate of the perpetually unemployed in our economy .
The unskilled are slowly disappearing from the labor force , and it is n't clear why or how this is happening .
Is it the result of the computerization of the economy , as Gregory Clark suggests ?
Is it the result of the criminalization of a large part of the poor through specific projections of state power , particularly the War on Drugs and Broken Windows ?
Is it a more general trend towards higher skills as well as forms of ( disability ) insurance as Kevin Murphy argues ?
What is actually going on here , and if it will get worse before it ( ever ) gets better , should be a focus of research for those looking at our labor markets .
Historical Markets
Maybe this will all just be fine .
The increased presences of computers and robots in creating automation and decreasing the need for labor will increase the need for new types of labor .
In particular , the labor necessary for the creation , maintenance , and deployment of said machines .
But this work is highly skilled , and there is good reason to believe that it will employ fewer people post machines than before .
Transformation of the skill level of that much labor is going to have large destabilizing effects .
The last time we had such a transition of the skilling of labor we'd have to look at the Industrial Revolution in Europe .
There we had a transformation from an artisan class into a deskilled , more productive class .
This , from an economists point - of - view ( but certainly not everyone 's ) , was a huge win for unskilled labor .
This new change in the skilling of labor is not what is happening now .
Now the economy is taking the labor of an unskilled class and replacing it with machines .
In order for someone to take advantage of the new employment opportunities opening up it will requires a peculiar new type of skilling - the ability to create and maintain the new efficiency machines .
It is n't clear what happens here .
We could assume that markets will hand - wave these problems away , that wages and incentives and laws will find everyone optimal work , or we can learn from History that these radical changes have massive changes in our lives and begin to prepare accordingly .
I 'm rooting that we go the second route .
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
A new study from Cars.com sheds light on the absurdity of thinking cars have a " nationality . "
When you consider that even a post - bailout GM will expand its use of foreign labor , it should n't be that hard to understand how an " American " car is n't really so , just because its maker was founded in Detroit .
And more generally , there seems to be little reason to think that American cars are really more American in any metrics that matter :
Namely , labor and parts inputs .
According to the new survey , the most American car in America is the Toyota Camry , containing the highest percentage of American inputs , even surpassing the Ford F - 150 .
Actually , Toyota utterly dominates the top 10 list , with a Honda thrown in for good measure .
Now some might object to this , saying that even though these cars are " made - in - America " , the value still flows overseas , but really , even that 's not right .
Toyota still pays taxes in America .
Its stock is traded in the US , and is no doubt owned by individual retail accounts and mutual funds .
If you insist on coming up with some definition of " American " that limits that moniker to the Big Three , we suppose it's this : Only Chrysler , Ford and GM have the political clout to win a bailout if needed .
We really can't imagine Toyota or Honda receiving so much political support .
Of course , this is a circular definition that still does n't say much , but it 's the best you can do .
For the penguin heads , attach one olive to the top of each egg with a toothpick .
For beaks , cut six carrots 1/2.in from the pointed end ; attach the flat side of a pointed piece to the center of each head with half a toothpick .
For the feet , make a lengthwise cut through the remaining carrots ; place flat side down in pairs ( trim carrots if necessary ) .
Place a toothpick in each carrot ; press an egg on top of each pair .

In his special comment tonight , MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann hammered Sarah Palin for her death panel statement .
He said , “ Madam , you are a clear and present danger to the safety and security of this nation , ” and suggested that she should not be allowed to hold any position of responsibility or trust at any level of government .
Here is the video :

Talking about Palin ’s claims of an evil Obama death panel , Olbermann said , “ There is no death panel .
There is no judgment based on societal productivity .
There is no worthiness test , but there is downright evil , and Ms. Palin you just served its cause .
You shouted fire in a crowded theater , a hot theater , and then today tried to roll it back with , no , no sorry , not fire , I meant flashlights , too little , too late , too obvious . ”
He continued , “ Madam , you are a clear and present danger to the safety and security of this nation .
Whether the death panel is something you dreamed , or something you dreamed up , whether it is the product of a low intellect and a fevered imagination , or the product of a high intelligence and a sober ability to exploit people , you should be ashamed of yourself for having introduced it into the public discourse , and it should debar you for all time from any position of responsibility or trust in the governance of this nation or any of its states or municipalities . ”
Olbermann kept on going , “ Ms. Palin you might as well have declared that the government is being run by a coven of witches with fake Kenyan birth certificates , and you might as well have told the vast unthinking throng that mistakes your ability to wink as leadership that they should start shooting at Democrats … ”
Olbermann called Palin out on exploiting her kids , “ And incidentally madam , you have also forfeited your right to be taken seriously the next you claim offense when somebody mentioning your children .
You have just exploited your youngest child , dangled him in front of a mindless mob , as surely as if you were Michael Jackson .
You have used this innocent infant as an excuse to pander to the worst and least of us in this nation .
You have used him to create the false image of death panels .
The only death panels Ms. Palin are the figurative ones you have inspired with such irresponsible , dangerous , facile , vile , hate speech , the death of common sense , the death of logic , the perhaps of democracy at the hands of mob rule . ”
The host also took on Glenn Beck and the congressional Republicans who are spreading lies , like Sen. John Cornyn ( R - TX ) .
He also took aim at the birthers and Lou Dobbs .
He also took the time to make it clear that healthcare reform is not going to euthanize grandma , and that there is no death panels .
It has come down to this , Republicans and healthcare reform opponents know that they can’t stop the bill , so they are trying to scare people away from it .
Sadly there are enough uninformed distrustful people out there that can be motivated by fear to make this tactic viable .
He tried to debunk all of the lies about healthcare , but the problem is that the liberal MSNBC host is preaching to the choir .
The viewers of his show already know the truth about the proposed healthcare reform .
It is those who would rather follow Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck who wo n’t take the time to think and learn the truth .
The hard core right wingers will never support this proposal , but it is important that their noise not be allowed to overwhelm the debate and influence the confused middle , because there is where the fate of true reform rests .
The Aleph
by Jorge Luis Borges
O God !
I could be bounded in a nutshell , and count myself a King of infinite space ...
Hamlet , II , 2 But they will teach us that Eternity is the Standing still of the Present Time , a Nunc - stans ( as the schools call it ) ; which neither they , nor any else understand , no more than they would a Hic- stans for an Infinite greatness of Place .
Leviathan , IV , 46
On the burning February morning Beatriz Viterbo died , after braving an agony that never for a single moment gave way to self - pity or fear , I noticed that the sidewalk billboards around Constitution Plaza were advertising some new brand or other of American cigarettes .
The fact pained me , for I realised that the wide and ceaseless universe was already slipping away from her and that this slight change was the first of an endless series .
The universe may change but not me , I thought with a certain sad vanity .
I knew that at times my fruitless devotion had annoyed her ; now that she was dead , I could devote myself to her memory , without hope but also without humiliation .
I recalled that the thirtieth of April was her birthday ; on that day to visit her house on Garay Street and pay my respects to her father and to Carlos Argentino Daneri , her first cousin , would be an irreproachable and perhaps unavoidable act of politeness .
Once again I would wait in the twilight of the small , cluttered drawing room , once again I would study the details of her many photographs : Beatriz Viterbo in profile and in full colour ; Beatriz wearing a mask , during the Carnival of 1921 ; Beatriz at her First Communion ; Beatriz on the day of her wedding to Roberto Alessandri ; Beatriz soon after her divorce , at a luncheon at the Turf Club ; Beatriz at a seaside resort in Quilmes with Delia San Marco Porcel and Carlos Argentino ; Beatriz with the Pekingese lapdog given her by Villegas Haedo ; Beatriz , front and three - quarter views , smiling , hand on her chin ...
I would not be forced , as in the past , to justify my presence with modest offerings of books -- books whose pages I finally learned to cut beforehand , so as not to find out , months later , that they lay around unopened .
Beatriz Viterbo died in 1929 .
From that time on , I never let a thirtieth of April go by without a visit to her house .
I used to make my appearance at seven - fifteen sharp and stay on for some twenty - five minutes .
Each year , I arrived a little later and stay a little longer .
In 1933 , a torrential downpour coming to my aid , they were obliged to ask me for dinner .
Naturally , I took advantage of that lucky precedent .
In 1934 , I arrived , just after eight , with one of those large Santa Fe sugared cakes , and quite matter - of - factly I stayed to dinner .
It was in this way , on these melancholy and vainly erotic anniversaries , that I came into the gradual confidences of Carlos Argentino Daneri .
Beatriz had been tall , frail , slightly stooped ; in her walk there was ( if the oxymoron may be allowed ) a kind of uncertain grace , a hint of expectancy .
Carlos Argentino was pink - faced , overweight , gray - haired , fine - featured .
He held a minor position in an unreadable library out on the edge of the Southside of Buenos Aires .
He was authoritarian but also unimpressive .
Until only recently , he took advantage of his nights and holidays to stay at home .
At a remove of two generations , the Italian " S " and demonstrative Italian gestures still survived in him .
His mental activity was continuous , deeply felt , far - ranging , and -- all in all -- meaningless .
He dealt in pointless analogies and in trivial scruples .
He had ( as did Beatriz ) large , beautiful , finely shaped hands .
For several months he seemed to be obsessed with Paul Fort -- less with his ballads than with the idea of a towering reputation .
" He is the Prince of poets , " Daneri would repeat fatuously .
" You will belittle him in vain -- but no , not even the most venomous of your shafts will graze him . "
On the thirtieth of April , 1941 , along with the sugared cake I allowed myself to add a bottle of Argentine cognac .
Carlos Argentino tasted it , pronounced it " interesting , " and , after a few drinks , launched into a glorification of modern man .
" I view him , " he said with a certain unaccountable excitement , " in his inner sanctum , as though in his castle tower , supplied with telephones , telegraphs , phonographs , wireless sets , motion - picture screens , slide projectors , glossaries , timetables , handbooks , bulletins ... "
He remarked that for a man so equipped , actual travel was superfluous .
Our twentieth century had inverted the story of Mohammed and the mountain ; nowadays , the mountain came to the modern Mohammed .
So foolish did his ideas seem to me , so pompous and so drawn out his exposition , that I linked them at once to literature and asked him why he did n't write them down .
As might be foreseen , he answered that he had already done so -- that these ideas , and others no less striking , had found their place in the Proem , or Augural Canto , or , more simply , the Prologue Canto of the poem on which he hd been working for many years now , alone , without publicity , with fanfare , supported only by those twin staffs universally known as work and solitude .
First , he said , he opened the floodgates of his fancy ; then , taking up hand tools , he resorted to the file .
The poem was entitled The Earth ; it consisted of a description of the planet , and , of course , lacked no amount of picturesque digressions and bold apostrophes .
I asked him to read me a passage , if only a short one .
He opened a drawer of his writing table , drew out a thick stack of papers -- sheets of a large pad imprinted with the letterhead of the Juan Crisóstomo Lafinur Library -- and , with ringing satisfaction , declaimed :
Mine eyes , as did the Greek's , have known men's
towns and fame ,
The works , the days in light that fades to amber ;
I do not change a fact or falsify a name --
The voyage I set down is ... autour de ma chambre .
" From any angle , a greatly interesting stanza , " he said , giving his verdict .
" The opening line wins the applause of the professor , the academician , and the Hellenist -- to say nothing of the would - be scholar , a considerable sector of the public .
The second flows from Homer to Hesiod ( generous homage , at the very outset , to the father of didactic poetry ) , not without rejuvenating a process whose roots go back to Scripture -- enumeration , congeries , conglomeration .
The third -- baroque ?
decadent ?
example of the cult of pure form ? -- consists of two equal hemistichs .
The fourth , frankly bilingual , assures me the unstinted backing of all minds sensitive to the pleasures of sheer fun .
I should , in all fairness , speak of the novel rhyme in lines two and four , and of the erudition that allows me -- without a hint of pedantry ! -- to cram into four lines three learned allusions covering thirty centuries packed with literature -- first to the Odyssey , second to Works and Days , and third to the immortal bagatelle bequathed us by the frolicking pen of the Savoyard , Xavier de Maistre .
Once more I 've come to realise that modern art demands the balm of laughter , the scherzo .
Decidedly , Goldoni holds the stage ! "
He read me many other stanzas , each of which also won his own approval and elicited his lengthy explications .
There was nothing remarkable about them .
I did not even find them any worse than the first one .
Application , resignation , and chance had gone into the writing ; I saw , however , that Daneri 's real work lay not in the poetry but in his invention of reasons why the poetry should be admired .
Of course , this second phase of his effort modified the writing in his eyes , though not in the eyes of others .
Daneri's style of delivery was extravagant , but the deadly drone of his metric regularity tended to tone down and to dull that extravagance .
[ Among my memories are also some lines of a satire in which he lashed out unsparingly at bad poets .
After accusing them of dressing their poems in the warlike armour of erudition , and of flapping in vain their unavailing wings , he concluded with this verse :
But they forget , alas , one foremost fact -- BEAUTY !
Only once in my life have I had occasion to look into the fifteen thousand alexandrines of the Polyolbion , that topographical epic in which Michael Drayton recorded the flora , fauna , hydrography , orography , military and monastic history of England .
I am sure , however , that this limited but bulky production is less boring than Carlos Argentino 's similar vast undertaking .
Daneri had in mind to set to verse the entire face of the planet , and , by 1941 , had already dispatched a number of acres of the State of Queensland , nearly a mile of the course run by the River Ob , a gasworks to the north of Veracruz , the leading shops in the Buenos Aires parish of Concepción , the villa of Mariana Cambaceres de Alvear in the Belgrano section of the Argentine capital , and a Turkish baths establishment not far from the well - known Brighton Aquarium .
He read me certain long - winded passages from his Australian section , and at one point praised a word of his own coining , the colour " celestewhite , " which he felt " actually suggests the sky , an element of utmost importance in the landscape of the Down Under . "
But these sprawling , lifeless hexameters lacked even the relative excitement of the so - called Augural Canto .
Along about midnight , I left .
Two Sundays later , Daneri rang me up -- perhaps for the first time in his life .
He suggested we get together at four o'clock " for cocktails in the salon - bar next door , which the forward - looking Zunino and Zungri -- my landlords , as you doubtless recall -- are throwing open to the public .
It 's a place you 'll really want to get to know . "
More in resignation than in pleasure , I accepted .
Once there , it was hard to find a table .
The " salon - bar , " ruthlessly modern , was only barely less ugly than what I had excepted ; at the nearby tables , the excited customers spoke breathlessly of the sums Zunino and Zungri had invested in furnishings without a second thought to cost .
Carlos Argentino pretended to be astonished by some feature or other of the lighting arrangement ( with which , I felt , he was already familiar ) , and he said to me with a certain severity , " Grudgingly , you 'll have to admit to the fact that these premises hold their own with many others far more in the public eye . "
He then reread me four or five different fragments of the poem .
He had revised them following his pet principle of verbal ostentation : where at first " blue " had been good enough , he now wallowed in " azures , " " ceruleans , " and " ultramarines . "
The word " milky " was too easy for him ; in the course of an impassioned description of a shed where wool was washed , he chose such words as " lacteal , " " lactescent , " and even made one up -- " lactinacious . "
After that , straight out , he condemned our modern mania for having books prefaced , " a practice already held up to scorn by the Prince of Wits in his own grafeful preface to the Quixote . "
He admitted , however , that for the opening of his new work an attention - getting foreword might prove valuable -- " an accolade signed by a literary hand of renown . "
He next went on to say that he considered publishing the initial cantos of his poem .
I then began to understand the unexpected telephone call ; Daneri was going to ask me to contribute a foreword to his pedantic hodgepodge .
My fear turned out unfounded ; Carlos Argentino remarked , with admiration and envy , that surely he could not be far wrong in qualifying with the ephitet " solid " the prestige enjoyed in every circle by Álvaro Melián Lafinur , a man of letters , who would , if I insisted on it , be only too glad to dash off some charming opening words to the poem .
In order to avoid ignominy and failure , he suggested I make myself spokesman for two of the book 's undeniable virtues -- formal perfection and scientific rigour -- " inasmuch as this wide garden of metaphors , of figures of speech , of elegances , is inhospitable to the least detail not strictly upholding of truth . "
He added that Beatriz had always been taken with Álvaro .
I agreed -- agreed profusely -- and explained for the sake of credibility that I would not speak to Álvaro the next day , Monday , but would wait until Thursday , when we got together for the informal dinner that follows every meeting of the Writers ' Club .
( No such dinners are ever held , but it is an established fact that the meetings do take place on Thursdays , a point which Carlos Argentino Daneri could verify in the daily papers , and which lent a certain reality to my promise . )
Half in prophecy , half in cunning , I said that before taking up the question of a preface I would outline the unusual plan of the work .
We then said goodbye .
Turning the corner of Bernardo de Irigoyen , I reviewed as impartially as possible the alternatives before me .
They were : a ) to speak to Álvaro , telling him the first cousin of Beatriz ' ( the explanatory euphemism would allow me to mention her name ) had concocted a poem that seemed to draw out into infinity the possibilities of cacophony and chaos : b ) not to say a word to Álvaro .
I clearly foresaw that my indolence would opt for b .
But first thing Friday morning , I began worrying about the telephone .
It offended me that that device , which had once produced the irrecoverable voice of Beatriz , could now sink so low as to become a mere receptacle for the futile and perhaps angry remonstrances of that deluded Carlos Argentino Daneri .
Luckily , nothing happened -- except the inevitable spite touched off in me by this man , who had asked me to fulfill a delicate mission for him and then had let me drop .
Gradually , the phone came to lose its terrors , but one day toward the end of October it rang , and Carlos Argentino was on the line .
He was deeply disturbed , so much so that at the outset I did not recognise his voice .
Sadly but angrily he stammered that the now unrestrainable Zunino and Zungri , under the pretext of enlarging their already outsized " salon - bar , " were about to take over and tear down this house .
" My home , my ancestral home , my old and inveterate Garay Street home ! " he kept repeating , seeming to forget his woe in the music of his words .
It was not hard for me to share his distress .
After the age of fifty , all change becomes a hateful symbol of the passing of time .
Besides , the scheme concerned a house that for me would always stand for Beatriz .
I tried explaining this delicate scruple of regret , but Daneri seemed not to hear me .
He said that if Zunino and Zungri persisted in this outrage , Doctor Zunni , his lawyer , would sue ipso facto and make them pay some fifty thousand dollars in damages .
Zunni's name impressed me ; his firm , although at the unlikely address of Caseros and Tacuarí , was nonetheless known as an old and reliable one .
I asked him whether Zunni had already been hired for the case .
Daneri said he would phone him that very afternoon .
He hesitated , then with that level , impersonal voice we reserve for confiding something intimate , he said that to finish the poem he could not get along without the house because down in the cellar there was an Aleph .
He explained that an Aleph is one of the points in space that contains all other points .
" It 's in the cellar under the dining room , " he went on , so overcome by his worries now that he forgot to be pompous .
" It 's mine -- mine .
I discovered it when I was a child , all by myself .
The cellar stairway is so steep that my aunt and uncle forbade my using it , but I 'd heard someone say there was a world down there .
I found out later they meant an old - fashioned globe of the world , but at the time I thought they were referring to the world itself .
One day when no one was home I started down in secret , but I stumbled and fell .
When I opened my eyes , I saw the Aleph . "
" The Aleph ? " I repeated .
" Yes , the only place on earth where all places are -- seen from every angle , each standing clear , without any confusion or blending .
I kept the discovery to myself and went back every chance I got .
As a child , I did not foresee that this privilege was granted me so that later I could write the poem .
Zunino and Zungri will not strip me of what 's mine -- no , and a thousand times no !
Legal code in hand , Doctor Zunni will prove that my Aleph is inalienable . "
I tried to reason with him .
" But is n't the cellar very dark ? " I said .
" Truth can not penetrate a closed mind .
If all places in the universe are in the Aleph , then all stars , all lamps , all sources of light are in it , too . "
" You wait there .
I 'll be right over to see it . "
I hung before he could say no .
The full knowledge of a fact sometimes enables you to see all at once many supporting but previously unsuspected things .
It amazed me not to have suspected until that moment that Carlos Argentino was a madman .
As were all the Viterbos , when you came down to it .
Beatriz ( I myself often say it ) was a woman , a child , with almost uncanny powers of clairvoyance , but forgetfulness , distractions , contempt , and a streak of cruelty were also in her , and perhaps these called for a pathological explanation .
Carlos Argentino 's madness filled me with spiteful elation .
Deep down , we had always detested each other .
On Garay Street , the maid asked me kindly to wait .
The master was , as usual , in the cellar developing pictures .
On the unplayed piano , beside a large vase that held no flowers , smiled ( more timeless than belonging to the past ) the large photograph of Beatriz , in gaudy colours .
Nobody could see us ; in a seizure of tenderness , I drew close to the portrait and said to it , " Beatriz , Beatriz Elena , Beatriz Elena Viterbo , darling Beatriz , Beatriz now gone forever , it 's me , it 's Borges . "
Moments later , Carlos came in .
He spoke dryly .
I could see he was thinking of nothing else but the loss of the Aleph .
" First a glass of pseudo - cognac , " he ordered , " and then down you dive into the cellar .
Let me warn you , you 'll have to lie flat on your back .
Total darkness , total immobility , and a certain ocular adjustment will also be necessary .
From the floor , you must focus your eyes on the nineteenth step .
Once I leave you , I 'll lower the trapdoor and you 'll be quite alone .
You need n't fear the rodents very much -- though I know you will .
In a minute or two , you 'll see the Aleph -- the microcosm of the alchemists and Kabbalists , our true proverbial friend , the multum in parvo ! "
Once we were in the dining room , he added , " Of course , if you do n't see it , your incapacity will not invalidate what I have experienced .
Now , down you go .
In a short while you can babble with all of Beatriz ' images . "
Tired of his inane words , I quickly made my way .
The cellar , barely wider than the stairway itself , was something of a pit .
My eyes searched the dark , looking in vain for the globe Carlos Argentino had spoken of .
Some cases of empty bottles and some canvas sacks cluttered one corner .
Carlos picked up a sack , folded it in two , and at a fixed spot spread it out .
" As a pillow , " he said , " this is quite threadbare , but if it 's padded even a half - inch higher , you wo n't see a thing , and there you 'll lie , feeling ashamed and ridiculous .
All right now , sprawl that hulk of yours there on the floor and count off nineteen steps . "
I went through with his absurd requirements , and at last he went away .
The trapdoor was carefully shut .
The blackness , in spite of a chink that I later made out , seemed to me absolute .
For the first time , I realised the danger I was in : I 'd let myself be locked in a cellar by a lunatic , after gulping down a glassful of poison !
I knew that back of Carlos ' transparent boasting lay a deep fear that I might not see the promised wonder .
To keep his madness undetected , to keep from admitting he was mad , Carlos had to kill me .
I felt a shock of panic , which I tried to pin to my uncomfortable position and not to the effect of a drug .
I shut my eyes -- I opened them .
Then I saw the Aleph .
I arrive now at the ineffable core of my story .
And here begins my despair as a writer .
All language is a set of symbols whose use among its speakers assumes a shared past .
How , then , can I translate into words the limitless Aleph , which my floundering mind can scarcely encompass ?
Mystics , faced with the same problem , fall back on symbols : to signify the godhead , one Persian speaks of a bird that somehow is all birds ;
Alanus de Insulis , of a sphere whose center is everywhere and circumference is nowhere ; Ezekiel , of a four - faced angel who at one and the same time moves east and west , north and south .
( Not in vain do I recall these inconceivable analogies ; they bear some relation to the Aleph . )
Perhaps the gods might grant me a similar metaphor , but then this account would become contaminated by literature , by fiction .
Really , what I want to do is impossible , for any listing of an endless series is doomed to be infinitesimal .
In that single gigantic instant I saw millions of acts both delightful and awful ; not one of them occupied the same point in space , without overlapping or transparency .
What my eyes beheld was simultaneous , but what I shall now write down will be successive , because language is successive .
Nonetheless , I 'll try to recollect what I can .
On the back part of the step , toward the right , I saw a small iridescent sphere of almost unbearable brilliance .
At first I thought it was revolving ; then I realised that this movement was an illusion created by the dizzying world it bounded .
The Aleph 's diameter was probably little more than an inch , but all space was there , actual and undiminished .
Each thing ( a mirror 's face , let us say ) was infinite things , since I distinctly saw it from every angle of the universe .
I saw the teeming sea ; I saw daybreak and nightfall ; I saw the multitudes of America ; I saw a silvery cobweb in the center of a black pyramid ; I saw a splintered labyrinth ( it was London ) ; I saw , close up , unending eyes watching themselves in me as in a mirror ; I saw all the mirrors on earth and none of them reflected me ; I saw in a backyard of Soler Street the same tiles that thirty years before I 'd seen in the entrance of a house in Fray Bentos ; I saw bunches of grapes , snow , tobacco , lodes of metal , steam ; I saw convex equatorial deserts and each one of their grains of sand ; I saw a woman in Inverness whom I shall never forget ; I saw her tangled hair , her tall figure , I saw the cancer in her breast ; I saw a ring of baked mud in a sidewalk , where before there had been a tree ; I saw a summer house in Adrogué and a copy of the first English translation of Pliny -- Philemon Holland 's -- and all at the same time saw each letter on each page ( as a boy , I used to marvel that the letters in a closed book did not get scrambled and lost overnight ) ; I saw a sunset in Querétaro that seemed to reflect the colour of a rose in Bengal ; I saw my empty bedroom ; I saw in a closet in Alkmaar a terrestrial globe between two mirrors that multiplied it endlessly ; I saw horses with flowing manes on a shore of the Caspian Sea at dawn ; I saw the delicate bone structure of a hand ; I saw the survivors of a battle sending out picture postcards ; I saw in a showcase in Mirzapur a pack of Spanish playing cards ; I saw the slanting shadows of ferns on a greenhouse floor ; I saw tigers , pistons , bison , tides , and armies ; I saw all the ants on the planet ; I saw a Persian astrolabe ; I saw in the drawer of a writing table ( and the handwriting made me tremble ) unbelievable , obscene , detailed letters , which Beatriz had written to Carlos Argentino ; I saw a monument I worshipped in the Chacarita cemetery ; I saw the rotted dust and bones that had once deliciously been Beatriz Viterbo ; I saw the circulation of my own dark blood ; I saw the coupling of love and the modification of death ; I saw the Aleph from every point and angle , and in the Aleph I saw the earth and in the earth the Aleph and in the Aleph the earth ; I saw my own face and my own bowels ; I saw your face ; and I felt dizzy and wept , for my eyes had seen that secret and conjectured object whose name is common to all men but which no man has looked upon -- the unimaginable universe .
I felt infinite wonder , infinite pity .
" Feeling pretty cockeyed , are you , after so much spying into places where you have no business ? " said a hated and jovial voice .
" Even if you were to rack your brains , you could n't pay me back in a hundred years for this revelation .
One hell of an observatory , eh , Borges ? "
Carlos Argentino 's feet were planted on the topmost step .
In the sudden dim light , I managed to pick myself up and utter , " One hell of a -- yes , one hell of a . "
The matter - of - factness of my voice surprised me .
Anxiously , Carlos Argentino went on .
" Did you see everything -- really clear , in colours ? "
At that moment I found my revenge .
Kindly , openly pitying him , distraught , evasive , I thanked Carlos Argentino Daneri for the hospitality of his cellar and urged him to make the most of the demolition to get away from the pernicious metropolis , which spares no one -- believe me , I told him , no one !
Quietly and forcefully , I refused to discuss the Aleph .
On saying goodbye , I embraced him and repeated that the country , that fresh air and quiet were the great physicians .
Out on the street , going down the stairways inside Constitution Station , riding the subway , every one of the faces seemed familiar to me .
I was afraid that not a single thing on earth would ever again surprise me ; I was afraid I would never again be free of all I had seen .
Happily , after a few sleepless nights , I was visited once more by oblivion .
Postscript of March first , 1943 -- Some six months after the pulling down of a certain building on Garay Street , Procrustes & Co. , the publishers , not put off by the considerable length of Daneri 's poem , brought out a selection of its " Argentine sections " .
It is redundant now to repeat what happened .
Carlos Argentino Daneri won the Second National Prize for Literature .
[ " I received your pained congratulations , " he wrote me .
" You rage , my poor friend , with envy , but you must confess -- even if it chokes you ! -- that this time I have crowned my cap with the reddest of feathers ; my turban with the most caliph of rubies . " ]
First Prize went to Dr. Aita ; Third Prize , to Dr. Mario Bonfanti .
Unbelievably , my own book The Sharper 's Cards did not get a single vote .
Once again dullness and envy had their triumph !
It 's been some time now that I 've been trying to see Daneri ; the gossip is that a second selection of the poem is about to be published .
His felicitous pen ( no longer cluttered by the Aleph ) has now set itself the task of writing an epic on our national hero , General San Martín .
I want to add two final observations : one , on the nature of the Aleph ; the other , on its name .
As is well known , the Aleph is the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet .
Its use for the strange sphere in my story may not be accidental .
For the Kabbala , the letter stands for the En Soph , the pure and boundless godhead ; it is also said that it takes the shape of a man pointing to both heaven and earth , in order to show that the lower world is the map and mirror of the higher ; for Cantor 's Mengenlehre , it is the symbol of transfinite numbers , of which any part is as great as the whole .
I would like to know whether Carlos Argentino chose that name or whether he read it -- applied to another point where all points converge - - in one of the numberless texts that the Aleph in his cellar revealed to him .
Incredible as it may seem , I believe that the Aleph of Garay Street was a false Aleph .
Here are my reasons .
Around 1867 , Captain Burton held the post of British Consul in Brazil .
In July , 1942 , Pedro Henríquez Ureña came across a manuscript of Burton 's , in a library at Santos , dealing with the mirror which the Oriental world attributes to Iskander Zu al - Karnayn , or Alexander Bicornis of Macedonia .
In its crystal the whole world was reflected .
Burton mentions other similar devices -- the sevenfold cup of Kai Kosru ; the mirror that Tariq ibn -Ziyad found in a tower ( Thousand and One Nights , 272 ) ; the mirror that Lucian of Samosata examined on the moon ( True History , I , 26 ) ; the mirrorlike spear that the first book of Capella 's Satyricon attributes ; Merlin 's universal mirror , which was " round and hollow ... and seem'd a world of glas " ( The Faerie Queene , III , 2 , 19 ) -- and adds this curious statement : " But the aforesaid objects ( besides the disadvantage of not existing ) are mere optical instruments .
The Faithful who gather at the mosque of Amr , in Cairo , are acquainted with the fact that the entire universe lies inside one of the stone pillars that ring its central court ...
No one , of course , can actually see it , but those who lay an ear against the surface tell that after some short while they perceive its busy hum ...
The mosque dates from the seventh century ; the pillars come from other temples of pre-Islamic religions , since , as ibn-Khaldun has written : ' In nations founded by nomads , the aid of foreigners is essential in all concerning masonry . ' "
Does this Aleph exist in the heart of a stone ?
Did I see it there in the cellar when I saw all things , and have I now forgotten it ?
Our minds are porous and forgetfulness seeps in ; I myself am distorting and losing , under the wearing away of the years , the face of Beatriz .
El Aleph , 1945 .

An article on Sarah Palin has touched off a blistering exchange between high - profile conservatives .
Palin story sparks GOP family feud
A hard - hitting piece on Sarah Palin in the new Vanity Fair has touched off a blistering exchange of insults among high - profile Republicans over last year ’s GOP ticket – tearing open fresh wounds about leaks surrounding Palin and revealing for the first time some of the internal wars that paralyzed the campaign in its final days .
Rival factions close to the McCain campaign have been feuding since last fall over Palin , usually waging the battle in the shadows with anonymous quotes .
Now , however , some of the most well - known names in Republican politics are going on - the - record with personal attacks and blame - casting .

William Kristol , the editor of The Weekly Standard and at times an informal adviser to Sen .
John McCain , touched off the latest back - and - forth Tuesday morning with a post on his magazine ’s blog criticizing the Todd Purdum - authored Palin story and pointing a finger at Steve Schmidt , McCain ’s campaign manager .
Kristol cited a passage in Purdum ’s piece in which “ some top aides ” were said to worry about the Alaska governor ’s “ mental state ” and the prospect that the Alaska governor may be suffering from post - partum depression following the birth of her son Trig .
“ In fact , one aide who raised this possibility in the course of trashing Palin ’s mental state to others in the McCain - Palin campaign was Steve Schmidt , ” Kristol wrote .
Asked about the accusation , Schmidt fired back in an e-mail : “ I 'm sure John McCain would be president today if only Bill Kristol had been in charge of the campaign . ”
“ After all , his management of [ former Vice President ]
Dan Quayle ’s public image as his chief of staff is still something that takes your breath away , ” Schmidt continued .
“ His attack on me is categorically false . ”
Asked directly in a telephone interview if he brought up the prospect of Palin suffering from post - partum depression , Schmidt said : “ His allegation that I was defaming Palin by alleging post - partum depression at the campaign headquarters is categorically untrue .
In fact , I think it rises to the level of a slander because it ’s about the worst thing you can say about somebody who does what I do for a living . ”
But Kristol ’s charge was seconded by Randy Scheunemann , a longtime foreign policy adviser to McCain who is also close to the Standard editor and was thought to be a Palin ally within the campaign .
“ Steve Schmidt has a congenital aversion to the truth , ” Scheunemann said .
“ On two separate and distinct occasions , he speculated about about Governor Palin having post - partum depression , and on the second he threatened that if more negative publicity about the handling of Governor Palin emerged that he would leak his speculation [ about post - partum depression ] to the press .
It was like meeting Tony Soprano . ”
Schmidt said Scheunemann ’s charges were “ categorically untrue . ”
“ It is inappropriate for me to discuss personnel issues from the campaign , ” Schmidt continued .
“ But suffice it to say Randy is saying these things not because they ’re true but because he wants to damage my reputation because of consequences he faced for actions he took . ”
Schmidt is alluding , without saying so directly , to the stories that emerged after the campaign that Scheunemann had been fired .
Scheunemann said Schmidt did try to fire him but added : “ I ’ve got a pay stub through November 15th . ”
The questions about Scheunemann being terminated are central to the larger battle about who was trashing Palin , something that quickly came to the surface in the back and forth between Schmidt and Kristol on Tuesday .
The vitriol also suggests the degree to which Palin remains a Rorschach test not simply to Republicans nationally but within a tight circle of elite operatives and commentators , many of whom seem ready to carry their arguments in 2012 .
Was Palin a fresh talent whose debut was mishandled by self - serving campaign insiders , or an eccentric “ diva ” who had no business on the national stage ?
Going forward , does she offer a conservative and charismatic face for a demoralized and star -less party ?
Or is she a loose cannon who should be consigned to the tabloids where she can reside in perpetuity with other flash - in - the - pan sensations ?
Schmidt , who has returned to his California - based political and public affairs consulting business , said that he “ worked incredibly hard during the campaign to defend Sarah Palin and her family against a lot of attacks that I thought then and think today were very unfair . ”
And he got in a dig at Kristol , who frequently offered unvarnished assessments of McCain ’s campaign from his perch at the Standard , on Fox News , where he is a contributor , and in his then - New York Times column .
“ Bill Kristol , going back to the time of the campaign , has taken a lot of cheap shots at the campaign without ever offering a plausible path to victory , ” Schmidt said .
“ He ’s in the business of ad hominem insults and criticism . ”
Responding to Schmidt ’s counterattack , Kristol directly fingered Schmidt : “ It ’s simply a fact that when the going got tough , Steve Schmidt trashed Sarah Palin , both within the campaign and ( on background ) to journalists .
This was after Steve took credit for the Palin pick when , at first , he thought it made him look good .
John McCain deserved better . ”
At this , Schmidt unloaded in a lengthy telephone interview , suggesting that Kristol was carrying out a personal vendetta based out of anger over the attempt to fire Scheunemann in the final days of the campaign .
In doing so , Schmidt revealed what has been whispered about for months following the campaign : that he and another top aide had ordered a leak hunt in the campaign ’s internal e-mail system .
“ What this is about is a personal issue that happened late in the campaign relating to a close , personal friend of Bill Kristol and people at The Weekly Standard , ” Schmidt said , refusing to use Scheunemann ’s name .
“ At the end of the campaign there were a series of leaks that were so damaging that it was consuming the 24 - hour cable news cycle .
Leaks to reporters where Sarah Palin was called all manner of names .
[ McCain senior adviser ]
Rick Davis and I jointly felt that was outrageous .
So we made an attempt for the first time in the campaign to try to ID who was leaking information that was so damaging and demoralizing to a campaign that was in very difficult circumstances , ” Schmidt said , noting that an IT professional executed a system - wide search by keyword .
“ What was discovered was an e-mail from a very senior staff member to Bill Kristol that then entered into the news current and continued the negative in - fighting stories for an additional news cycles .
I recommended tough medicine for that individual that was carried out , ” Schmidt said , again referring to Scheunemann .
“ Bill Kristol might not have liked that decision , and he might be mad about what happened to his friend , but going all the way back he has been a part of this story and I ’ve preserved his confidentiality in that until now .
But his use of his public forums to take a personal fight and make character attacks is just simply dishonest and wrong . ”
Scheunemann , confirming that his e-mail had been searched , accused Schmidt of “ acting in a manner of Iranian secret police ” in going to his account .
The foreign policy hand said what was discovered was a message from Kristol inquiring who was the source in the campaign of the “ diva ” leak , the now - famous complaint from a senior McCain campaign official to CNN ’s Dana Bash that Palin was acting like a spoiled and selfish celebrity .
Schmidt suggested that Scheunemann had fingered Nicolle Wallace , a senior McCain adviser who helped work with Palin , to Kristol in the message .
“ It led to a whole another round of speculation , including Fred Barnes the next night attacking Nicolle Wallace on the air , ” Schmidt said , suggesting without saying directly that was why an effort was made to terminate Scheunemann .
Barnes , another Weekly Standard editor and Fox News contributor , accused Wallace on Fox News in late October of being “ a coward ” for running up tens of thousands of dollars in high - end clothes for Palin and then letting the governor take the blame for the purchases .
After Wallace denied she had purchased the clothes , Barnes apologized on the air the following night .
But Scheunemann said the clothes controversy was an entirely separate issue and one which he made no mention of in his e-mail to Kristol .
Asked directly if he accused Nicolle Wallace of being the source behind the “ diva ” leak in his message to Kristol , Scheunemann said : “ My e-mail did not accuse Nicolle Wallace .
It said something very disparaging about Nicolle but it did not accuse her of being the leak . ”
A source familiar with the contents of the e-mail said that Scheunemann actually accused Nicolle Wallace ’s husband , Mark Wallace , of being the source of the leak .
When Kristol questioned the likelihood of a male like Mark Wallace using such a gossipy term as diva , this source said , Scheunemann wrote back that Mark Wallace knows something about divas because he ’s married to a diva .
Asked about the e-mail , Nicolle Wallace said : “ I did not have any knowledge of this .
This is all news to me . ”
As for being called a “ diva , ” Wallace laughed for a few seconds .
“ I do n’t have anything to say on that , ” she said .
Mark Wallace , taking the phone from his wife , also laughed about the diva accusation but would n’t respond when asked whether he had been the source of the “ diva ” leak .
He explained that he had followed a " zero talk policy with the press " regarding the campaign and wanted to honor that .
But , after an early version of this story was posted on - line , he made an exception and offered a flat denial : " No , never .
I do n't think Sarah Palin is a diva . "
The leak - hunting , Scheunemann said , began after POLITICO ’s Ben Smith wrote a story in late October suggesting that Palin had ” gone rogue ” and began ignoring the advice of her campaign handlers .
“ So after that , they went nuclear with ‘ diva ’ the next day , ” Scheunemann said , referring to the Palin - bashing done to CNN ’s Bash the day after the POLITICO story .
“ But did anybody search Mark or Nicolle Wallace ’s e-mails for leaks to Dana Bash ? ”
Schmidt said Kristol was driven by a personal vendetta over the attempted termination of his decades - long friend , Scheunemann .
“ Nonsense , ” Kristol replied .
“ My post today was ( self - evidently ) triggered by the Todd Purdum article that appeared today , which had Schmidt ’s fingerprints all over it .
I had n’t thought about Schmidt in months , and will be happy now to return to more pressing issues , like the presidency of Barack Obama . ”
As for the charges of being a sunshine soldier with regard to Palin , Schmidt said : “ Nonsense .
I ’m a team player .
That ’s a reflection of [ Kristol ’s ] values .
He ’s the Washington , D.C. , talking head and glitterati .
I live in Northern California and I really do n’t give a s--- about that stuff . ”
The nasty back - and - forth between the two well - known Republicans and re-litigating of internal backbiting underscores the degree to which the internecine and very personal battle over last fall ’s ticket between those seen as Palin allies and Palin detractors still rages on nearly six months into President Obama ’s term .
And it comes as Palin struggles to find her footing , at times appearing to want to take a strictly Alaska - first approach , but then re-emerging on the national stage – something chronicled in the nearly 10,000 - word Vanity Fair article .
Loyalists to Palin , including Kristol , were outraged at Purdum ’s piece , believing it to be another example of what they see as elite media contempt for the Wasilla native .
In his post , Kristol also criticized Purdum for writing that several Alaskans had told him during the reporting of the piece that they had checked the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders definition of “ narcissistic personality disorder ” and found it fit their governor .
“ Is there any real chance that ‘ several ’ Alaskans independently told Purdum that they had consulted the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ? ” Kristol wrote .
“ I do n’t believe it for a moment .
I ’ve ( for better or worse ) moved in pretty well - educated circles in my life , and I ’ve gone decades without ‘ several ’ people telling me they had consulted the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders . ”
In response , Purdum , a Princeton graduate , wrote of his Harvard - degreed critic : “ I 'm not nearly as well - educated as Bill , but the great Irving Berlin taught me that ‘ you do n't have to go to a private school not to pick up a penny near a stubborn mule . ’
In the age of Google , I 'm confident that plenty of Alaskans know more about finding medical reference works – and all sorts of other knowledge – than Bill thinks they do . ”

EVENTS IN PALIN'S POLITICAL CAREER EVENTS IN PALIN'S POLITICAL CAREER December 2006 - Gov. Sarah Palin , a former mayor of Wasilla City , Alaska , becomes governor of her state after defeating an incumbent governor of her own party in the primary and then beating a former governor in the general election .
August 2008 - John McCain picks
Palin as his vice presidential running mate in a startling selection that makes the Alaska governor the first woman named to a spot on a Republican national ticket .
September 2008 - An announcement that Palin's then 17 - year - old daughter , Bristol , is pregnant creates a stir as the governor prepares to accept her nomination at the Republican National Convention .
October 2008 - Palin is investigated for the firing of a public safety commissioner who said he felt pressure from the governor , her husband and her staff to fire a state trooper who had gone through a divorce from Palin 's sister .
The Alaska Legislature finds Palin abused her power in office , but a report released by the Alaska Personnel Board on the eve of the election clears Palin of wrongdoing .
November 2008 - McCain and Palin lose the 2008 presidential race .
June 2009 - Palin blasts comedian David Letterman for making a joke about her daughter getting " knocked up " by New York Yankee Alex Rodriguez .
Letterman apologizes .
July 2009 - Palin makes a surprise announcement , saying she is resigning from her post as governor at the end of the month .
The Associated Press Sarah Palin has no intention of retiring from public life , the soon - to - be ex-Alaska governor 's spokeswoman said Sunday , but top Republicans are expressing befuddlement at the decision by one of the party 's leading presidential prospects to give up her job .
" It 's astounding , " Sen . Chuck Grassley , an Iowa Republican said on CBS '
Face the Nation .
Grassley , whose state holds the crucial first contest of the presidential campaign , said he would welcome a Palin presidential candidacy but thought it might now be harder to launch .
" I would think , if you want to run for president — and I 'm not sure that 's got anything to do with what she 's doing — that the forum of a governorship would be a better forum than just being a private citizen , " Grassley said .
Meghan Stapleton , the governor 's communications director , told USA TODAY in a phone interview that she expects Palin to remain active as a speaker and campaigner .
" I am listening to options for her , " she said .
Palin's also working to complete memoirs due out next spring .
" She does n't have a next step decided yet , " Stapleton said .
" We will just have to wait for history . "
Palin , who last year became the Republican Party 's first female vice presidential nominee , announced plans to step aside as governor at a hastily organized holiday news conference Friday , citing the toll that her national notoriety has taken on her state , her family and her finances .
But in a Facebook posting the next day , Palin said she wants to " help our nation achieve greatness " by advancing a platform of energy independence , smaller government and enhanced national security .
Over the weekend , Palin moved aggressively to squelch rumors that her surprise decision might have darker motivations .
She posted links on her Twitter account to a Los Angeles Times article quoting FBI officials saying that she is not under investigation .
Her lawyer , Thomas Van Flein , threatened legal action against reporters and bloggers who suggest any wrongdoing by Palin or her husband , Todd .
Last year 's Republican presidential candidate , Sen. John McCain , issued a statement expressing " the greatest respect and affection " for his former running mate , and a hope that " she will continue to play an important leadership role in the Republican Party . "
Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele said he 'll seek Palin 's help this fall for GOP gubernatorial candidates Bob McDonnell in Virginia and Chris Christie in New Jersey .
Other party leaders were not so enthused .
Karl Rove , former political adviser to President George W. Bush , said on Fox News Sunday that he and other GOP strategists are " perplexed " by Palin 's bombshell .
Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee , another potential 2012 Republican presidential contender , called Palin 's strategy " risky . "
Even so , SarahPAC , Palin 's political action committee , enjoyed a surge of contributions after the governor 's announcement , Stapleton said .
Her decision caught many members of her own party flat - footed .
" I did n't find out until a newspaper called , " said state Rep .
Wes Keller , a Palin ally .
U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski — whose father , former Alaska governor Frank Murkowski , lost the GOP primary to Palin in 2006 — accused Palin of having " decided to abandon the state and her constituents . "
Palin 's resignation becomes official July 26 .
She will be succeeded by Alaska 's lieutenant governor , Sean Parnell , a Republican .

Using a hair plucked from a dead housefly as his paintbrush , self - taught sculptor Willard Wigan brings an extremely sharp eye to his life 's work : creating miniature masterpieces that fit inside a needle 's eye or sit atop the head of a pin .
The British artist reduces pop culture characters like the Incredible Hulk and The Simpsons to tiny figures that fetch big prices : Microsculptures go for up to $ 140,000 a pop , according to Wigan 's current catalog .
Collectors , including Prince Charles , Elton John , Mike Tyson and British tycoon David Lloyd , receive a microscope along with each nanoscale object so they can actually see the artwork they 've purchased .

" I 'm like a mad professor , but without the spiky hair , " laughs Wigan , 52 , who spends about six weeks on each piece .
" I get down to 6 , 7 microns , which is one - third the size of a period you 'd see in a newspaper . "
How does he do it ?
Wigan peers through a microscope at 800 times magnification as he molds dust fibers and slivers of plastic into recognizable shapes .
Exercising precision control over unruly materials requires nearly superhuman calm , Wigan told Wired.com during his recent visit to Los Angeles , where some of his creations are on display .
The artwork is housed in special cases that incorporate microscope lenses focused on the work to allow visitors to get a good look .
" When you work at a microscopic level , " he says , " you have to control every part of your body movement — your fingertips , your joints , the pulse in your fingers .
I slow down my breathing before any cut , which gives me one and a half seconds in between the heartbeat to make my incisions . "
Anatomy of a Microsculpture
For his tribute to Buzz Aldrin 's 1969 moon landing , pictured above , Wigan manipulated the astronaut 's arm into saluting position with a minute implement made from the sliver of a plastic shirt tag .
" I cut the joints of this nylon fiber and moved the arm toward its head , but as I bend it , the arm keeps wanting to spring back , " he says , describing the delicate process .
" I 'm making little grooves , and as I 'm cutting , the body starts to bend and twist and by then , perspiration starts dripping off my finger down the tool and toward the sculpture , like a little tidal wave of sweat coming down . "
Setting the teeny astronaut figure firmly in place presented another problem .
" I drilled two microscopic holes into the needle , then pushed his feet inside the little holes , " Wigan says .
" If you press too hard , the body will flick like a little catapult , so I had to let my pulse act like a jackhammer to apply the pressure that actually shoved him into place . "
As for the flag , Wigan used a housefly hair to paint a miniscule plastic bag fragment with crushed paint pigment , then literally grabbed his flagpole out of thin air .
" I got a piece of black plastic , waved it in the air and collected a dust fiber particle , " he says .
" I put it underneath the microscope , grabbed one end and straightened it out .
That became the flagpole . "
Wigan began making small stuff at age 5 , when he built houses for ants .
Snubbed at school for being dyslexic , he found refuge in an alternate universe of his own design constructed in the backyard of his parents ' cottage in Birmingham , England .
" I started making houses for ants because I thought they needed somewhere to live , " he says .
" I made them shoes and hats .
It was a fantasy world I escaped to where my teachers could n't criticize me .
That 's how my career as a microsculptor began . "
This Wizard of Oz
As an adult , Wigan worked for two decades in a factory until he won overnight acclaim in 1999 .
To commemorate the royal wedding of Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys - Jones , he carved " Edward and Sophie : The Perfect Match " on the end of a matchstick .
Wigan 's Puff Daddy sculpture flashes some bling .

The stunt made Wigan 's reputation .
Since then , he 's crafted dozens of cultural figures , real and fictional , working out of a wardrobe closet lit with fiber - optic LEDs .
Wigan 's smallest triumph to date came in the form of a commission from a British tycoon who wanted an art piece invisible to the naked eye .
" I crushed a grain of sand with a little hammer , " Wigan matter - of - factly recalls , " smashed it into dust , took one of those dust particles and made a sculpture of a little polar bear out of it . "
Miniaturist to the Stars
Next up for Wigan :
He 's moving from England to Los Angeles , where he plans to launch a miniaturized celebrity series , starting with Michael Jackson .
Might this one - time outcast become the toast of Hollywood ?
The optimistic Wigan expects nothing less .
" I 'm just honoring my mother 's words , " he says .
" She always told me , ' The smaller your work , the bigger your name will become . ' "
Wigan 's miniature sculptures will be on display at Los Angeles ' Hollywood Education and Literacy Project , 6336 Hollywood Blvd. , through Aug. 24 .

Nearly 80 students packed into a basic accounting class at San Francisco State University on Tuesday , the first day of the fall semester , while dozens more spilled into the hallway hoping to get a seat .
In the Television Department , 56 students tried to crowd into " Age of Information , " another basic class with room for just 40 students .
And largely unseen in the crush of students trying to get a college education in the era of budget cuts were those , like Shaun Wong , who were so frustrated that they simply quit .
" I got , like , zero classes , and it was n't worth staying , " said Wong , a would - be sophomore who loves history but has just withdrawn from S.F. State .
" By the time it was my turn to register , about the only classes left were , like , fourth - semester Arabic and modern Greek .
I need to take second - semester English . "
Like all 23 campuses of California State University , San Francisco State is forced to shoulder its share of the $ 564 million reduction in state funds to the system that educates nearly half a million students - most of modest means who are trying to get an education at an affordable price .
Cost of budget cuts
The San Francisco campus is cutting $ 30.2 million this year .
That means it 's offering 354 fewer classes than last year , turning away dozens of lecturers , requiring employees to take two unpaid days off each month - and raising student fees 30 percent higher than last fall .
" I 'm pissed because they cut , like , a ton of classes , and we 're paying more money - it 's stressful , " said sophomore Elle Sandbloom , standing in the crowd of business majors forced to remain outside of Professor Scott Jerris ' Accounting 100 class because there was no room inside .
Students register online at a time assigned to them .
But because so many courses have been eliminated , many students found that classes were full by the time they were told to sign up .
So all across campus , students were " crashing " classes - showing up at the classroom door and hoping for mercy from professors willing to take on additional students .
It 's like going standby on an airline .
Jerris ' class is a prerequisite for business classes , and dozens of students tried to crash it Tuesday morning .
Later , during office hours , Jerris looked grim .
" I 've been a college teacher for 26 years , and I have never seen anything like this today , " he said .
" It 's frustrating for the students , and it 's heartbreaking for me . "
With 70 seats in the class , and 106 students wanting to sit in them , Jerris was forced to turn many of them away .
Just three from the wait list won a spot .
Sandbloom , the business major , was n't one of them .
" This is a bummer because to get financial aid I have to be enrolled in a certain number of classes , " said Sandbloom .
Flimsy silver lining
The financial aid problem is shared by many , and Victoria Moore , a graduate - level teaching assistant , witnessed the result :
The Latin class she teaches has a waiting list for the first time .
" It 's a boon for the Classics Department , " said Moore , instantly regretting any hint of pleasure revealed in her words and expressing sympathy for the students ' troubles .
" I 'm just trying to look for a silver lining . "
Jo Volkert , the school 's associate vice president for enrollment management , acknowledged how hard it is for students , staff and faculty .
She offered advice for worried students .
" Watch the online class schedule like a hawk , " Volkert said , because openings may occur during the three - week period when students can drop classes .
She also advised students to consider taking courses during the intense , three - week winter session that will be flush with courses because it is funded from student fees instead of scarce state funds .
Volkert also said the university may raise fees again to pay for summer courses .
" It would enable us to offer more classes in fall and spring , " she said .
Meanwhile , senior Danielle Carter , a broadcast major , waited nervously with dozens of students outside of Professor Marie Drennan 's " Age of Information " class in the television building .
" If I do n't get in , I wo n't be graduating in December , " she said .
As class began in the cavernous TV studio , Drennan explained that she would let in just eight more students , bringing the class size to 48 .
She would hold a lottery at the end of the three - hour class , so hopefuls could see if they even liked it .
The hours passed .
No one left .
Drennan looked out at the 56 students , who seemed to be enjoying themselves .
She sighed .
Everyone , she said , could stay .
On July 20 , Blizzard held an event for the press to allow game writers to get their first taste of StarCraft 2 single - player .
Ars Technica received what amounted to a golden ticket for the event , but I was unfortunately busy attending to a personal issue and had to politely decline ... no matter how great the temptation .
What Blizzard revealed was a completely rethought single - player experience that goes beyond what was attempted in the first game .
While some are still hung up on the lack of LAN play , what is offered to those playing alone is substantial .
The single - player game is no longer a linear , mission - to - mission affair .
You 'll be given different hubs that allow you to click on people and items in order to gain understanding about the game world , and pick and choose which missions you would like to tackle .
" These hubs operate in a similar fashion to briefing rooms from games like Wing Commander or X - Wing , but with an even greater degree of interaction , " Shacknews explains .
" You can talk to characters , interact with and examine various items in the environments , upgrade your units , and start up missions . "
Successfully completing these missions allows you to unlock new units , as well as cash to hire your own mercenaries to aid you in battle .
" The mercenaries function kind of like Hero Units from the Warcraft games .
For a large fee , you can contract with various groups of mercenaries , " Destructoid reports .
" Once you 've contracted them , you can then use them in battle by constructing a Merc Compound and then buying them like any normal unit . "
Single - player gameplay is given some unique twists
The missions described include a race to grab an artifact , and a lava - infused map that includes unique environmental challenges .
There was also a mission on display that incorporated a day and night cycle into the strategy .
" During the day , it 's build , research and destroy every Zerg infested structure .
At night , the player must retreat , as hundreds of infested humans emerge from their hidden burrows , swarming the camp , " Kotaku reveals .
Missions will also include unique units that almost sound like something out of the world of Diablo .
" When trying to secure the relic , Raynor 's forces are attacked by a quartet of Stone Zealots , gargantuan statues brought to life to protect the prized artifact , " Kotaku describes from its playthrough .
There will also be achievements to unlock during each mission , giving you a reason to go back and improve your performance .
Single - player is no longer just a mutliplayer trainer
These sweeping changes to how single - player missions are organized and how you unlock units and items should make the solo experience a much more fulfilling experience .
No longer just a way to learn how to use your units , now it seems as if the single - player will be an almost fully unique experience .
If you 're a fan of the world and lore of StarCraft , expect it to be explored in a much deeper - than - expected way .
This also raises some interesting questions about the Zerg and Protoss releases .
While Terrans drink in bars and organize their attacks from ships , what will the Zerg hubs be like ?
It will likely take a while to find out , but it 's a question that should be fun to answer .
While I do n't regret skipping out on Blizzard to take care of my family , this is the one invitation that tempted me to leave the hospital and hop on a plane .
A new son ... or single - player StarCraft 2 ?
No man should ever have to make that choice .
Be sure to read the previews that are scattered around the Internet , there are many interesting tidbits in each one .

A storage unit with regulated temperature and humidity may be the best option for your belongings , but it comes at a higher price .
When you ’re heart is broken , you ’ll do anything to fix it .
Even replace it with a pig heart .
Scientists at the University of Minnesota have been working on stripping down hearts , removing much of the muscular and vascular tissue .
What you get is a semi- translucent “ decellularised ” heart .
Add some stem cells , and a new heart can be grown on this scaffold .
A new heart that your body wo n’t reject , at least in theory .
When Singularity Hub first brought you this story last year , researchers at UM were using the technique on rat hearts .
Now , they ’ve moved on to pig hearts and we ’ve got a hold of some cool new pics and a short video from New Scientist .
Check them out before and after the break .
At top , a rat ’s heart is decellularised until it becomes a scaffold .
Stem cells from mice are then applied to the heart , and it is recellularised at bottom .

It ’s alive !
This rat heart is being pumped in an artificial structure , allowing stem cells to grow into a new version of the organ .

The biggest problem is making sure that each heart grown is fully functioning and able to be transplanted .
After being decellularised , each heart has to be recellularised by applying a coating of stem cells and having blood pumped through the heart scaffolding .
Along with chemical signals from the scaffold cells , the blood allows the stem cells to specialize into the various needed tissues .
Looking at the rat hearts in the pumping machine , it ’s hard to believe that you are looking at a living , autonomous organ outside a body .
Check out the video from New Scientist :
The ultimate goal , as you would guess , is to radically increase the availability of hearts for transplant in humans .
While pig hearts provide a good scaffold , we may see human hearts ( from cadavers ) as the finalized product .
Similar techniques are being used for livers , kidneys , and lungs .
Using a patient ’s stem cells , and either pig or cadaver scaffolding , doctors may be able to “ grow ” organs for transplant .
Organs where most of the cells share the same DNA as the patient .
It ’s the ideal situation .
But we are years away from that case at the very least .
The University of Minnesota first released information on their research on rat hears back in January 2008 .
Eighteen months later , and we ’re just now seeing pig hearts in various stages of decellularisation .
If and when recellularized pig hearts can be transplanted into pigs and keep them alive ( the test already passed with rat hearts ) we may hear talk about starting human trials .
Judging by the slow but steady progress so far , this may be three to five years away .
Fortunately , heart transplant patients have some experience with waiting and hoping .

Spinvox has spoken several times to the BBC about its technology A UK firm that turns mobile messages into text faces questions over its privacy standards , technology and finances following a BBC investigation .
Spinvox 's service aims to convert voice messages into text messages using advanced speech recognition software .
But claims to the BBC suggest that the majority of messages have been heard and transcribed by call centre staff in South Africa and the Philippines .
The firm issued a statement calling the claims " incorrect " and " inaccurate " .
" Speech algorithms do not learn without human intervention and all speech systems require humans for learning - Spinvox does this in real - time , " the firm said in a statement .
" The actual proportion of messages automatically converted is highly confidential and sensitive data , " it added .
The Spinvox website claims its technology " captures spoken words and feeds them into a Voice Message Conversion System , known as ' D2 ' ( the Brain ) " .
The company said that , when necessary , parts of messages can be sent to a " conversion expert " .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The part sent is anonymised so that there is no way of tracking back a particular number or person .
It will be just one of millions of messages going through the automated system on a particular day , the company said .
A Facebook group created by staff at an Egyptian call centre , which used to work for Spinvox , includes a picture of one transcribed message containing what appears to be sensitive commercial information .
It also includes an audio recording of one call , and pictures of staff at the call centre .
Spinvox said that the pictures relate to a training session , and that the call centre did not meet its stringent standards and never handled live calls .
Data protection
However , the BBC has spoken to Kareem Lucilius , who said he worked for six months at the call centre , alongside as many as 150 others .
He said that after initial training , he went on to transcribe live messages .
Asked what part machines played he said , " It was done 100 % by people " .
He described the work : " We heard the message from the very beginning to the very end .
Love messages , secret messages , messages with sexual content , even people threatening to kill each other . "
Other call centre staff in South Africa and the Philippines have discussed on blogs how they have also transcribed calls for Spinvox .

A source at the company has told the BBC that the vast majority of messages are in fact converted into text by staff at call centres .
The fact that messages appear to have been read by workers outside of the European Union raises questions about the firm 's data protection policy .
The firm 's entry on the UK Data Protection Register says it does not transfer anything outside the European Economic Area .
The Information Commissioner 's Office ( ICO ) told the BBC that it has contacted Spinvox " to ensure that its entry on the data protection register is both accurate and complete , especially with regards to the transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area " .
In a statement , the ICO explained there was nothing to prevent Spinvox from using people rather than machines to translate messages .
However , it said that " it may be helpful if the company is clearer about the likelihood that people will be used to translate messages " .
" This is particularly important if customers are using the service for transmitting sensitive or secure information , " it added .
The firm issued a statement via its blog on Thursday saying that the allegations of call centres handling a majority of calls were " incorrect " .
" We have always been absolutely clear in our communications that humans form an important component of our learning system , " it said .
It added that the human - mediated training of its system was accomplished " in total security through anonymisation , encryption and randomisation " .
' Cost - cutting measures ' Spinvox , which has raised more than $ 200 m ( £ 120 m ) from investors , was founded in 2004 .
The company source told the BBC that operating large numbers of call centres is putting a huge financial burden on the business .
Last week the company 's co-founder Christina Domecq appealed to staff to take all or part of their pay for the months of July and August in the form of share options .
Is Spinvox a major technology success story , cracking the age - old problem of getting a machine to understand the human voice in all its glorious , cacophonous varieties ?
Not yet , it is n't

Dot.life : The Spinning of Spinvox
In an e-mail to staff she explained that the target was to raise £ 1 m to see the company through to profitable status .
But she warned that " should we not achieve the uptake we need , unfortunately , we may have to explore further cost - cutting measures " .
Daniel Doulton , the firm's other co-founder , told the BBC that it was true that the company had suffered some growing pains because of the exponential growth it was enjoying - bringing it 100 million customers around the world .
" The business now operates profitably , " he said .
" We are going through enormous growth as a business . "
The BBC has also learned that Spinvox has been locked out of one of its London data centres , leaving it unable to get access to its servers after a dispute about payments .
A spokesman at ANLX , the company which runs the data centre , said " their access has been suspended .
We are reviewing our options on a day - to - day basis . "
Spinvox said it cannot comment on the dispute , but said its main data storage locations are not affected .
The company says it works with some of the world 's biggest telecoms companies and institutional investors who , following due diligence and audit , have gone on to sign contracts with the voice - to - text firm .

With Microsoft copying Apple lock and step , it ’s like 1995 all over again .
In the latest piece of un-innovation from Redmond , a leaked presentation from the consulting company Microsoft hired to help it design and layout its upcoming retail stores indicates that Ballmer and co. are looking to copy the layout and feel of Apple Stores to a tee .
Check out these photos courtesy of Gizmodo .
Hey look !
It ’s a Microsoft “ answer bar ” !
A theater area with group events and training sessions ?
Hmmm …
And in classic Microsoft fashion , here they advertise the ability to check your email on the same screen you ’re watching TV .
Seriously ?
Even Katie Couric and Matt Lauer think it ’s a funny idea .
Hmm ..
I ’ve seen this set up somewhere before .
Wow , I wonder where Microsoft got the blueprint for this layout ?
And when you ’re done shopping at the Microsoft Store , walk out in a distinctive Microsoft shopping bag !
You can check out all of the leaked slides , courtesy of Gizmodo , over here .
Eric Boehlert at Media Matters wonders if Glenn Beck has forgotten that the entire reason he is in hot water with advertisers revolves around the fact that he called the President of the United States a " racist " and someone who has " a deep - seated hatred of white people " .
Because , you know , in all of his lashing out this week and last at his critics , he has yet to address this central point .
Certainly he has not apologized for it .
In fact , he 's acting as though he never actually said it .
As Boehlert puts it :
I ask because watch this clip below of Beck on Bill O'Reilly 's show this week and watch as the two men bemoan the attempts by nasty liberals " loons " to shut Beck up ; to snatch away his Freedom of Speech .
What 's rather astonishing is that while Beck and O'Reilly clearly make ( indirect ) references to the ad boycott campaign , they never explain to viewers what sparked the outrage .
They never explain why .
They never explain the campaign was launched in direct response to the fact that Beck went on national television and called the President of the United State a " racist " ; somebody who flashed a " deep - seated hatred of white people . "
At Fox News , that smear has been flushed down the memory hole , and all that 's left is playing victim .
Ah , but here 's the one thing :
If you 've been watching Beck this week on his program , he 's been imploring his audience to record it -- write it all down , even -- because it 's the Most Important Stuff They 'll Ever Watch on the Teevee .
That 's because , if you watch what he 's been doing so far , what seems to be emerging is that he is basically building a case justifying his declaration that Obama is a racist who hates white people .
This became crystal - clear midway through his Fox News program Thursday night , during a segment featuring ex-Democrat now complete loser Patrick Caddell and the ever- vivacious Michelle Malkin to heartily agree with whatever craziness came burbling out of his mouth .
They were all gathered to talk about the " army " of " thugs " that President Obama is planning to gather under the combined umbrellas of ACORN , SEIU , Color of Change and whatever other insidious " radicals "
Beck believes he 's uncovered .
And what does this " army " of " thugs " look like ?
Why , they 're all black people , of course .
Watch the segment and observe the examples he offers of the kinds of " thugs " he says Obama intends to incorporate into his army : some gun-toting Black Panthers , a shot from a Louis Farrakhan sermon before a Nation of Islam gathering , and a group of young black men doing military - style exercises .
This , as he explained earlier in the show , will be " Obama 's SS . "
So we now can see the arc of Beck 's thesis this week :
He was right to call President Obama an anti-white racist because he is this very moment forming an army of militant black thugs to take over your white neighborhoods and threaten your children and impose a liberal fascist state .
Or something like that .
You do have to wonder when the honchos at Fox will realize that Glenn Beck may bring in the ratings , but he is inflicting a deep scar on their brand name that will be a long time fading .
by Brett Stevens on July 22 , 2009
Back in election 2008 , many people voted for Barack Obama out of a simple desire to fix the racial inequities and conflict in the United States , a problem that has plagued us for centuries and peaks , periodically , in riots like Watts ( 1967 ) and L.A. ( 1992 ) .
The thinking was that if all people are finally made equal , the inequality that propelled discontent will cease .
That formula has been part of the American approach to race since 1968 : inequality causes conflict , so bring everyone into a first - world , middle - class lifestyle and things will be OK .
Obama appeared to bridge the worlds .
He could function in the white world , but also appeal to African - Americans .
Furthermore , he was our first black president .
Therefore , the logic went , everyone could see that equality was reigning and we ’d all be OK .
From the perspective of history , however , people tend to identify with their own ethnic , religious and cultural groups , and if given an inch , will take a mile .
Samuel Huntington in his Clash of Civilizations dovetailed with Spengler and Plato who say a civilization needs to have consensus on a values system , or its political and economic forces tear it apart .
In the United States , this translates to an upsetting of the power balance .
After WWII , African - Americans received increasing focus and government and social benefactors worked to end inequality ; this culminated in late - 1960s riots to which the solution was greater benefits and more forced integration .
The intent was to ensure that equality was enforced and therefore African - Americans would join the middle class , be just like “ us ” as white people saw it , and so the conflict would end .
I call it the “ fat and happy ” theory : if everyone is bought off , they ’ll all be fat and happy , and not riot and interrupt our lives with drama .
But “ fat and happy ” may only work when your ethnic group is the majority .
If you ’re a minority , you see a salient fact the majority cannot perceive : your group , and your values , are still not In Control .
With Barack Obama , white folks and black folks saw a chance to put African - American values in control .
But because the demands of the presidency are political and not cultural , this backfired .
The fragile balance of the 1970s — separate but equal , by other names — has been upset , and now we ’re in a competition for who ’s going to stay on top .
Sad but true , this is the reality of multicultural societies dating back to day one of humanity : one group must be on top , and group - mixing only really occurs when the others destroy that dominant majority .
The competition we see now is leading up to that conflict .
Let ’s look at a smattering of helpful news items :
[ Black professor Henry “ Skip ” Gates ] had returned from a trip to China last Thursday afternoon and found the front door of his Cambridge , Mass . , home stuck shut .
Gates entered the back door , forced open the front door with help from a car service driver , and was on the phone with the Harvard leasing company when a white police sergeant arrived .
Gates and the sergeant gave differing accounts of what happened next …
Gates was charged not with breaking and entering , but with disorderly conduct after repeatedly demanding the sergeant ’s name and badge number .
It does n’t matter whether Gates was yelling , or accused Sgt. James Crowley of being racist , or that all charges were dropped Tuesday .
Earl Graves Jr. , CEO of the company that publishes Black Enterprise magazine , was once stopped by police during his train commute to work , dressed in a suit and tie .
“ My case took place back in 1995 , and here we are 14 years later dealing with the same madness , ” he said Tuesday .
“ Barack Obama being the president has meant absolutely nothing to white law enforcement officers .
Zero .
So I have zero confidence that ( Gates ’ case ) will lead to any change whatsoever . ”
AP
We still have no statistical or factual data for what would happen if a white professor did the same thing .
Most conservatives would guess the treatment would not vary ; after all , even well - dressed , well - spoken men commit crimes ( for most of us , distinguishing between a Harvard professor and a con man can be difficult ) .
In their view , the cops did a rational thing — hold the person breaking and entering until his identity can be verified .
Then again , most do n’t live in neighborhoods where they see black people entering homes .
But to Democrats and African - Americans , the situation appears different — they see racial profiling , or the tendency of law enforcement to notice that more crimes occur in minority neighborhoods , that minorities have more convictions for crimes , and that minority gangs control more of the flow of drugs , and therefore , that they have a higher chance of conviction if they stop minorities .
They see this case as clear - cut racial profiling , and think that a white man would n’t even be stopped for doing the same thing .
I have no idea which viewpoint is correct .
What ’s more important however is seeing how Gates is caught up in a war of tokens , whereby black people feel targeted by law enforcement , and white people feel defensive whenever this happens , because they do n’t want law enforcement to stop looking for criminals wherever they occur .
This is part of that ethnic competition I write about above .
I know how the problem of racial profiling can be avoided .
In the 1950s and early 1960s , cops were mostly “ beat cops ” — meaning they patrolled small areas constantly .
After the 1960s , our cops operated by “ flexible response , ” or taking calls on the radio and sending in the troops in force .
Beat cops did n’t patrol in minority neighborhoods , nor did they stop people on freeways looking for drugs .
They defended the turf they came from , and let the rest take care of itself .
When we changed to flexible response , and the war on drugs intensified , that ’s when racial profiling became a noticed issue .
None of this really matters now .
People are not concerned with how well law enforcement works ; this is ethnic competition , with each side seeking privileges either by government or economic supremacy .
And so to them , it does n’t matter whether it was racial profiling or not .
It ’s how you want to interpret it that gets you and your people ahead in the game .
Let ’s look at another ambiguous circumstance :
Immigration agents raiding homes for suspected illegal immigrants violated the U.S. Constitution by entering without proper consent and may have used racial profiling , a report analyzing arrest records found .
Latinos made up a disproportionate number of the people arrested who were not the stated targets of the raids , and many of their arrest reports gave no basis for why they were initially seized , said the report , which was based on data from raids in New York and New Jersey .
The raids are ostensibly aimed at targeted individuals who present threats either to national security or community safety , but arrests of illegal immigrants nearby , known as collateral arrests , are also made .
AP
Remember how in high school the kids who got picked on formed a group of their own ?
This group was ultra- tolerant : you could be any kind of freak , or just a geek , but you were FIGHTING BACK against the majority .
That ’s how many white elites view the ethnic conflict issue — they perceive themselves as picked - on geeks , and so have joined in a tolerance coalition to smash the majority , and enjoy using ethnic conflict to do it .
Many of these people work in non-profits that look for statistical reasons to discount law enforcement actions against minorities , including illegal aliens .
Once again , there ’s a split .
Conservatives are going to say these cops went looking for bad guys , and in the process , found thousands of illegal aliens .
Faced with the choice of enforcing the law or not , they chose to enforce the law and deport them .
Liberals are going to say that these raids were a pretext for rounding up illegal aliens and deporting them .
Again , it ’s hard to know what ’s true .
Believe what you ’re inclined to believe , because the real story is n’t the justification of law , but the conflict of groups going on beneath it .
And a final corker of an example :
State police in riot gear rushed a downtown street to break up a standoff Tuesday between hundreds of black and white extremists who exchanged screams of “ Black power ! ” and “ White power ! ” during a protest over the state ’s handling of the case of a black man who was run over and dragged by a vehicle .
The conflict began with a march by about 100 mostly black activists who avoided a designated “ protest zone ” near Paris ’ courthouse and walked to the town square to chants of “ Black Power ! ” and “ No Justice , no peace ! ”
The rally in Paris , about 90 miles northeast of Dallas , is the third courthouse protest over the death of 24 - year - old Brandon McClelland , whose mangled body was found Sept. 16 on a country road .
Prosecutors initially charged two of McClelland ’s white friends with murdering him .
But a special prosecutor dismissed the charges last month , citing a lack of evidence , after a truck driver came forward and said he might have accidentally run over McClelland .
AP
Everyone remembers the dragging death of James Byrd , Jr. A sometimes - itinerant fellow with an alcohol problem and very little to his name , Byrd was lured into a compromising situation by white supremacists who then murdered him in a horrible way .
Of course , there ’s two sides to that story as well .
These white supremacists became that way in prison , where the ethnic battle lines are so cleanly drawn that many states attempt de facto segregation to keep conflict to a minimum .
And back outside the big house , we also have two points of view .
Black folks and many Democrats are going to see this case as a racial incident ; Republicans and many white folks are going to see this case as an accidental vehicular homicide .
Which is true ?
Not surprisingly , this has resulted in an interesting trend in Obama ’s poll numbers :
That was fast .
The hope and optimism that washed over the country in the opening months of Barack Obama ’s presidency are giving way to harsh realities .
An Associated Press - GfK
Poll shows that a majority of Americans are back to thinking that the country is headed in the wrong direction after a fleeting period in which more thought it was on the right track .
AP
And as if to explain why :
The President earns approval from 41 % of white voters , 97 % of black voters , and 58 % of all other voters .
Rasmussen
While up to 90 % of minorities normally vote Democratic , they cannot be counted on to approve of the Democratic candidate after several months in office , and not all of them ever do .
Yet his numbers are strong with one group , and falling with another .
A big part of this is the sudden realization that he ’s not a racial equalizer , but a racial polarizer , which plays into our fears that there ’s no easy solution to race discontent in America .
And the truth is equally “ clear ” to both sides as they now gear up for conflict .
The truth itself depends on what you believe .
Or rather , which side of the conflict you ’re on .
Truth really does n’t matter , only getting your group ahead .
We thought Obama would end this Us - versus - Them , but it looks like by not being from either side fully , he has intensified it .

US and Canadian college students can pack textbooks into their pockets instead of spine - bending backpacks courtesy of an iPhone application released by CourseSmart .
The northern California supplier of electronic textbooks on Tuesday released free software that makes digitized forms of college textbooks available on Apple 's ubiquitous iPhone or iPod Touch devices .
" We 've seen significant demand from student customers for the ability to get required textbook content in electronic form on an iPhone or iPod Touch , " said CourseSmart executive vice president Frank Lyman .
" We see incredible potential for iPhone and iPod Touch applications in education . "
Students that buy " eTextbooks " from CourseSmart can view them from any Internet - linked computers and are able to print out pages or copy sections into custom study guides .
Instead of lugging old - fashioned ink and paper books to classes , students can use iPhones of iPod Touch devices to access textbooks online for reference during classes .
" It 's important to students to be able to access textbook content in color with the same page layout as a printed textbook and now the eTextbooks App allows them to do that , " Lyman said .
CourseSmart began offering eTextbooks in 2007 and as of Tuesday had reportedly sold copies to students in slightly more than 5,900 schools .
CourseSmart said it works with a dozen major textbook publishers to stay current with electronic versions mandated by professors for classes and claims its prices are typically about half that of print versions .
The CourseSmart iPhone program is available at Apple 's online App Store .

Raven Software designer Manveer Heir has mounted a one - man Twitter Wolfenstein marketing campaign , offering to pay for your copy of the game if it manages to outsell Madden 10 .

Yes , he 's completely serious folks .
If the latest game in the long - running first - person shooter franchise manages to topple the game that generally dominates the month of August , he 'll reimburse you the full retail price for Wolfenstein .
Here 's the original tweet :
Here 's the deal folks : if Wolfenstein outsells Madden 10 in August I will personally pay for your copy ( keep your receipt ) - SPREAD THE WORD

Since that original post earlier this morning , Heir has gone on the clarify details about the offer .
For instance , reimbursements will take place on an international level , and he 'll be using official NPD numbers to determine whether or not he needs to pay .
Oh , and you need to follow him on Twitter to collect , so pay close attention to the link below .
It 's a pretty bold statement , but I 'd say that going up against Madden for the month of October with a first - person shooter is like trying to entice your football - loving spouse into sex with a striptease in front of the television on Super Bowl Sunday .
It 's futile , and you could get hurt .
Besides , if he has that kind of money to spend , why not buy a bunch of copies himself to pad the numbers ?
It would certainly save him a fortune in PayPal fees .

Ever wondered where people originally came up with descriptions of fantastic creatures like goblins , faeries , and others ?
I ’d suggest that many of these creatures came about as people tried to describe creatures from far - away lands , many of the creatures being so rare that it would be difficult to ever see them in one person ’s lifetime .
That is , difficult to see these creatures before the creation of the Internet .
Goblins and Proboscis Monkeys :
It ’s easy to see how goblins could have arisen as people tried to describe a creature like the Proboscis Monkey .
Goblins are typically characterized by having a large meaty nose , long claws , and being somewhere between the size of dwarves and humans .
Proboscis monkeys share all three of these characteristics .
Proboscis monkeys also live in swamplands and forests –goblins are believed to live in mossy cracks , caves , and tree roots .
Both goblins and Proboscis monkeys are nomadic , never staying too long in the same place .
Are these similarities a coincidence ?
Perhaps , but that makes for a less interesting story .
In a lot of ways , I ’d prefer thinking that the goblins in some of my favorite stories had a basis in a real creature .
Faeries and Pygmy Marmosets :
These small creatures only grow to be five to six inches tall ( excluding the tail ) , and are the perfect size for faeries .
They ’re also known for living in the rainforests of Brazil , as well as other areas of South America ( not bad , considering that many faeries are also rumored to live in forests ) .
It would not be too hard to believe that creatures like the Pygmy Marmosets inspired some of the original tales of faeries .
Pygmy Marmosets may not look exactly like faeries , but , as they scamper by in a nearby tree , it would not be hard to imagine that someone who did n’t know any better would mistake them for a faerie .
Of course , since these specific creatures live in South America , the likelihood of them influencing Celtic legends are slim–Europeans would have needed to travel to South America hundreds of years prior to the start of these legends .
However , there are similarly small species in Africa ( such as the Talapoin ) , which could work just as well as inspiration for similar tales ( no pun intended , of course ) .
There ’s also the possibility that squirrels dashing through the trees could have been part of the inspiration for woodland faeries –if all you got was a quick glance , it would be easy to mistake a squirrel for a small person running up a tree .
Pygmy Marmosets are known both for being common–they ’re classified as Least Concern as far as the threat of them being endangered –and for being fast .
It ’s very easy to see how someone in the rainforest could hear , or even see , very small “ people ” running through the trees .
What do you think ?
What other explanations can you think of for the creatures told in stories ?
Are these similar , real - life creatures just coincidences ?

Sir ,
I , too , am a disabled veteran of the armed forces , though I see no need to make ostentatious mention of that in public .
For it has been my observation that when a man prefaces his remarks this way , bullshit inevitably follows .
It is a cheap way of reclaiming the authority one no longer possesses .
We took the same oath , you and I .
We both claim to uphold it today , though we differ in execution : I serve my community by cleaning up roadside litter ; you fight the “ indoctrination ” of your children by public schools .
Question : do you mean this kind of indoctrination ?
Texas high school students would learn about such significant individuals and milestones of conservative politics as Newt Gingrich and the rise of the Moral Majority — but nothing about liberals — under the first draft of new standards for public school history textbooks .
The right - wing narrative holds that liberalism has no constructive role in the American story .
Such framing has been applied to liberals before … in Nazi Germany .
Surely you know this , Mr. Hedrick , since you are the expert in all things Nazi .
Surely you are aware that Hitler used the “ brownshirts , ” an astroturf movement , to shut down debate in Germany .
So who is shouting in that video ?
Democracy is a conversation , not a bellicose rant .
While copying your video code from YouTube , Mr. Hedrick , I saw the following note .
Why do you open this paragraph like court testimony ?
And why do you claim to speak for a “ silent majority ” when a clear majority wants reform ?
I , David William Hedrick , a member of the silent majority , decided that I was not going to be silent anymore .
So , I let U.S. Congressman Brian Baird have it .
I was one questioner out of 38 , that was called at random from an audience that started at 3,000 earlier in the evening .
Not expecting to be called on , I quickly scratched what I wanted to say on a borrowed piece of paper and with a pen that I borrowed from someone else in the audience minutes before I spoke .
So much for the planned talking points of the right wing conspiracy .
Perhaps you ’re not a paid spokesman for the “ right wing conspiracy , ” Mr. Hedrick , but you ’ve clearly internalized the right wing gasbaggery issuing from the Glenn Beck doom bunker .
For instance , you have willingly swallowed a nonsensical meme about German fascism .
The Nazis were “ socialists ” in the way that North Korea is a “ Democratic People ’s Republic ” — which is to say they were n’t .
Nazi Germany was a corporatist state and their auto industry was a legal monopoly — there is no analogue in the bailout of General Motors .
Of all the unfathomable nonsense you spewed , it was when you screamed “ do n’t touch my health care ! ” at Baird that I finally understood your problem : you suffer from paranoia , Mr. Hedrick .
You are convinced that “ THEY ” are out to get you .
But the truth is , nobody wants to take away your health care in the first place .
Your mind is trapped in a never - ending Samsara of Wacky ™ that transforms this non-taking - away of your health care into a threat to take it away .
Black becomes white , and up becomes down .
Indeed , your Crazy ™ asserts itself most boldly in your demand that Baird “ keep ” his oath to the Constitution .
As far as I can tell , Baird is , in fact , upholding that oath , while your vehemence strikes me as fearful ; you are afraid .
Of what ?
What are we supposed to be protecting ourselves from ?
Web developers could n’t stop talking about HTML and its evolution during the 1990s .
New features were usually tempting , though not always workable , and the Browser Wars meant that vendors competed by providing and copying features .
The HTML standardization process had its twists and turns , moving from the IETF to the W3C , developing standards that reflected immediate needs and tried to channel developer energy in more productive directions .
Then , suddenly , HTML was incredibly boring .
The dot - com bust was part of that , but a more fundamental change doomed the conversation : Microsoft dominated the space .
Whether because of the dominance of Windows , the technical quality of key innovations like Dynamic HTML , or the disappearance of Netscape into AOL , the stark reality was that Internet Explorer ruled the browser world .
Outsiders asking Microsoft for improvements to Internet Explorer invariably heard that Microsoft would be willing to upgrade IE “ when our customers ask for it ” – which was an almost polite version of no .
As a result , the last decade , even for those of us who turned to Mozilla , Opera , Safari , Chrome , or other browsers , has been one long exercise in making the most out of tools that took their last major steps in the late 1990s .
There was enough in HTML 4.01 , Cascading Style Sheets 2 , JavaScript , XML , HTTP , and XMLHttpRequest to keep us busy , especially as users acquired higher - speed connections and faster computers .
There was also constant frustration with browser limitations , driving the development of more flexible plugin approaches like Flash and Silverlight , though none of them succeeded in replacing the traditional Web , however dull it might have become .
Today , though , the HTML conversation is reborn .
Standards development around HTML seems to actually have a chance of influencing user experience in the browser , and Microsoft itself is participating in the HTML 5 conversation despite still holding roughly two - thirds of the browser market .
While Microsoft ’s market share is only slowly eroding , developer mindshare seems to have shifted decisively to the band of WHATWG upstarts , Microsoft ’s competitors .
The reason for this , I think , is that HTML 5 clearly has a bright future in a place that Microsoft can’t presently block : mobile web browsers .
When I ask people about the future of computing , the word I keep hearing in their answers is “ mobile “ .
Even if it ’s small now , it has a much greater effect on how people evaluate what ’s coming .
Microsoft has a mobile presence , certainly , but it ’s hard to argue that it has anywhere near the visibility of the iPhone , or even the Android .
Mobile web browsing has kept Opera going for years , but the iPhone and Android give Apple and Google much more visibility for their HTML 5 work , and Apple ’s decision to keep Flash off the iPhone in particular gave developers further cause to rethink their dependencies .
( The WebKit browser engine these share will also be integrated with Blackberry soon , and is also on the Palm Pre . )
In the mad rush to build mobile applications , HTML 5 ’s competition is n’t even desktop web browsers , but other mobile development toolkits .
As my co-worker Keith Fahlgren put it recently :
Speaking from personal experience , I ’ve had a lot more fun writing an HTML5 application based on CSS3 , the database API , and jQuery that runs out of the box on all of the hot mobile platforms than I ever would have had writing some silly Objective C app for a locked down App Store ( or Java for an open one ) .
This creates a whole new world for the “ where should HTML go ? ” conversation .
Web developers certainly have pent - up demand for new features , but previous conversations about revising HTML always foundered on the “ but will Internet Explorer support it ? ” question .
Today , when that question feels less important , the ice is finally breaking .
( Microsoft is even participating in HTML 5 , though it ’s not yet clear how committed they are to implementation . )
It will doubtless be years before developers can safely deploy fully - featured HTML 5 sites without concern for older browsers , but for the first time it is plausible that changes to HTML will find wide adoption , and hope is rising .
That hope , of course , brings its own risks .
I ca n’t say the HTML 5 process has done credit to either the W3C or the WHATWG – it feels to me like an ugly scramble – and there are plenty of specific decisions that deserve careful questioning .
That the broken process is actually important to people , however , is a huge sign in itself that HTML is relevant once again .
After years of quiet , it ’s worth paying attention again !
Fanboys have been running Ubuntu on Sharp 's deceased Zaurus lineup of PDAs for years .
Now Sharp makes it official with the launch of this 5 - inch , 1024 x600 TFT LCD touchscreen NetWalker smartbook , aka the PC - Z1 .
It 's not a Zaurus per se , but the compact 161.4 x 108.7 x 19.7 ~ 24.8 mm / 409g device certainly resurrects its ghost .
Underpinning the device is an 800MHz Freescale i.MX515 CPU built around the ARM Cortex - A8 architecture , 512MB of memory , 4GB of on - board flash storage ( with microSDHC expansion for another 16GB ) , 802.11b/g WiFi , 2x USB , and QWERTY keyboard going 68 percent of full - size .
Sorry , no 3G data .
The PC - Z1 features a 3 - second quick launch , non-removable 10 - hour battery , and is purposely positioned by Sharp as a taint -- it ain't quite a smartphone and 't ain't quite a laptop .
Good luck with that Sharp .
The device is expected to hit Japan on September 25th for ¥ 44,800 .
That 's about $ 479 whenever it might come Stateside .
It 's worth noting that the current US ban on the import of BGA - packaged products like Freescale 's i.
MX processors should not affect the import of the PC - Z1 as Akihabara News contends .
As we understand it , that ban affects the import of the chips , not the systems using them and assembled elsewhere .
Otherwise , Amazon would n't be selling its Kindle , dig ? [ Via Akihabara News and Engadget Japanese Read [ warning : Japanese PDF ]
Muslim man sentenced to life in jail after killing his German - born wife because she was ' too independent '
The scales of justice : A Muslim man has been sentenced to life for killing his ' independent ' wife
A Muslim asylum seeker has been sentenced to life in prison after killing his German - born wife because she was ' too independent ' , a court in Germany heard today .
The 27 - year - old Kurdish man , identified only as Onder B , was found guilty today of stabbing his wife in the eyes , beating her with a billiard cue and then running over her in his car .
His mother - in - law had once told him to be ' strict ' with her strong - willed daughter , Mujde - who was also Onder 's cousin .
On New Year 's Eve 2008 he stabbed his 18 - year - old wife Mujde 46 times and beat her with a billiard cue .
And because she was ' already so disfigured from the stabbing and beating that she would hate me for the rest of her life , ' he got into his car and ran over her body several times .
Bielefeld District Court judge Jutta Albert convicted him on a charge of murder arising from base motives , and one of cruelty , because the defend ant stabbed his wife in both eyeballs while she was still alive .
He stabbed her so hard in the head with a fruit knife that the blade broke off in her skull .
The case has pulled into sharp focus the cultural differences between Western values and the estimated three million Muslim immigrants living and working in Germany .
Bielefeld District Court judge Jutta Albert clashed repeatedly this week with family members of both victim and defendant as details of the horrific case unfolded .
' One more remark from you and you 'll be removed ! ' she told the victim ’s mother .
' Do you think you can behave here as if you were in a Turkish bazaar ? '
The killer arrived in Germany as an asylum seeker , in 2001 .
He was 19 and Mujde was 11 at the time .
He married a Turkish woman 10 years his senior , but the couple soon separated .
He returned home to Turkey in 2003 , where he performed his mandatory military service , coming back Germany in 2006 .
Under a deal between their families a marriage was ' arranged ' between him and Mujde , in which he then viewed her , according to prosecutors , 'as his property ' .
He returned to Turkey and left her in Germany after marrying in 2007 .
The court was told their relationship degenerated into threats and abuse carried out over the Internet with Mujde at one stage reporting him to the police .
The court heard how he was upset ' that she behaved the way she did and didn`t do what he told her ' .
' She was too independent and she had to die for it , ' said the prosecutor .
He returned to Germany at the end of 2008 , killing her on New Year`s Eve because , he claimed , she had turned up the car stereo when he tried to speak to her .
She had also given him an incorrect PIN three times when he tried to check the calls on her mobile phone , and she had refused to answer him when he asked whether she had been unfaithful .
I wish I had a time machine .
I would n't use it to place bets on sports teams , or see what my folks were like in high school .
No , I 'd go back a mere three months ago and tell my past - self to avoid all pop culture and television for the next three months .
That way , I 'd have no idea who the hell Jon and Kate Gosselin are and I could get on with my life .
The mere fact that the Gosselins are sharing space with the dramatic events in Iran is mind - numbingly scary .
We should n't be concerned that the parents of eight children are going through marital difficulties .
I had the misfortune of being involved ( indirectly ) in a " Flinstones Meet the Jetsons " type of television program crossover when the Gosselins invaded one of my favorite shows : American Chopper .
I understand the promotional value of having stars of one high - rated show appear on another , but all it made me realize was how little I 'd enjoy watching Jon and Kate Plus 8.
I can't be sure what went down , privately , in the marriage between Jon and Kate .
Through the glory of editing , we 're made to assume certain things and cast aspersions about certain people .
Here is what I gathered from my one and only experience of seeing the Gosselins on American Chopper : if that were my wife , I 'd wear ear - plugs .
Leaving the Flock of Seagulls haircut out of it , Kate Gosselin comes across as a whining control - freak .
She belittles her husband in front of the kids ( and cameras ) and seems to revel in her new - found status as the most popular person in America .
Jon , on the other hand , seems like a relaxed guy .
The type of person I would n't mind getting a few brews with and watching a game .
But he is a man suppressed .
A man beaten into quite silence and reflection .
I actually feel bad for him .
He obviously loves his kids ( they both do ) , but there seems to be a fading glimmer of light in his eyes that says , " this was not what I expected .
" Divorce sucks , and whatever their big announcement turns out to be on Monday , I hate to see a marriage and family fall apart .
But perhaps the entire world does n't need a front - row seat to watch the destruction .
Maybe this intensely private time needs to be just that , not one that 's edited to have cliff - hangers before commercial breaks .
I wo n't watch the show on Monday .
I do n't like hanging out with my own family , so why the hell would I want to spend time with someone else 's that 's four - times as large ?
FRANKFURT ( Reuters ) - Porsche SE ’s controlling families will agree on Thursday to accept an offer by Volkswagen to buy its sports car business Porsche AG for roughly 8 billion euros ( $ 11.28 billion ) , Der Spiegel reported on Saturday .

Germany ’s leading weekly magazine wrote that the rival Porsche and Piech clans , which own 100 percent of Porsche SE votes , will approve the two - stage takeover at a supervisory board meeting on July 23 .
Volkswagen would purchase a 49.9 percent stake in Porsche AG and at a later date acquire the rest , in a deal that would create an integrated automotive group with 10 brands under the leadership of the Wolfsburg - based carmaker .
The sale would help Porsche SE pay off most of its debt , which two sources told Reuters has ballooned to considerably more than 10 billion euros .
Der Spiegel also said embattled Porsche SE and Porsche AG Chief Executive Wendelin Wiedeking is negotiating over a severance package that could total more than 100 million euros .
In the meantime , production chief Michael Macht will replace him as head of Porsche AG , the magazine reported .
On Thursday , Wiedeking rejected speculation he was about to leave the group .
Asked on Saturday whether the two families have reached a decision for the July 23 board meeting , Porsche spokesman Anton Hunger said “ we have not been informed of one , ” adding that the Spiegel report was speculation that the company would not comment on .
Separately rival German weekly magazine Focus reported that Volkswagen ’s powerful chairman and part - owner of Porsche , Ferdinand Piech , plans to remove Wiedeking on Thursday from the influential six - man steering committee on the VW supervisory board .
The vacancy could open up the opportunity for Piech ’s cousin and rival , Wolfgang Porsche , VW supervisory board member and Porsche SE chairman , to replace Wiedeking in the committee as a representative of his side of the family .
The grandfather of Wolfgang Porsche and Ferdinand Piech was Ferdinand Porsche , designer of the Beetle and founder of Volkswagen .

A recent Fox News piece on President Obama ’s “ science czar , ” John Holdren , makes for spooky reading , dramatizing where well - intended intellectuals can end up when they take a zero - sum view of our planet ’s resources .
In a 1977 course book that Holdren co-authored with environmental activists Paul and Anne Ehrlich , the three make an extended case for aggressive global population control .
As the Fox News article explains :
Holdren and the Ehrlichs offer ideas for “ coercive , ” “ involuntary fertility control , ” including “ a program of sterilizing women after their second or third child , ” which doctors would be expected to do right after a woman gives birth .
“ Unfortunately , ” they write , “ such a program therefore is not practical for most less developed countries , ” where doctors are not often present when a woman is in labor .
The article provides a pdf of the relevant pages of the 1977 course book ( go here ) .
Reading these several pages makes it difficult to take seriously a statement by Holdren ’s office that Dr. Holdren “ does not now support and has never supported compulsory abortions , compulsory sterilization , or other coercive approaches to limiting population growth . ”
At best , a passage at the end of 788 and the beginning of 789 suggests that the three authors would happily opt for less coercive measures , provided those measures work to their satisfaction .
Holdren and the Ehrlichs are not alone .
There ’s a long history , dating back at least to the 1700s , of doomsters insisting that population growth coupled with a scarcity of natural resources will very soon ruin civilization .
What ’s behind this pessimism , a pessimism apparently immune to contrary historical evidence ?
In Acton ’s new Effective Stewardship DVD curriculum , soon to be released by Zondervan ( go here ) , Acton president Rev. Robert Sirico puts the matter in philosophical and theological context .
There he argues that the problem is rooted in a false anthropology , one in which the doctrine of the imago dei is eclipsed , and with it the powerful role of human creativity :
There are many people , including religious leaders , who say that the essential problem is a problem of resource , and that if it ’s a problem of resource then it ’s a problem of population .
This is what I call humaniphobia .
The image in the humaniphobe ’s mind is that the human person is one big mouth that is constantly ingesting , and then polluting .
On such a view , humans are the problem rather than the solution .
The takeaway question is this :
Do we really want to hand our health care over to the U.S. government when a science adviser like Holdren has the president ’s ear ?
The government rejected advice from its expert advisers on swine flu , who said there was no need for the widespread use of Tamiflu and suggested that the public should simply be told to take paracetamol .
An independent panel set up by the Department of Health warned ministers that plans to make the stockpiled drug widely available could do more harm than good , by helping the flu virus to develop resistance to the drug .
But ministers pressed ahead with a policy of mass prescription , fearing the public would not tolerate being told that the millions of doses of Tamiflu held by the state could not be used during a pandemic , one of the committee members has told the Guardian .
" It was felt ... it would simply be unacceptable to the UK population to tell them we had a huge stockpile of drugs but they were not going to be made available , " Professor Robert Dingwall , a member of the Committee on Ethical Aspects of Pandemic Influenza , said .
Today one of the country 's foremost flu experts called for the national helpline to be shut down to stop hundreds of thousands of doses of Tamiflu going out in an unregulated way , which could render it useless when a more dominant strain returns in the autumn .
As it became clear that the current outbreak only had mild symptoms , the committee recommended that antivirals should only be given to those in high risk categories , like pregnant women or people with existing respiratory illnesses .
It suggested the government explain to people that they would not be given medicine they did not need and should use off - the- shelf flu treatments .
" There were discussions within the Health Protection Authority and the Department of Health , once it became clear that swine flu was a relatively mild infection , about whether to reserve antivirals for high - risk groups and to advise the general population to treat themselves with paracetamol or ibuprofen , " said Dingwall , director of the Institute for Science and Society at Nottingham University .
" Some people wanted to take a long - term view of the risk of resistance developing and to seek to preserve the effectiveness of antivirals for the next pandemic , which may be more severe . "
Last month , the government launched the national pandemic flu service which authorised more than 511,000 courses of Tamiflu and Relenza treatment during its first fortnight in operation .
Oxford University researchers have warned that antivirals are not a " magic bullet " against flu , and that resistance to the drug could develop , making it useless to fight any future and potentially more serious pandemic flu strain .
The concern was seconded by flu expert Hugh Pennington , emeritus professor at Aberdeen University , who called for the national flu line to be shut down .
" I am concerned about the vast amount of Tamiflu that is going out almost unregulated , " he told the Guardian .
" We are increasing the possibility that the flu will become resistant sooner or later .
At the moment there is no desperate need for Tamiflu .
We should be reconsidering its issue , rather than encouraging its use .
" I think we should stop the national pandemic flu service .
It was put there for an outbreak of far higher mortality than we have .
If you get a resistant strain that becomes dominant in the autumn , Tamiflu will then be useless . "
A senior government adviser , Prof Peter Openshaw , said the government was told during the early stages of the current outbreak of the " significant side effects " that Tamiflu was causing in some people .
" I think there was , in some quarters , a slight over - optimism about the acceptability of prophylactic medication and its effectiveness , " said Openshaw , a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies .
" Maybe some of the less clinical scientific advisers perhaps slightly over - inflated expectations of the ease and efficiency of antiviral treatment .
Many of us who do clinical work and are clinically trained had a bit more of a jaundiced view of how things may turn out . "
Openshaw said antivirals were effective only if used within 36 to 48 hours of symptoms developing .
" If the treatment is delayed they are relatively ineffective .
" On the other hand , we do have this large stockpile available and I think there is an advantage in trying to treat cases early , in order to reduce the severity and the number of patients who end up needing hospital care . "
Such a policy could " blunt " a spike of cases , reducing pressure on health resources , he said .
The pandemic ethical committee was set up at the request of Sir Liam Donaldson , the chief medical officer , to assist planners and policy makers with ethical aspects of decisions they face in a pandemic , such as how to allocate scarce drugs when many people are sick .
At its last meeting in May , when it was already becoming clear that the current H1N1 strain was causing a relatively mild disease in most people , the committee discussed the government 's antiviral strategy .
Members feared that the widespread use of antivirals in the current outbreak was incompatible with the principle of minimising harm , minutes from the meeting show .
The current outbreak did not alter the risk of a more serious flu pandemic developing in the future .
There would be ethical concerns if the blanket use of antivirals compromised their effectiveness in the future .
Members said it was important to use antivirals in the most appropriate way , not just because the government had a stockpile of the drugs .
The committee called on the government to explain to the public that they were no cure for flu .
The committee concluded that it would be appropriate to offer antivirals as treatment only for those in risk groups , or with underlying conditions .
In a statement , the Department of Health said : " Protecting the public is the prime concern of our strategy , which has been shaped by advice from the most eminent specialists from the beginning .
" There is still doubt about how swine flu affects people – a safety - first approach is the best approach .
This means offering antivirals when required .
However , we will keep this policy under review as we learn more about the virus and its effects .
This is in line with the views of both the Committee on Ethical Aspects of Pandemic Influenza and of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies .
WASHINGTON -- Former Vice President Dick Cheney hinted that , in the waning days of the Bush administration , he had pushed for a military strike to destroy Iran 's nuclear - weapons program .
In an interview on Fox News Sunday , Mr. Cheney described himself as being isolated among advisers to then - President George W. Bush , who ultimately decided against direct military action .

Cucumber is a great tool I usually use for BDD in my ruby projects , but yesterday I tried it with Flex , and it was very enjoyable .
Here a little example on how to test Flex applications with Cucumber .
First of all you need ruby , then you need to install the following gems :
sudo gem install rspec cucumber watir safariwatir funfx
( I used the following codes on mac os x , with ruby 1.8.6 , safari 4.0.3 and funx 0.2.2 )
After that open Flex Builder and create a new project called CucumberExample and use the following code for your main mxml file : 0
As you can see , we have a number , 2 buttons and a label .
Now create a directory called features inside your flex project folder and create the first Cucumber feature file , called counter : CucumberExample / features / counter .
feature : Feature : Counter
In order to count something
As a flex rock star I want to use my great flex app
Scenario : Increment index Given I open my flex app
And I click the increment button
Then the label text should be " 1 " When I click the decrement button
Then the label text should be " 0 "
When I click the decrement button
Then the label text should be " - 1 "
It 's a test written in pure plain text .
In the features folder create another folder called step_definitions with a blank file called counter_steps.rb , we 'll use it later .
Now open the console , go the to flex project root and run your test :
cd / path / to/CucumberExample cucumber features
You should see something like this :
... 1 scenario ( 1 undefined ) 7 steps ( 7 undefined ) 0m0.002s
You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets :
Given / ^I open my flex app$ / do pending end Given / ^I click the increment button$ / do pending end Then / ^the label text should be " ( [ ^ \ " ] * ) " $ / do |arg1 | pending end When / ^I click the decrement button$ / do pending end
Before implementing the steps above , we need to add the funfx component to our library .
Download the latest swc file from rubyforge and place it in your CucumberExample / libs folder ( I used the version 0.2.2 ) .
Duplicate the bin-debug folder and rename it to test ( you have a bin-debug folder after the first time you run the CucumberExample from FlexBuilder ) .
Inside the test directory create a file called test_server.rb with the following content :
require ' webrick ' server = WEBrick ::HTTPServer.new : Port => 9852 , :DocumentRoot => File.dirname( __FILE__ ) trap ( " INT " ) { server .
shutdown } server.start
Now you need a compiled version of your project that includes funfx .
We 'll use it just for testing :
build_test.sh
#!/bin/sh FLEX_SDK_HOME= " / Applications / Adobe Flex Builder 3/sdks/3.2.0 " " $ FLEX_SDK_HOME/bin/mxmlc " -verbose - stacktraces - include - libraries ./libs/funfx-0.2.2.swc
" $ FLEX_SDK_HOME/frameworks/libs/automation.swc "
" $ FLEX_SDK_HOME/frameworks/libs/automation_dmv.swc "
" $ FLEX_SDK_HOME/frameworks/libs/automation_agent.swc " - output ./test/CucumberExample.swf
-- ./src/CucumberExample.mxml
Run test compile_test.sh
chmod 755 ./build_test.sh ./build_test.sh
Now open another terminal window and start the test server :
cd / path/to/CucumberExample/test ruby test_server.rb
Open http://localhost:9852/CucumberExample.html with your browser and you should see your flex app .
Now you can come back to your features and implement the step we leave before .
Here my implementation :
CucumberExample / features/step_definitions/counter_steps.rb
Given / ^I open my flex app$ / do open_flex_app end Given / ^I click the ( increment|decrement ) button$ / do | button| click_button ( " button#{button.capitalize} " ) end Then / ^the label text should be " ( [ ^ \ " ] * ) " $ / do |text| label_text .
should == text end
open_flex_app , click_button and label_text are methods defined in my env.rb file .
CucumberExample / features / support / env.rb
require " rubygems " require ' funfx/browser/safariwatir ' module FlexWorld def open_flex_app @browser.goto ( " http://localhost:9852/CucumberExample.html " ) end def click_button ( button_id ) @flex_app.button ( :id => button_id ) .click end def label_text @flex_app.label ( : id => " myLabel " ) .
text end end Before do @browser = Watir:: Safari.new @flex_app = @browser.flex_app( " CucumberExample " , " CucumberExample " ) end After do @browser.
close end World ( FlexWorld )
Now you are ready to run your tests .
Start the test_server and then the features .
You should have an error :
Then the label text should be " 1 " # features / step_definitions/counter_steps.rb:9 expected : " 1 " , got : " 0 " ( using == )
This because we did n't implement the functionality yet in our flex app .
So , change the mxml file with the following :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " utf - 8 " ?> < mx:Application xmlns:mx = " http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml " layout = " absolute " > < mx : Number id =" index " >0</mx: Number > < mx:VBox width = " 300 " height = " 200 " backgroundColor = " white " > < mx:HBox width = " 100 % " height = " 30 " > < mx:Button id =" buttonDecrement " label= " - " width = " 100 % " click = " index - - " /> < mx:Button id =" buttonIncrement " label= " + " width = " 100 % " click = " index + + " /> </mx:HBox > < mx:HBox width = " 100 % " height = " 100 % " verticalAlign = " middle " horizontalAlign=" center " > < mx : Label id =" myLabel " text = " {index} " / > </mx:HBox > </mx:VBox > </ mx:Application >
It 's the same code but I added the click action to the increment and decrement buttons .
Now compile the new code and run the features again :
./build_test.sh cucumber features
You shoiuld have the following output , with all the seven steps passed :
Feature : Counter
In order to count something
As a flex rock star I want to use my great flex app Scenario : Increment index # features / counter .
feature : 6
Given I open my flex app # features / step_definitions/counter_steps.rb:1
And I click the increment button # features / step_definitions/counter_steps.rb:5
Then the label text should be " 1 " # features / step_definitions/counter_steps.rb:9
When I click the decrement button # features / step_definitions/counter_steps.rb:5
Then the label text should be " 0 " # features / step_definitions/counter_steps.rb:9
When I click the decrement button # features / step_definitions/counter_steps.rb:5
Then the label text should be " - 1 " # features / step_definitions/counter_steps.rb:9 1 scenario ( 1 passed ) 7 steps ( 7 passed ) 0m9.781s
If you have any problems you may want to clear the cache from safari .
I used the funfx gem from rubyforge but it 's not up to date .
If you want you can get the new code from github , it should have new features .
Ten year old punched and burnt by actress in Mumbai
A man-eater leopard was killed in Uttarakhand ’s Pithoragarh by hunter on September 30 .
Forest Department instructed the hunter to do the same following multiple incidents of attack .
The leopard had attacked and severely injured locals in the area .
Forrest official said , “ Leopard was spotted and killed at a distance of 300 meter from the location where the first incident took place . ”
A few days ago this video was uploaded to YouTube .
It 's a two - month old kitten that has suddenly become the well - known eyebrow cat ( 眉毛猫 or mayugeneko ) .
My translation of most the video is below .
Title :
Cat with worried - looking eyebrows
So what could it be ?
0:20 A cat with eyebrows .
Yes , it looks like it 's worried about something .
0:28 Try touching the cat and yes , they 're definitely real .
0:35 Shizuoka prefecture 's submission for Chinhyakukei ( the name of the show ) : a cat with eyebrows that looks worried about something .
( Name : Maro-chan .
Female , 2 months old . )
This cat is Maro - chan , just two months old .... does n't seem to know how her eyebrows got to look this way ...
1:00 Interview with dad : I was really opposed to getting the cat when we got it .
Q : Ah , you were opposed to it in the beginning ?
A : Yeah , because I really hate cats .
Q : You hate ...
A : Yeah , and when I saw this cat I just loved her .
Right that moment my hate turned to love .
It felt more like destiny than the first meeting with my mom .
Then a final comment saying the same thing , and then the people on the panel joke about how the cat always looks like she 's running around saying she 's sorry for everything , and how important these eyebrows are if they can change a person that hates cats into one that loves them .
And just in case you 're at a workplace that does n't allow YouTube on the job , here 's a screenshot of Maro- chan .

The British government is being sued for the first time over its complicity in the operation of the CIA rendition program .
A former detainee at Guantanamo Bay , now living back in Pakistan , claims the CIA plane that took him to be interrogated in Egypt stopped to refuel on the British island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean , where the U.S. has an air base .
Mohamed Saad Iqbal Madni is filing a lawsuit in the High Court in London that alleges the stopover makes the British complicit in the torture he received at the hands of the Egyptians and Americans – and , moreover , the British government now has a duty to help him win justice .
Madni says he was first beaten up , tied in chains , and then packed on a Gulfstream jet in a wooden box when he was picked up in Jan. 2002 in Jakarta , Indonesia .
He says he was still bleeding from his nose , mouth and ears when the plane touched down to refuel six or seven hours into the flight .
After the stopover , flight records show the plane went on to Cairo , where Madni says he was badly tortured .
He told the BBC World Service , " When I arrived in Egypt I was blindfolded and left in a room ... they interrogated me three times .
Each was for 17 hours and they electrocuted me in my knees .
And they asked if I knew Osama Bin Laden or went to Afghanistan or if I met Richard Reid or knew anything about a shoe bomb or future attacks . "
Madni was accused of being an Al Qaeda operative and of plotting attacks on U.S. officials .
He was released last year from Guantanamo , where he had attempted suicide , and returned to his native Pakistan , where he now lives .
His lawsuit is being filed on his behalf by a British legal charity , Reprieve , that has represented many inmates at Guantanamo Bay .
Reprieve claims to have worked out that it was Madni who landed on the island by analysing statements made by the British government .
Island of Diego Garcia
Ever since 2002 , news reports have alleged the CIA was using Diego Garcia as a secret site to hold terror suspects , either in a prison or to transport them .
The British Government was always pretty strong and sharp in denying all that .
But they based their firm denials on what the Americans told them , until the U.S. changed its position .
Last February , British Foreign Secretary , David Miliband , was forced to make what was quite an embarrassing statement that two planes – rendition flights - did in fact stop there , each with one prisoner .
From its database of the records of prisoners held at Guantanamo and comparing them to the details released by Miliband , Reprieve claimed it worked out that Madni was one of the two prisoners involved .
It will deploy the legal argument that since torture is a crime , the British government needs to do everything in its power to help its victims seek justice from the perpetrators .
Reprieve successfully deployed the same legal argument last year to force the British government to release its files on a British resident , Binyam Mohamed , then held at Guantanamo , and to secure his release .
Speaking of the Madni case , Clive Stafford Smith , legal director , of Reprieve told the BBC program , " I would defy the British government to deny that we are right . "
He said , " The issue for Britain is that Diego Garcia is a British territory , we 're responsible for it and what happens on it ... the Americans are meant to tell us what they are doing and we , as supervisor of Diego Garcia , have a responsibility to make sure that crimes do not happen on it . "
The British Foreign Office said it could not comment in detail because of the pending legal action .
But , in a statement , they said that while the movement of prisoners through UK territory without permission was " concerning … .
it did not mean that the UK has been complicit in torture . "

The TPM article in question is here .
It provides screen shots of Twitter traffic from " ScottEO " ( apparently Scott Oskay ) which read :
If ACORN / SEIU attends these meetings for disruptive purposes , and you have a license to carry ... carry .
and
If ACORN / SEIU attends these townhalls for disruption , stop being peaceful and hurt them .
Badly #iamthemob
( TPM explains a bit about the #iamthemob tag , but I 'd certainly welcome further explanation from anyone who grasps its significance . )
But the significance of a request to people to arm themselves , and to be ready
to use those weapons to inflict violence on others at these meetings , is unmistakable .
I very much hope his advice is disregarded , and equally hope that security staff at these meetings are highly vigilant .
I fear this wo n't end well .
Update 1 : In the comments , the girl notes that TPM has updated their site ; it looks like the current link to TPM 's coverage is Anti-Health Care Reform Protester Encourages Physical Violence , Use Of Firearms .
There 's also now a link to it from their home page .
Thanks !
Update 2 : I 've just woken up to find this message in my gmail inbox :
From : " jeff childress " childress@lycos.com
Subject : SEIU
The violence was started last night BY SEIU , here in St. Louis !!
Punched a black
conservitive handing out ' Do n't tread on me ' flags , all on tape , so get your
facts straight .
The SEIU thugs will do you Dem 's well .
Keep stirring the pot .
Its fun to watch ....
What my new quasi- literate friend ( should n't it be a requirement that to hold a political philosophy , you should at least be able to spell it ? ) is apparently referring to , based on 20 minutes of quick searching , is an alleged incident that is all over Fox " news " and similar propaganda sites but does not seem to be present on actual news sites , including the St. Louis Post - Dispatch .
Perhaps , if this actually happened , it 'll turn up later today .
Of course , I do n't espouse violence of any kind , but I think it 's worth pointing out that even if this did happen -- and as yet I see no credible evidence that it did -- a punch is not the same as a bullet .
It 's also worth pointing out that full responsibility for the escalation going on here rests with the Becks and Limbaughs of the world , and the pitifully gullible fools who follow them : these are the people who are trying to turn a discussion into a brawl .
Retailers have told Eurogamer that Microsoft will increase the price of the Arcade Xbox 360 bundle to £ 159.99 ( from £ 129.99 ) starting 1st September .
The five XBLA games will no longer be included in the bundle , either .
ShopTo boss Igor Cipolletta received confirmation from Microsoft this morning , as did a corroborating independent retail chain source .
We 're also told that Microsoft will bump the price of individual Xbox 360 accessories by one or two pounds .
Our independent retail source said this is being done to counteract the poor pound - to - Euro currency exchange rate .
Furthermore , the email from Microsoft to retailers mentioned only Arcade and Elite bundles .
This strengthens rumours that the Premium Xbox 360 bundle is being discontinued .
Last week PySide was launched , the team was glad to see the project finally go public and receive the community feedback , be it positive , negative or both .
Many questions arose , like “ Why duplicate efforts ? ”
Well , I ca n’t say much more than what is already answered on PySide FAQ .
For us ( the team ) the fact is that we had a task to accomplish and must perform it the best we can .
That said , allow me to remind you that this is my personal blog and many of the views here written are my very own cherished opinion .
The other question that we ’re waiting for , and my personal favorite , was “ Why Boost .
Python ? ” .
Though one .
First of all , Boost .
Python eases very much the creation of C++ libraries bindings for Python .
How to infer which method signature to call based on the Python arguments passed to the method wrapper ?
Boost .
Python will take care of it .
Inheritance ?
Type conversion ( in opposition to type wrapping ) ?
You bet : Boost .
Python will take care of all this for you .
The feature full Boost .
Python gave us a great kick start and at first we progressed very fast .
Occasionally some strange bug appeared and took some time to figure out the problem through the jungle of template error messages .
Part of the job anyhow , and after that : fast pace again .
At some point somebody checked the size of the produced binary modules .
“ Hey guys , is that correct ? ” , “ Ah , just strip the file . ” , “ Still huge . ” , “ Holy cow … ” .
Next task : size reduction .
Some redesigns reduced a good deal of megabytes , g++ flags were also helpful , but these things were n’t enough .
Then a new idea : “ Let ’s try it with the Intel C++ compiler and see what gives . ”
It gave binary modules with feasible sizes .
Good , but the test just proved that it was possible to achieve the reductions .
Besides , there were still other new ideas to try , and the fact that as soon as the project was launched the community would step in and say “ I had this size problem with Boost .
Python before .
Here is how I solved it … ” .
( Which reminds me how limited , communication wise , a project is in its non-open phase .
And do n’t point your finger , mister — for every open source project has it ’s non-open phase , even in your head ! )
Part of the team was growing skeptical about the size reduction problem .
Why not to try CPython code generation right now ?
Well , some say you ca n’t change the plane ’s motor while flying , and this is true .
Feature wise we were almost there and the reduction was possible .
Also some of us had mixed feelings about CPython .
In a past project a comparison was made about writing bindings with different technologies , including CPython , to check for speed , size and the burden imposed on the developer .
At the end the guy with CPython had good numbers ( not stunningly better than the others , at least for the case that mattered back then ) , but his personal impression was that he was suffering the Stockholm syndrome : he knew CPython abused him , but he developed a bond with his kidnapper .
Still , almost every one started personal ( and voluntary , aka “ made at home ” ) experimentation with different CPython generators ( even a ctypes one ! ) , and in the end all the ideas ( including the ones from the Boost .
Python generator ) were merged into a single CPython generator , called Shiboken .
Shiboken
Before going on with this , allow me to explain that Shiboken means absolutely nothing .
Not buddhist void , I just mean that the word Shiboken has no meaning attached to it .
Except , of course , “ generator of CPython based binding code for C/ C++ libraries ” .
死
某
剣
Disclaimer : I do n’t know a thing about Japanese language and the above kanjis are just something that I found at wikitionary to match the sounds of Shiboken .
Forgive me , Lauro . 🙂
The conspirators ’ plan was to develop the alternative generator to a point that could generate PySide bindings that pass all our unit tests , run the apps , etc , thus beign able to replace the Boost .
Python front - end .
For PySide users , i.e .
Python programmers , the replacement would bring no impact , since the API should remain the same .
The Shiboken generator is based on the same principles of the Boost .
Python one : built using the API Extractor library , how the C++ library should be exported to Python is described on a Type System file , and so on .
When Shiboken reached a point that we ’d think was good enough to start working with it at work , we presented it to our bosses and the green light was given .
The Boost .
Python generator will continue as the tool to generate the official PySide bindings , but with the parallel efforts we hope that Shiboken takes its place , the size reduction is achieved , and the Occam ’s razor cut off the unnecessary entities .
C/C++ Bindings
Another fix that we aim to achieve with Shiboken is to allow non-Qt C++ and C libraries to be wrapped with the generator scheme .
The problem with the current Boost .
Python generator is that even a non-Qt library wrapped with it will depend on Qt .
Of course this is not the best we can do , but the fixing task had low priority since the PySide bindings are the main target of the work .
For Shiboken we make it library agnostic from the start , specially because we do not get our chances trying to wrap the whole Qt from start : a test library with all the problems that could arise was made and is the source of all Shiboken unit tests .
Shiboken Features Worth Noting
Abandoning Boost .
Python means abandoning some features already provided by it .
One that is worth mentioning is the decision of which signature of a method should be called depending on the Python arguments passed on the call .
For this to work we have to write a decisor that progressively checks the argument types until the correct signature is found .
Just this ?
Of course not , the binding developer can use the Type System description to remove method signatures , remove / change the type of its arguments , even remove / change / set its default values !
The method call decisor must take everything into account .
No Boost .
Python also means that would be harder to convert types and containers back and forth between C++ and Python .
The template specialization technique was used to solve this one .
template <> struct Converter < bool > { static PyObject * to Python( ValueHolder<bool > holder ) { return PyBool_FromLong( holder.value ) ; } static bool toCpp ( PyObject * pyobj ) { return pyobj == Py_True ; } } ;
Why not generating “ pyobj == Py_True ” directly , you say ?
The above code scales better , since it will be the same for types that are composed of some primitive types inside containers inside containers , etc .
Besides , the compiler could be counted on to inline short methods .
“ They have a plan ”
Right now Hugo ( from PySide fame ) started working on generating bare QtCore bindings without QObject and signals , then go to QObject .
After that we should solve the signals problem , re-write the pieces of custom code and so on .
I think after QtCore is completely done we can make a comparison with the one produced by the Boost .
Python generator and see if the whole Shiboken idea can stand to its promise .
The best should win for the honor and glory of open source .
We encourage everyone interested in the creation of Python bindings for C++ libraries to test Shiboken , report problems ( we now have a component on OpenBossa bugzilla ! ) , and tell us if something is missing for your library to work .
Patches are always welcome as usual . 🙂

Seeing the cosmos through ' warm ' infrared eyes

NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope has taken its first shots of the cosmos since warming up and starting its second career .
The infrared telescope ran out of coolant on May 15 , 2009 , more than five - and - half - years after launch , and has since warmed to a still - frosty 30 Kelvin ( about minus 406 Fahrenheit ) .
New images taken with two of Spitzer 's infrared detector channels -- the two that work at the new warmer temperature -- demonstrate that the observatory remains a powerful tool for probing the dusty universe .
The images show a bustling star - forming region , the pretty remains of a star like the sun , and a swirling galaxy lined with stars .
" Spitzer continues to provide us with a unique view of stars , galaxies and planets , " said Spitzer Project Scientist Michael Werner , NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif .
" We 're thrilled to see Spitzer up and running again , and continuing to provide such spectacular images , " added astronomer Giovanni Fazio of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics .
" This new lease on life is a testament to a well - designed spacecraft . "
The first of three images shows a cloud bursting with stars in the Cygnus region of our Milky Way galaxy .
Spitzer 's infrared eyes both peer through and see dust , revealing young stars tucked in dusty nests .
A second image shows a nearby dying star -- a planetary nebula called NGC 4361 -- whose outer layers expand outward in the rare form of four jets .
And a final picture is of a classic spiral beauty , a galaxy called NGC 4145 located 68 million light - years from Earth .
" With Spitzer 's remaining shorter - wavelength bands , we can continue to see through the dust in galaxies and get a better look at the overall populations of stars , " said Robert Hurt imaging specialist for Spitzer at NASA 's Spitzer Science Center , California Institute of Technology .
" All stars are equal in the infrared . "
Since its launch from Cape Canaveral , Fla. , on August 25 , 2003 , Spitzer has made countless discoveries : planet - forming disks around stars , the composition of the material making up comets , hidden black holes , galaxies billions of light - years away and more .
Perhaps the most revolutionary and surprising Spitzer finds involve planets around other stars , called exoplanets .
In 2005 , Spitzer detected the first actual photons of light from an exoplanet .
In a clever technique , now referred to as the secondary - eclipse method , Spitzer was able to collect the light of a hot , gaseous exoplanet and learn about its temperature .
Further detailed studies later revealed more about the composition and structure of the atmospheres of these exotic worlds .
Warm Spitzer will address many of the same science questions as before , while tackling new projects , such as : refining estimates of Hubble 's constant , or the rate at which our universe is stretching apart ; searching for galaxies at the edge of the universe ; characterizing more than 700 near - Earth objects , or asteroids and comets with orbits that pass close to our planet ; and studying the atmospheres of gas - giant planets expected to be discovered soon by NASA 's Kepler mission .
As was true during the cold Spitzer mission , these and the other programs are selected via a competition in which scientists from around the world are invited to participate .
Spitzer officially began its warm science mission on July 27 , 2009 .
The new pictures were taken while the telescope was being re-commissioned , on July 18 ( NGC 4145 , NGC 4361 ) and July 21 ( Cygnus ) .

Report from the Kidnapped Passengers in Ramle Prison , July 4 , 2009
On Monday , June 30 , 21 passengers going to challenge the blockade of Gaza on board the Spirit of Humanity were seized by the Israeli Navy and taken to Israel against their will .
All their equipment was taken and some of were roughed up .
All were thrown into prison to await Israel ’s decision on how and when they would be deported .
The majority of the group ended up in Ramle Prison .
Those of us who are Free Gaza organizers had been hearing some news from them , statements , interviews and letters since they arrived .
From the first night , the Free Gaza 21 have been busy trying to get news out of the prison about the illegality of Israel ’s actions in relation to themselves and the other inmates inside Ramle Prison who have no voice .
Report from E : I received a 2 am phone call during one of the first sleepless nights from Ramle Prison to let me know that in one of the cells , four of the FG group had been busy writing a press release on an old phone one of their cellmates had loaned them .
It had taken them hours to write the press release .
but they were just ready to send it out , and ‘ could I check my email to see if I had received it ? ’
Since that first night I have been hearing more increasingly about the plight of the other inmates of the prison ; men and women who have not nearly as good an opportunity as our folk for media coverage of their stories and not nearly as good an opportunity as our folk of ever getting out of Ramle Prison .
To Fathi Jaouadi , Adie Mormesh , Ishmael Blagrove , and Captain Denis Healy , the situation of their fellow inmates is something they want to talk about and act upon .
Fathi wanted to pass on news of what they have been doing inside Ramle prison ; he wanted to let everyone who supports the Free Gaza Movement know that ‘ Free Gaza Members are never lost for things to do when it comes to trying to expose Israel ’s appalling treatment of not just Palestinians , but all people who come to Palestine and get caught up in Israel ’s abuse of justice and the law . ’
Fathi Jaouadi has been actively involved in Palestinian rights since he was 15 years old .
Now in Ramle prison , he has already managed to organize a meeting with a UN representative and to raise the issue of the other inmates with him .
He said that the UN official has agreed to follow up on some of the cases ; Fathi has also been in contact with local NGO ’s to raise the issue of many of the inmate ’s situations .
He told me he wants to focus on the fact that none of the inmates have any access to legal advice or help , most of the inmates have not been able to contact family to let them know of their situation and none of the inmates have committed anything that warrants them to be held indefinitely inside Ramle prison .
Fathi is in the process of collecting statements from all the inmates , and he is translating them from Arabic .
He says the majority of the inmates in their cell are from Arab countries , and they have not had access to their embassy officials .
He will follow up with the UN and other organizations once he is released , contact all the families and give statements and details to the relevant embassies .
Ishmael Blagrove is a well - known documentary filmmaker and has been speaking extensively about the Palestinian struggle for more than twenty years .
In Ramle prison , he has been working tirelessly to get contact with refugee councils and organizations in Britain to present to them the case of the refugees inside .
He says that many of the men from neighbouring Arab countries just want to go home , they do n’t want to stay in Israel and yet they are not being given the opportunity to speak .
Ishmael says that many of the inmates are entitled to legal representation , but they do not know this , nor do they have any idea how to contact any refugee organization to advise them .
Ishmael is in the process of establishing links between the refugee councils in Britain and the inmates of his cell in Ramle Prison .
Fathi and Ishmael have already established channels to publish these issues in Britain on their release .
When we called Ramle Prison today Fathi said that Adie had just finished his daily English lesson with the inmates .
Adie is reportedly very happy with the progress of his students and said this morning they had successfully completed an intense session on Past Participles .
Adie Mormesh has also been very active for the rights of Palestinians for many years .
He spent two weeks in the West Bank with the Olive Coop ( Zeitoun ) and Action Palestine in 2007 .
He worked with and documented the Boycott , Divestment and Sanction Campaign and participated in the World Social Forums for Palestine in Porto Alegre and Mumbai in 2003 and 2004 .
He has now become a teacher of English in Ramle prison .
Captain Denis Healey who has been the Free Gaza Movement ’s captain since October 2008 and bravely steered the DIGNITY to safety in December when she was attacked by the Israeli Navy at sea , has also been quite busy ; he has been giving in - depth lectures to his fellow inmates about life at sea .
Apparently there are many interested parties amongst the inmates ; some hope that they may pursue a life on the sea when ( and sadly if ) they ever get out .
They are full of questions as to the procedure of getting qualified to work on and sail boats in the Mediterranean , and Captain Denis is giving them a good run down on what they should do to follow such a dream .
This is how four of our passengers have been keeping busy during the past week , they wanted to let you all know ; they also said they realize the news they are sending out is not new to any of us .
We have all been working with these issues of injustice for years .
But that does n’t mean that every new story about the violation of human rights , about the cruelty , brutality and flagrant misuse of justice by Israel should not be published .
Our friends are stuck in Ramle prison , because they tried to visit the war - stricken people of Gaza , and they are furious at what they are seeing .
They know they have generated media interest around the world , and that sooner or later , they will leave Ramle Prison , but they also know that the other inmates of the prison have no such privilege , and without our interest in them , they could well be stuck inside Ramle prison for the rest of their lives , or exiled to some foreign country that is not their home , facing a life without family or loved ones to share it with .
And so it is for the 11,000 Palestinian prisoners at present inside Israeli jails .
Every one of them has a story that ought to be heard .
Statement # 1 taken by Fathi Jaouadi .
From Ramle Prison , 3rd July 2009 .
My name is M .
I am 26 years old .
I am a Palestinian born in Al Quds and I hold a birth certificate showing this .
My family comes from a village called Sour Bahr .
We have two houses there owned by my grandfather who fled in ’ 48 to Jordan and left the houses with my Aunt .
When I was 5 years old I went with my family to Jordan to bring back the papers that proved our ownership of these two houses .
We stayed in Jordan for 2 years and then , when we had all the papers we came back to Sour Bahr .
I lived all my life in one of the houses and some of my family lived in the other .
We always used to make our way between our two houses which were only minutes apart from each other .
However when the Wall was built , it split our two houses apart .
It used to take minutes and then it took 4 ½ hours to go from house to house .
The house I lived in was in the West Bank , the other on the side of the Wall that is Al Quds .
When I was 16 I began the process to try and obtain Israeli ID so that I could continue to enter Al Quds and go to our house that was on the other side of the Wall .
Every day my mother would go to the Interior Ministry to try and obtain my ID .
She contacted many lawyers about the case but although she worked on this for 8 years , there was no result .
During this time I tried often to visit our house on the Al Quds side of the wall and every time I was caught by the Israeli forces and sent back to the West Bank .
When I was 24 years old I had a fight with a friend , I was caught by Israel during the fight and imprisoned for 1 ½ years .
I am a normal Palestinian trying to live a normal life .
I am not involved in any political movement and I have no security issues with Israel .
I am just trying to live my life , but when I had served my time in prison for fighting with a friend , Israel could not decide where to release me .
My birth certificate said Al Quds but I had no Israeli ID .
When Israel started investigating , they discovered that when I was 5 years old I had gone with my family to Jordan for 2 years .
It was then that I was told by an Israeli judge that the Law states :
‘ Any Palestinian who spends 2 years outside Israel has no right to return ’
I have since seen Judge twice in the past two months .
and he has told me that I will be returned to Jordan .
But Jordan has refused to accept me .
So now I have been told I will just have to wait in prison .
I am very depressed now and hate my life .
I am afraid of how long they will make me wait .
It could be years .
I am afraid I will be sent to Jordan .
I have no one in Jordan .
I was there when I was 5 years old !
All my family are in Palestine .
I know if they send me to Jordan I will never be allowed back into Palestine .
I will never be allowed to see my family again .
And I have done nothing .
I just want to be allowed to live a simple life with my family and the people I know and love , in my own land .

If you 're a geek like me , one of the best things about the summer is new episodes of Nova Science Now .
My favourite segments are the ones where they profile a scientist and recently they profiled Luis von Ahn , Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University .
Luis is the inventor of the Captcha , the squiggly words we type when registering on many websites to prove we 're human and to keep spammers out .
After initially being very proud of his invention , he soon realized that if every person takes 10 seconds to type a Captcha , about 500 thousand hours of humanity 's time was being wasted everyday .
In an effort to turn those 10 seconds from a waste into something useful , he invented the ReCaptcha , turning us all into unknowing volunteers in a massive public works project .
There are many projects digitizing books - Google and the Internet Archive projects for example - using optical character recognition .
The challenge for these projects has been working with older books where the print is often faded or blurred .
The OCR software can't recognize the words .
In fact , about 30 % of the words are deciphered incorrectly .
Most often though , the words are still decipherable by a human .
Luis 's ReCaptcha takes those words and uses them as Captchas .
In a two - word ReCaptcha , one of the words you type is the computer generated puzzle that proves you 're a human .
The other word comes out of the archive .
It 's assumed that if you can decipher the first word correctly , you can do the second word too .
If 10 people decipher the word the same way , it is officially digitized .
How fast can the the process of digitizing books and periodicals one word at at time go ?
Incredibly fast .
Especially when Facebook , Twitter , TicketMaster among others are using ReCaptcha .
Luis says that since it 's launch last year , over 400 million people or 6 % of the world 's population have helped digitize words .
35 million ReCaptcha words per day results in 125 to 150 digitized books .
About 20 years of the New York Times archive was completed in a few months .
The entire 30 year archive should be done by the end of the year .
Here 's a video of Luis speaking to the Library of Congress .
Jaycee Lee Dugard was said to have been grabbed off the street in 1991 A US woman found after being abducted as a girl in 1991 gave birth to two children fathered by her alleged kidnapper - the first when she was 14 .
Jaycee Lee Dugard and her daughters , 11 and 15 , were kept in a " hidden backyard within a backyard " , police say .
Alleged kidnapper Phillip Garrido , 58 , and his wife Nancy Garrido , 54 , are being held in custody in California .
DNA tests are being done to confirm Ms Dugard 's identity , but meanwhile she has been reunited with her mother .
" She was in good health , but living in a backyard for the past 18 years does take its toll , " El Dorado County Undersheriff Fred Kollar said .
Ms Dugard disappeared in 1991 , aged 11 , apparently taken by two people who bundled her into a car .

Mr Kollar said that since the kidnapping she had lived with the couple , isolated from view at a property in Antioch near San Francisco , 170 miles ( 273 km ) from her home in South Lake Tahoe .
" The tents and outbuildings in the backyard were placed in a strategic arrangement to inhibit outside viewing and to isolate the victims from outside contact . "
She and the children spent " most of their lives " there , he said , adding that they had never been to school or seen a doctor .
Their identities were revealed after police spotted Mr Garrido as he handed out religious literature at the University of California Berkeley campus with the two young children .
He raised suspicions because as a registered sex offender he was not allowed to be with young children .

He was called in by his parole officer for questioning , and brought the two children and a young woman he called Allissa with him .
During questioning he revealed that Allissa was actually Ms Dugard .
She also confirmed her identity to police .
In a telephone interview from prison with the KCRA - TV station , Mr Garrido said he had not admitted to abduction and that the birth of the first child 15 years ago had changed his life .
" If you take this a step at a time , you 're going to fall over backward and in the end you 're going to find the most powerful , heart - warming story , " he said .
In pictures : Girl found " I tell you here 's the story of what took place at this house and you 're going to be absolutely impressed .
" It 's a disgusting thing that took place with me in the beginning .
But I turned my life completely around , " he said .
Some of those who had had contact with Mr Garrido over recent years said he had developed increasingly strong religious beliefs .
Tim Allen , who did business with Mr Garrido 's printing firm , told Associated Press that Mr Garrido gave the impression he was planning to establish a church .
" He rambled .
It made no sense , " Mr Allen said .
' Given up hope '
Police said they had found a vehicle hidden in the backyard of the Antioch property that matched the vehicle described at the time of the abduction .
It broke my marriage up .
I 've gone through hell , I mean I 'm a suspect up until yesterday
Carl Probyn , stepfather Although Mr Garrido was previously visited by a parole officer , there was nothing odd noticed about the backyard .
The area occupied by Ms Dugard and her children was concealed by shrubs , rubbish bins and a tarpaulin .
Ms Dugard 's stepfather , Carl Probyn , who witnessed the abduction on 10 June 1991 , said he had " given up hope " she would be found alive .
" It broke my marriage up .
I 've gone through hell , I mean I 'm a suspect up until yesterday , " Mr Probyn , 60 , told AP .
Mr Probyn saw the young girl being taken away by two people as she walked from her home to a school bus stop in South Lake Tahoe .
He said a stranger drove up and grabbed Ms Dugard , bundling her into a grey car even as she tried to resist by kicking and screaming .
Mr Probyn believed a man and woman were in the vehicle .
Despite several false reports of sightings in the intervening years , Ms Dugard was never seen again .
" She sounds like she 's okay , " Mr Probyn said .
" I hope she 's been well - treated this entire 18 years .

Some saw Mr Mashaie as a moderate mouthpiece for Mr Ahmadinejad Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has dismissed his most senior vice - president , it has been reported .
The decision , the state news agency Irna said , came after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered Mr Ahmadinejad to do so .
First Vice - President Esfandiar Rahim Mashaie had angered hardliners last year by saying Iranians and Israelis were friends .
Mr Mashaie no longer considered himself first vice - president , reports said .
The decision came after a week - long stand - off between Ayatollah Khamenei and Mr Ahmadinejad , who had defended Mr Mashaie .
Ayatollah Khamenei wrote to the president , telling him that appointing Mr Mashaie was " against your interest and the interests of the government " .
In the letter , which was broadcast on Iranian state TV , Ayatollah Khamenei said : " It is necessary to announce the cancellation of this appointment . "
Mr Ahmadinejad , who is known for his own outspoken views against Israel , had been defending Mr Mashaie , at one stage calling him modest and loyal to Iran 's Islamic system .
Hardline students
During the day , hundreds of hardline students took to the streets of the capital , Tehran , in support of the demand for Mr Mashaie to stand down .
They had warned they would withdraw support from Mr Ahmadinejad unless he dismissed Mr Mashaie .
During their demonstrations they chanted that defiance of Ayatollah Khamenei 's views would not be tolerated , the semi-official Fars news agency reported .
In a resignation letter broadcast on Iranian radio , Mr Mashaie said : " I do not consider myself the first vice - president following the order by the supreme leader and I will offer my services to the dear people anywhere I can . "
Ayatollah Khamenei has the final say in matters of state , and analysts say he has rarely faced defiance in the past - though that changed in recent weeks with reformists challenging his ruling that last month 's disputed presidential election was fair .
Correspondents say the rift between the ayatollah and Mr Ahmadinejad comes at a precarious time for the president .
They say the president needs hardline support against the reformist opposition who continue to maintain that his re-election was fraudulent .
BBC correspondent Jon Leyne says the row shows how vulnerable Mr Ahmadinejad is to pressure from conservatives .
He says that , although this was a dispute within the conservative camp , the reformist opposition is bound to gather encouragement from seeing those in power engage in such a divisive argument among themselves .
The row over Israel broke out last year when Mr Mashaie , then minister in charge of tourism , was quoted as saying that Iranians were friends with the Israeli people , despite the conflict between their governments .

By Kim RahnStaff ReporterMale - turned - female transsexuals will no longer need to fulfill their military service before changing their legal sex in family records .
The Supreme Court said Tuesday that it had revised a regulation on transsexuals ' legal sex change approval to delete the clause stipulating that when a man changes his legal sex to female , he should have already fulfilled military service or been exempted from it .
The clause was designed to prevent men from dodging the mandatory service by getting a sex change .
Male - turned - female transsexuals , who have not changed their legal sex , used to be exempted from the service due to their ``mental illness . '' `` It was not easy to tell whether the applicants aimed to dodge the service or not , so we decided to remove the clause , '' a court official said .
The revision will enable male - to - female transsexuals to change the records more easily , he said .
Military service was one of seven conditions that the court prepared as a guideline in approving transsexuals ' legal sex change after its first approval in September 2006 .
The guideline says an applicant should be aged 20 and over , have never been married and have no children ; have suffered disparity between his or her biological sex and legal sex ; have undergone a sex change operation ; and be unlikely to change to his or her original sex again .
It also includes that the applicant has no intention to take advantage of the legal sex change in crimes ; the change should not have grave influence on his or her family relationship or have negative influence on society ; and the applicant , if a male - turned - female , should have fulfilled military service or been exempted from it .
As to the guideline , the National Human Rights Commission recommended last November the top court revise or delete it , saying it infringed on transsexuals ' human rights .
The court accepted the military service clause among the guidelines , along with the clause on influence on family relationship , and deleted them .
The number of those changing their legal sex is on the rise _ 10 people in 2006 , 15 in 2007 and 29 last year .
Among them , 48 changed from male to female , while six did so from female to male , according to the court .

A Westchester man who allegedly threatened to blow up the White House held police at bay for nearly eight hours Thursday as he sat parked in his car at the Federal Building in Westwood and was finally subdued when lawmen shattered a window , Tasered him and dragged him out of the vehicle .
The man , who authorities identified as Joseph Moshe , 56 , of Westchester , initially fled from U.S. Secret Service agents who had attempted to arrest him near his home .
Moshe fled in his bright red Volkswagen Beetle and parked in front of the Federal Building .
Local and federal authorities feared at first that the car might contain explosives and boxed the vehicle in with police cruisers and an armored vehicle .
The Federal Building was locked down and hundreds of people were prevented from leaving the scene as the standoff wore on for hours .
The confrontation reached a climax when police used a robot to shatter a rear window and filled the car with tear gas repeatedly .
Though officers expected Moshe to bail out of his car , he remained seated behind the steering wheel .

“ Unfortunately to everyone ’s surprise , he did n’t come out , ” said Det. Gus Villanueva of the Los Angeles Police Department .
Ultimately , officers shattered the driver ’s side window , Tasered Moshe and dragged him out of the vehicle .
He was taken to a hospital for minor scrapes , Villanueva said .
Police had tried to negotiate with Moshe throughout the incident , but he refused to communicate .
Law enforcement sources who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak about the case said Moshe appeared to have a mental illness .

A beautifully confused article from the Daily Mail to kick off the new year .
Nano particles , are they awesome or or are they evil ?
Well I do n’t really care , I just want to know if they are going to give me cancer but Sean Poulter the old tease waits till the final paragraph before telling us .
“ Some nano particles are known to mimic the harmful effects of asbestos on the lungs .
Consequently , they have the potential to trigger lung cancer if inhaled . ”
So first on the list of things to cause cancer in 2008 : Nano particles .
But it is n’t all bad apparently thanks to the wonders of nano technology we can look forward to Willy Wonka chewing gum , though disappointingly the Mail does n’t tell us whether this is likely to turn us into a ( cancer curing ) blueberry .
Judging by this article The Mail is eyeing up Nano Particles as the next “ frankenstein foods ” but wants to keep the option open of filling its health pages with glowing reports on the inevitable tide of bullshit “ Nano health supplements ” that are surely on the way .
Ca n’t wait .
Very few people are going to complain to their credit card company , still less to the police , that they have been charged for visiting a site identified as " child rape " – for how do you prove that it was n't you ?
Some of the men had visited legal adult pornography sites on the internet , and given their credit card details so they could watch porn films .
They had not been to child pornography sites – but once they had given their credit card details , it was very easy for someone else to do so using their credit card number .
The percentage of Americans who hold a favorable view of the Dem Party has slipped below 50 percent .
Democratic Party ratings plummet
The percentage of Americans who hold a favorable view of the Democratic Party has slipped below 50 percent for the first time since President Barack Obama took office , according to a new Pew Research Center poll released Wednesday .
Only 49 percent of Americans now hold a favorable view of the Democratic Party , down from 62 percent in the same poll shortly after Obama assumed office .
Democratic favorable ratings hovered around 60 percent as recently as April , when 59 percent of those polled held a favorable view .

The national survey of 2,010 adults conducted Aug. 11-17 also found that 51 percent of Americans approve of Obama ’s job performance with 37 percent disapproving .
Independents split 45 percent - 43 percent in approving of the president ’s performance .
While Democratic numbers have plunged , the GOP has yet to see any uptick among voters .
Only 40 percent of those polled held a favorable view of the Republican Party , a number which Pew noted “ has not changed all year . ”
In addition , a growing number of Americans believe Obama and Republican leaders are not working together to address the problems facing the nation .
Nearly two - thirds ( 63 percent ) think the two groups are not working together , compared to 50 percent in June .
The number of Americans who blame Obama for not working with GOP leaders is also on the rise .
Among those polled , 17 percent blamed the president , up from 12 percent in June .
But even more ( 29 percent ) held GOP leaders responsible for not working together , up from 26 percent in February .
Why Seniors Oppose Government - Run Health Care ( Except for Their Own )
This appeared in Sunday 's Outlook section .
I 'm posting it here so folks can comment .
" We need to protect Medicare , " Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele exhorted last week , " and not cut it in the name of ' health - insurance reform . ' "
It was a rousing defense of government - run health care from the . . . conservative chairman of the GOP .
But incoherence does n't necessarily make for bad politics .
In this case , Steele was aiming his message directly at America 's seniors .
Lucky for him , they share his incoherence in full .
In late July , President Obama recounted a letter from a woman who told him , " I do n't want government - run health care , I do n't want socialized medicine , and do n't touch my Medicare . "
The president chuckled .
" That 's what Medicare is , " he protested at an AARP town hall .
" A government - run health - care plan that people are very happy with . "
Jokes aside , the White House is struggling to attract seniors to health - care reform .
No age group is as solidly opposed to the project as the over - 65 set .
But that 's the same set that relies on government - run health care and loves it .
That 's not how it 's supposed to work ; successful government programs are supposed to create constituencies for their expansion .
But the happy experience of Medicare has made seniors less , not more , open to a generous welfare state .
It has n't created advocates for more single - payer health care ; it has created advocates just for Medicare .
And they fear that health - care reform will endanger Medicare .
Resolving this tension could decide the future of Obama 's make - or - break domestic policy push .
The opposition of seniors matters .
Older people vote in bigger numbers than younger people do ; they 're more likely to call their representatives or attend a town hall meeting .
Most important , says Robert Blendon , a Harvard scholar who studies public opinion on health care , " they make off - year elections .
The secret about Congress and health policy is that in 2010 , there will be a lot more seniors at the polls than there were in 2008 . "
Just ask Bill Clinton .
In September 1993 , the strongest supporters of his plan to reform the health - care system were seniors .
A solid 62 percent approved of his efforts .
By April 1994 , the president had lost 25 points among seniors , and they were his weakest backers .
" In the Clinton plan , it did n't come out till later that the financing came substantially from Medicare , " Blendon says .
But once it did , seniors revolted .
In that fall 's midterm elections , Democrats lost more than 50 seats in the House .
Seniors were a big part of the reason -- giving Republicans 51 percent of their votes .
Seniors are moving in a similar direction this year .
A Washington Post - ABC
News poll this month found that only 35 percent of people 65 and older approved of Obama 's handling of health care .
Compare that with 44 percent of respondents between the ages of 30 and 64 , and 57 percent of 18 - to 29 - year - olds .
More telling , only 8 percent of seniors thought reform would improve their health care , while 42 percent thought their care would get worse .
All this despite the fact that a staggering 94 percent of seniors are satisfied with the quality of care they receive , and Medicare polls much better than the private health insurance market .
What are seniors so afraid of ?
From the beginning , Medicare has been named as one of the potential sources of savings that would fund subsidies for the uninsured .
That sounds like service cuts , even if the specific changes do n't involve anything of the kind ( most of the savings would come from reducing overpayments to the private insurers that participate in the Medicare Advantage program ) .
So the fear is not of a welfare state but of changes in their welfare state .
The result is that the coalition against reform is an odd union between people opposing government - run health care and people defending government - run health care .
It 's a potent combination .
Seniors are also the most conservative segment of the population and are getting more so .
They constitute not only the sole age group that Obama lost in last year 's election , but also the sole age group in which his results were worse than those of John Kerry in 2004 .
And both Obama and Kerry underperformed Al Gore 's 2000 results .
" The Roosevelt seniors are being replaced by the Reagan seniors , " says Paul Begala , who helped run Clinton 's 1992 campaign .
A May poll by the Pew Research Center found that for the first time in 20 years , the GOP is now an older party than the Democrats .
The June Post - ABC poll asked whether respondents would prefer a smaller government with fewer services or a larger government with more services .
Seventy percent of seniors -- the segment of the population with government - run health care and a government pension , also known as Social Security -- preferred a smaller government , compared with 37 percent of people 18 to 29 .
Seniors are the age group most solidly opposed to the public option .
In fact , in the August Post - ABC poll , they were the only age group in which a majority opposed it .
" Seniors are like the American West , " says Julian Zelizer , a Princeton historian .
" They depend on government and then say they hate it . "
But taken as a whole , the attitudes seniors express on health care are arguably the greatest vote of confidence anyone has offered reform .
Seniors live in America 's version of Canada .
They have single - payer health care .
And they love it .
They love it so much that they 've got the chairman of the RNC swearing to protect it .

Les Paul died on August 13 , 2009 , at the age of 94 .
He is known both for his guitar - playing skill and also for his inventions .
He is one of the first people to create a solid - body electric guitar .
He invented multitrack recording , which changed the way music is produced .
In his obituary in the New York times , though , I was struck by one sentence .
" His music teacher wrote to his mother , " Your boy , Lester , will never learn music . "
This is a prime example of how music is a skill not an ability .
Carol Dweck and her colleagues make a distinction between abilities - things you can or cannot do - and skills - things you learn to do .
We often think of music as an ability .
People who do not play instruments look at people who play beautiful music and assume they have some special ability to sound good playing music .
That gulf between those with and without musical ability seems unbridgeable , and so they do not even try to take up an instrument .
The evidence , though , suggests that music is a skill , not an ability .
You can learn to play music , and to play it well .
Certainly , there are some basic abilities that affect how well you will play an instrument when you first pick it up and how easily you will learn at first .
People will differ in their basic motor coordination and timing .
But again , Les Paul is an inspiring case .
As an adult , he was in a car wreck and his right elbow was shattered .
He had it set at an angle so that he could continue to play the guitar .
But certainly having an arm that will not move much ought to be a significant impairment to playing .
Yet he played on .
In addition , as he grew older , he had terrible arthritis , and had to re-learn to play the guitar with reduced mobility , but still managed to play beautiful and technically difficult lines .
The research on music expertise says that it is the amount of time that musicians spend practicing that determines how good they will be .
Anders Ericsson and his colleagues have studied expertise extensively in music and other domains .
One study even looked at musicians in a conservatory .
The ratings of students by faculty were almost perfectly related to the amount of time that those students spent practicing rather than some other measure of ability .
So , as we honor Les Paul for his contributions to popular music , let 's also honor him for being an example of what each of us is capable of doing if we are willing to put in the time and effort to do it well .
I am returning to the irregular postings of the Test Automation Tips .
In this entry you can ready about simple introduction to the PHPUnit testing framework that is used , not surprisingly , to unit test PHP applications .
This entry was first sent out as part of the Test Automation Tips .
Visit here to subscribe .
Welcome back I have to apologize as it has been more than 2 months since I sent out the last testing tip .
After I came back from Oslo , where I gave the Test Automation Training a client contacted with an urgent project that had a tight dead - line .
That meant that up till yesterday I have been working quite intensively at the client .
That did not leave time for writing either the Test Automation Tips or the Perl 6 Tricks and Treats .
Anyway , the dead - line is now over and they are moving into a calmer period in which we finally going to setup a real testing framework .
I hope I 'll be able to write about that .
In the meantime I have lots of other subjects I wanted to write about .
Let 's start with an introduction to PHPUnit .
Background Previously there were two posts about testing PHP using SimpleTest .
The two posts can be read here : Testing PHP code with SimpleTest Testing PHP Applications Today I am going to take a look at PHPUnit to see how we can test the same simple add ( ) function we had in that example .
Just to remind you we had a file called mylib. php with a function in it called add ( ) that is supposed to add numbers and return their sum .
We noticed that calling add ( 1 , 1 ) returns 2 as expected and calling add ( 1 , 1 , 1 ) also returns 2 .
Which is not so good .
We are not interested in fixing this code now , just to write test and see how the success and failure is reported .
If we were doing it " manually " we would call print ( add ( 1 , 1 ) ) and observe the result .
The problem with this is that it is extremely boring and error prone .
PHPUnit PHPUnit was developed and is maintained by Sebastian Bergmann .
It has an extensive manual and it seems to be more wide - spread than SimpleTest we saw earlier .
asserTrue
In the first example we 'll try to solve the same simple problem as we did in the SimpleTest example .
We have a function called add ( ) in the mylib .
php file .
We would like to test that function .
We include that file in our test script and include the already installed PHPUnit / Framework.php
We have to create a class that extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase - the name of the class does not matter .
In the class we need to create testing functions .
The name of each function has to start with the word ' test ' , otherwise the name does not matter .
It should be descriptive as any function name .
<? php require_once ( dirname ( __FILE__ ) . '/../includes/mylib.php ' ) ; require_once ' PHPUnit/Framework.php ' ; class AddTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase { public function testAddTwo ( ) { $ this ->assertTrue ( 2 == add ( 1 , 1 ) ) ; } public function testAddThree ( ) { $ this ->assertTrue ( 3 == add ( 1 , 1 , 1 ) ) ; } } ?>
As opposed to the SimpleTest framework , in PHPUnit the primary way to execute the tests is from the command line using the phpunit script .
So you do the following : phpunit cal01.php
The output looks like this : PHPUnit 3.3.17 by Sebastian Bergmann . .F
Time : 0 seconds
There was 1 failure : 1 ) testAddThree ( AddTest )
Failed asserting that < boolean : false > is true .
calc01.php:14 FAILURES !
Tests : 2 , Assertions : 2 , Failures : 1 . In the results you can see a single .
F meaning one of the testing functions failed .
In addition you 'll see details of the failure giving both the name of of the test function and the test class .
PHPunit showing success
Just in order to see how it looks like I removed the failing test from the test script and ran the test again .
The code has only one test function : <?php require_once ( dirname ( __FILE__ ) . '/../includes/mylib.php ' ) ; require_once ' PHPUnit/Framework.php ' ; class AddTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase { public function testAddTwo ( ) { $ this -> assertTrue ( 2 == add ( 1 , 1 ) ) ; } } ?>
The output : PHPUnit 3.3.17 by Sebastian Bergmann . .
Time : 0 seconds OK ( 1 test , 1 assertion ) PHPUnit with assertEqual Just as was in the case of the SimpleTest , PHPUnit also has an assertEqual method that allows the separation of the expected value and the actual result .
The first parameter of the assertEqual method is the expected value and the second parameter is the actual result .
Making the roles of the two values clear is important so in the reporting we can already know what was the expected and what was the actual result .
<?php require_once ( dirname ( __FILE__ ) . '/../includes/mylib.php ' ) ; require_once ' PHPUnit/Framework.php ' ; class AddTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase { public function testAddTwo ( ) { $ this ->assertEquals ( 2 , add ( 1 , 1 ) ) ; } public function testAddThree ( ) { $ this ->assertEquals ( 3 , add ( 1 , 1 , 1 ) ) ; } } ?>
Output : PHPUnit 3.3.17 by Sebastian Bergmann . .F
Time : 0 seconds
There was 1 failure : 1 ) testAddThree ( AddTest )
Failed asserting that < integer : 2 > matches expected value < integer : 3 >.
calc03.php:14 FAILURES !
Tests : 2 , Assertions : 2 , Failures : 1 . The difference between this output and the one from the first example is that in this case the reader can know more details about the failure .
The reader can actually see that the expected values was 3 while the actual value was 2 .
That can already give a clue where the problem might be .
assetEqual with message <?php require_once ( dirname ( __FILE__ ) . '/../includes/mylib.php ' ) ; require_once ' PHPUnit/Framework.php ' ; class AddTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase { public function testAddTwo ( ) { $ this->assertEquals ( 2 , add ( 1 , 1 ) , ' 1+1=2 ' ) ; } public function testAddThree ( ) { $ this->assertEquals ( 3 , add ( 1 , 1 , 1 ) , ' 1+1+1=3 ' ) ; } } ?>
In case of success this does not make a difference but when the test fails PHPUnit will display this message along with the name of the test function and the name of the test class .
If the message is worded carefully it can further help in understanding the failure without even looking at the source code .
PHPUnit 3.3.17 by Sebastian Bergmann . .F

Tests : 2 , Assertions : 2 , Failures : 1 . Installing PHPUnit
You should be able to install PHPUnit either by the package management system of your operating system or via PEAR .
In Ubuntu 9.04 I found I could install it using $ sudo aptitude install phpunit but that seems to bring a very old version of PHPUnit .
In order to use PEAR first I had to install the command line tool using $ sudo aptitude install php-pear
Then I followed the instructions on the PHPUnit web site though I had to use sudo for that as it would not work as regular user .
$ sudo channel - discover pear.phpunit.de
The the actual command : $ sudo pear install phpunit / PHPUnit gave me the following error message :
Did not download optional dependencies : pear / Image_GraphViz , pear / Log , use -- alldeps to download automatically phpunit / PHPUnit requires PEAR Installer ( version >= 1.8.1 ) , installed version is 1.7.1 phpunit / PHPUnit can optionally use package " pear / Image_GraphViz " ( version >= 1.2.1 ) phpunit / PHPUnit can optionally use package " pear / Log " phpunit / PHPUnit can optionally use PHP extension " pdo_sqlite " phpunit / PHPUnit can optionally use PHP extension " xdebug " ( version >= 2.0.0 )
No valid packages found install failed So I had to first upgrade PEAR which was easy : $ sudo pear upgrade - all and then I could install PHPUnit : $ sudo pear install phpunit / PHPUnit
It might be slightly different on your operating system .
Conclusion
That 's it for today .
There is a lot more to say about PHPUnit but these examples can already get you started .

WTVJ - TV's Amara Sohn reports .
If you ’re a Muslim ( note : while Borat was n't Muslim some Muslim groups were concerned that he would be confused for one ) or a Kazakhstani who hated the waystereotyped your people , then prepare to get upset all over again .
It seems that even though Sacha Baron Cohen was n’t the least bit afraid of you , he ’s scared to death of gay people .
When Muslims bitched and complained about Borat , when people sued and when civil rights groups of all type threatened to protest , when Khazakh officials pissed and moaned about the way they were being portrayed , Sacha Baron Cohen and 20th Century
Fox simply gave them the middle finger and then released their horribly offensive movie anyway .
They were rewarded with huge box office numbers and critical praise .
It was a rare , shining moment for free speech in this country .
Enterwhich by all accounts is , at the least , just as offensive asand we hope just as funny .
Though by the time we see it , the film may be less funny .
Or at the least , it wo n’t be the movie Cohen and his team originally intended because The Wrap is reporting that Cohen has conducted significant reshoots toafter gay audiences at sneak peek showings told him that he crossed over the line .
Apparently those reshoots happened this spring and included an ending shot with cooperation from Elton John , whose presence will undoutedly take care of quite a lot of placating .
Word is they ’ve shoehorned in some sort of pro-gay marriage message along with Sir Elton .
Meanwhile people who have n’t seen the movie are already overreacting , in spite of the reshoots .
It ’s being compared to a white actor appearing in blackface … which seemed to work out pretty well for Robert Downey Jr. Maybe Sacha Baron Cohen will win an Oscar .
At issue is whether this is satire or simply getting laughs at the expense of gay stereotypes …
I guess .
Frankly I had no idea that Cohen cared what people thought .
He certainly did n’t when he made Borat , but I guess gay people have more powerful lobbying groups .
I have n’t seen the movie and neither have any of you , so we have no way to know what the film ’s content is like .
Maybe they have a point , maybe he really does go too far .
Who knows ?
Again , I thought the whole point of his moviescrossing the line ?
crossed the line at least once every sixty seconds .
It ’s Khazaks though who should be really pissed here .
Why do gay people get their way while Cohen was allowed to take a big dump on an entire country ?
If I were Khazakstan , I ’d declare war on San Francisco right now … assuming they have n’t already .
They are Khazaks , after all .
I spend a lot of time thinking about how to prevent bugs in Parrot .
My first contribution to the project was a patch in late 2001 to make an essential Perl 5 program used in the build compatible with Perl 5.004 .
( My , how times change . )
I 've spent countless hours in the intervening seven and a half years helping the project become correct , complete , viable , and competitive .
Many of my opinions about the maintainability and sustainability of software projects come from experiences with Parrot ( sometimes to the chagrin of people who do n't know the other projects I can't talk about which have similar characteristics ) .
Fiddly Bits of Parrot Not Always Easy to Write Correctly
Parrot uses pervasively a data structure called a PMC , a PolyMorphic Container ( or Parrot Magic Cookie ) .
A PMC represents anything that 's not a primitive value -- anything more complex than an integer , a floating point value , or a string .
In Perl 5 terms , a PMC resembles an SV .
Do n't take that line of thinking too far ; PMCs take the good parts of SVs and avoid the scary , complex parts of SVs .
Because Parrot has n't quite managed to get rid of C entirely yet ( see the Lorito plan for more about that ) , we have several dozen core PMCs written in C .
A PMC has several well - defined behaviors which forms the vtable interface .
These are common operations that any PMC should be able to perform : get a scalar value , set an integer value , access a nested PMC , invoke the PMC as a callable function .
Not every PMC performs every defined vtable function , but unimplemented functions produce Parrot exceptions rather than interpreter crashes .
Additionally , most PMCs have attributes .
Think of a PMC as a class , with instances of that PMC as objects and PMC attributes as instance attributes and vtable functions as instance methods , and you have a conceptual understanding which works at a high level .
Because of our current use of C as the PMC declaration language , PMCs need to understand their memory management characteristics .
In other words , if your PMC has two INTVAL attributes and one PMC attribute , the PMC init ializer ( like a constructor , in OO terms ) needs to allocate enough memory to store these three attributes .
Similarly , the PMC 's garbage collection mark vtable function needs to be able to mark any PMC stored as an attribute as live .
The PMC 's destroy vtable function ( a destructor , of sorts ) , needs to release the memory allocated for attribute storage back to the system .
( Do n't you have a garbage collector ? , you may ask .
That 's a good question .
We could let the garbage collector manage the lifecycle of all of these pieces of memory , but they 're already attached to GCable elements , so we do n't need to mark or sweep or trace them .
The malloc / free memory model works here well enough , even though we use memory pools to avoid the costs of malloc / free . )
Why Fiddly Bits are a Problem
Thus to write a PMC without any garbage collection errors , without any memory leaks , and without any random corruption waiting to happen , you had to remember several steps .
In practice , people writing their own custom PMCs copied and pasted behavior from an existing PMC , then refactored it until it did what they wanted .
I spent a couple of weeks reading every line of every core PMC in Parrot .
I fixed a lot of bugs .
I can spot GC and memory bugs in patches .
The problem is that I do n't scale and you can't get the experience I have without going through all of the bugs I 've gone through -- and if I never read your patch , you may still have that bug .
Properly Encapsulated Complexity
Julian Albo and Andrew Whitworth ( and several other Parrot developers ) made an improvement recently in this area .
PMCs with attributes need to declare them .
We use a mini-language built around C to define PMCs .
For example , the PMC which represents an object in Parrot ( the Class PMC ) has two attributes , a PMC which represents the class of the object and a PMC which contains the instance variables of the object .
The code looks like :
pmclass Object need_ext { ATTR PMC * _class ; ATTR PMC * attrib_store ; /* vtable entries go here */ /* PMC methods go here */
The PMC to C conversion step creates a C struct to hold this PMC attribute data :
/* Object PMC 's underlying struct .
*/ typedef struct Parrot_Object_attributes { PMC * _class ; PMC * attrib_store ; } Parrot_Object_attributes ;
Thus at Parrot 's compilation time -- when we compile the Parrot virtual machine -- we know how much memory to store the attributes of each PMC .
We know which PMCs have attributes ( not all do ) .
We know which PMCs need to mark their attributes specially ( this one does , as its attributes are GCables and not primitive values ) .
Julian 's idea was to store the size of the attribute structure in the PMC structure .
When allocating a new PMC , the PMC initialization code also allocates memory to contain the PMC 's attributes and attaches it .
Thus all of the bookkeeping code in PMC init vtable functions can go away .
When destroying an unsed PMC , the PMC destruction code can free this memory .
Thus all of the bookkeeping code in PMC destroy vtable functions can go away .
We can even get rid of a special PMC flag value which meant something to the garbage collector but was fiddly to get right , because people often forgot to enable it .
This new code is obvious to prove correct .
It either works or it does n't .
It 's one codepath to examine and patch , not dozens of core PMCs and countless other PMCs existing now or in the future .
This reduces the amount of code people need to write and reduces the amount of code existing in our system .
We 've moved the internal bookkeeping mechanism from the user - visible portions of Parrot .
If you want to hack on the GC , feel free -- but most people should n't have to .
They should n't even have to know how it does what it does .
( That wo n't hurt , but they should n't have to know the mechanisms by which it does what it does . )
That 's one principle of software development I always encourage .
Encapsulate confusing or dangerous or difficult code behind a nice interface .
Now you do n't have to worry about doing the wrong thing because you do n't know how to write code which does the wrong thing .
If you do n't write any code at all , Parrot will do the right thing for you .
Yes , we changed the way you define PMCs -- but tell me that this is n't an improvement for everyone .
That 's a principle of modern Perl I want to encourage .
And dis button activates mah army of evil robots .

It 's a date prospective parents try to avoid if told their baby is due on 31 August .
Neil Hallows - whose own daughter 's birthday falls on this day - asks why .
This is the time when bad birthdays turn good .
In a society where parental ambition leads some to fake their address or religious faith to give their little ones the best start in life , 31 August is gaining a certain reputation .
Summer - borns tend to lose out at school because , in England and Wales , 1 September is the cut - off date for school entry , so they can be up to a year younger than their classmates .
June baby Frank Lampard Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies two years ago found only 53 % of girls and 47 % of boys born in August reached the expected educational level at age seven in state primary schools in England , compared with 80 % and 70 % of those born in September .
Their sporting prowess is affected too .
Older children tend to be bigger and more confident , receive more encouragement , and their advantage grows over time .
For unto everyone who hath shall be given .
Among the 25 most capped England football players , 11 were born between September and November , while only one , Frank Lampard , was born between June and August .
In his case , having an England international for a father probably outweighed the disadvantage .
So for educational and sporting opportunities , the cruellest and kindest months sit next to each other in the calendar like resentful neighbours .
Reception
We never thought about it , and I 'm glad we did n't , when our daughter arrived two hours before midnight on 31 August , 2005 .
She looks awfully young to be starting school next week , although my word , she 's up for it .
Four can seem young to start school
But should parents be thinking twice as to what time of year they have children ?
When I raise the issue on the parenting website Mumsnet , a large number of respondents say their children have faced disadvantages by being the youngest in their class .
But only one says she made a conscious effort to try for a September or October baby .
A teacher , she has witnessed the difference in achievement between older and younger children , and thinks her sister 's school career has been marred by an August birth .
If anyone is likely to be a pioneer of seasonal planning , it is she .
But her comments are telling : " Not that I would have stopped trying had I not fallen pregnant at the best time though - I was n't that concerned . "
After all , it can take months , or years , to get pregnant and the desire to do so often overshadows the niceties of diary planning .
And other mothers point out they are having children later in life , and cannot afford the luxury of holding off for several months until the " best " season swings into view .
Long walks and curry
If , however , you are already pregnant , there might be a temptation to try to tip the birth date one way or another .
Please come to my party , 25 Decem ... oh , you 're busy Betty Kellett , a midwife based in London and Essex with 38 years experience , has noticed a growing number of women due to give birth on the cusp of August and September who try to do their unborn child a favour .
" There is such competition , especially for good schools , and parents have become much more aware , " she says .
So what can women safely do ?
When they go beyond their due date , long walks are often recommended as a way of naturally inducing labour .
Mrs Kellett says those wishing to delay matters for several days may instead choose to rest up .
While a September birthday has grown in importance in the past few years , it is not the only time of year on parents ' minds .
Spring remains a popular time to have a baby , she says , as it means mothers can avoid being heavily pregnant during hot weather .
And certain bogey dates like Christmas Day , Friday 13th and 29 February are avoided by many parents if they can .
" In the past , March was popular .
Everybody wanted a baby then because it was the end of the financial year and you had a good tax rebate . "
Numbers game
This is starting to get confusing , as there seem to be ever more seasons or dates to avoid .
If you worry about the education statistics for August babies , how about the increased risk of Alzheimer 's when born in March , allergies in autumn or arthritis in November ?
Can birth date have an impact ?
It might sound like astrology , but these have all been media health stories based , sometimes misleadingly , on scientific studies which may be small or only relevant to specific countries .
Those born in May are perhaps the most confused - they are apparently the most optimistic and yet also the most suicidal .
Perhaps our family saying is right after all : " There 's never a right time to get pregnant . "
It 's not meant as a discouragement , but the opposite , to show these things should not be over - planned .
The answer might be not to plan our babies around the system , but make our system slightly more accommodating to the babies .
Helen Brown , head teacher of St Mary 's Catholic First School in Wool , Dorset , says there has to be a cut - off point for school entry , and those born near it will always be the most affected .
But she would like to see schools given more flexibility in where they can place children .
" In almost every year group , in every school I have worked in , there has been at least one child who has been an August birth for whom I have thought , if only they could now repeat that reception year they would fare well .
" It 's not that they did n't have the ability , it 's not that there were any underlying problems .
It 's just that they were too young for their year . "
He will be playing catch - up for years
Gemma Catchpole , on her July - born son Gemma Catchpole , a mother of four children in Sussex , says summer - born children are not only penalised by their age but by aspects of the educational system .
Her seven - year - old son , with a July birthday , would have had an extra year at pre-school had he been a few weeks younger .
And the admissions policy where she lives means he had to attend reception class part - time for two terms until Easter , whereas the oldest children in the year could attend full - time from September .
He has struggled at school and has recently been diagnosed with dyslexia , but had to wait until near his seventh birthday before the necessary tests could be carried out .
An older child could have been diagnosed three terms earlier .
" He will be playing catch - up for years , " she says .
BORN ON 31 AUGUST Actor Richard Gere Singer Van Morrison Cricketer Clive Lloyd Professor Sir Bernard Lovell , founder of Jodrell Bank Singer Debbie Gibson Anecdotally , Scottish educational authorities tend to show more flexibility than those in England and , as the cut - off point north of the border is the end of February , the youngest children starting reception class are four and a half rather than four and perhaps better able to deal with the experience .
Mrs Brown reassures parents that reception teachers are well aware of the disparities in children 's ages , and place a huge emphasis on supporting children 's personal and social development .
So many summer - borns fare well .
I hope ours will .
I 've been feeling in the past few weeks , as she gets ready to start school , that the best birthday present we could buy her would be a different birthday .
But parental influences , good or bad , surely still count more than the accident of a birth date .
If she is like her mother and father , she will love books , be hopeless at sport , and not so much cry over spilt milk as write long articles about it four years after she dropped the cup .
Good luck Lila , and happy birthday .
Below is a selection of your comments .
My friend had identical twin girls either side of midnight on 31 August / 1 September and was devastated when they had to be split into different school years .
The girl who started school a year later did far better in her exams .
Dee , St Helens , UK
My daughter was born on 8 September - deliberately conceived to be born in the first week of September .
Her actual due date was 1 September - a date my teaching colleagues ( yes , I was a teacher at the time ) found hilarious .
On the evening of 31 August a group of friends and I sat and counted the minutes to midnight , determined to see my baby past the date we all feared .
She then had the audacity to keep us all waiting another eight days .
I 've now remarried and my husband has twins from a previous marriage .
Born 10 weeks prematurely , and with all the issues that prematurity can bring , they had the misfortune to be born on , yes - you 've guessed it - 31 August .
That they have been disadvantaged by their birth date is without question .
Another year in primary , another year of maturity before GCSEs would have made all the difference to them .
It 's not easy growing up being the worst , the least able for no other reason than the fate of your birthday .
Cath Pickles , Southwold , UK
It is my daughters 9th birthday today - 31 August , she was born at 11.30 pm .
I feel she has really suffered at school .
She was a month premature and I tried to keep her back a year but the authorities refused .
Having an older daughter born in November , I can see the difference it has made .
She is also very small for her age and I feel the current system is very unfair .
Kate Robinson , Northampton , England
My son was born on 30 August , but the cut off date for schools in N Ireland is 30 June .
So ironically here " summer babies " are the oldest in their class and probably do have that developmental " edge " in the early years of schooling .
Gillian , Belfast
This story annoys me .
I was the youngest child in every school I attended and never felt inferior or disadvantaged , never needed any help , and spent most of my time feeling frustrated by the speed of teaching because they had to spend extra time helping the older kids understand what was going on .
Being older always seemed to a disadvantage to me as that extra 12 months at home meant their fragile little minds must have been corrupted by watching more Bagpuss or Rainbow .
Phil Bailey , Poole , Dorset
Where I grew up , the cut - off was December / January , and as a late December baby I was the youngest one in my year - by quite a lot as it turned out since the second youngest had an October birthday .
When I started school I suffered from the separation from my mum more than most children , and it took me a while to get my head around reading .
But by the time we left primary school , I was top of my class and stayed there until the end of secondary school so I really do n't think people should worry too much about it .
The younger children will catch up .
CC , UK Our daughter was born two weeks early , on 27 August .
It was clear when she started school that she did n't have the stamina and attention span that the older children had in her class .
Until around 10 or 11 she was always playing catch - up and her achievements were average .
But she has just got four As in her A - levels , so it has n't damaged her long term .
I would say she is probably more reserved than many , though she claims that 's because she 's the oldest .
She believes that birth order has more impact than actual birth date , and that kids with older siblings learn from their siblings and are more confident and socially adept .
John , Huntingdon
I wonder what some of the comment writers would like to have done about the system - would they like all August babies to be moved into the year below ?
All this would do is put the July babies at the same disadvantage .
There has to be a cut off somewhere , and if a child happens to be born just inside one school year , then they will just be statistically disadvantaged .
Tough luck - there will always be a youngest person in the year , nothing will change that .
James , Bradford , England Here in Canada it 's very different .
The cut off is 31 December so it 's " December Boys " who are renowned for struggling - but it's very common to keep them back a year and either start a year later or repeat kindergarten .
In recent years it 's become unusual to repeat any grade , but back in the day , repeating it was common .
Now other strategies are used which are less demoralizing for children .
But I always regretted repeating a class I had come top of , and consequently losing a full year of my life .
Mel Morris , Burlington , Ontario I was born on 4 September , so was one of the oldest children in my class at primary school .
In secondary school , though , I started a year early , as my parents and the teachers thought I was bright enough to cope with the work and felt it unfair to keep me back for the sake of four days .
I was never good at sport , even in primary school , but I certainly did n't suffer academically .
It 's not just the birth date , it 's the inherent ability of the child .
Elaine , Sheffield , UK I was born on 31 August and as a result , I got extra attention from teachers at school .
I was always told how intelligent I was considering that I was a year younger than some of my classmates , which actually spurred me on to do well .
Victoria Graham , Kenilworth , UK
Our baby was due on 27 August and we wanted him to be born BEFORE 1 September to help avoid that extra year of childcare ; not only for financial reasons but for the awkwardness of it ( we live 120 miles from both sets of grandparents so it 's not easy ) .
As it happened he came on 9 September and we realised we were n't that bothered because he is the most amazing thing to ever happen to us .
Phil Beasley , Newcastle I was 10 days late as a child resulting in me being a September baby instead of an August child .
I was treated with extra privileges at school for being the oldest in the class and enjoyed a lot of responsibility .
As a result I was always a " leader " and have been assigned management roles quickly in various jobs .
Kathy , Manchester , England I was born on 30 August and although I was always younger than my mates - I never felt the disadvantage , I 'm just as confidence and have always kept up I got 10 GCSEs , an IT qualification and a degree - all before I was 20 .
Age does not mean anything - you do n't realise the age gap until your older and all your mates are turning 18 and going down the pub and you can't .
Sam Cairns , High Wycombe , Bucks I was a June baby and did well at school .
However , I was in " proper " kindergarten from the age of 3 so that may have had something to do with it .
I was a bright child and had that reinforced by my teachers and parents ; perhaps it 's more about self - belief .
Pamela Brooke , London , UK I was born on 5 September , was moved ahead in primary school until Year 3 as I found school easy , then had to do Year 3 again to get back in my age band .
Effectively , by being born five days late for the cut - off , I lost a whole year of my adult life as I could have gone through the education system and university a year earlier ...
I just wished my Mum had pushed a bit sooner .
Steve Earl , Swindon , UK
We used to live in Germany , where parents had the option of holding back their children by a year before starting school - parents of boys born in the summer often did this .
The advantage of being an older child is often far higher than completing studies a year earlier , but having struggled all the way , and perhaps failing to get into a good university as a result .
Edward , Petaling Jaya , Malaysia Being born on 28 August 1990 I understand parts of this , and yes at times I struggled to keep up with classmates .
But I was blessed with a fast mind and am now doing a degree part - time with a well - paid job .
The nurture factor of my upbringing has benefitted me , so not all babies born at the end of August are lost causes by all means .
Whitney Robinson , Whitehaven , UK
One simple remedy would be for young children to enter school the following year .
My own children missed the cut - off date for starting school by a few weeks .
Other mothers pushed me to appeal , and undoubtedly they would have passed the entry test .
Most children I knew could have passed it at three .
We as a country are keen for children to start school as early as possible - perhaps as childcare is easier and free , and parents can work with less worry .
I conducted a bit of research of my own and found , 20 years ago , there was evidence that starting school later has many advantages .
Perhaps this is why children in other European countries start at six or seven .
My own girls were five and a half when they started official schooling and were more mature and capable than some of their very young counterparts .
I felt , and still feel sorry for children who enter the exam - filled rat race when not quite ready for it .
Alison Turner , Beith , Scotland I was on 31 August but , at the age of five or six , a decision was made by the head teacher and my parents that I should repeat a year , as I was struggling mostly due to being the youngest .
This had a huge impact on me throughout school , as being amongst the oldest children in the year was definitely an advantage .
I can only imagine how different my experience would have been had this decision not been made .
I guess that I owe a lot to that teacher .
Mark Stokes , Cambridge , UK My experience was the opposite of Mark's .
Also born on 31 August , I was the oldest in the class until age seven , when they decided I should be in the year above , so I skipped a year .
I was n't given any extra help and missed some important stuff ( like arithmetic ) .
Somehow they thought I 'd just pick it up .
Oh well , it was the 70s , after all .
In addition to the academic challenges , I also remember a huge change in how I behaved with my peers , going from one of the most confident members of the class to being rather quiet and withdrawn .
Later on I managed to do quite well academically , but I still wonder now and then how things would have been .
A lot of problems I experienced can ( somewhat subjectively ) be traced back to this decision .
Regardless of this , had they put me in the correct year in the first place , or left me where I was , things would have been easier .

The statistics around educational ability are interesting .
However , how much of this is due to staggered intakes in certain areas ?
My daughter was born on 14 July and due to start school in Easter 2010 .
Believe me , she is ready for it now .
I know that this is the last year in some LEAs for staggered intakes , so it will be interesting to see the stats in a few years time when the impact of one intake per annum can be truly assessed .
Simon Atkinson , Woodley , Reading , Berkshire
My lad 's an August boy and has just completed his first year at school .
On the day he started I was convinced he was too young and little - he was the smallest boy as well as the youngest in the school .
How did he cope ?
The other kids and school ethos was fantastic and he flew - I look back now and can see that his age made no difference and he has loved being at school .
Paul Hone , Maidenhead
My son was born on 4 September so when he started school he was five and the oldest in his class .
His teacher said that his maturity is more than the other children and his work is top of the class , it is an advantage to be older at this stage in school .
My daughter was born in October so will also be one of the oldest when she starts school , which I 've learned is a good thing .
Jade , Devon
My son's birthday is this Wednesday ( 2 September ) .
He is the oldest in his class and he is very bright , but in his own unique way , so he's not the best in his class at anything .
Neither is he the tallest , fastest or whatever .
All children develop at different rates and in different ways .
These sorts of systems are stupid anyway , schools do n't reflect the abilities of the children in them , nor the needs of society .
They are just somewhere to park your child while you have to go out to work , and when your daughter grows up , she will probably have to do the same .
Julie , Leeds Surely it can't make that much difference ?
I have a June birthday and I do well at school .
I started reception full time two terms later than older members of my class , but that does n't seem to have held me back .
Hannah Farley , Ipswich , England
When I grew up in Belgium - and I believe it still is the case - children started school when they were ready , not when the cut - off date said they should .
I myself was a year early and never had any problems but I was lucky I guess .
Also in Belgium , primary starts a year later than in the UK and children are just that little more mature .
I am sure every system has its pros and cons but I feel that the Belgium system served me and my daughter better than the UK system served my son , born on 28 June and too young to start school as far as I am concerned .
Marc , Barcelona , Spain
It 's my 23rd birthday today and I was the youngest person in my year all the way through school .
But I do n't think this was in any way a disadvantage .
I have two older brothers , which naturally made me more confident and more eager to go to school , and my parents made sure that I could already do the basics of reading and writing before I went into reception .
I finished school with straight As and as captain of the rugby team , and I went on to graduate with a first in engineering from Cambridge .
The main problem is that parents do not always prepare their children well enough for going to school , or they seem to think that their children are too quiet or too shy or too young .
But in reality most kids will probably do well if you give them the confidence and a bit of grounding before they go .

COCAINE and ecstasy use has risen sharply , along with a surge in drive - by shootings , as crime rates fall overall , according to the latest data .
Figures released yesterday from the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research show that Canterbury - Bankstown and the North Shore have emerged as hotspots , with crime rising in three categories in each , while the largest decline was recorded in the inner city followed by the central western suburbs .
Across the state , Sydney had the biggest decline in crime overall , with falls in robbery - with or without a weapon - break and enter , motor vehicle theft , stealing from a motor vehicle and stealing from a person .
Possession and use of cocaine surged by 63.3 per cent in the 24 months to March , which was outpaced by a 72.3 per cent leap in the possession and use of ecstasy .
The possession and use of cannabis was up a more modest 18.3 per cent , with the possession and use of other drugs rising 29.4 per cent .
The head of the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research , Dr Don Weatherburn , said figures for other crimes such as offensive conduct and language had risen .

I like porters .
For those who might be new to my beer review , this is a revelation .
For those learned , well , then it ’s a review .
Porters and stouts are my favorite .
Hands down .
What ’s also nice is having a brewery that presents this echelon of beers so very close to home .
After all , Michigan ( where I presently reside ) is the Great Lake State , and , we do love sharing our beach borders with a few other states .
Hey , we ’re nice that way .
So , Cleveland sits near Lake Erie ( granted , the nastiest of the five lakes ) and the brewery does a fine job of creating a lot of wonderful beers .
So this , the porter , will be the first of a series .
Cuz it ’s fun .
The pour is dark , a little more ruby - hued than I ’m used to with a porter , but very pretty .
The head is rich for a little while , and then it ’s fleeting .
It has a rich , caramel aroma with deep roasty notes and an almost malty finish .
It certainly smells similar to most of the porters I ’ve had .
So far , so good .
The first sip offers up a nutty , deep and intense flavor with hidden nuances of hops and smokey fruit .
Wow , now that was a pompous appraisal , would n’t you say ?
Yeah , I do n’t normally get that intimate , but it was good , right ?
Seriously , it has a very nice and very typical porter - style flavor , though it does indeed have differentiating blends of more subtle flavors .
I do find a hit of bitter hops , maybe a hidden tongue of coffee , and certainly a chocolate mouth - feel that may be even more obvious than many of the other porters I ’ve had that claim to include such ingredients .
It is a darn fine representation , indeed .
As is stated above , there ’s no reason not to match this sample with a nice grilled fair , maybe even a deeply - flavored fish like salmon .
Dessert ?
Sure .
I ’d sit a plate of cherry cordials with it .
Why not .
Enjoy !
Rating : * * * * 1/2
An exceedingly tasty porter full of roasted cocoa hints and a clean , slightly bitter - sweet finish .
Very nice .
Oh , and just in case you are blissfully unaware of what the SS Edmund Fitzgerald was , here ya go !
Wiki -
West Yorkshire , England – Two men who called Auschwitz a holiday camp for Jews have become the first in the UK to be convicted of inciting racial hatred online .
The pair fled Britain for the US after being convicted of running an internet campaign .
But their hopes of being protected by the US free speech laws ended when they were held in custody for a year before being deported to face sentence in the UK .
At Leeds Crown Court , judge Rodney Grant referred to articles published by both men on a website run by Simon Sheppard .
He told them : “ I have rarely seen or read material which is so insulting or abusive towards racial groups within our society . ”
Sentencing Sheppard , 52 , of Selby , Yorkshire , to four years and 10 months , he told him the articles were “ offensive in the extreme ” .
Disgusting Stephen Whittle , 42 , of Preston , Lancashire , was jailed for two years and five months .
The judge told him five articles he published on the site were “ full of hatred and disgusting and abusive in the extreme . ”
Both men were found guilty of publishing racially inflammatory material .
The court had heard earlier articles attacked black people as “ not the equal of whites ” and the Holocaust was “ treated in an insulting fashion and survivors held up to ridicule ” .
The pair claimed they should be aquitted as the articles were posted on a server registered in the US and beyond UK law .
But in a groundbreaking decision , judge Grant determined the publication of the offending material took place when Sheppard and Whittle themselves uploaded the information .
Asia Facing Unprecedented Food Shortage
Asia Facing Unprecedented Food Shortage , UN Report Says
by John Vidal
Asia faces an unprecedented food crisis and huge social unrest unless hundreds of billions of dollars are invested in better irrigation systems to grow crops for its burgeoning population , according to a UN report published today .
[ The UN has said that billions of dollars will be needed to improve irrigation in Asia .

India , China , Pakistan and other large countries avoided famines in the 1970s and 1980s only because they built giant state - sponsored irrigation systems and introduced better seeds and fertilisers .
But the extra 1.5 billion people expected to live on the continent by 2050 will double Asia 's demand for food , says the report from the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ) and the World Bank - funded International Water Management Institute ( IWMI ) .
A combination of very little new land left for cultivation , an increasingly unpredictable climate and water supplies stretched to the limit means the only realistic option to feed people in the future will be better management of existing water supplies , according to the report .
" There is no new land or water to develop so we have to make more use of what we have .
Existing irrigation systems are often 50 to 70 years old .
They are leaking and water is evaporating .
We urgently need a new generation of irrigation .
That is the only way we are going to feed everyone , " said Colin Chartres , who is the director general of IWMI .
" If we do n't [ invest ] we will see food crises like the one in 2007 repeated over and again .
That was an early warning .
If nothing is done , you are going to get an increase in social unrest , migration and a fertile ground for terrorism , " he said .
Since the demise of communism and the rise of the free market , farmers have increasingly opted to take irrigation into their own hands , mainly using cheap Chinese - made pumps .
Tens of millions of smallholders have invested in their own pumps so that they can extract water from shallow aquifers whenever they choose .
Governments have been unable to regulate this practice , which has led to major exploitation of water resources .
Water tables in parts of India and China have dropped catastrophically in the last few years .
" It 's a trend that will become more common .
The consequence will be more farmer suicides , hardship and collapsing enterprises , " said Chartres .
The food crisis is compounded by millions of wealthier people in developing countries turning away from traditional rice and cereal - based diets to western dairy and meat - based foods that require more water , says the report .
" The agriculture of tomorrow will need a lot more water .
Given that one litre of water is used to produce one calorie of food , the world will need up to 6,000 cubic kilometres of additional water every year to feed another 2.5 billion people 2,500 calories per day .
" This is almost twice what we use today and is not sustainable , " said Chartres .
The report urges countries to repair and modernise irrigation systems and use better drip - fed farming .
The UN expects the world to have an extra 2.5 billion mouths to feed within 40 years , most of them in developing countries .
Africa 's population could double , Asia 's could grow by nearly 30 % and Pakistan 's by 85 % .
Guardian News and Media Limited 2009
Last week , we reported that the US House of Representatives voted 316 to 109 to pass HR 3445 , which allocates another $ 2 billion to Cash - for - Clunkers from an energy - loan guarantee program .
A backlog of dealer paperwork and unexpectedly high consumer interest means the program may already have run through the full $ 1 billion allocation in just its first week .
Now the issue has moved to the Senate , where further funding is expected to face much tougher sledding .
This morning , TheHill.com reports that presidential candidate Senator John McCain ( R - AZ ) will lead Republican opposition to any extension of the program .
Clunkers program : " Stupidity "
With automakers issuing sales data throughout day , early reports seem to indicate that sales rose in the last week of July , when the program launched .
Ford eagerly reported its first year - over - year sales gain since 2007 ; Subaru sales are up 32 percent .
But appearing on a Sunday talk show , Senator Jim DeMint ( R - SC ) called the program " a great example of the stupidity that 's coming out of Washington right now . "
Arguments against the program include that it benefits one industry at the expenses of others , that it simply moves sales forward in time , and that it 's wasteful because it destroys cars before the end of their useful life .
From the Democratic side of the aisle , several Senators insist that the requirements for increases in gas mileage are far too low .
Rules : 22 mpg or more for cars
Under the program , owners of 1984 - 2002 vehicles with a combined EPA mileage rating of 18 miles per gallon or less qualified for a $ 3,500 voucher towards the purchase of a new car rated at 22 mpg or better .
The maximum voucher of $ 4,500 was available to those who bought cars rated at 10 mpg ( or more ) higher than the tradein .
There 's a different scheme for trucks :
The new vehicle must be rated at 18 mpg or better , and it also has to be 2 mpg more efficient than the truck traded in to qualify for a $ 3,500 voucher .
Boosting the mileage by 5 mpg or more gets you the full $ 4,500 .

1994 Buick Park Avenue , by Flickr user Rienk Mebius
[ The Hill via HuffingtonPost Green ]
For years , neighbors knew something was off about Phillip Garrido , the registered sex offender now accused of abducting an 11 - year - old girl and holding her for 18 years , much of the time in an overgrown backyard filled with sheds and tents .
One neighbor even called 911 , worried about children living in the yard .
Authorities regularly visited Garrido ’s home in Antioch , northeast of Oakland , but never detected the presence of Jaycee Lee Dugard , whom Garrido allegedly kidnapped in 1991 , or the two blond , blue - eyed girls officials say she bore him during her captivity .
On Friday , authorities retraced their steps to explain and understand where they had failed .
Contra Costa County Sheriff Warren E. Rupf expressed dismay that a deputy had visited the squalid home after a neighbor ’s ominous 911 call three years ago and found no evidence of the crimes .

“ No one knows that we could have found Jaycee or the other children on that day in 2006 , and I cannot change the course of events , ” Rupf told reporters in a televised mea culpa .
“ But we are beating ourselves up over this and will continue to do so . ”
As their neighborhood continued to bustle Friday with FBI officers , sheriff ’s deputies and news crews from around the world , Garrido , 58 , and his wife , Nancy , 55 , were charged 75 miles to the northeast in El Dorado County Superior Court in connection with 29 felony kidnapping and rape counts .
The abduction occurred in the South Lake Tahoe area in that county .
Dugard , now 29 , and her daughters , now 11 and 15 , remained in seclusion in Northern California with her mother , Terry Probyn of Riverside County .
Dugard ’s half sister Shayna , who was 1 when the abduction occurred , was also with them .
Police from Pittsburg , which borders Antioch , began searching the Garrido home for evidence that Phillip Garrido may have been linked to a series of prostitutes ’ murders in the 1990s .
His father , meanwhile , said he was n’t surprised by the news about his younger son and had seen the warning signs decades ago .

Authorities described the Garrido compound as containing a “ backyard within a backyard , ” a squalid complex of tents , tarps and sheds .
A children ’s playground with two swings and a slide sits beside a dilapidated barn .
An empty pool filled with leaves occupies one corner of the yard .
--
Yard never searched
In addition to parole officers ’ regular visits , Rupf said law enforcement officials went to the home on several occasions but never searched the backyard where Dugard lived .

In 2006 , a neighbor called 911 to report that people were living in the yard and said Phillip Garrido was “ psychotic and had a sexual addiction , ” Rupf said .
But the deputy never entered the house .
Damon Robinson , 38 , has lived next door to the Garridos for three years .
His former girlfriend , Erika Pratt , alerted authorities that something was amiss at the Walnut Avenue home .
They had just moved into their house , Robinson said , when Pratt called him at work one day .
She had been showing their new home to a girlfriend , he said , when they peered into Garrido ’s yard .
Pratt “ told me , ‘ They ’ve got tents .
There are people living back there .
Little girls , ’ ” Robinson recounted .
He counseled her to call the authorities , who came and then left .

She was angry , he said .
“ She said they did n’t . . . do nothing . ”
The deputy talked to Garrido in the frontyard of the home , inquired about the tents in the backyard and said there could be some code violations if people were living in them , authorities said .
“ There ’s no crime , and there was a follow - up phone call made to the person that reported it , ” said sheriff ’s spokesman Jimmy N. Lee .
“ The deputy cleared from the scene . ”
Rupf said the deputy did not know that Garrido was a registered sex offender who was on parole for a rape and kidnapping committed in Nevada in the 1970s .
He called the deputy an “ energetic , intelligent , hardworking officer ” and said he “ would not contemplate any discipline ” against him .

Surprise visit
In 2008 , members of a multi-agency task force also paid a surprise visit to Garrido ’s home as part of a sex offender compliance check .
The officers searched every room of the one - story , gray ranch house , Rupf said , but they never set foot in the vast , tree - cloaked backyard where Dugard is believed to have given birth to two daughters .
Advertisement
One reason , Rupf said , was that no parole officer was part of the team , adding that such officers have greater search powers .
In fact , one question that has dogged the Garrido case is how parole officers , who have visited the home a few times a month , could have missed the compound in the backyard .
Garrido has had several parole officers since being assigned to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation in 1999 , said Gordon Hinkle , corrections spokesman .
His latest has been on the case since December .
The officer , whose name was not divulged , never saw anything suspicious when he visited , Hinkle said .
He never saw people other than Phillip and Nancy Garrido and Phillip ’s mother .
But he never went into the backyard , Hinkle said , simply noting the high fence covered by trees and bushes .

‘ Very stealthy ’
“ Most of America , including myself , has been trying to figure out how somebody can go to this house and not see any evidence of people there , ” Hinkle said .
“ We were dealing with a criminal , and he and his wife were being very elusive .
They were very deceptive and very stealthy in how they were keeping these individuals hidden . ”
Garrido was imprisoned in federal and Nevada state facilities from June 1977 to January 1988 , in connection with a kidnapping and sexual assault he committed in 1976 , said Suzanne Pardee , a spokeswoman for the Nevada Department of Corrections .
Advertisement
He had been sentenced to 50 years for a kidnapping she believed occurred in the South Lake Tahoe area and involved crossing state lines .
He was given five years to life for the sexual assault .
He was paroled to California 21 years ago .
On the morning of June 10 , 1991 , Dugard was walking a few blocks from her home in the South Lake Tahoe area to the bus stop when two people snatched her , screaming , as her horrified stepfather watched , authorities said .
Although police received thousands of tips , she was not heard from until this week , when a sharp - eyed UC Berkeley police officer encountered Garrido on campus , accompanied by two young girls she described as robotic and unusually submissive .
On Wednesday , he went to his parole officer ’s Concord office with Nancy Garrido , Dugard and Dugard ’s daughters .
The Garridos were arrested that night .

On Friday in Placerville in El Dorado County , both Garridos were charged with rape , forcible lewd acts on a child , kidnapping for sexual purposes and forcible rape in the Dugard case , prosecutors said .
They were also charged with special allegations that could bring them multiple life sentences .

Father saw signs
In a telephone interview , Manuel Garrido , 88 , of Brentwood , a city adjacent to Antioch , said he was n’t surprised by the news about his son and had seen the warning signs decades ago .
Advertisement
“ They are treating him like he knew what he was doing , but he did n’t know what he was doing , ” the older man said .
Phillip Garrido “ is out of it .
He is a sick man . ”
The father said he and his son became estranged after the younger man was arrested in the Nevada rape .
He has n’t seen his son for more than five years .
Meanwhile , Carl Probyn , Dugard ’s stepfather , said he was heartened to hear from his estranged wife that Dugard had remembered a lot about her life before the kidnapping .
Probyn said his wife did n’t talk much about Dugard ’s mental state .
“ She ’s probably still mentally 11 years old , ” he said .
“ She ’s gone through so much . ”

It seems insane to think that it would be illegal to have a rain barrel and practice rainwater collection , but that ’s exactly what two new laws in Colorado have changed .
Â
Coloradans have broken the law to collect the water drops that fall from the sky because technically they do not own them .
Â Durango resident Tom Bartels explains , “ I was so willing to go to jail for catching water on my roof and watering my garden , but now Iâ€™m not a criminal . ” Â

It ’s hard to think of someone as criminal for collecting precipitation , but many western states closely guard water rights , including water that falls from the sky .
Â
The New York Times explains :
Precipitation , every last drop or flake , was assigned ownership from the moment it fell in many Western states , making scofflaws of people who scooped rainfall from their own gutters .
In some instances , the rights to that water were assigned a century or more ago .
The concern is that collected rainwater will never reach creeks and streams , but a 2007 study found that 97 % of precipitation never naturally reached waterways due to evaporation and plant use thus convincing lawmakers rainwater collection should be legal , well at least for some residents .
Â
Two new laws in Colorado make it legal for some residents to collect rainwater if they have an “ exempt well ” .
Â The Rainwater Observer reports :
The bill will limit the catchments to properties served by an â€œexempt well , â€ that is , a well that is allowed to pump regardless of priority because the amount of water produced is so small that it is assumed that no senior rights holder will be harmed .
Â
While this bill would be a step forward for those who support rainwater harvesting , it would not apply to urban residents since these â€œexempt wellsâ€ are not common in the urban landscape .
Rainwater collecting Coloradans need to apply for a permit and must not use the water for irrigating more than an acre of land .
Â
To be eligible for a permit , you must live outside of a municipal water district and qualify or already have a well .
Â
The other new Colorado rainwater law establishes urban pilot studies for collection .
For residents of rural Colorado , it is a start , but rainwater collection is still illegal in Utah .
Â
Laws vary greatly across the arid West .
Â
The New York Times expounds :
Just 75 miles west of here , in Utah , collecting rainwater from the roof is still illegal unless the roof owner also owns water rights on the ground ; the same rigid rules , with a few local exceptions , also apply in Washington State .
Meanwhile , 20 miles south of here , in New Mexico , rainwater catchment , as the collecting is called , is mandatory for new dwellings in some places like Santa Fe . Â
And in Arizona , cities like Tucson are pioneering the practices of big -city rain capture .
Utah ’s SB 128 could change that by allowing residents to store up to 2,500 gallons of rainwater .
Â
As the West faces continual drought , residents need to be able to legally seek out alternative sources for fresh water ; however , the impact on streams and rivers should be considered .
Â
According to the Sierra Club , rainwater is “ often a problem rather than a resource ” for municipal communities .
Rainwater collection in urban environments could help cities deal with stormwater runoff pollution .
The Public Option : A Look At Defenders , Opponents , And Its Chances
Having moved on from the debate on imaginary “ death panels , ” the public option of the health care reform bill is squarely in the sights of anti-reform critics .
Therefore , I felt we should dedicate some time here to the public option , examined by itself :
WHAT IS IT :
A new , government - sponsored insurance policy that individuals may select instead of one of the many private insurance company policies .
Designed to make sure that more of the 40 million uninsured Americans can get insurance , and to force private insurance companies to start offering better service at more reasonable rates in order to compete against the new public insurance .
WHAT IT IS NOT :
First , it is not free …it ’s cheap , because it will be subsidized .
Second , it is not a “ government takeover of healthcare “ … all of the hospitals , doctors , nurses , drug companies , and insurance companies will continue to stay as they are …it just that some patients will be filing claims with a new “ insurance provider . “
Third , it is not replacing private insurance … you are not forced to go on it , you can keep your existing plan , and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office ’s report clearly states that it will not drive private insurers out of business .
WHAT THE MEDIA IS SAYING :
Regardless of your media source , whether it be any of the TV networks , cable news , newspapers , or radio … you ’re likely hearing that the public option is in “ trouble . ”
In fact , almost all news outlets seem determined ( as in this article ) to paint the option as a “ losing battle , ” and a recent CBS / Wall Street Journal poll showed overwhelming public opposition to the government - run plan .
Oh , but wait … turns out that CBS \Wall Street Poll … the question was reworded to remove the word “ choice . ”
Why would the pollster want to give the impression in the poll question that people would be FORCED onto the public plan ?
Oh yeah …he ’s worked extensively for America ’s Health Insurance Plans ( AHIP ) , an organization that opposes the public option , and who he lists as a current client .
Wendell Potter , former vice president of insurance giant CIGNA , remarked , “ I think it ’s a very big deal to drop the word .
This has been a strategy the industry has had for many years .
They ask questions in many ways , knowing the way they are asking the questions will skew the result .
Dropping the word choice is very important .
It plays into some of the fears some of the people have been hearing lately , that the government would leave them without an option . ”
Curiously , the same poll showed that the majority of Americans have widespread misconceptions about what is actually in the reform bill … and at the same time the poll was CREATING misconceptions .
FYI : Most polls , not run by men working for big insurance , show OVERWHELMING public support for the public option … see here .

Most polls , not run by men working for big insurance , show public support for the public option … see here .
But one corrupt pollster does n’t seem to explain why ALL of the media seems to be wishing for the public option ’s demise .
Tommy Christopher at Mediaite has a theory :
One , they are run by megalithic corporate entities who are ( in general ) against reform … two , they will seize on anything that they can hype to fill a slow news day .
On the latter suggestion , they took “ throwaway lines ” from Press Secretary Gibbs and Health Secretary Sibelius , where they commented that there would still be a reform bill even if the public option was removed .
As Christopher points out , this is a question they get asked a million times a day , and the correct political answer to it is always , “ the bill is still valuable without the public option . “
This is then hyped by the media as , “ Obama Administration Gives Up On Public Option ! !! “
More realistically , when Obama and friends make such statements , they just do n’t want to give Republicans the satisfaction of thinking “ if we kill the public option , Obama ca n’t declare a health care reform victory . “
WHO IS FIGHTING FOR IT :
The Liberal Media : From Rachel Maddow to Keith Olbermann , the message is clear :
The public option is the very HEART of the reform , because with out it , the insurance companies keep doing exactly as they are , and the uninsured … stay uninsured , and we continue towards another economic crisis because of it .
No longer are the fingers pointed solely at the Republican opponents of the option , and liberal pundits are increasingly calling on the Obama administration to abandon bipartisan efforts ( which wo n’t gain even one Republican vote ) and to get their fellow Democrats behind the bill through whatever convincing / coercing is required .
Here ’s Rachel :
The Unions : The unions , like the AFL - CIO have been spending money to support the option through TV spots , and have been organizing counter - protests at town halls .
Now , they have sent a clear reminder to the White House and Congress : “ we voted you in , and we can vote you out . ”
If Democrats fail to show the proper backbone on this issue … the much - needed support of organized labor during the next election , MAY NOT BE THERE .

The Big Dems : Health Secretary Sibelius has restated that , while she did say that loss of the option does not equal total defeat ( again , what else is she going to say ? ) that its inclusion is still top priority .
House Speaker Pelosi has said that the House Democrats stand firmly in favor of the public option .
President Obama … has finally given the task of “ Democrat - arm - twisting ” to Vice President Joe Biden .
And now … there is even talk of bring Big Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton into the fight , as their active support for the option will sway many legislators AND citizens .

The Administration : Duh …it ’s their baby .
Duh …it ’s their baby .
The Liberal Dems :
The number is 60 and growing …60 members of the House sent a letter to President Obama saying that the public option is SO important , that they wo n’t support the bill WITHOUT it .
Senators Rockefeller and Feingold , as well as Representatives Weiner and Pelosi have been vocal and active in leading the charge amongst the legislative “ ground troops . “

They are making phone calls , writing letters , and even managed to raise over $ 100,000 in 24 hours in support of the public option .
Their message is simple : screw Chuck Grassley and compromising that wo n’t earn any GOP votes … go it alone and do it right .

Their message is simple : screw Chuck Grassley and compromising that wo n’t earn any GOP votes …

WHO IS FIGHTING AGAINST IT :
Conservative Media :
No big surprise … when even the mainstream media is having fun predicting the death of the public option , we can only expect Fox , Drudge , Rush , and others to be having a FIELD DAY over it .

Senator Max Baucus , having received more money from the health industry lately than any other legislator …is , not surprisingly , dragging his feet and continues to abandon quality portions of the plan to appease Senator Grassley .
Senator Kent Conrad has started pimping the “ co-op ” idea ( see below ) and claims that there are not enough Democratic Senate votes to pass the bill ( although his assertions are clearly not backed up by facts ) .
Representative Jim Cooper of Tennessee has also jumped on the vaguely - defined “ co-op bandwagon . ”
And of course … there ’s Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle …not really a “ Blue Dog , ” but he might as well be , since he ’s totally in the health care industry ’s hip pocket .

Mysterious “ CIA spy in Iran ” calls for stronger US policy
August 5 , 2009 by intelNews
By IAN ALLEN | intelNews.org |
A mysterious CIA informant , who claims he worked for the CIA inside the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the 1980s , has called for “ a strong Western hand ” against the Iranian government .
In an article published earlier today in The Christian Science Monitor , the informant , who uses the pseudonym “ Reza Kahlili ” , says that defending “ what remains of democracy and freedom in Iran ” is one of the West ’s “ most important decisions of our era ” .
“ Kahlili ” makes vague mentions of working “ for years alongside ” Iran ’s Revolutionary Guards , “ as a CIA spy working undercover [… ] , starting in the 1980s ” .
In arguing for a stronger Western stance against Iran , “ Kahlili ” alleges that , in the 1980s , unnamed European governments made secret pacts with the Iranian government , allowing them “ to assassinate opposition members abroad without interference , as long as European citizens were not at risk ” , in exchange for steady supplies of Iranian oil .
The Christian Science Monitor disclosed “ Kahlili ” is currently “ writing a book about his life and experiences as a CIA agent in Iran ’s Revolutionary Guards ” .
IntelNews hears that “ Kahlili ” went under the operational codename “ Wally ” during the 1980s and that he now lives in the United States .

MARK COLVIN : An unsuspecting Adelaide public servant has found himself swept up in a conspiracy to oust the 44th President of the United States from office .
A movement known as the Birthers , which originated in California , is attempting to prove that Barack Obama was born in Kenya , not Hawaii , therefore making him ineligible to be President .
In a bid to stake their claim they released what appeared to be a Kenyan birth certificate with Obama 's name on it .
Sceptics soon traced the bogus birth certificate and found it to be a forgery .
The document turns out to have been based on the birth certificate of an Adelaide man called David Jeffrey Bomford .
Dina Rosendorff broke the news to him .
DINA ROSENDORFF : David Jeffrey Bomford 's language was a touch too colourful for radio when PM first contacted him with news his birth certificate had been used in a bid to oust Barack Obama .
Now that he 's come to terms with his unwitting involvement in an international conspiracy , he 's slightly more amused .
DAVID JEFFREY BOMFORD : ( Laughs )
That is ridiculous .
Little old person in Adelaide , the President of the United States .
I do n't know whether to laugh about it or not , be worried about it .
It is interesting someone from here being involved in a conspiracy - that is so funny .
DINA ROSENDORFF : It 's believed computer hackers found Mr Bomford 's birth certificate on his family 's genealogy website .
They used it as the basis for a forgery in an attempt to prove President Obama was born in Kenya rather than Hawaii .
Only people born in the USA can be president .*( see editor 's note )
The fake Kenyan birth document has been circulated by political opponents of Obama 's , called the Birthers , who are out to unseat him .
A growing online community who are against the Birthers quickly picked apart the bogus birth certificate and traced it back to about as far from Kenya as you can get - Thebarton Community Hospital at Mile End in South Australia and David Jeffrey Bomford .
As for the unsuspecting man at the centre of the political storm , he says he's not a Birther - just a public service clerk from Adelaide .
DAVID JEFFREY BOMFORD : I 'm not involved in anything .
To think that someone like me would be involved in an international conspiracy , considering I 'm a conspiratist myself , I believe everything in all the old Roswell and all that rubbish .
So this is quite funny .
DINA ROSENDORFF : Do you have anything against President Obama ?
DAVID JEFFREY BOMFORD : No .
I think he was a good choice for President .
Apart from that , I did n't at first think he was a good President but he 's proved himself alright so he changed my mind .
DINA ROSENDORFF : Looking over the documents in question Mr Bomford still can't quite believe his eyes .
DAVID JEFFREY BOMFORD :
It 's little old me and my mum and everything else up there .
Oh I definitely confirm that the birth certificate was mine .
That was quite easy to see - my address , even the style of the birth certificate was an old South Australian one .
So it 's quite easy to identify that it 's mine .
DINA ROSENDORFF : And looking at the fake Kenyan birth certificate what do you make of it ?
DAVID JEFFREY BOMFORD :
It 's definitely a copy of my certificate .
It 's so laughable it 's ridiculous .
DINA ROSENDORFF : Internet security expert Dr Asha Rao from RMIT
University says although this case is quite funny , it 's also very dangerous .
ASHA RAO :
It just shows you what is possible on the Internet ; that ultimately digital documents come down to a string of zeros and ones .
This is an extreme case .
Of course they must have trawled around and found something they could use .
But it 's also , you know , you really do n't , if you put that up , that is the main document that shows your identity .
So , identity theft starts with getting hold of that document .
So it 's very dangerous to put stuff like that online .
DINA ROSENDORFF : Mr Bomford agrees with the experts and says he 'll definitely be removing it from the website .
DAVID JEFFREY BOMFORD : I 'm very surprised at how anyone would even find it on the net unless they were looking for something like that because it 's buried on a little known research site that 's particularly for my family .
So I was very , very surprised that anyone would even find it on the net .
I 'll be certainly contacting my friend who runs that web and asking him to remove it .
DINA ROSENDORFF : But he reckons it 's a good story to tell his friends and family .
DAVID JEFFREY BOMFORD : I 'm not particularly worried about it because no - one would honestly believe that anyone like me would be involved in it - just a grey - haired old guy sitting in a corner in quiet old Adelaide .

* Editor 's note :
The US constitution says the presidency is only open to natural born citizens .
There is a debate going on in the United States on the definition of those words and who is – and is n’t – eligible to run for the highest US office .
More from Gideon Levy :
Then the administration fell into the trap set by Israel and is showing no signs of recovery .
A settlement freeze , something that should have been understood by a prime minister who speaks with such bluster about two states - a peripheral matter that Israel committed to in the road map - has suddenly turned into a central issue .
Special envoy George Mitchell is wasting his time and prestige with petty haggling ...
This i think is the bottom line :
An America that will not pressure Israel is an America that will not bring peace .
True , one cannot expect the U.S. president to want to make peace more than the Palestinians and Israelis , but he is the world 's responsible adult , its great hope .
Those of us who are here , Mr. President , are sinking in the wretched mud , in " injury time . " -- Gideon Levy
Just recently , two large extended families were evicted from their homes in Jerusalem .
Homes they have lived in for 50 years .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton :
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Monday criticized Israel for the eviction two Palestinian families from an Arab neighborhood in east Jerusalem , calling the move " deeply regrettable " .
" The eviction of families and demolition of homes in east Jerusalem is not in keeping with Israeli obligations and I urge the government of Israel and municipal officials to refrain from such provocative actions , " Clinton said .
Regrettable . 50 more Palestinians on the streets and evicted from their homes .
This , Mr. Obama , is much more than regrettable .
Needless to say , this is not progress .
I see a disturbing trend .
I see a President unable to deliver .
Held back by powerful lobbies here at home , working through Congress to push back against even the most modest of demands .
It 's not just folks like me that see AIPAC and its cohorts putting pressure on Congress and the President to block US policy on settlements , it is so open and plain that even someone so usually loathsome in his prowar views as Thomas Friedman can see it .
For the last 40 years , a succession of Israeli governments has misled , manipulated or persuaded naïve U.S. presidents that since Israel was negotiating to give up significant territory , there was no need to fight over " insignificant " settlements on some territory .
Behind this charade , Israeli settlers bit off more and more of the West Bank , creating a huge moral , security and economic burden for Israel and its friends ...
For years , the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations and the pro-Israel lobby , rather than urging Israel to halt this corrosive process , used their influence to mindlessly protect Israel from U.S. pressure on this issue and to dissuade American officials and diplomats from speaking out against settlements .
Everyone in Washington knows this , and a lot of people — people who care about Israel — are sick of it ...
And here , folks , is part of the fruit of their efforts :
A senior member of US President Barack Obama 's party broke ranks on Thursday , blaming Palestinians for a lack of peace negotiations and casting doubt on calls for a settlement freeze .
" I do n't think settlements are nearly the big issue that confronts the Palestinians and the Israelis in reaching an agreement , " said Steny Hoyer ( D - MD ) , the American House majority leader , at a West Jerusalem news conference .
" I think the largest thing impeding them at this point in time is the unwillingness of [ Palestinian President Mahmoud ]
Abbas to sit down now , " added Hoyer , who was leading a 29 - member delegation to Israel and the West Bank sponsored by an affiliate of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) , the largest pro-Israel lobbyist group in Washington , DC .
From here .
Here is what actual acting for peace is up against .
Politicians like Hoyer , a dedicated servant of various lobbies in Congress , saying it is n't important what happens on the ground in the West Bank , in Gaza , and elsewhere ... what is important for Hoyer and gang is that there be :
Photo - ops .
Abbas chatting with Netenyahu .
With nice refreshments .
Press Releases .
Limos to take the diplomats here and there .
Security .
Air Conditioning .
No distractions , and certainly no thinking about what is happening outside .
In the meantime , Israel is permitted to evict families , threaten others with home demolitions , arrest and imprison nonviolent Israeli Jewish protesters , Palestinian protesters .... this is not a concern to Hoyer and his ilk .
Does anyone else think that the attention should be on what is happening in people 's lives , the actual continued and expanding illegal settlements and the suffering of people outside is what should catch the attention of President Obama , and not this " peace processing " that without real changes is nothing more real than a never - ending Broadway extravaganza .
Think maybe Hoyer has this backwards ?
Like really backwards .
Should n't we be putting actual changes in policy as first priority ?
Yes , it 's only 7 months on ... a short time .
So maybe Levy has it wrong , maybe there is still hope for acting for peace , beyond talking for peace , in the Middle East coming from the Obama administration .
But 7 months is long enough to spot a trend .
We need to push Obama to not only stick to the very modest demands he has made of Israel , but also to make Israel refusal to follow past agreements have some consequences , something more dramatic than an official " regrettable " .
Because even if they really , really , mean it , words alone just does n't cut it .
It 's time to end unconditional aid to Israel .
Obama has not said that , we need to say it for him .
Those who want a just peace are being attacked by those who want to stall any real progress .
When we see the destruction of human rights in the West Bank and Gaza , people of conscience must speak out , and call for policies that show our government does not support it , will not subsidize it , will no longer let it go on in our name .
End US aid for Occupation , Mr. Obama .

The UK governments Interception of Communications Commissioner , Sir Paul Kennedy , has revealed in his Annual Report [ 1st Jan to 31st Dec 2008 ] ( Adobe Reader . PDF ) that public authorities as a whole made a staggering 504,073 requests for communications data ( your telephone , email or website access logs etc. ) from Internet Service Providers ( ISP ) and Telecom operators .
The figure is slightly below the number of requests made in the previous year ( 519,260 ) , while police forces and other law enforcement agencies remain the principal users of communications data .
It does not include warrants issued by the Foreign Office to GCHQ and MI6 , or those issued by the N.Ireland Secretary of State .
Still , many people fear that the state now has too much power and is invading the rights of innocent individuals by storing the details ( but not content ) of every phone call , email or website visit we make .
Interestingly the report even admits that " . "
One such example can be found below :
The report does not state precisely what " " have been implemented , which is important because as anybody familiar with the Internet knows - IP addresses are notoriously unreliable .
They can easily be hacked , spoofed , redirected , hijacked and generally abused .
Those ignorant of the dangers always like to say , " , " a popular phrase among many past and present dictatorships or communist states ; we prefer " " as opposed to the " " style doctrine of unnecessary data collection .
Still , the government remains adamant that the outcome of its inspections are satisfactory and the inspectors concluded communications data is being " "
It 's impossible to tell from the limited data whether this is correct , although the multiple news reports about council spying might suggest otherwise .
Presently the government is busy trying to extend its powers even further , albeit while also clamping down on potential areas of abuse ( i.e. local councils ) .
Personally we ’ve always felt that the system needs more court / legal oversight and that the security services and ONLY the security services should have access .
Quite why local councils and in future , potentially , also the NHS and Royal Mail , should need access to our private personal email , website and or telecom logs is quite beyond comprehension .
What do you think , has the state gone too far or is our government only doing what is necessary to combat criminal and terrorist threats against the country ?

Schwarzman 's stock holdings are subject to " a performance - based clawback provision , " which means he might have to give back some of that , and at least 25 per cent of the shares must be retained , according to the report on the top 10 CEO compensation packages .

If the thinking of three York University scientists has been sound , they just might have the world at the end of a tether .
Writing recently in science journal Acta Astronautica , Brendan Quine , Raj Seth and George Zhu have come up with a concept and prototype to create a giant inflatable tower that could carry people to the edge of space .
The three scientists have come up with a plan that could be used to create a 20 - kilometre tower using inflatable modules that could house a space elevator and be used for research , tourism and telecommunications .
" The concept of a space tether that went all the way up to a space station is that if you can ascend the tether electrically or by other means , you could gain access directly to space .
You would n't need chemical rockets , with their danger and often environmental consequences , " Quine said .
" What we 're developing is something much smaller than that .
It would be about 20 kilometres high , and instead of being built from space , it would be built up from the ground .
We would realize this from basically using gas pressure to support the colossal weight of the building .
Even in the 20 - kilometre tower , we 're talking about something that 's twice the mass of a supertanker . "
The idea for a space elevator or tether was first posited by Russian scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in 1895 .
Arthur C. Clarke popularized it in fiction in 1978 in his book , The Fountains of Paradise , but throughout the 20th century , it is an idea that has had many proponents .
More recently , there have been attempts to turn the idea into a reality by New Jersey 's Liftport Group and the Japan Space Elevator Association .
One of main stumbling blocks is that current construction technology is not advanced enough to create a material that is strong and light enough to support the massive weight of an Earth - based elevator and withstand the stress pressures of the altitude and atmosphere .
Some scientists believe that carbon nanotubes might be the answer .
But the York paper provides a much simpler solution to some of the inherent problems , using modules that are already being used in some spacecraft .
" One of our proposed concepts is that you build 150 - metre sections of the tower on the ground , and they consist of pneumatically inflatable compartments made of , say , a material like Kevlar , " Quine said .
" Some of them are will be used for an elevator shaft for access and the rest would be for structural support using gas pressure , or machinery to control the tower .
Then you make 100 of these components and stack them on top of each other , until you achieve a 20 - kilometre tower . "
The modules would be filled with air , helium and / or hydrogen , depending on how elevated the module would be .
Quine also believes that it would likely need to be built in a remote area , possibly on a mountain , so that it would get a bit of a head start .
As well , the tower could theoretically be extended up to 200 kilometres .
At this point though , Quine and his team have built two - , three - and seven - metre prototypes to test the concept .
The idea has been picked up by media outlets around the world , and Quine plans to host a demonstration of the prototypes in coming weeks .
Space tourism is also seen as an area of great potential for this project .
Quine says a 20 - kilometre tower could provide an experience close to what astronauts have – with the added bonus of normal gravity .

" If we created a 20 - kilometre - high tower , from the ground it would take you 40 minutes to ascend to the top of the tower , and if you got up there , the view would be extremely similar to being in space .
You would basically have the view that astronauts have , the black of space , the bright rim of the Earth where the sunlight scatters on the atmosphere and the outline of the continents , " he says .
" We estimate that you could see 600 kilometres in any direction . "

PRESIDENT OBAMA has nominated Francis Collins to be the next director of the National Institutes of Health .
It would seem a brilliant choice .
Dr. Collins ’s credentials are impeccable : he is a physical chemist , a medical geneticist and the former head of the Human Genome Project .
He is also , by his own account , living proof that there is no conflict between science and religion .
In 2006 , he published “ The Language of God , ” in which he claimed to demonstrate “ a consistent and profoundly satisfying harmony ” between 21st - century science and evangelical Christianity .
Dr. Collins is regularly praised by secular scientists for what he is not : he is not a “ young earth creationist , ” nor is he a proponent of “ intelligent design . ”
Given the state of the evidence for evolution , these are both very good things for a scientist not to be .
But as director of the institutes , Dr. Collins will have more responsibility for biomedical and health - related research than any person on earth , controlling an annual budget of more than $ 30 billion .
He will also be one of the foremost representatives of science in the United States .
For this reason , it is important that we understand Dr. Collins and his faith as they relate to scientific inquiry .
What follows are a series of slides , presented in order , from a lecture on science and belief that Dr. Collins gave at the University of California , Berkeley , in 2008 :
Slide 1 : “ Almighty God , who is not limited in space or time , created a universe 13.7 billion years ago with its parameters precisely tuned to allow the development of complexity over long periods of time . ”
Spell Incantation Varies Type Varies Hand movement Varies Light Varies Effect Affects the world in a variety of magical ways Creator Various [ Source ]
A spell is a controlled manifestation of magic that affects the world in a supernatural fashion , such as levitating objects , [ 1 ] conjuring fire [ 2 ] or water , [ 3 ] or stunning an individual . [ 4 ]
Generally cast by a witch or a wizard , spells are often produced with an incantation , and may appear as jets of light .
Because of this spells can usually miss , be dodged , or blocked , either with an object or another spell .
The action of performing a spell is referred to as casting or spellwork .
Contents show ]
Usage
Now , do n't forget that nice wrist movement we 've been practising !
The swish and flick !
And saying the magic words properly is very important , too — never forget Wizard Baruffio , who said ' s ' instead of 'f ' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest . "
— Professor Flitwick in Charms Class[src ]
Normally , spells require four main factors to be properly accounted for in order to succeed : wand movement , incantation , concentration and intention .
If one does not move their wand in the correct way , does not speak the incantation properly and / or cannot retain their concentration and / or desired outcome in their imagination during casting then the spell will fail or backfire .
It should be noted that spells can be performed with or without speech and wands , though non-verbal and wandless spells are much more difficult and hence are usually not taught to practitioners until they reach a more advanced level , such as the sixth year of study at Hogwarts .
[ 5 ]
Notable practitioners of non-verbal spells include Albus Dumbledore , Tom Riddle , and Severus Snape , who have also been known to perform wandless spells .
Most incantations derive from the Latin language ( such as Accio ) [ 6 ] but there are also some English incantations ( such as Obliviate [ 7 ] or Stupefy ) .
[ 4 ]
It could be that , in other countries and wizarding territories , that spells with an English incantation or another incantation other than Latin - based , could be used in other languages , as long as wizards use the same wand movement , concentration and intention .
A simplified analogy for the differentiation between Transfiguration and Charms is the difference between form and function or matter and energy ; one is concerned with what the object is ( its form - Transfigurations ) whilst the other is concerned with what the object is doing ( its function - Charms ) . [ 8 ]
Appearance
When performed , spells usually manifest as light , sparks , lightning , or fiery energy like of various colours from the wand they are cast with , such as the tell - tale red of Stupefy [ 9 ] or green of Avada Kedavra . [ 10 ]
However , some spells , such as Accio and Silencio , produce no visible intermediate effect .
Some spells also make loud noises when cast , although Harry Potter noted that " bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than experience . " [ 11 ]
Durations
Typically , spells brought about through magic have a certain time limit placed upon them .
This means that effects and after - effects magically induced by them are not meant to last , since spells like Expelliarmus only operate brief and swift , [ 12 ] while spells like Stupefy [ 13 ] and Petrificus Totalus wear off eventually . [ 14 ]
Counter - curses can also end a designated spell 's effect .
Likewise , a spell whose effect has yet to diminish would disappear at the moment of the caster 's death .
However , it was mentioned that ancient Egyptian wizards could place curses on their tombs for anyone who might open them , and the curses are still active today even though the casters are presumed dead .
It could be that the Egyptian wizards used curses that could grow stronger over time or at least retain their power after the casters ' deaths , as that is one known aspect of certain Dark magic . [ 15 ]
Memory Charms can be so strong that they completely remove a person 's memory or even damage his or her mind permanently . [ 7 ] [ 16 ]
Origin
" There was a lot more to magic , as Harry quickly found out , than waving your wand and saying a few funny words . "
— Harry Potter learning that magic is not as easy as he thought .[ src ]
Classification
New spells can be crafted by wizards and witches , though Spell creation is a highly difficult and dangerous practice , as exemplified by Pandora Lovegood , who was killed in a backfired attempt at spell - crafting .
Severus Snape is often attributed with the creation of spells such asandduring his time as a student at Hogwarts
Below is a list of all known categories that spells can be assigned to .
It should be noted that when it comes to the classification of spell types , " the boundaries are flexible , " and as such , types of spells may overlap , or have non-indicative effects . [ 20 ]
It also seems likely that certain spell types belong to separate classification schemes to others .
For example : Petrification is dark magic of the most advanced kind , [ 21 ] but it is also Transfiguration , Melofors is both a Jinx and a Conjuration , [ 22 ] [ 23 ]
Fiendfyre could be considered as conjuration as well as a curse [ 24 ] and many healing spells could also be considered either charms or counter - spells .
Hence , it appears that charm vs. transfiguration is one method of classification and differentiation , and that charm / counter - spell / healing spell vs. jinx / hex / curse is a different one .
Spell Type Defining Feature Notes Example Transfiguration Alteration of the object 's form or appearance .
Spells of this group may be separated into true transfiguration spells ( where an existing object is altered ) and conjurations , where the desired object is seemingly transfigured out of thin air .
Vera Verto - a true transfiguration spell that changes animals into water goblets . [ 25 ] [ 22 ]
Avis - a conjuration that produces a flock of birds . [ 26 ] [ 27 ]
Charm Alteration of the objects inherent qualities i.e. its behaviour and capabilities .
When cast by an experienced practitioner , charms appear to usually have fairly long - lasting effects .
Expelliarmus - the Disarming Charm , so - called because it changes its object 's ( the opponent 's ) quality from armed to disarmed by separating them from their wand . [ 12 ] Jinx Minor dark magic ; spells whose effects are irritating but amusing , almost playful and of minor inconvenience to the target .
[ 2 ]
Jinxes can only be maintained as long as the caster keeps eye contact . [ 28 ]
Impedimenta - the Impediment Jinx , which ( appropriately ) impedes the forward motion of an object . [ 4 ]
Hex Consistently affects the object in a negative manner ; has a connotation of dark magic , but more so than a jinx .
Major inconvenience to the target .
[ 2 ]
Densaugeo - a hex that horribly enlargens the target 's teeth . [ 26 ]
Curse
The worst kind of dark magic , intended to affect the target in a strongly negative manner .
[ 2 ]
Avada Kedavra - Kills the target . [ 10 ] [ 29 ]
Counter - spell Inhibition of the effect of another spell .
Counter - spells are a mysterious spell type that is not elaborated on .
There are six known types : Counter - jinxes , counter - curses , counter - charms , untransfigurations , anti-jinxes and undifferentiated counter - spells ( it is unknown whether or not counter - hexes exist , though they presumably do ) .
Whilst nomenclature is complex they all share the common trait of inhibiting another spell .
Finite Incantatem - a widely - employed counter - spell that terminates spell effects in general . [ 12 ]
Healing spell Improves the condition of the living object .
Episkey - heals minor injuries . [ 30 ]
A simplified analogy for the differentiation between a transfiguration and a charm is the difference between form and function or matter and energy ; one is concerned with what the object is ( its form - transfigurations ) whilst the other is concerned with what the object is doing ( its function - charms ) . [ 8 ]
Behind the scenes
J. K. Rowling defined a spell as " The generic term for a piece of magic . " [ 31 ]
" Many spells are portrayed as energy blasts , bolts or beams , sometimes in the shape of lightning , with various colours .
Other times , spells can manifest as balls or bursts of sparks and fire of various colours , vibrational shockwaves , wave like wisps of smoke like energy , or flashes of light , but in many instances , these physical manifestations of spells can be used as projectiles .
Commonly , a spell can also contain great concussive force or even intense heat , especially when they hit something that is not the target of the spell , with it being enough to damage objects or surfaces .
Also , many offensive spells are able to knock down or send a person flying through the air .

Patterns Are Not Scary : Method Missing Proxy
Method missing proxy ?
Ooooh !
Sounds scary , right ?
I got news for you Walter Cronkite , it ’s not .
Lets start with the definition of proxy , according to Wikipedia .
Definition
A proxy , in its most general form , is a class functioning as an interface to something else .
An interface to something else .
That sounds easy enough .
You might be thinking that you have never used a proxy , but if you are reading this blog , you are wrong .
Chances are you have used Rails , and if you have used Rails , chances are you have used has_many or some other ActiveRecord association , all of which are implemented using proxies under the hood .
Creating Your Own
Now that we have definition out of the way and have confirmed your use of proxies , let ’s make one !
Yay !
The people rejoice !
The basic idea of a proxy is a class that is an interface to something else .
Lets call something else subject from now on .
In order to get started , we ’ll make a new proxy that has a subject .
class Proxy def initialize ( subject ) @subject = subject end end proxied_array = Proxy.new ( [ 1,2,3 ] ) puts proxied_array.size # NoMethodError : undefined method ‘ size ’
FAIL !
Our proxy has a subject ( the array ) , but does not proxy anything yet .
In order to proxy up the girl , lets throw in some method missing magic .
class Proxy def initialize ( subject ) @subject = subject end private def method_missing ( method , * args , & block ) @subject.send ( method , * args , & block ) end end proxied_array = Proxy.new ( [ 1,2,3 ] ) puts proxied_array.size # 3
Method missing takes 3 arguments : the method called , the arguments passed to the method and a block if one is given .
With just that tiny method missing addition , we can now do fun things like this :
proxied_array = Proxy.new ( [ 1,2,3 ] ) puts proxied_array.size # 3 puts proxied_array [ 0 ] # 1 puts proxied_array [ 1 ] # 2 puts proxied_array [ 2 ] # 3 puts proxied_array.select { |a| a > 1 }.inspect # [ 2 , 3 ] proxied_array << 4 puts proxied_array.size # 4 puts proxied_array [ 3 ]
# 4
Just like that our proxied array behaves just like the original array .
Well , almost like the original array .
puts proxied_array.class # Proxy
BlankSlate and BasicObject
Hmm , that is not quite what you would expect .
We told the proxy to send everything to the subject , so it should output Array , not Proxy as the class , right ?
The problem is that any new class automatically has some methods included with it .
In order for our Proxy class to be a true proxy , we need to remove those methods as well .
In the Ruby 1.8 series , this is often done by defining a BlankSlate object which removes those methods and then have our Proxy inherit from BlankSlate .
class BlankSlate #:nodoc : instance_methods.each { |m| undef_method m unless m =~ /^__|instance_eval|object_id/ } end class Proxy < BlankSlate def initialize ( subject ) @subject = subject end private def method_missing ( method , * args , & block ) @subject.send ( method , * args , & block ) end end proxied_array = Proxy.new ( [ 1,2,3 ] ) puts proxied_array.class # Array
Yay !
Now we in fact get Array as one would expect .
The great news is that Ruby 1.9 comes with a class like this already named BasicObject .
The easy way to make this work with Ruby 1.8 and Ruby 1.9 is to just define BasicObject if it does not exist and then inherit from BasicObject , instead of dealing with BlankSlate .
class BasicObject #:nodoc : instance_methods.each { |m| undef_method m unless m =~ /^__|instance_eval / } end unless defined ?( BasicObject ) class Proxy < BasicObject def initialize ( subject ) @subject = subject end private def method_missing ( method , * args , & block ) @subject.send ( method , * args , & block ) end end proxied_array = Proxy.new ( [ 1,2,3 ] ) puts proxied_array.class # Array
Just like that our proxy is a full fledged proxy and it works with Ruby 1.8 and 1.9 .
Example : MongoMapper Pagination
So other than ActiveRecord where else can you check out some proxies in the wild ?
In MongoMapper , pagination uses a method missing proxy .
When someone uses paginate , instead of find , I wanted the result that was returned to also function much like WillPaginate : : Collection does , but I did n’t want to inherit from Array .
You can view the pagination proxy on github .
The paginate method that uses it looks like this :
def paginate ( options ) per_page = options .
delete( : per_page ) page = options .
delete ( : page ) total_entries = count ( options [ : conditions ] || { } ) collection = Pagination : : PaginationProxy.new ( total_entries , page , per_page ) options [ : limit ] = collection.limit options [ :offset ] = collection.offset collection.subject = find_every ( options ) collection end
Just like that , paginate returns results just like find , but also includes methods for total_pages , previous and next pages , total_entries and the like .
Example : HTTParty Response
In HTTParty , at first I just returned a ruby hash that was the parsed xml or json .
Then , people started begging for response codes and headers , so I went with a Response proxy that looks like this :
module HTTParty class Response < BlankSlate #:nodoc : attr_accessor : body , : code , : message , : headers attr_reader : delegate def initialize ( delegate , body , code , message , headers={} ) @delegate = delegate @body = body @code = code.
to_i @message = message @headers = headers end def method_missing ( name , * args , & block ) @delegate.send ( name , * args , & block ) end end end
Now I just pass the parsed response , the codes , headers , and such to Response.new and the people who want that information get it and those who do n’t have no API change to wrestle with .
Conclusion
Hope this little primer on the Proxy pattern , specifically using Ruby ’s method missing , is helpful .
I also hope that because of this you check out some of the other great patterns that are out there .
I know I avoided them for far too long .
When applied correctly , they really lead to elegant solutions .
One of the great mysteries surrounding the spread of GMO plants around the world since the first commercial crops were released in the early 1990 ’s in the USA and Argentina has been the absence of independent scientific studies of possible long - term effects of a diet of GMO plants on humans or even rats .
Now it has come to light the real reason .
The GMO agribusiness companies like Monsanto , BASF , Pioneer , Syngenta and others prohibit independent research .
An editorial in the respected American scientific monthly magazine , Scientific American , August 2009 reveals the shocking and alarming reality behind the proliferation of GMO products throughout the food chain of the planet since 1994 .
There are no independent scientific studies published in any reputed scientific journal in the world for one simple reason .
It is impossible to independently verify that GMO crops such as Monsanto Roundup Ready Soybeans or MON8110 GMO maize perform as the company claims , or that , as the company also claims , that they have no harmful side effects because the GMO companies forbid such tests !
That ’s right .
As a precondition to buy seeds , either to plant for crops or to use in research study , Monsanto and the gene giant companies must first sign an End User Agreement with the company .
For the past decade , the period when the greatest proliferation of GMO seeds in agriculture has taken place , Monsanto , Pioneer ( DuPont ) and Syngenta require anyone buying their GMO seeds to sign an agreement that explicitly forbids that the seeds be used for any independent research .
Scientists are prohibited from testing a seed to explore under what conditions it flourishes or even fails .
They cannot compare any characteristics of the GMO seed with any other GMO or non-GMO seeds from another company .
Most alarming , they are prohibited from examining whether the genetically modified crops lead to unintended side - effects either in the environment or in animals or humans .
The only research which is permitted to be published in reputable scientific peer - reviewed journals are studies which have been pre-approved by Monsanto and the other industry GMO firms .
The entire process by which GMO seeds have been approved in the United States , beginning with the proclamation by then President George H.W. Bush in 1992 , on request of Monsanto , that no special Government tests of safety for GMO seeds would be conducted because they were deemed by the President to be “ substantially equivalent ” to non-GMO seeds , has been riddled with special interest corruption .
Former attorneys for Monsanto were appointed responsible in EPA and FDA for rules governing GMO seeds as but one example and no Government tests of GMO seed safety to date have been carried out .
All tests are provided to the US Government on GMO safety or performance by the companies themselves such as Monsanto .
Little wonder that GMO sounds to positive and that Monsanto and others can falsely claim GMO is the “ solution to world hunger . ”
In the United States a group of twenty four leading university corn insect scientists have written to the US Government Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) demanding the EPA force a change to the company censorship practice .
It is as if Chevrolet or Tata Motors or Fiat tried to censor comparative crash tests of their cars in Consumer Reports or a comparable consumer publication because they did not like the test results .
Only this deals with the human and animal food chain .
The scientists rightly argue to EPA that food safety and environment protection “ depend on making plant products available to regular scientific scrutiny . ”
We should think twice before we eat that next box of American breakfast cereal if the corn used is GMO .

Seeds of Destruction
The Hidden Agenda of Genetic Manipulation
by F. William Engdahl

by F. William Engdahl
Buy Now !
This skillfully researched book focuses on how a small socio-political American elite seeks to establish control over the very basis of human survival : the provision of our daily bread .
“ Control the food and you control the people . ”
This is no ordinary book about the perils of GMO .
Engdahl takes the reader inside the corridors of power , into the backrooms of the science labs , behind closed doors in the corporate boardrooms .
The author cogently reveals a diabolical World of profit - driven political intrigue , government corruption and coercion , where genetic manipulation and the patenting of life forms are used to gain worldwide control over food production .
If the book often reads as a crime story , that should come as no surprise .
For that is what it is .
Engdahl ’s carefully argued critique goes far beyond the familiar controversies surrounding the practice of genetic modification as a scientific technique .
The book is an eye - opener , a must - read for all those committed to the causes of social justice and World peace .
What is so frightening about Engdahl ’s vision of the world is that it is so real .
Although our civilization has been built on humanistic ideals , in this new age of “ free markets ” , everything – science , commerce , agriculture and even seeds – have become weapons in the hands of a few global corporation barons and their political fellow travelers .
To achieve world domination , they no longer rely on bayonet - wielding soldiers .
All they need is to control food production .
( Dr. Arpad Pusztai , biochemist , formerly of the Rowett Research Institute Institute , Scotland )
If you want to learn about the socio-political agenda –why biotech corporations insist on spreading GMO seeds around the World– you should read this carefully researched book .
You will learn how these corporations want to achieve control over all mankind , and why we must resist …
( Marijan Jost , Professor of Genetics , Krizevci , Croatia )
The book reads like a murder mystery of an incredible dimension , in which four giant Anglo - American agribusiness conglomerates have no hesitation to use GMO to gain control over our very means of subsistence …

George Clooney is gearing up for a legal war in Italy -- claiming invasive paparazzi climbed over the wall of his Italian home and shot a topless photo of a 13 - year - old girl changing in one of his guest rooms .
The photographer also took shots of Clooney and his girlfriend Elisabetta Canalis enjoying private moments in the yard of his estate .
The photos were published in two magazines -- and in a statement to TMZ , Clooney says he 's gunning to sue both the mags and the photog who took the pictures .
" We 're suing two magazines AND a photographer .
I do n't know about the law in the United States but in Italy it 's illegal for photographers to climb over my wall and to take long lens pictures of a 13 - year - old girl in her bedroom .
I draw the line of privacy at that . "

We promised to keep regular tabs on " G.I. Joe 's " amazingly positive reviews , which are amazingly positive -- so far -- since Paramount has only been showing the film to certified fan - boy zealots , keeping all of the mainstream critics away from the film until it opens on Friday .
Yesterday , the film registered an 80 on Rotten Tomatoes ; today the film has skyrocketed to an 85 , putting it up there with such genuine critical darlings as " ( 500 ) Days of Summer " and " The Hurt Locker . "
Blackfilm.com 's Wilson Morales offered this glowing assessment , saying that " despite all the brou - ha - ha ... about the state of the film , ' G.I. Joe ' is a pure adrenaline fantasy and fun ride . "
Of course , if it was really that good , why would Paramount be keeping all the critics away ?
Let 's see how the film fares tomorrow .
Could it go even higher , like into " Citizen Kane " territory ?
PREVIOUSLY : Will ' G. I. JOE ' REALLY GET BETTER REVIEWS THAN 'THE HANGOVER '?
The vast majority of women in the UK spend more than 30 years of their lives trying to avoid becoming pregnant .
Contraception has been available free from the NHS since 1974 and today there is a choice of 15 methods , so it would seem that avoiding pregnancy should be straightforward .
Yet the evidence demonstrates otherwise , with about one in five conceptions ending in abortion .
An understandable preoccupation with the UK's high levels of teenage pregnancy has had the unfortunate consequence of diverting attention from the importance of contraceptive services for women throughout their reproductive years .
Yet women in their 20s have the highest abortion rates and perimenopausal women are among those who are most likely to choose an abortion if they become pregnant .
Public health campaigns at national and local level have inadvertently given the message that condoms and emergency hormonal contraception alongside the pill are the main answers : EHC and the pill to prevent pregnancy , condoms to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections and to prevent pregnancy .
The information provided has often been simplistic and inadequate .
EHC is a valuable fallback when continuing contraception has not been used or has failed , but it is much less effective than other methods of contraception .
Similarly , the increase in STIs has led to an emphasis on the use of condoms to the exclusion of other much more effective contraceptive methods .
The lack of comprehensive national awareness - raising campaigns about contraception is compounded by the fragmented nature of the services that women are offered .
Very few primary care trusts have undertaken a review of their services or made any assessment of hidden needs .
The majority of women obtain their contraception from their doctor , and GPs mostly prescribe the combined pill , which again is not the most effective method .
In 2005 , guidance from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence recommended that long - acting reversible contraception – the implant , injection and inter-uterine methods , ( LARC ) – were more cost - effective , and since then LARC use has increased slowly .
However , provision is still patchy , and many women are being denied these very effective methods .
Sadly , there is a complete lack of research evidence about women 's contraceptive preferences and many women are unable to exercise an informed choice because they do not know what is available and where .
From 2001 women have been able to buy EHC in community pharmacies , and today they are the main source of this method .
This provision has greatly increased access but it is not known whether women actually prefer to pay £ 25 , or whether difficulty in accessing free NHS provision is forcing them to do so .
Last year the government announced three years ' funding for PCTs to improve services .
Unfortunately , the additional funding to trusts is not ring - fenced and at the end of the first year , little progress had been seen at local level .
While most of the money is to be spent by PCTs , there will be a national campaign aimed at young people to raise awareness of LARC .
Alas , the vital needs of the majority of women are again being ignored , which is not only bad for them but very shortsighted .
Young people get much of their information from their mothers , sisters , aunts and friends .
If older women are ignored by the campaign , enduring myths about contraception may prove more powerful than the national campaign 's messages .
Another significant change is that , since April this year , doctors receive payment for telling women seeking advice about contraception about all the methods .
Some are already seeing an increased take - up of LARC .
This is a complex area and women need comprehensive and sophisticated information so that they can make the right choice for them , taking into account the pros and cons of different methods of contraception , their relative effectiveness and how best to reduce the risk of pregnancy and of contracting an STI .
Strategic health authorities and PCTs must recognise that contraception is central to public health and wellbeing , and give it priority .
The government needs to put in place a national workforce plan to ensure that the professionals are in place to provide the service when and where it is needed .
Women in 2009 should expect no less .
Ubuntu 9.04
Jaunty distribution release date draws near .
Pulseaudio – the future is coming up as well .
I admit that it works better compare to Intrepid , however , I still want to stick to the no-frills ALSA for my Intel on board card .
If Pulseaudio works for you , by all means stick to it .
I merely give you another option to choose .
By the way , I manage to get my mic working 🙂
This guide will help you to kind of disable pulseaudio from starting / avoid pulseaudio to hog the sound hardware .
It also solves the problem of every boot , the master channel is turned all the way down and muted .
The Environments : Firstly , I upgrade my Intrepid to Jaunty RC 32 bits PC through ‘ update - manager - d’.
I have only one laptop so I ca n’t test the vanilla Jaunty RC version .
Though , I will try to match the configuration as best as I can .
Secondly , I have a built - in mic .
Thirdly , the soundcard is an onboard Intel STAC9200 and I do n’t have 2nd soundcard .
For the uninitiate , the $ in front just denote your shell , after that is the command .
Required Packages : alsa-oss ; libasound2 ; libasound - plugins ; sysv-rc - conf ( optional )
$ sudo apt - get install alsa-oss libasound2 libasound2 - plugins sysv-rc-conf
The Procedure :
Step 1 :
When I upgrade to Jaunty , it does n’t install any new ’ 70 pulseaudio ’ file in Xsession .
If there is no such file , safely ignore this step .
If it is present , move it to somewhere safe .
The command below sends it to your home root folder .
$ sudo mv /etc/X11/Xsession.d/70pulseaudio ~/
Step 2 :
Disable Pulseaudio service from run level .
Watch out for the dot at the end .
Else you can use sysv-rc - conf GUI .
$ sudo update - rc.d pulseaudio stop 50 2 3 4 5 .
Unset Pulseaudio from system and set my card from ‘ asoundconf list ’
$ asoundconf unset- pulseaudio $ asoundconf set - default - card Intel
Make sure your libao.conf is using alsa .
Use gedit if you like .
For the uninitiate , to save in nano , press Ctrl + x .
$ sudo nano /etc/libao.conf default_driver=alsa
Navigate from the menu : System – Preferences – Sound , make sure yours looks like the one in the screenshots below :
So far so good .
Cos those steps are similar to my previous guide .
Now come to the more tricky part .
Prevent Pulseaudio from daemonize .
Open ‘/etc/pulse/client.conf ’ with your editor again .
Look for this line ‘ autospawn = yes ’ then change it to ‘ autospawn = no’ .
This folliwng step is thanks to one of my reading of Sonal Santan on the mailing list last time , but now in Jaunty then it can shine .
If the just above step does n’t work properly .
Open ‘/etc/pulse/default.pa ’ in an editor .
Look for lines similar to the following two commented out lines :
#load - module module - alsa-sink
# load - module module - alsa - source device=hw :
1,0
Add the following two lines just after these two lines :
load - module module - alsa - sink device=dmix
load - module module - alsa - source device=dsnoop
The above change will force PA not to take exclusive control of sound hardware .
This step is similar to my old guide .
Open ‘/usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf ’ in an editor .
Comment out the line which says ‘ /usr/share/alsa/pulse.conf ‘ by inserting a # in the beginning .
After the change , the @hooks section would look something like the following .
@hooks [ { func load files [ # " /usr/share/alsa/pulse.conf " " /usr/share/alsa/bluetooth.conf " " /etc/asound.conf " " ~/.asoundrc " ] errors false } ]
The above procedure will make sure ALSA is use system - wise . 🙂
OPTIONAL ( But recommended anyway ) :
Go to this link , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HdaIntelSoundHowto look at this section Manually Specify Module Parameters and do yourself a favour 🙂
Step 3 :
Application specific issue is discuss here .
Mplayer only at the moment .
MPlayer : 10 second wait before audio start playing .
—> Edit ‘/etc/mplayer/mplayer.conf ‘ , change the order to the order below ( original pulse , alsa )
# Specify default audio driver ( see - ao help for a list ) .
ao=alsa
Step 4 :
THE MIC WORKS 🙂 !
This step might need the optional step Manually Specify Module Parameters above .
I will give you a short tutorial on `alsamixer` which is required to get the elusive mic to work .
Open alsamixer by type ‘ alsamixer ’ in the terminal .
In alsamixer , using Tab to change View property .
To MUTE / UNMUTE press m.
To move the slider , use up and down key .
To move to another property of same view , use right and left button .
And the spacebar …
Now guys , you see the box right below the slider ? [ 00 ] == unmuted , [ MM ] == muted .
Check before you keep whining that there is no damn sound .
For the Mic to work , make sure ( look at the screenshot , that ’s how your should looks like )
Capture and Digital properties are not muted / not zero db.
67 is a good value .
Capture should look like in my screenshot .
If your capture looks like , — – then press space bar once to change it to L R Captur .
Mux should be at zero .
Select your Input Source to Mic .
Fire up your gnome - sound - recorder , choose Capture the voila .
The capturing quality is better than M$ Windows with noise cancellation .
Bleh 🙂
Step 5 :
Check that you did n’t miss any step .
Reboot ( do n’t be lazy ) and make sure the damn sound is not muted =.= ” .
Cheers and do n’t disturb me for at least 3 weeks 🙂
Let me be at peace with my exams .
TROUBLESHOOTING
If you get the message as below

Update , 2017
The diagram below is from an article " How Trump Won , in Two Dimensions , " by F.H. Buckley , from The Wall Street Journal of August 10 , 2017 [ A15 ] .
This is the result of a study by Lee Drutman of the " Voter Study Group , " analyzing the vote in the 2016 Presidential election .
Red dots are Republican voters ; blue dots , Democrats ; and yellow dots , " other . "
It is not clear whether Drutman was aware of the history of the Diamond Quiz , but this reproduces the quadrants familar from the examination of the Quiz above .
The upper half of the diagram is socially conservative , the lower half socially liberal .
The left half is low on economic freedom , the right half high .
The Empty Quarter here is the libertarian quadrant , at the lower right , with the whole diagram skewed noticeably to the left , although there is a heavy Republican presence on the economic right .
At the same time , Democrat voters obviously are deeply committed on the economic left , i.e. to socialism , the welfare state , or command economics .
The real battleground here is the upper left quadrant , which on this page is being called " populist " or " authoritarian . "
Here , Republican , Democrats , and a good number of " other " voters heavily overlap ; and this is where Drutman says the election was decided .
Enough people with lefist ideas about economics , who otherwise might have voted Democrat , were socially conservative enough to vote Republican instead .
This was a powerful dynamic , Drutman says , among Catholic voters in , for instance , Pennsylvania , Ohio , and Michigan , which helped secure the victory of Trump .
Of course , we also see Republican and Democrat voters , as well as " other , " in the lonely libertarian quadrant .
The ranks get pretty thin out in the maximum personal and economic freedom direction .
Thus , in general this is a disheartening display for the future of freedom .
But it necessarily leaves some interesting questions unexplored .
In those terms , quite a few social consernatives do n't mind that much what other people do but do want to be left alone in their own convictions .
They are theatened by the program of the left to force radical views about sexuality on everyone else , suing businesses , for instance , where Christians will not provide services for gay weddings , or requiring that women 's bathrooms be open to anatomical males with a female " gender identity . "
Lefists , of course , never ask Muslims what they think about such things ( knowing that homosexuals are executed in Iran and that generally homosexuality is illegal elsewhere in Muslim countries ) ; but they vilify Christians for it .
The vote here therefore may represent a backlash , not so much against " gay rights " as against using such rights to destroy the freedom of others .
There is a similar question down in the lower left " liberal " quadrant .
Not all liberal socialist people agree with the aggressive anti-Christian program .
Bernie Sanders condemns the attacks on free speech at American colleges .
However , Bernie is out of step with his university brain trust , and his own previous love of Cuba and the Soviet Union leaves us wondering about his honesty .
Also , it is unlikely that Bernie would excuse Christians from providing services for Satanic rites , i.e. gay weddings , or would have a problem with anatomical males in women 's restrooms .
When Indiana tried to protect religious liberty , and when North Carolina prohibited anatomical males from using women 's restrooms , the media firestorm was intense and merciless .
Again , the press never asks conservative or observant Muslims what they think -- unless , of course , it is to solicit some anti-American or " Islamophobia " grievance statement .
After all this , one may harbor the suspicion that the dominant opinion at lower left is just what conservatives have understood , that it is intolerant of religious people observing the moral restrictions of their religion -- unless they are Muslims .
We might also wonder about the meaning of the upper left quadrant .
This is the area of the least freedom both personally and economically .
The form of the analysis for the diagram may have confused the meaning on this point .
People who say they are socially liberal , but are intolerant of religious people , and in general believe in a police state to enforce their " tolerant " ideology , belong in the upper left quadrant , not the lower left .
Similarly , religious people who are conservative in their own lives , but who are actually tolerant of other poeple governing their own lives as they wish , may actually belong in the libertarian quadrant .
The quadrant of least freedom has always been proper , at its extreme , to totalitarian ideologies .
While the farcical " Resistance " to Donald Trump portrays him as a fascist and themselves as anti-fascist , the rioting anarchist and communist students at Berkeley are clearly the equivalent of Fascist black shirts ( the dress of the anarachists ) or Nazi brown shirts .
In short , they are the fascists .
And this is widely recognized across the political spectrum , except on the sympathetic far left .
Yet Trump , like many of the conservative Republicans , believes in Protectionist and anti-trade measures .
This probably accounts for most of the Republican voters in the upper left quadrant .
But this also attracted a lot of Democrat voters .
Labor unions have always been Protectionist , and Democrat politicans used to pay more attention .
Union leaders , of course , often have sold out the Democrats so completely ( like NAACP coming out against charter schools , which are more popular with black parents than with anyone else ) , that they ignore the sentiments of the members of their unions .
In the end , what seems unambiguous about this analysis is the unpopularity of economic freedom .
In one way , this is puzzling .
Everyone should know better by now .
But the Fall of Communism has not prevented the American professoriate from finding Communism appealing .
And they teach this to American children .
Of course , Communism fell more than a quarter century ago , so perhaps people have just forgotten .
The economic problems of Europe , however , especially France , are current .
The bankruptcy of Greece is current .
The poverty of Cuba is current .
The hunger in Venezuela is current .
The devastation of Detroit is current .
The flight of people from New York , Connecticut , New Jersey , and Illinois is current .
The prosperity of Texas is current .
The professoriate that ignores the evidence of these things is irresponsible and incompetent .
Of course , there was no reason to have ever believed that English Department Marxism ever would have been competent to make political or economic pronouncements .
This situation therefore only serves to discredit the system and ideology of education in the United States , especially in the humanities and social ( i.e. pseudo - ) sciences .
But this evil may be self - correcting .
College students are realizing that their degrees are not worth what they used to be , especially when the debt they must assume is unprecedented -- and cannot be discharged by bankruptcy -- and especially when a lot of their courses consist of political propaganda that will be of no help to them in finding jobs or pursuing careers -- unless their hope is for a universal minimum income that the Left ( and , astonishingly , some libertarians ) now advocate -- unless they hope to have a career in leftist political activism funded by George Soros .
Male students are realizing that colleges are a " hostile environment " for men , if not also for white people in general .
Thus , enrollments are down .
Some schools have closed unneeded dormitories .
But this is a slow process .
Where H. G. Wells said that , " History is a race between education and catastrophe , " it is now a race between the poisonous " education " current today and its destruction and reform .
It remains to be seen whether the process will succeed in time to avoid the catastrophe .
The Trump Phenomenon
In the history of political philosophy , the freedom emphasized by Rand and the Nolan Chart is only a certain kind of freedom .
It is a modern conception of freedom , formulated in terms of the limitation of the power of government and so the protection of private action from government interference .
This " liberty of the moderns , " as it was first called by the French novelist and statesman Henri-Benjamin Constant de Rebecque ( 1767 -1830 ) in his essay " The Liberty of the Ancients Compared with That of the Moderns , " is very different from the " liberty of the ancients " : the latter originally meant the positive power of citizens to participate in government , while the former means , as Constant put it , " to come and go without permission , and without having to account for [ our ] motives and undertakings . "
The " liberty " of the citizens of Athens meant that , as David Boaz of the Cato Institute says , " Socrates , indeed , was free because he could participate in the collective decision to execute him for his heretical opinions . "
The modern liberty of Americans , however , should mean that an " obnoxious individual " ( as James Madison said ) cannot be executed for practicing freedom of speech or freedom of religion , which were the only complaints against Socrates .
Similar to Constant 's distinction is that made by the recent political philosopher Isaiah Berlin ( 1909 - 1997 ) , who famously contrasted " positive " freedom , the right to exercise political power , from " negative " freedom , the right to be left alone by others exercising political power .
The original Nolan Chart is entirely about the " liberty of the moderns " and negative freedom .
Thomas Hobbes ( 1588 - 1679 ) is often credited with originating the idea of negative freedom and of " civil society " ( as opposed to " political society " ) , which is then that sphere of action free of government control in which citizens actually exercise their negative freedom .
Hobbes , however , was an absolutist who honored nothing in the way of " positive " political liberties and who saw the sphere of civil society and negative freedom as granted and allowed entirely at the discretion of the monarch .
Hobbes ' historic counterpart was John Locke ( 1632 -1704 ) , who saw the " negative " liberties as the original and natural rights of men , which were to be protected , not granted , by government .
Locke believed that , as governments existed only to protect natural rights , the power ceded to government was only a limited grant for specific purposes .
Should government fail in its proper purposes and exceed its legitimate powers , then the government would lose its legitimacy .
This theory is then employed by Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence .
Another recent conception of " positive " liberty , which gets confused with the " natural rights " advocated by Locke and Jefferson , are " welfare rights " such as a right to a job , a right to medical care , a right to adequate housing , a right to disability payments , a right to child support ( from the government in default of a " deadbeat " parent ) , a right to be cared for in retirement , etc .
These , it can be argued , are necessary for anyone to have " real " freedom : " You ca n't be free , " as Dennis Hopper said in the 1969 movie Easy Rider , " if you are bought and sold in the marketplace every day . "
Such positive welfare rights remove everyone from what Marx called the realm of " necessity , " where we have to worry about survival , to the realm of " freedom , " where we can enjoy life by doing what we like .
The problem with " welfare rights " as positive " liberties " is that , while they might enable the beneficiary to do what he wants , they must be applied by the threat or the use of force against the freedom and / or property of others .
A " right to a job " means that somebody else must be required to provide the job .
A " right to medical care " means that somebody else , doctors and nurses , must be required to provide that care .
These kinds of rights thus will either effect " involuntary servitude " on the part of employers , doctors , nurses , etc. , or they will simply require sufficient taxation to hire people who , for enough of a price , will be willing to do these things .
Positive " welfare rights " thus are no different from positive liberties that correspond to political power in general , and they may be assimilated to that in our consideration .
If there are few negative liberties , i.e. if one does not have the right to dispose of one 's body or property as one wishes , this concedes to political power the job of so disposing .
How that political power is used will depend on how that political power is distributed and / or what the political power is expected to accomplish .
How " welfare rights , " which empower political society , have gotten confused with civil rights , which defined civil society and limited political society , may be seen in The Corruption of Civil Rights and Civil Law .
The whole idea of the difference between negative freedom and positive freedom has been attacked in a recent book , The Cost of Rights : Why Liberty Depends on Taxation [ 1999 ] , by Cass Sunstein and Stephen Holmes .
Their argument is that it costs money to enforce both kinds of rights -- negative rights at least need police and courts to enforce them -- and that taxes pay for " negative rights " just as much as for " positive rights . "
Therefore , they are the same thing .
This approach in effect eliminates natural rights , civil society , private property , and privacy , making everything a matter of political control , and so accomplishes the totalitarian project of giving the government control of everything .
They say that " the fact that the Fourth Amendment is violated so regularly shows that the public is not willing to make that investment . "
In other words , taxes are not high enough to make the legislatures , police , and courts do their duty in observing and enforcing the Fourth Amendment .
How more money would make the faithless , who have their own reasons for subverting freedom , faithful , is mysterious .
We might as well ask , " How are higher taxes going to make people like Sunstein and Holmes understand the theory of the Declaration of Independence and remain faithful to it ? "
The problem is not money , but an easily identifiable desire for absolute power -- though it is a clever twist to turn the all - but - worship of taxes by the recent left into a theory of the protection of rights ( welfare rights as well as the right to be left alone ) .
Sunstein and Holmes might take note that " negative rights " are things that can be protected in principle in a " state of nature , " with no government , by effective self - defense , while " positive rights " in a state of nature would mean using force to steal things from unoffending others , or forcing them to do things they do n't want to do .
Since people like Sunstein and Holmes basically want a police state , their eagerness to abolish negative rights is easily explained .
They want the power to steal things and force people to do what they do n't want to do , without having to worry about them defending themselves .
Few more shameless arguments for tyranny have been offered in the 20th century .
Another appalling and even more shameless burst of Hobbesian authoritarianism now can be found in The Myth of Ownership : Taxes and Justice , by Thomas Nagel and Liam Murphy [ Oxford University Press , 2002 ] .
Nagel and Murphy ( on the Law Faculty -- a terrifying thought -- at New York University ) not only reaffirm the thesis of Sunstein and Holmes that rights do not exist without the state and taxes , but they proceed to the logical conclusion that people simply have no right to their property , savings , and income , i.e. to the fruit of their own labor , " in any morally meaningful sense . "
We can have whatever the government condescends to leave to us .
They even say that there is no " defensible " notion that such a right is based on any notion of merit or reality .
This is so vile that it almost defies belief .
It certainly exposes the obvious belief of the Left that all our wealth and possessions really belong to them ( since they think of themselves as the natural and proper rulers ) , to dispose as they wish .
Locke 's idea that the dangers of the state of nature to the growth of wealth motivates the creation of goverment " to secure these Rights " and allow for greater wealth , is now turned on its head , and the likes of Nagel and Murphy interpret the greater accumulation of wealth under the protection of government as meaning that all that wealth belongs to the government .
And , as Hobbesians , they throw it in that even the wealth that one might have secured in the state of nature belongs to the government also .
As Locke or Jefferson would certainly say , these are not the terms under which anyone in the state of nature would agree to a social contract for the formation of government .
It is certainly not the natural law terms under which the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were written ; but then it should be obvious by now , though never spoken in common public discourse , that people like this are promoting ideas that are alien to the American Revolution , alien to American Constitutional principles , and in fact derive from European fascist and communist totalitarianism .
These are men with the hearts of tyrants .
But this will likely not be asserted in " polite " company .
Since the original Nolan Chart employs two kinds of " negative " liberty , it is possible to represent " positive " liberty on a separate axis , producing a three dimensional display of political positions .
[ Click on the chart for a larger version of the image ; or here for a black and white image , which may print out better ]
How much there will be for " political society " and political power to do will be defined by the degree of personal and economic freedom that is envisioned .
With what political power is then to be allowed , the question is then how it is to be exercised .
The spectrum will stretch from the exercise of all political power by one person ( Monarchy , or any individual dictatorship ) , to the equal exercise of all political power by all ( Anarchy ) .
In between the logical extremes , there will be the exercise of power by a relatively limited number ( Oligarchy ) on one side , the exercise of power by majority of all ( Democracy ) on the other , and then , in the middle , varieties of Representative government , with mixed Oligarchic and Democratic forms ( a Republic ) .
A Republican form was envisioned by people like James Madison , who wished to impose practical , and not just theoretical , limits on government by the use of the Separation of Powers and a system of Checks and Balances .
This worked well enough but was ultimately undermined by one grave oversight :
The United States Constitution provided no mechanism for its own enforcement .
That task was soon taken up by the Supreme Court , but Thomas Jefferson realized that the Supreme Court , as a part of the federal government , could not be trusted to faithfully maintain the limits to the power of the federal government itself : " How can we expect impartial decision between the General government , of which they are themselves so eminent a part , and an individual State , from which they have nothing to hope or fear ? "
[ Autobiography ]
In the end , especially during the Civil War , World War I , the New Deal , and the Sixties , the Supreme Court began to concede extra-Constitutional powers to the federal government simply on the principle that it wanted them .
The only mechanism that existed to check the failures of the Court was the torturous avenue of Constitutional Amendment , politically impossible when so many people had begun to believe that unlimited power for the federal government was actually a good thing .
And then again , it is hard to know how a newer version of the 10th Amendment could be more plainly worded than the old one .
A new Amendment would have to descend to the ignoble level of contradicting specific Supreme Court pronouncements that the original Amendment was simply a " tautology " or " truism " that was n't really meant to limit federal power .
( See Two Logical Errors in Constitutional Jurisprudence . )
An effectively updated Constitution would have to address all the sophistry and dishonesty that was used to undermine the original one , besides providing for such additional checks and balances as would abolish the dictatorial powers of the Court .
On the economic spectrum ( X axis ) , a basic division might be made between " social " ( or " socialist " ) forms , allowing little economic freedom , and " market " forms , allowing a lot .
Thus , on the XZ plane , which displays economic freedom and political freedom , the political spectrum divides into " social " and " market " forms .
In " social " forms there may be divergent uses of political power over economics , e.g. in a Monarchy taxation may be directed to the benefit of the monarch and his family and friends , or taxation may be directed to the " welfare rights " of others .
Thus , Otto von Bismark and Wilhelmine Germany sought successfully to defuse socialism through State old age pensions and other welfare benefits .
In a Democracy , the tendency will naturally be for people to vote themselves increasing benefits and thus increasingly to encroach on the freedom and property of those who are economically productive , or at least more productive than most voters .
With the dynamic of " Public Choice " rent - seeking , voters in a democracy will also be tempted to vote and countenance small taxes here and small taxes there , all for some public or personal benefit , without noticing or understanding that the cumulative burden will begin to seriously impact their ability to dispose of their own income and property .
They also may fail to notice that voting for things like publicly financed medical care implies that the government will have the power to forbid " unhealthy " activities which may impose a burden on the public purse , as riding motorcycles without helmets and riding in cars without seatbelts have been banned by many States under federal pressure .
On the personal spectrum ( Y axis ) , a basic division might be made between " moralist " ( or " moralistic " ) forms , allowing little personal freedom , and " tolerant " forms , allowing a lot .
Thus , on the YZ plane , which displays personal freedom and political freedom , the political spectrum divides into " moralist " and " tolerant " forms .
Athenian democracy ( with absolute majority rule , and no independent courts or bureaucracy ) , which condemned Socrates but which had few restrictions on commerce or property , could be called a moralist market democracy ( or a conservative democracy ) .
American government , which edges from a republic over into a democracy ( with confusing oligarchic elements from judicial and " administrative " government ) , with stronger protections for speech and art than in the past , but less strong protections for commerce and property than in the past , could be called a tolerant social republic ( or a liberal republic ) .
The Soviet Union was a moralist social ( i.e. authoritarian ) oligarchy , or monarchy ( dictatorship ) under Stalin .
The Anarchy end might seem to be the negation of political power altogether .
It is n't , because if one were to be an authoritarian anarchist , this would mean that one would be justified in using force against both the person and property of others on the basis of a spectrum of posssible moral or economic wrongs .
" Anarchy " does not mean that there is no political power ; it just means that any political power is exercised only by each individual .
This would have been called the " state of nature " by John Locke , though he would have thought that rights could not be effectively enforced in such a state of nature .
( To Hobbes , rights would n't even exist in the state of nature . )
19th and 20th Century Anarchists have ranged from social anarchists who did n't believe in private property ( " Property is theft , " is the characteristic maxim ) , to those who wanted to limit private property to what could be immediately used by the occupant ( Georgism , like Albert J. Nock ) , to complete libertarian anarchism , where extensive property rights are accepted -- though of course an anarchist owner of extensive property could protect that only by the consent and voluntary or paid help of other individuals .
A Monarchy might be thought to eliminate all other freedom , but the idea of the existence of " benevolent dictatorship , " or of " Enlightened Despots , " like Frederick II ( the Great ) of Prussia , was precisely that someone like Frederick retained all political power for himself but allowed considerable personal freedom , though mainly in speech and thought ( " Say what you like , but do what I say " ) .
At the time , no regime allowed economic freedom much beyond the standard forms of Merchantilism ( though Britain and the Netherlands were already ahead ) .
The accompanying chart contains a set of questions to apply to the third axis of the three dimensional chart .
As above , " yes " answers score 10 points and " maybe " answers 5 points .
These questions on " positive " political liberty address various specific issues of political participation or liability , rather than general constitutional questions .
The test thus does not reflect a simple numerical distribution of power as described above or the subtlety of the previous definition of " republic . "
The test also does not touch the question of for whose benefit political power is exercised , especially in the absence of strong negative freedom , regardless of the distribution of power .
Suggestions are welcome .

At the end of July , I was traveling in the Boulder area and had the privilege of getting a tour of the SparkFun headquarters .
I got my first Arduino from them ; and although I ’m not a terribly frequent shopper , I follow their blog assiduously and I love what they do , so it was a pretty thrilling experience .
SparkFun posts a lot of pictures on their site and they ’re not shy about showing off their facility , but the online photos do n’t give quite the same perspective on their operation that an outsider gets when coming through for the first time .
They told me there was nothing I could n’t photograph and post , so I wanted to share a bit from my tour .
Immediately upon walking in the door , it ’s obvious that this is not your ordinary workplace .
The reception area features two “ just for fun ” projects — the Tron table ( above ) and the GPS clock ( below ) .
Also between my parents ’ feet you can see one of the dogs roaming the hallways .
Before I had even assimilated the reception area , a head poked out of the corner door and asked , “ Are you Keith ? ”
It was Nathan Seidle , the founder himself .
Trevor , the VP who had arranged to give me a tour , was unavailable in a meeting , and the CEO thought nothing of taking time out of his day to show a few people around their workplace .
We started with the office area upstairs .
SparkFun teaches a number of classes ranging from intro to soldering to using EAGLE to selling your widget , and this is the classroom where they ’re held .
The ceiling is festooned with the mini-shuriken punchouts that come sandwiched between Lilypad Arduino PC boards .
The technical support area looks much like any other modern office except for the attire and the dogs .
SparkFun is very “ Boulder ” in being a dog- friendly workplace .
A number of employees have gated areas near their desks where their dogs spend the day napping , roaming , and generally doing whatever it is that dogs normally do outside , at home , while their people are away during the day .
They were all very friendly and well - behaved — maybe the altitude makes them less prone to bark .
After looping through the design area where Nate explained their choice of EAGLE for schematic and board design , it was down to the manufacturing floor .
One of the first things inside the door was this pick - and - place machine for placing surface - mount components on PC boards , which got me all distracted and Nate ended up explaining it to my dad while I mostly stared and drooled .
Auto - changer and different heads for vacuum - picking SMT parts out of tape - and - reel spools .
Yummy !
After tearing myself away from the pick - and - place , we turned to the hand - assembly area on the right .
SparkFun has a demand - driven manufacturing process , with daily build sheets printed each morning to meet actual and anticipated sales demands .
Products with both a lot of components and a large batch to be built that day will be stuffed on the pick - and - place machine ; everything else happens right here .
These guys crank out a lot of boards !
Further back to the left are supply shelves for manufacturing , including the stock of as - yet unconverted phones for the Port - O - Rotary Bluetooth and cellular phones .
Following the supply shelves , we passed through the testing area , where they have a whole cabinet of test fixtures ( of which I did n’t get a good picture ) .
SparkFun has a great tutorial about designing test jigs to test every single item they build before shipping it out the door .
In the very back are the stockroom with products ready to ship ,
the SparkFun limo ( Nathan and a friend bought it from Craigslist because , well , why not ??? ) ,
the receiving , unpacking , and inspection area ,
and plenty of room to grow .
SparkFun is expanding steadily , and this should tide them over for a while .
Thus concluded my tour .
I ’d like to reiterate a huge thank - you to Trevor Zylstra for arranging it , to Nathan Seidle for taking the time to lead us around , and to all of SparkFun for being the kind of place to welcome people in their doors !
Over the past few weeks Iranians have turned their backs on Nokia .
There are widespread reports that many are boycotting the brand while rumors are swirling about a huge bonfire in Tehran , which allegedly consisted of Nokia phones and products .
There have also been reports of vandalism against Nokia posters and billboards .
The picture above shows a vandalized Nokia billboard on a major highway in Shiraz .
The billboard is covered in green paint .
Also there is this poster , which describes a “ new Nokia product , produced with the cooperation of the Islamic Republic of Iran ” that is “ capable of identifying , torturing and killing Iranian youth . ”
These images show Iranian anger against the wireless company after it was revealed to have provided the Iranian government with sensitive surveillance technology that aided in the post-election crackdown .

Captured Caroline . by Quin ======================
Prologue : Just a Quiet Burger =============================
As I neared the state border I turned off the highway and towards the golden arches of an all night McDonalds .
When I 'd planned the route the month before this had seemed the best place to stop , food bought from here would still be warm when I parked up to change the plates .
I parked towards the back of the lot close to one of the lights .
I figured no one would be likely to park close by , I 'd taken a lot of trouble to ensure that she was tightly gagged and that she was tied in such a way that she could n't attract any attention .
Still it paid to go to a little extra trouble and it also reduced the chances of some passer by spotting my home made tags .
I still felt nervous and unsure , copying a stranger 's tags so that you do n't have to cruising a neighborhood with out of state plates is smart thinking and pays off when the jobs over and the cops are looking for clues .
Yet I could n't help feeling that this would be the night the idiot got his car stolen or his wife was rushed to hospital and that every cop in the state would be after that license .
I was at most twenty minutes from the layover when I could switch mine back , I hoped to stay lucky that long .
I got out and pantomimed looking for my wallet so that I could hang around near the trunk .
Nothing , not a peep .
I have to say that I started to worry , maybe she 'd choked or something .
She was a smart girl , a college student , she must see her situation , bound and gagged in the trunk of a car being taken who knows where , her best chance is when we stop .
Then , just when I was about to panic and open the trunk I heard it , a faint muffled cry , so soft at first I thought it was imagination .
I listened and there it was again full of desperation and hope , saying just one thing ` Help me . '
Satisfied that she could n't be heard more than a few feet away I `found ' my wallet and headed towards the doors .
She was smart all right , she 'd waited until she thought I 'd gone before making any noise .
A good idea spoiled only by the tiny amount of noise she could make .
In some ways I was pleased , she was living up nicely to my expectations .
The McDonalds was almost deserted , and was just about to switch to cooking to order .
My fellow patrons consisted of a couple of truck drivers and a state trooper .
I have to confess that threw me at first , but from conversations between him and the staff it appeared he stopped off here every night after his shift .
I ignored him and carried on .
I got them to refill my coffee flask for `later ' and took a coke and the quarter pounders they had left as I did n't want to wait around for them to cook my order .
The trooper said his good - byes and it was with some relief that I saw him drive away .
Once my order was filled I too hit the road nerves on edge but keeping to a nice legal fifty as I headed towards the layover .
I ran through all the events of the past few days again to see if there was anything that could tie me , Richard Cody successful thirty - something computer journalist , with Caroline Conway the struggling eighteen year old psych major currently in my trunk .........
I can't exactly say when the idea of taking a sex slave first came to me .
I suppose every man who has ever been lead on by a woman harbors certain fantasies , any guy with a female boss , any guy stood up or embarrassed or humiliated .
What I suppose made me different from " any guy " was that I had been provided with the means , both financially and practically to carry out those fantasies and make them real .
I could have a woman who could n't say no , one over which I would have total control .
I suppose in reality this started six months ago .
At the time I was dating Samantha Prescott , former model and an assistant editor at Vogue .
I must confess that I had fallen , she was lovely of course , but she also had an elegance and charm which completely won me over .
I suppose I read more into the relationship that she did , certainly I was ready to commit .
I was at that time building a house in New England and contemplating the Great American Novel .
Then out of the blue she called everything off , the next time I saw her was in a tabloid escorting some baseball star to the Grammies .
When she finally answered my calls she as good as told me that I was just a fashion accessory , that literary men had been a feature of the Fall season and that now that Spring was here she and her friends preferred more " physical " escorts .
About a month later one of my editors called and suggested that I did a blab piece on computer porn .
The newspapers and television were in a feeding frenzy about girlie pics on bulletin boards and S&M on the internet .
Apparently a company in San Diego was marketing an S&M Multimedia CD - ROM , and had just won a court battle to allow it 's distribution .
With some reluctance I 'd agreed , chiefly because the Samantha thing had caused me to fall behind with my column .
A few days later the CD arrived .
By then I 'd done the few thousand words of condemnation required by my middle class publisher but I thought I 'd try it anyway just to get some specific quotes .
In the game you play " Dak Forest " a porno film actor .
When the costar of his next flick " Nympho Nurses From Hell " is kidnapped by a Colombian drug cartel , Dak has only three days to rescue her and save the movie .
The script was poor , the video clips included painful acting and in the course of the game just about every female character ends up bound and gagged either naked or in some kinky outfit .
Part way through the game a character is introduced called Samantha Pressman , she is the editor of a fashion magazine who is kidnapped by the cartel and turned into the nymphomaniac sex slave Kitty , who acts as Dak 's sidekick from then on .
To anyone who knew her the similarities between this character and Sam Prescott where overwhelming , the actress even looked a lot like her .
I found myself playing the same section again and again .
Sam kneels before Dak and begs him to whip her , spank her , humiliate her .
Dak of course refuses , but that and some of Sam 's heavier scenes kept me hooked on the CD weeks after my article was printed .
I started to ask myself if it was really that difficult to take a woman and make her your sex slave .
I had a secluded house with a large basement that I 'd originally designed as a computer lab .
I had few friends who lived nearby so impromptu visits were unlikely .
In addition I had the money and the time to make it work .
Suddenly it became clear what I should do .
I could n't take Sam of course , the history of our relationship was too well known .
For a wild second I even considered taking ` Kitty ' and driving her back from California .
In the end I realized that I needed a woman with whom I had no contact , a complete stranger preferably from some distance away so that the police investigation would n't get too close to home .
I looked at a map and selected a college town about three hundred miles from my home .
Colleges mean young female students a good starting point for the selection of a slave ..........
By now I 'd reached the turnoff I 'd been waiting for .
This lead down a tree lined lane into a wooded hollow .
I had come across the place by accident whilst scouting out the area a few months before and could hardly believe that I 'd found somewhere so perfect .
I 'd spent a couple of nights here to assure myself that this was n't the local lovers lane , or the favorite route of poachers .
In the end however I had to accept that it was what it appeared to be , a rough dirt road leading to a small wood , and that the place was deserted at night .
I drove carefully into the hollow , this was n't the night to slide into a ditch or have a flat .
I assured myself that we were far enough from the road and that no one was watching .
Finally I got out , went to the back of the car and opened the trunk .
Two large , frightened blue eyes stared back at me over the mass of Ace bandage that covered her lower face .
The bandage was tight and her cheeks bulged out over it , in places there was a flash of silver where the bandage failed to cover the duct tape underneath .
She made a mewing sound and started to struggle , I carefully checked her bonds .
In a sense we were both acting out our roles , she as victim , I as kidnapper , we both knew she could n't get free .
She was dressed in the same outfit she had worn that morning to her Saturday job , a fairly expensive blue blazer and skirt , a white blouse , heels and stockings .
I had pulled her long blond hair back into a kind of ponytail and secured it with some rubber bands , it cascaded onto her back like a horses mane .
I had considered removing the blazer before tying her but this power dressing had reminded me of Samantha , so instead I had added to the ensemble .
Her ankles where cuffed , good solid black leather bondage cuffs bought from a sex shop in New York , in many ways they matched her pumps and proved I could " Accessorize " .
At the moment they were fastened together with a padlock and linked by a long leather strap to her wrists .
Smaller straps clinched her legs together just above and just below the knees effectively immobilizing them .
I had done the same at her elbows but had used duct tape to secure her wrists and hands .
Even her fingers where covered in a mass so thick it appeared that she was clutching a bowling ball .
As well as securing her hands the mass also stopped another leather strap from biting into her wrists and it was this strap that was also secured to her ankles .
After checking everything was secure I removed the strap that formed the hogtie .
She groaned with relief and started to straighten her legs .
I grabbed her by the arms and pulled her clear , then slung her over my shoulder and carried her round to the open passenger door and placed her inside .
Closing the door I entered via the drivers door .
For a second we sat looking at each other , then she started to struggle and I went back to the job in hand .
" Stop that ! "
She turned and looked at me , her eyes framing a silent question .
" No I 'm not going to kill you if you do n't force me to .
If I 'd wanted to kill or rape you I could have done it back in that alley and saved myself a lot of trouble .
Now stop struggling , you 've been alone in the trunk for the last three hours , if you could n't get free then what chance do you have with me here ? "
She stopped and sat watching me with a nervous expression on her face .
" Look , I have a proposal to make , we 've got a long way to go and things are going to get quite unpleasant for you unless we can come to some arrangement . "
She continued to listen , her large accusing eyes watching me .
" You probably need the john and you must be thirsty .
I have a drink for you and some food .
For you to eat it I have to remove the gag , you can scream all you want out here and no one will hear you , all you 'll do is piss me off , clear ? "
She looked out of the car window at the quiet secluded woods .
" Is that clear ! " I snapped .
She turned back to me and nodded , her ponytail bobbing behind her .
" Ok , I want you to promise that IF I remove the gag , you 'll let me replace it again when it 's time to go .
You 'll be quiet , you 'll eat the food then we 'll head off again . "
She looked at me incredulously and I began to realize just what expressive eyes she had .
" I suggest you think about this , you were n't able to stop me gagging you in the first place , and you wo n't be able to stop me now , all you 'll do is force me to hurt you .
Besides cause me trouble now and we simply do n't stop until we get were we 're going , I know which of us will suffer most . "
I could see the calculations in her eyes , here was definitely a bad place for her with no chance of rescue .
I could see her thinking that the next stop may offer more possibilities and that she should n't blow it now .
At length she nodded .
" So let 's check that we 're clear on this .
The gag comes out , no screaming or carrying on , you eat then you let me gag you again with no trouble ? "
Again she nodded so I told her to bend down whilst I undid the bandage .
Pushing the ponytail away I worked on the knot then I unwound the bandage and dumped it on the floor .
She started to protest when I started pulling the duct tape free but at last I removed it and the dense sponge rubber ball that packed her mouth .
She licked her dry lips , " Water ? " she croaked .
I put the straw to her lips and she started to drink greedily .
Finally she stopped and looked up at me , " Why are you doing this ? " she asked looking at me with those big expression filled eyes .
" Shut up , " I said , " I did n't say you could talk . "
" You did n't say I could n't . "
" You 'll learn , " I said and reached for the sponge ball .
" No ! " She said quickly , " Look I 'm sorry .
I 'll be quiet , promise ! "
Without a word I held the first burger to her lips and she started to eat .
There continued a strange silence until she was finished .
I reached back , plucked the toy bag from behind her seat and started to root around inside .
At length I found what I wanted and pulled out her collar .
Seeing it she started to protest but then she caught my eye and sat meekly as I locked it around her neck .
Then I pulled out a leather gag , this time she could n't stop herself .
" What ... "
" It 's your gag . "
" But I thought .... "
She nodded towards the sponge ball .
" That design is very effective but the adhesive from the tape damages the skin .
This is a better long term solution .
Now open wide .. "
" But ... "
" Are you breaking your promise ? " " No but ... "
" Then open up ! "
She sighed resigned to her fate and opened her mouth to let me put the gag inside , then she bent forward as I secured the straps .
The gag had a wide padded leather section that covered her lips and a strap that tightly fastened around her head .
I could tell that she 'd worked out that the ball in her mouth was a lot smaller that the last one .
She made a number of muffled sounds that were much quieter that they should be .
I think she thought that I 'd overestimated the gag 's effectiveness and she could exploit that later .
I reached into the bag and got the pump .
At first she did n't recognize what it was and it was only when the ball in her mouth started to inflate that she realized the truth .
Eyes wide and bulging she started to protest , her whines becoming steadily more muffled as the ball inflated .
When I was satisfied that she was gagged as effectively as before I replaced the pump in the bag and withdrew the padded leather blindfold that matched the gag .
She spotted this and wanted nothing to do with it she shook her head , struggled and whined as I strapped it in place .
I pulled back and she sat there shaking .
Deprived of sight she felt even more vulnerable .
Her almost covered face , gag and blindfold scanned the car as if waiting for something to happen .
I left the car and walked around to the passenger side with the bag .
Opening the door I swung her bound legs out and clipped a short length of chain between the D rings of her ankle cuffs .
I removed the padlock joining the cuffs and then the two leather straps leaving her legs free but hobbled at the ankles .
Then I secured another chain to her collar to act as a leash and pulled her upright .
A little unsteadily she followed me to a tree where I secured the leash to a low branch .
" I 'm going to leave you here while you pee is that clear ? "
She tried to say something .
" The panties ? "
She nodded , " No problem . "
She squealed as my knife cut them off .
I watched her squat against the tree then returned to the car .
In the trunk next to the spare wheel was my license plates , with some relief I removed my clever fakes and replaced the legal ones .
I watched while she shivered by the tree .
I was n't concerned , even if she somehow slipped the leash she could n't get far in a wood blindfolded and hobbled .
At length I collected her and returned her to the trunk .
I re-secured her legs and hog - tied them back to her wrists .
She moaned and struggled back to her role as victim .
" Hey sweetheart . "
Her leather covered face turned towards me .
" I 'm not a bad guy I know it can be boring in here .
I have some entertainment for you . "
With one quick motion I slipped the vibrator into her pussy and turned it on low .
A strangled moan came from behind the gag and she started to struggle as I secured her knees and trapped the buzzing intruder inside her .
The moans and groans continued but the hogtie deprived her of the movement necessary to remove it , if of course that was her intention .
Her hips moved as much as they could and muffled moans came from behind the gag .
Once again I tucked the blankets around her for sound insulation and shut the trunk .
In the eerie silence of the woods I could still hear her faint moans .
Satisfied that the vibrator , with it 's long life batteries , would keep her distracted until we returned home I returned to the drivers seat and drank my coffee .......

Chapter 1 : The Selection and Capture of a Slave .
=========================================
It had been fate that delivered her to me .
I discovered that a small software house was holding a product demo in the town I 'd selected as my hunting ground .
A small startup company made up of young graduates , they where based near the university .
I was preparing another blab piece on innovation in the computer industry and so had an excuse to go , it seemed like a good opportunity to scout around .
I think the company had been surprised when I accepted , I was the only recognized hack that had bothered to attend .
In any case they were all over me , I got a private demo and enough disks and promotional material to supply the whole press corps .
They were keen young men desperate to make a good impression .
One even showed me the local night life and over some beers he told me of the best student hangouts , information which I stored away for later .
The next day was to have been the main demo and having seen the package already I had intended to send my apologies and use the time to check out prospective targets .
In the end however I elected to turn up for at least the first half hour .
They had hired a couple of girls from a local modeling agency to look pretty during the presentation .
Neither was exactly what I was looking for but on a whim I hung around until lunch to practice my stalking skills .
The girls headed off downtown to a small restaurant where they met with friends .
It was here that I first saw her , tall , shapely , blond , Caroline .
With a decent makeup job and some reasonable clothes she could have made a good living on the modeling circuit .
As it was she had a fairly poor dress sense , which reduced her from stunning to just good looking .
I knew then that this was the one I wanted .
Not only could I train her as my slave I could eventually mold her into the kind of escort to make the Sam Prescotts of this world seem ordinary .
After her meal she said her good - byes and left .
Once outside I followed her back to a local department store , here she worked as a cosmetics saleswoman .
She seemed to be fairly junior , supplying free makeovers to women brought to the counter by more senior staff .
I went to a rival company 's stand and made some excuse about needing a last minute birthday gift .
The girl was helpful and I managed to keep her distracted enough that I could watch Caroline across the floor .
She had a certain intrinsic elegance that shone out despite her dowdy looks .
Trade was slow and from the banter I picked up between the other saleswomen it became clear that Caroline was a student working here part time .
Realizing I could n't continue to hang around without attracting attention I purchased enough perfume to keep the girl happy then left and headed off for the rest of the day .
I had bought a late model medium sized domestic sedan to use during the abduction .
My researches had shown that this was a popular type and color and indeed I saw a number as I drove around .
In the end I selected one and followed it to a small car park .
Here a guy got out and went into an office building .
I noted his plate then headed back to the store in time for closing .
I followed from a distance as she left work and headed down a set of back alleys to a place where a small car was parked .
I nearly lost her as she drove away but fortunately the traffic slowed her until I could catch up in my car .
I followed her to a small apartment building near the university .
I had caught her first name in the restaurant and from the bell box I saw that she was Caroline Conway and lived in 23C .
The next morning she was working in the store as usual , during the night I 'd formulated a plan .
First I hired a cell phone from a local company that were happy for me to take it for a few days when I claimed mine was damaged .
This gave me a local number .
I had spent most of the previous evening filling a small notebook with cryptic notes and I put a woman 's name on the cover .
I had noticed that Caroline carried a small black leather purse with her at all times .
I guessed that they may be available from the store where she worked .
Another quick `birthday gift ' shopping trip and I had it's twin together with a woman 's billfold .
In the stores toilets I assembled my decoy .
I placed about $ 300 in the wallet and dropped it into the bag , then added some old keys , some change , the notebook , a pen and some of the perfume I 'd purchased the day before .
I figured it would weigh about right and that she may not immediately realize it was n't her own purse .
I assumed that she would eat lunch in the same place and again fate was with me .
I sat on the next table just behind her as she sat and gossiped .
I paid for the salad I bought and while the waitress took their order I quickly swapped purses , stuck hers under my coat and left .
I explained to the cashier that I was waiting for a friend who had n't shown and that I was off to find out where he was .
Would she hold my table for fifteen minutes until I got back ?
A large tip ensured she would .
I knew I had little time , there was a key and heel place down the block and a hardware store a little beyond that .
Out of sight I removed her apartment and car keys and ensured they had no ID .
I stopped at the heel bar first , dropped off the car keys and paid for a duplicate set .
With the excuse that my lunch break was almost over and I had shopping to do I left them with the promise that the keys would be ready when I returned in five minutes .
Then I went to the hardware store where I got the apartment keys done quickly .
In their toilets I quickly went through the rest of the purse .
I was relieved to see that she had no bottles of medication or cards indicating a serious medical complaint .
What she did have was a large number of unpaid bills , and of course a motive to disappear .
Collecting both sets of keys I headed back .
In all it had taken me ten minutes before I was back in the restaurant .
The decoy had worked well , and it was still where I left it .
If I could n't get the purse back to her she would find the decoy and assume some mistake .
If she dialed the number on the notebook she would reach the cell phone and I had a plausible story prepared about my absent minded wife and her talent for mislaying her purse .
I would then arrange a place for an exchange .
I doubted she would be suspicious but I was still relieved that she and her friends ordered coffee and were too distracted to notice when I successfully switched her purse back .
I tailed her back to the store to ensure this was n't a college day , then went to her apartment .
I rang the bell first in case there was a room mate or a boyfriend , then went up and scouted things out .
I discovered that she was a psych major struggling to meet the demands of the course and of her day job and that she apparently lived alone .
She had awful dress sense seeming to choose baggy clothes that hid her figure and colors that did n't suit her .
Although this was puzzling her wardrobe did provide me with details of her clothes sizes that would let me order some of the more exotic outfits before I collected her .
The absence of a boyfriend and estranged letters from the family assured me she would n't be missed for some time .
I was almost tempted to wait and take her then , but I did n't want anyone to place me near the scene so instead I decided to wait a month and returned home to prepare ...
The dungeon was close to finished .
I had managed to do most of the work myself and the little extras I 'd had to get my contractor to do ( like putting water into the small basement room ) were easily explained by my love of photography .
Before collecting my model I went to New York on a fetish buying spree .
Gags , cuffs , whips , chains , harnesses , toys and a reasonable fetish wardrobe started to fill the dungeon .
I managed to pick up some reasonable strong secondhand furniture to liven up the place , the only problem now was collecting Caroline .
And that was n't going to be easy .
I mapped out her movements as I knew them .
Up at seven , out at eight thirty , work by nine , lunch twelve to one .
The problem was not what she did but the fact that everyone else did them at the same time .
At least a dozen people left her apartment building within fifteen minutes of her every day .
I as I looked into it in detail it began to seem that there was not a moment when I could reasonably expect to have her alone long enough to get her and make off unseen .
First her apartment was on the third floor of a small student tenement , there was frenetic activity all the time .
Though I had keys to the apartment and could easily ambush her there day or night there was no method I could use to get her out of the place unnoticed .
I had no doubt that I could take her , but someone was bound to mention the guy with the " drunken girlfriend " or the dude with " the big box " when the police started asking questions .
I could wait until the early hours but then the back door leading to the car park would be locked so I 'd have to take her through the front doors .
I determined that it was never quiet enough for that to work .
The apartment 's car park was above surface and at the back of the building .
Between 7 AM and 8 PM there was a back exit open to allow access .
Unfortunately it was clearly visible from the road and worse it was a short cut to the nearest bar .
Therefore an ambush in the car park was n't on either .
On TV of course it's all terribly easy , the heroine leaves her apartment and gets into her car .
Suddenly the menacing bulk of the bad guy looms behind her and a gloved hand closes over her mouth .
In the next scene she 's unconvincingly bound and gagged on her own back seat as the bad guy telephones the hero to arrange a meet .
Of course the heroine always drives a big domestic car , if she were wise and had bought a small compact Japanese model like Caroline she would have only needed to worry about midget and contortionist kidnappers .
The only real opening was that she left the store slightly later than everyone else .
I could in theory jump her in the back alleys leading to her car .
Unfortunately * MOST * of them were well used short cuts which was probably why she felt safe using them .
The only exception was an alleyway close to the store , here at that time I could expect to have her alone for perhaps fifteen to twenty minutes .
Unfortunately the alley was too narrow for a car , it did however lead into an wider alley linking two blocks .
This wide alley was quiet enough that I could get perhaps five minutes parked there before I congested traffic but simply put it was too busy for me to leave a car there during the kidnapping .
For a while I played with the idea of stashing her in a dumpster while I went for the car , but even with the best gag in the world she 'd make too much noise for me to leave her the twenty minutes I needed .
I started to wish I knew more about drugs so that I could knock her out , but I knew that unless I was very careful I could kill her .
What I needed was a way to overpower her and to make her invisible for perhaps twenty minutes .
Then fate again stepped in .
During another shopping trip to NYC I made the mistake of taking a short cut through a particular alley .
About half way through I became aware of someone by my side , before I could react someone pushed something into my side and it was all over .
A cop told me later that it was a stun gun , an electrical device that delivers the victim a debilitating charge .
I figure I was out of it for perhaps ten minutes , which had been enough time for the guy to make off with my wallet .
The police had got there so fast because a bum sleeping in the alley had flagged them down .
I had to confess that I had n't noticed him , and neither it seemed had my attacker , as the cops caught him at the next block .
I slipped the bum a C note for his help before heading off to my destination .
I was more careful from then but it got me to thinking .
Over the next few weeks I practiced my capture technique using an inflatable doll part filled with sand .
Counting in my head , I choreographed , handcuffing the wrists , gagging the mouth , securing the legs .
When I could bind my unresisting vinyl victim in under three minutes I returned to the Big Apple and hired a woman who advertised as a " Professional Submissive . "
She made it clear that she was n't into " rough stuff " but apparently rape fantasies were common to both her male and * FEMALE * customers .
We worked out what she called a " scene . "
She would enter her bedroom as a " tired business executive . "
I as a passed over rival would jump her , bind and gag her then " punish " her for getting " My promotion . "
The plot was lame but apparently a popular one with her other customers , she offered several others but all I wanted was to refine my technique on a real struggling body .
After the first time I made some changes , she was to make as much noise as possible at all times , she would get a hundred dollar bonus if she kept me from tying her for two minutes and I was allowed to tie her as I wanted .
The first couple of occasions she was up by two hundred bucks but after that it became easier to subdue her .
I tried out several types of ties and gags looking as much for the type of movement and sounds the victim could make as for the degree of immobilization or silence .
Finally I was happy I had found what I wanted so I packed my equipment and started the long drive that would end with Caroline .
That Friday I followed her around .
I kept fairly clear of the store as it had security cameras and store cops but I attended her regular lunch break .
Her two model friends were off to a trade fair in Chicago , bad news it seemed as she needed somewhere to stay for a few days .
The landlord was apparently evicting her on Monday and she needed to move that weekend .
With a put upon sigh one of the girls offered a spare key to her apartment but made it clear this could n't be a permanent arrangement .
For a second I considered rethinking my risky plan in favor of taking her there but I figured with my luck this apartment would be even worse than the current one .
What was clear though was that I needed to move quickly , for some reason and despite the fact that I had intended to kidnap her the next day I felt compelled to move things forward .
Trailing her back to the store I slipped off down back alleys to the place where she parked her car .
Then I stole it , simple when you have the keys .
I 'd already been warned about the " bad " side of town so that was were I headed .
I parked in a back street and left the car open with the keys inside before making it to a more busy street and flagging down a cab .
I had been away from the car perhaps five minutes before the cab drove past the back street .
By then the car had gone , destined for the chop shop or perhaps a new identity like it 's mistress .
I was dropped off in the town center and recovered my car from the car park .
Next I drove out to her place .
The block was as quiet as it got as I walked up the back stairs in my disguise .
I was wearing jeans and a hooded track suit top and had a couple of books under one arm .
As the " instant student " I went into her apartment unobserved .
To my surprise the contents of the rooms had been packed into a number of largish boxes .
Only a little food and the pillows and bedding were still out .
Good fortune having smiled on me again I started to move the boxes down the back stairs to my car .
Several people seemed to be moving at the same time and it became easy to loose myself coming in and out .
I ensured that I was relatively unobserved loading the car and hung around in the stairwell to ensure no one saw me enter her apartment .
It took perhaps twenty minutes to do the whole thing .
I searched afterwards to ensure that nothing valuable was left behind but deliberately left the place untidy .
As a final gesture I left the final notice on the table together with enough cash to cover the back rent .
I reasoned the super would find it on Monday and assume she 'd moved out .
I 'd put the boxes on the back seat of the car but I put the pillows and comforters in the trunk as added sound insulation .
Driving to a secluded spot I got ready for the final assault .
Under the track suit top I put on a harness to which were clipped the items I would need quickly .
Looking back I wonder why I did this , my " appointment " with Caroline was n't for some time and the harness was bulky .
I reasoned it was best to get used to it so I did n't appear odd when I approached her .
I drove back to the town center with the intention of hiding behind the dumpsters in the alley until she left work .
Taking a large cardboard box half full of equipment to the alley I quietly moved one of the dumpsters a little to allow a six foot gap between them .
I had just unpacked the box when a sob alerted me to someone 's approach .
Dumb as it was I peered around the dumpster rather than hide immediately .
It was her !
I could n't believe it , she was walking down the alley sobbing quietly over an hour too soon !
I panicked , there were just too many people around at this time for it to work , the store would be closing in a few minutes and the alley would fill with her fellow workers .
The cold realization hit me that I 'd overplayed my hand , that after all the planning and expense I 'd been just a little too impatient .
I could n't take her now , but if I did n't she would discover her car missing and the things gone from her home .
There would be police reports , questions , in essence Caroline Conway would become too noticeable to just disappear .
I had failed and beyond that I was mad .
Mad with Samantha for starting this thing in the first place , mad at myself for my impatience but above all mad at her , at Caroline , for having the ill manners to be early the one time it really mattered .
Then before I knew what I was doing I was standing next to her .
" Caroline ? " I asked and as she raised her tear - filled eyes to mine I pressed the stun gun into her side and pushed the button .
She made an " Uhhug " sound as her contracting diaphragm forced the air from her lungs .
A pained and surprised look spread over her face as she started to fall .
I directed her on to the open sleeping bag I 'd just spread between the dumpsters , I looked down the alley both ways and saw no one , then I proceeded on autopilot .
The handcuffs were first , unclipped from my harness and then fastened , one pair on the wrists the other on the ankles .
Next came a dense sponge ball apparently designed for people to practice games near glass windows .
It was quite unyielding and despite the lack of resistance it took some pushing in .
I sealed it there with two quick strips of duct tape , each starting along the jawline , crossing over her lips and ending on the opposite cheek .
Again I checked for people aware that this alley would be at it 's busiest in a few minutes .
Fortunately I was still safe so I continued to cover her mouth with strip after strip of tape .
Then following the plan I strengthened the bonds before she could move again .
Four leather straps , two above and bellow the elbows , the same at her knees .
I quickly removed the handcuffs from her ankles and from the box pulled out a pair of bondage cuffs already locked together with a padlock .
I strapped them on her ankles and she attempted to kick me and made the first sounds since the stun gun was fired .
The sound was soft but still was n't quiet enough , turning her on her side I gathered her hair into a single bunch , holding it with my right hand I used my left to move an elastic band from around the right wrist on to the hair .
A couple of quick flips and the hair was bound into a pony tail and kept out of the way of the next stage .
I could hear people leaving the shops down the alley .
I thought of leaving her like this but she was still too noisy .
Quickly and brutally I wound an elastic bandage around her head and over her taped lips .
I knew it was really tight but at that moment all that mattered was the effect it had on her cries .
Not only were they more muted , they also became lower and more guttural as she had to do more with her throat .
I could see shadows moving in the far end of the alley .
By now it was too late to escape .
I would have to hide and hope that my idea would work .
Rolling her on to her stomach I used a spare strap to hog - tie her wrists to her ankles .
Satisfied I threw the other end of the sleeping bag over her and zipped it up .
After some fumbling it was zipped , because she was near the bottom of the bag it closed over her head .
Quickly dumping the other rubbish from the box , I used the top of the sleeping bag to pull her head up and pushed the box down over her upper body .
Dumping half a bottle of cheap whiskey and some rubbish on the bag I stood the half bottle strategically next to the wall and slid behind the dumpster .
She must have heard them because she tried to struggle and scream as the first people walked by .
Of course she was too late , the passers by smelt the strong alcohol , saw the ripped sleeping bag and cardboard box and " saw " a bum not a kidnapped girl .
Social conditioning being what it is the more sound she made the more she became invisible to the passers by .
Just another street person best ignored lest they tap you for pocket change .
I hid and watched , pleased that the plan had worked but still a little disturbed at how faceless society had become .
As I crouched there I went through her purse , found a hastily written notice of dismissal from the store and understood the tears .
Just before it was quiet enough for me to leave for the car , two of the women from the cosmetics counter where she worked stopped by the dumpsters .
I froze convinced they had recognized something that I 'd forgotten .
In the end however they just lit cigarettes , and gossiped about how " that stupid bitch , Caroline " had pushed her luck too far .
Perhaps recognizing the voices she tried to struggle and scream again , one commented that the cops should lock such people away and they flounced off with a self congratulatory waddle .
Looking down on her as she sobbed inside the sleeping bag I began to think that I could be doing her a favor and that of all the people she knew only I her kidnapper , her rapist , her MASTER really cared what happened to her .
With this in mind I checked the coast was clear and opened the bag .
The handcuffs on her wrists were already biting , cutting off her circulation .
The extra strain from the hog - tie was making it worse , she must have been in agony .
I released the hog - tie and started wrapping duct tape around her wrists , when I had built up enough I removed the handcuffs and continued over her hands .
I was able to force her to lace her fingers together with threats of a knife and taped her fingers into a solid mass .
The result was that when I reapplied the hog - tie strap it bit into the tape not her wrists .
She seemed happy that the pain had stopped so I re-interred her in the sleeping bag and box .
Then I piled other rubbish around her and went to get the car .
That trip took me twenty minutes and it was with some trepidation that I approached the dumpsters again .
I pulled off the box and was relieved to see her gagged face rather than the street cop I 'd half expected .
She was sobbing , huge tears ran down her face .
Quickly I blew her nose and warned her to stop blubbing or risk suffocation .
I do n't know how many people walked past her as she lay bound and gagged in the alleyway , but the experience of being so helpless yet so close to rescue had filled her with despair .
She gave me little trouble as I moved her from the alley into the trunk of my car .
I quickly packed the blankets and pillows around her to further muffle her and to minimize the risk she could somehow pound on the metal of the car .
Satisfied I quickly cleaned up , dumping most of the stage dressing for my " bum " in the dumpsters .
I started to throw the whiskey in too but an impulse stopped me and instead I placed it where only an invisible man would look and left to take my prize to her new home .
*****************************************************************
Chapter 2 : An Introduction to Slavery ================================
Sitting there sipping the coffee and reviewing the past few weeks I felt the tension slowly drain from my body .
I had her .
Not only that but as far as I could see I had left no clues other than ones that pointed to her leaving of her own free will .
Police do n't handle missing persons cases promptly anyway because the majority of people turn up in the first few days .
Seen from their point of view we have Caroline Conway , struggling student already being evicted who suddenly looses her job then disappears with all her possessions .
Not a good candidate for being a criminal case .
I packed everything away and started to put the pieces of her gag into the McDonalds bag along with the wrappers .
At length I picked up a piece of tape with traces of her lipstick on it .
The color seemed in some way wrong for her and it struck me as being a little odd that someone who made money applying makeup should botch her own so badly .
Still this was a mystery I would have plenty of time to investigate at my leisure .
Starting the car I left the hollow and headed back to the highway .
I was about four hours from home a distance I intended to take in one go .
I 'd held out the hope of other layovers and chances of rescue to buy her cooperation and I wondered how long it would be before she realized she 'd been tricked , assuming that she noticed anything above the persistent throbbing in her crotch .
Not that it really mattered of course as she did n't have a chance to complain .
The rest of the drive was fairly uneventful , I stopped for gas once at a small self service station .
If I had been unlucky I suppose someone could had driven up and heard her , but it was about 2 am by now and the cashier and I were the only ones for miles .
It was about four when I pulled up outside my house .
A stand of trees and a high brick wall shields it from the road so I could remove her without attracting any attention .
Again I hobbled her legs , though this time she was more cooperative probably to speed removal of the vibrator that still buzzed inside her .
Her thighs were slick with her cum and the sweat told of her exertions .
Taking the leash I lead her into the house and down into the basement .
I 'd left part of it unfinished so that the odd nail or hole would n't look out of place .
Originally I had planned a large lab under my office but now that section of the basement was hidden behind a swinging bookcase in the corner .
For now I locked the leash over an exposed beam and left her there .
Racing upstairs I changed into my master 's outfit , a cotton shirt , black leather pants , boots and matching gloves , after all my first act would be to dress my slave appropriately and the least I could do was reciprocate .
I returned to the basement where she was trying the extent of the leash and screaming behind the gag .
Without saying a word I moved the bookcase and stepped beyond .
This space had been designed to be fairly large .
Originally I had intended to surprise my friends with this room and so had kept it a secret .
That was useful now it 's purpose had changed as it stopped embarrassing questions ..
At the far end I had built a small room with a heavy iron door .
Inside was quite spacious , enough room for a double bed , a chair , a table and a chemical toilet .
That was her cell the rest of the place could best be described as the dungeon .
On one wall I had cemented in a steel latticework that stood out a couple of inches from the wall itself .
This provided ample anchoring points for straps and restraints .
The other wall had a number of large rings for the same purpose .
Near the door was a locked steel cabinet and an old wooded wardrobe .
Going to the wardrobe first , I selected an outfit for her to wear from the clothes I kept there .
The visit to her apartment had shown me that she was a conservative dresser .
This outfit screamed slut and sex and was guaranteed to embarrass her .
I had no doubt the kidnapping had rattled her , now I had to keep her hesitant , uncomfortable and unsure as I started to mold her as my slave .
Most of the clothes here were off the shelf vinyl , leather and rubber stuff from the sex shops of New York .
Being her first night however I went for something special .
I 'd ordered this ensemble from a specialist shop in LA .
using the measurements I 'd taken from her clothes .
Their catalog had contained several more specialist creations which I intended to order once I 'd broken her in .
Next I unlocked the cabinet and removed some restraints , a new gag , a pair of shears and a small riding crop then returned to the main basement .
By now she had given up struggling and just stood in the center of the room shifting her weight from foot to foot .
I let her stew a little longer as I walked around and surveyed her fine body .
Then I walked over and removed first her heels then the cuffs from her ankles .
The sudden loss of height made the leash pull tighter at the collar and she whimpered slightly .
I reached down , placed the shears against the hem of her skirt and with one movement cut it all the way to her hips .
Of course I could have removed the skirt without cutting , but these clothes were her last personal possession , the last vestige of her personal identity .
Destroying them was a symbolic act .
The skirt was relatively simple , the jacket took more time , the blouse shredded in seconds .
By now she was yelling and thrashing around , but the ever present bite of the collar kept her in check .
I felt a little guilty cutting off her bra and garter belt , I loved lingerie , but accepted it had to be done .
Finally I pulled off her stockings and she stood before me naked but for the bondage , her blindfolded face tracking backwards and forwards waiting for the next attack .
Her breasts heaved as she sobbed silently .
I looked at the matted triangle of her pubic hair , damp from the vibrator but still too thick for my taste , she had an appointment with a razor tomorrow .
Next I moved a small table close enough to her that she could reach it with some effort and placed the outfit on it Then I cut the tape from her wrists and her hands before removing the blindfold .
She stood blinking as sight returned .
then immediately her hands flew first to the back of her head where the gag was secured then to her neck and the collar .
In both cases she found small padlocks making removal impossible .
She murmured something then turned to face me .
I flexed the crop and smiled .
" From now on I will call you slave or cunt , you will call me master or sir .
You have no rights , I own you completely , even your body is mine , understand ? "
Her big blue eyes just stared at me incredulously .
" I want an answer slave , DO YOU UNDERSTAND ? "
This time when there was no answer I slapped her breast with the crop , she jerked to attention .
I pulled the crop back as if I was going to strike her face , she held up her arms and cowered .
" Understand ? "
She nodded .
" Good , lesson one obey first time every time and you 'll avoid punishment .
If you do n't you 'll soon understand what pain really means .
Clear ? "
She nodded , this time the response was much quicker .
" You are here as a sex slave , as your master I will use your body as I see fit for my personal pleasure .
You will obey me immediately and do the same for any others I designate .
If you obey orders and do n't try to escape you will avoid punishment , if not the severity of the punishment will increase .
I wo n't kill you unless , you threaten my life or my security but push me too far and I can permanently disfigure you .
Understand ? "
Again the nod , this time however she was looking at the ground so I put the end of the crop under her chin and raised her head so that I could stare into her frightened eyes .
I pointed to the clothes on the table with the crop .
" Put those on . "
She looked at them , on top was a shiny black latex bustier , at various points the rubber had been ribbed to provide support making it resemble a space age corset .
She turned to me and I could see that she was thinking about it .
" Put it on . "
She continued to just stand , I had brought some handcuffs with me in case she was difficult .
I was going to cuff her hands and punish her when suddenly I saw a better solution .
I pulled the table back out of her reach and smiled .
" We 'll see how you feel in the morning . "
I said and turned towards the stairs .
I was halfway up them when I heard her frantic mewing .
She had realized that eventually her legs would tire and that she would be choked by the leash .
I went back down stairs .
" Ready to cooperate ? "
She looked at the floor , then nodded .
I offered her the bustier , but when she reached for it I snatched it back .
" First , dance for me . "
She looked confused .
" Obey me first time , every time remember ?
This is your punishment , I 'm going to go easy on you this time .
Now dance or I 'm off to bed . "
Slowly she started to gyrate as much as the chain would let her .
" Is that the best you can do ?
Sexy , Slave I want you to dance sexy . "
I did n't think she was really trying so I applied the crop to the sections that did n't move enough .
She yelped a little but after about the first dozen she was doing the best she could .
I could tell that the nakedness troubled her .
Right now she would rather wear the kinky clothes than stay like this .
Most of my blows had been to make her move her hands from breast or crotch , I figured if she wanted to touch them that much I should encourage her .
I smiled , " I 'm afraid that you 've proved you do n't deserve this fine outfit .
If you want it then you are going to have to earn it piece by piece .
Now cup your breasts and offer them to me .
A muffled sound came from behind the gag . "
" First lesson ! " I said as I settled back in a chair .
She cupped her breasts in her hands and thrust her chest at me while all the time gyrating to some imaginary tune .
" Now play with the nipples .
When she hesitated I flicked the crop towards her .
She sobbed but her hands slid up her breasts and her thumbs flicked the brown nubs which soon hardened before her .
I tossed the bustier to her .
" Slide it up and down your body . "
This time she complied quickly , making involuntary crooning sounds as the cold latex touched her hard , sensitive nipples .
Finally I 'd seen enough .
" Ok now put it on . "
She struggled into it , all the time eyeing the crop fearfully .
It fit her better than expected , forming a shiny second skin from just below her nipples to just above her crotch .
It was so tight that her navel was clearly visible and her tits were trust up and out making them appear even more prominent .
The hard brown nubs of her nipples stood to attention just above the top of the cups and just cried out for attention .
I began to regret not bringing some clamps with me .
Still there was time for that later .
I held up a long black latex glove .
" Play with yourself , you do n't get it until you 're wet . "
She glanced at the glove then at the stairs .
Then , while one hand continued to stroke and fondle her latex covered breast and nipple , the other drifted to her clit where she started to finger herself .
I looked at her , the eyes where now glazed and full of silent tears .
I tossed her the glove .
" Get off with it , " I said .
She looked up eyes full of both humiliation and confusion .
Grabbing the other glove I passed it between my legs then with one hand holding from the front and the other from the rear I slid it backwards and forwards across my crotch .
She looked on horrified and I was sure she would die rather than do it .
Then slowly with hands shaking she copied my action dragging the slick glove backwards and forwards across her cunt until the surface was wet with her cum .
I made her repeat the procedure for the second glove .
Her hands were shaking when she slowly pulled the gloves up her arms .
I made her continue to play with herself and the tactile stimulation of the smooth latex seemed to seize her .
Suddenly she closed her eyes arched her back and started to play in earnest , oblivious to my presence .
At first I was tempted to whip her , then I remembered the discomfort she had shown at my seeing her naked .
Quietly I slipped back to the dungeon and took a loaded camera from the cabinet .
By this time she was so far gone that she did n't realize what I was doing until I already had three shots .
She stood there horrified at what she was doing and of the thought that it was captured on film .
I seized on her confusion and quickly tossed her the latex stockings with instructions to put them on .
I took more photos as she pulled them up her legs and fastened them to the garters of the bustier .
Next I passed her one of the five inch stiletto boots .
" Fuck yourself with the heel . "
By now tears of humiliation and frustration were following down her face , she looked at the floor sniffed and brought the heel up to her cunt .
" You do n't get the other one until I see you cum , understand ? "
She nodded and started to move the heel in and out .
I snapped more photos , she stopped , sobbed and tried to say something .
" Keep it up , " I said , " We do n't have all night . "
She tried to say something again .
I brought the crop down on one of her exposed nipples .
She let out a muffled scream .
" You 'll get one every 30 seconds until I see you cum , now do it cunt or my god I 'll make you suffer ! "
She started in earnest ramming the heel in and out of her hole .
True to my word I slapped her when the 30 seconds were up , after that though it was unnescessary .
She bucked and moaned her upper thighs and the tops of her stockings now slick with her juices .
Finally she shivered and groaned , I just tossed her the other boot .
" Put them on . "
She stood before me a vision in leather and latex , no slut or whore could look more perfect .
From the bondage elements of collar and gag , though the sheer kinkyness of the outfit to her juices streaming down her latex clad thighs I surveyed my slave .
Behind the shame and humiliation in her tear - filled eyes there still burned a trace of defiance , something I could break over the next few months as I molded her into my creature .
" If you had obeyed me first time an hour ago we could both have been in bed by now and you could have saved yourself all this trouble . "
She nodded , tears still rolling down her face .
I tossed her some leather cuffs .
" Wrists and ankles , NOW ! "
She put them on without hesitation all the while looking at me with those big eyes .
I stepped behind her and fastened the wrist cuffs together before adding a hobble chain to the ones at her ankles .
Then I removed the leash and lead her to the chair next to the small table .
Using some of the straps I 'd removed earlier I secured her to the chair .
She was unresisting , all rebellion temporarily crushed by humiliation and shame .
I removed the gag and offered her a drink .
She accepted then asked , " Why me ? " " Because I wanted you , " I said .
" But I ha ... " I slapped her mouth .
She looked at me stunned .
" Not * I * , " I said , " Only a person can be an * I * .
You are not a person , you 're an object like any possession .
* YOU * do n't exist anymore and have n't done since the moment I took you .
The only identity you 'll have from now on is the one I choose to give you . "
She looked up , terrified tears welling in her eyes again .
" From now on you will refer to yourself as `slave ' , understand . "
That 's all you are for the moment , just a thing for my pleasure .
I may give you another identity some day but you 'll have to earn it first .
Say , ` I am a cock sucking slave slut . ' "
She shook her head her self esteem denying this last humiliation ..
I brought the crop down hard on her right nipple , she yelped .
" Say it ! " " NO ! " I spun the chair around .
Now had access to her uncovered cunt and her legs were strapped to the chair where she could n't close them .
I whipped her exposed pussy .
" I am a cock sucking slave slut !
Please Master stop ... " she screamed then started sobbing .
I pushed the ball gag I 'd taken from the cabinet between her teeth and fastened the strap .
Her brief show of resistance had crumbled , I unfastened her from the chair and lead her into the cell .
There I fastened the collar to a steel wire attached to a pulley wheel on the ceiling .
The wheel ran on a small track which lead from the bed to the toilet .
I kept her hands cuffed behind her but removed the hobble .
She lay on the bed sobbing .
" Hey cunt , " She looked up , " Just something to contemplate , I have n't punished you for your insolence back there .
I have something in mind but it will have to wait until morning , you might want to ponder that . "
I closed the cell door on her muffled cries .
*****************************************************************
Chapter 3 : Opening Events =======================
I do n't think there has been a moment in my life that compares with the realization that I 'd got her .
My mind was full of possibilities , of the things I 'd planed and of my slave .
I fell to sleep that night with the image of my slave , bound , gagged and subdued in all her fetish finery burning itself into my brain .
I awoke full of life , reveling in my achievement .
Although I 'd read of many cases of sexual abduction ( in fact studied many in preparation for this ) no one had achieved what I had done .
I had a pretty coed bound and gagged in my basement , kidnapped from a busy alleyway in plain sight of at least a dozen people .
I felt like a god , now at last I had a woman who could n't say no , who would n't lead me on and then dump me as Samantha had .
I chuckled to myself , for now she was my prisoner but soon I would start to train her as my slave .
Slowly over the coming months , using torture , humiliation and sex I would slowly break her , destroying her identity , her self worth and gradually crushing her will until there would be nothing no mater how low or vile that she would n't do if I ordered it .
I gradually let the megalomania sweep over me savoring every moment ..... then I pulled myself back into line and started exercising the personal discipline expected of the master of such a beautiful slave .
One feature of the house that had been in the design from the beginning was it 's audiovisual distribution system .
In happier times I 'd intended it to allow Sam and I to access cable , satellite or video from any part of the house .
It had proved extremely flexible and coupled with hidden camera 's from an enhanced security system gave me access to any room in the house .
Reaching for a remote I turned on the bedroom monitor and entered the security code that accessed the camera in Caroline 's cell .
Caroline slept fitfully under the dimmed lights of the room .
Her position had changed little since I 'd left her .
Her hair was tousled though still held it it 's makeshift ponytail .
A few blonde strands had escaped and lay on her pillow next to the damp patch where she had drooled past the gag .
She looked so helpless that I was half tempted to go down and wake her , but I 'd been planning this for months and could wait .
With remarkable resolve given the circumstances I turned off the monitor , bathed , dressed and went downstairs .
In my haste to get Caroline inside last night I 'd left the car next to the side door instead of in the garage .
Whilst this was n't a problem ( the driveway has a gate ) part of me wanted to get the car out of sight as soon as possible .
I backed the car into the garage then started to transfer it 's contents into a small storage room at the back .
Most of Caroline 's sparse belongings were destined for the bonfire , I 'd only taken them to support the idea that she had moved out ..
Some things however were more important and as I stacked the boxes for later sorting I came across exactly what I 'd been looking for , a small box full of her personal papers .
Finishing up I took the box inside and made myself breakfast .
The box contained the sorts of things you 'd expect , High School diploma , family photo's , letters .
The real find for me though were the diaries , about a dozen of them ranging from exercise books to pretty little things with brass colored clasp locks .
The collected thoughts of a girl from her early teens to the present , invaluable stuff for her kidnapper .
Ultimately these would be the skeleton keys that would allow me to unlock her mind and give me access to the deep personal places I 'd have to violate if she was ever really to be my slave .
For now however they had a more practical use .
The kidnapping itself had gone without a hitch , my " Bum " rouse had allowed me to take her in broad daylight surrounded by people .
In addition the loss of her job and apartment had given her a good motive to disappear .
For the moment her friends would think she was at home and her family would think she was still at university , it was perfect .
Unfortunately it was also temporary .
Sooner or latter some friend would try calling her at home or family letters would be returned unanswered .
Eventually the alarm would be raised .
The police would investigate and it could be that they would find something I 'd overlooked .
Alternatively they could find a witness who remembered the strange student in Caroline 's building on the day she disappeared or someone who could place a man in the alleyway that evening .
I needed to buy time for memories to fade or better yet , direct people 's attention away from that area all together .
In short I needed letters , cheery postcards sent to favored relatives , excited jottings to friends all in saying the same thing .
" I 'm alive , free and happy living in another state . "
I had no doubt I could get her cooperation , apart from physical torture I controlled all aspects of her life from food and drink to when and if she went to the toilet .
Eventually when she'd been conditioned to obey that would be unnecessary , but for now I needed information .
I needed a source from which I could verify birthdays and the existence of relatives .
Whilst I intended for her letters to appear self absorbed and mention as little as possible that could be verified , missing a favorite aunts birthday could give the family a clue that something was wrong .
Yet I had to be able to check her writings so that she could not pass a distress message in the letters .
The diaries would be my verification .
I started sorting through the books wondering how difficult it would be to break the spines and scan them into a database .
Then suddenly I came across something odd .
One of the pretty notebooks with the brass clasps had been forced .
At first I assumed she 'd lost the key though this did n't make much sense as the locks are principally decorative and a key from any of the earlier diaries would fit .
Then I noticed that some of the pages had been torn out .
The book covered summer of three years ago around the time of her fifteenth birthday .
I decided to look into this later , for now however I divided my time between eating breakfast , reading her mail and watching " Caroline TV " .
Her bound form was just as tempting as ever .
She thrashed around on the bed in a feeble attempt to wiggle free .
Then she spent about twenty minutes rubbing her mouth against the edge of the bed trying to work the gag free .
Finally , realizing that escape was futile she lay back down and sobbed .
Looking down I found I was hard again .
Summoning up my self control I managed to go to my study and knock off a quick thousand words on " Power PC vs. Pentium " for my New York publisher .
In breaks for inspiration I continued through her mail and made a startling discovery .
Caroline was the daughter of the REVEREND Charles Conway and his wife Judith .
Quickly I paged through the photo albums until I found what I wanted .
The family portrait was not inspiring , an older dour looking man , the picture of a bible bashing Baptist stood next to his younger dowdy , once pretty wife .
He looked fierce and unbending , Judith looked down , the perfect picture of subservience .
One of the reverend 's eyes seemed fixed on the girls Caroline and her younger sister Anna , who stood with military stiffness before him .
Now Caroline 's drab taste in clothes began to make sense .
Suddenly I could also see a way to get her to write me those letters .
It would require some planning so I shelved it for now but the thought of it clawed at my mind and in the end I could resist no longer .
I quickly finishing up the article , hurried to the kitchen and made her a light breakfast of cereal and coffee then took it down to the dungeon .
In one corner of the room was a large heavy wooden kitchen table I had bought at a garage sale .
It had looked like the kind of thing grandma Walton used to bake pies on .
For my needs numerous D rings were attached to the frame , legs and top giving it a more sinister purpose .
For now however I needed it to be just a table .
Pulling it into the center of the room I cleared the top of bondage paraphernalia then added an old wooden chair to which I had also added straps ..
Pausing I realized that this would be a good time to test the most impressive addition I 'd made to the chair .
Putting breakfast on the table I went to the locked cabinet and removed some extra pieces one of which I bolted to the chair the other I pocketed .
Then I went to awaken the slave .
She was lying much as I 'd last seen her still bound and gagged , still in the latex outfit .
My erection returned as I unfastened the wire from the collar , hobbled her and lead her whining and struggling into the dungeon .
When we reached the chair she stopped struggling and stared in astonishment .
From the center of the seat a long polished wooden phallus emerged making the chair look like it had an erection .
She turned to look at me , eyes wide , head starting to shake .
She tried to say something , mouth chewing helplessly on the ball .
I pushed her towards the chair , she attempted to resist .
Needless to say I won , five inch stilettos being hard enough to walk in let alone anything else .
Hobbled , she could n't even brace herself and soon she was hovering over the wooden cock .
" It 's lubricated , " I said , " And it 's not that thick .
It 's going to hurt less than the punishment you 've just earned yourself . "
She continued to struggle , I really had n't expected anything else , but when penetration by the wooden rapist was inevitable she relaxed and allowed me to settle her on it .
Reaching into my pocket I produced its twin and waved it in front of her eyes .
" Guess where this one goes slave . "
She looked at me beseechingly , knowing that she was helpless and silently begging for mercy .
I crouched down and started to strap her ankles to the chair legs .
It was a tough fight as she struggled to keep her legs closed .
But she was in an impossible position and once her legs where strapped open I found it surprisingly easy to slide the dildo inside .
The back of the phallus had a large bolt fastened to it and after burying the 7 inches of wood in the girl I pushed the bolt through a hole in the chair seat and fastened a nut to the other side .
There was a small wrench velcroed to the bottom of the seat which I used to tighten the nut before pocketing it .
Caroline and the chair were now effectively bolted together , there was no way she could stand or walk and without a wrench and a lot of time no way she could get free .
Now , with her legs strapped open the wooden intruder was obvious but I could see that hidden beneath a full skirt it would be difficult to see anything amiss .
I thought of the other chair I had upstairs , the one with the nice finish and just the mountings for the dildos .
Dressed in regular clothes and bolted to the chair I could take photo's of Caroline with no obvious restraints .
I smiled , the family could expect a few pictures with her letters .
Returning to my slave I chained her collar to the table , freed her hands and pulled the gag from her mouth .
Rather than remove it completely I let it hang around her neck like a strange fetish necklace , a constant reminder that I could enforce her silence at any time .
She picked up the coffee and drank greedily , I topped up the cup .
She drained that also , then as I moved the cereal towards her she spoke .
" Sir ..... "
" I prefer Master , " I said with a smile .
" Err , Master ....
Erm please let me go ......
I promise I wo n't tell anyone about this .
I want to go home , please . "
I suppose that my sadistic side had free reign at that moment because instead of telling her to shut up and eat her cereal I decided to play with her .
" You must realize , Cunt , that taking you was n't a whim .
I 've invested quite a lot of time and money in this affair .
To return you now would put me at a lot of risk even if I could trust you not to run to the police .
What could you offer me in return ? "
She swallowed nervously , calling her ` Cunt ' like that had rattled her self confidence .
" I... I could suck you .... "
The look on my face must have told her this was n't enough for in a whisper she added , " Or we could do it .....
If you want . "
" I 'm sorry , " I said , " Where you offering sex ? "
She nodded , speechless .
" In that case I want you to say , you can FUCK me Master , If you want . "
" You can .... fuck me Master .
If you want . " " Louder ! " " YOU CAN FUCK ME MASTER , IF YOU WANT ... "
" Much better .
Tempting as your offer is , the reality of your situation is that I could tie you to this table in five minutes and fuck your brains out whether you liked it or not .
I could do the same tomorrow and the next day and the next .
You can't bargain with what you do n't own , and your body , together with the rest of you is now mine . "
She looked dejected then she started jabbering .
Telling me I would be caught and punished and she wished I was dead and ...
In the end only the threat of the gag got her to shut up and eat .
When she 'd finished I hobbled her again and unbolted her from the chair .
As I helped her up off the shit covered phallus I was reminded of something .
" Did you use the John ? "
She looked at me speechless .
" The chemical toilet , did you use it ? "
She nodded .
" Good 'cos that 's the last chance you 'll have for a while . "
I took her to the wall and chained her to the gridwork whilst I collected a few things from the cabinet .
First thing I did when I got back was try to gag her again .
The gag was not strictly necessary as the room was soundproofed but it helped reinforce her helplessness and a knew she did n't like it .
The ball gag was decorative but not very effective so leaving it where it was I held a padded gag against her mouth .
This type of gag has a very large soft rubber mouthpiece fastened to a padded leather section that is strapped over the mouth .
It was , I suppose a non inflatable version of the gag I 'd fitted her with the night before .
This time however she closed her mouth firmly and refused to open it .
I smiled .
" You must really like to be punished , " I said , " It 's going to take me most of the day just to work off what you 've earned so far . "
Her eyes widened .
" Oh yes you 're going to be punished for last night , you did n't think I 'd forgotten did you ? "
I could tell by the look in her eyes that * SHE * had forgotten . "
" Open up like a good girl and I 'll forgive you this time .
This is pointless anyway , the room is soundproofed so even without the gag you are just as helpless . "
She shook her head defiantly , I could see that a lesson was in order .
Going to the cabinet I retrieved a posture collar and a roll of duct tape .
Removing the ball gag from her neck I fitted the posture collar firmly in place .
Of course she resisted but the ponytail made an excellent handhold and after five minutes her old collar was replaced by a high stiff one that stopped her turning her head .
A couple of straps between the gridwork and the collar and she was fastened to the wall facing me .
Slowly , deliberately , I stuck strip after strip of tape over her closed lips .
I think she thought I was trying to gag her a different way because she just stood there smugly .
She seemed a little amused when I went into her cell and returned moments later with a strip of toilet paper .
One thing was certain however she was n't laughing when I shoved a small ball of toilet paper up each nostril and sealed it there with tape .
She started to cry out and thrash as much as she could .
I just added tape if a leak appeared in her mouth covering and waited .
All the activity burnt the air in her lungs quickly and before long she stopped thrashing , face red , eye 's bulging as she strained against the bonds , lungs screaming for the oxygen I 'd denied them .
" Perhaps I should gag you this way instead , " I suggested , watching as wild panic and desperation consumed her .
Then suddenly I reached out and in one move tore the tape mask from her lower face .
She let out an explosive breath and with mouth wide open drew in her first lung full of life giving air .
I gagged her , shoving the mouthpiece into her wide , open mouth just as she finished that first breath .
It was large enough to stay put without the straps so next I removed the tape and paper from her nose .
Then I tightened the gag .
I think she was just happy to breath as I had no further trouble .
I held one of the toilet paper balls in front of her wide eyes ..
" This is a lesson .
You are helpless , so helpless I can take your life with toilet paper if I wanted to .
First time , * EVERY * time slave , this is not optional .
Next time you try to stop me gagging you the tape stays on twice as long , keep it up and I may decide that you are n't worth the trouble and leave it on , understand ? ? "
She nodded .
That settled I continued with the preparations .
I replaced the hobble with a spreader bar forcing her legs open into a wide triangle .
I could tell that she did n't like being this exposed , but experience was starting to teach her that resistance could offer worse things than just pain .
I left her wrists cuffed together but added straps to her upper arms that also helped to pull her shoulders back and push her tits out .
To help this along even further I threaded a rope from her elbow straps to her wrists then from there through a D ring in the center of the spreader bar .
Pulling on it pulled her arms down , arched her back and thrust the tits out further .
Releasing her from the wall I dragged her under a ring to which I attached her collar .
Next came the butt plug .
She looked at me puzzled as I approached her with it then as I pushed it 's greased surface inside her ass she squirmed and made small noises behind the gag .
I started to unwind the wires attached to it , before packing her cunt with a large metal studded rubber dildo with similar attachments .
I fastened the wires to a small metal box which I clipped to the spreader bar , covered twat and ass with a pair of snap on leather panties and I was almost set .
I finally got to do something I 'd looked forward to since I 'd seen her nice tits .
The nipple clamps had a small length of chain between them and must have looked like jewelry because she did n't start struggling until I clipped the first one on .
Even then there was little she could do her body being forced into a tight stiff pose by the strict bondage .
I clipped the second one on the other nipple then freed the rope fastened to her wrists and pulled until she was bent back as far as I thought she could stand .
Then I tied the rope to the nip clamp 's chain .
Now any attempt to lean forward would drag on the chain which in turn would pull on the clamps , these were the type that bit harder as pressure increased .
She moaned and tried to say something looking at me with large accusing eyes , still that I could fix .
I fitted her with the padded blindfold I 'd used on her the night before .
The posture collar stopped any of the struggling nonsense this time and when I was finished only her nose was not covered by shiny black leather .
Next I attached a couple of small arms from the box to the wrist rope where it went through the spreader bar .
Then I attached two cables from the box to the wall , one AC power the other to the building ethernet .
Caroline started to twitch as the dildo and butt plus started their low frequency vibration .
As she squirmed she pulled on the rope attached to her nipples and slowly tortured herself .
I looked at her as she winced and writhed , vision in leather and latex .
The butt of the dildo was pushed tight , straining against the leather panties looking for all the world like a small cylindrical dick .
As I watched it began to move as her cunt muscles squeezed it out and the tight panties forced it back in .
I knew that the vibration though stimulating was not enough to bring her off instead she would have to stand there in a state of sexual frustration until I chose to release her .
However being a considerate sort I 'd arranged a small distraction .
" Slave , " She ignored me trapped in her private world .
" Slave , " I slapped her right nipple with the crop which got her attention .
" Frustrating is n't it ? "
Of course she had no way of answering , the posture collar stopped all head movement and gag and blindfold dealt with everything else .
" The good news is that the vibrator will go faster the further forward you lean .
She lent forward a little and sure enough the pitch of the vibrator increased , of course the clamps did painful things to her nipples .
She leaned back and suddenly when crazy struggling and screaming in pain .
" Lean forward ! " I commanded .
she seemed in too much pain to notice me so I grabbed her shoulders and pulled forward .
Immediately the pressure on the nipples increased and she tried to struggle more .
I held her there and the pain subsided .
" That was the bad news , periodically a small electrical shock will be administered to your cunt and anus .
To switch it off you need to lean forward and hold the pose for five seconds .
Every time the shock comes it will have a higher intensity and will take longer to shut off . "
Again she tried to say something .
I continued , " Just before the shock you will hear my voice giving you an instruction .
Obey it and the shock will be avoided .
fail and you know what happens . "
I looked behind me at the camera that would let me watch all this from the comfort of my office then prepared to leave .
Reaching up I released her hair from the pony tail and let the blond locks cascade around her shoulders .
Finally I fitted her with a pair of light headphones which I attached to the AV .
grid .
She twitched and leaned forward obviously too late to stop the shock .
I stood silently for a few minutes watching her move the little she could in response to my computer generated instructions .
The moans issuing from behind her gag showed me that she had discovered the other benifit of obedience , the sudden high speed burst from the vibrators that came when she reacted immediately .
The rewards were short so that she would n't be able to cum but in her painful position these flashes of pleasure would be very welcome .
She started to obey the commands with increasing enthusiasm and I noticed that her cunt was already juicing up again .
I watched for a few more minutes then left to watch " television " .
The rest of the morning I worked , easily clearing the backlog that had built up during my preparation for the kidnapping .
On the TV I watched as Caroline continued to thrash around .
A window on my PC monitor showed the current score .
Shocked twelve times she was currently on her 150th order and getting tired .
I smiled , Caroline would have spotted immediately that I was using an aversive conditioning technique .
As a method of brainwashing it was slow and primitive but it was also effective .
As a Psych major Caroline probably understood that her brain was being conditioned to obey my voice .
She may even have noticed that the headphones , gag , gloves and blindfold had enforced a kind of sensory deprivation and that the insistent buzz of the vibrator was robbing her of the ability to focus .
However just as you can shoot a ballistics expert , her skills could not protect her against this application of her science .
The persistent computer continued to pound orders into the primitive areas of her brain offering pleasure for compliance and pain for disobedience .
I imagined the horror , to understand exactly what was being done to her mind , to realize that in a few weeks her will would be broken and she would obey me like a dog eager to get my approval .
Perhaps some part of her mind realizing what was happening but powerless to resist ......
Another rush of megalomania and then I shut down the program and went downstairs .
She stood , legs trembling .
I could tell that she wanted to slump down but the tether at her collar prevented it .
Her latex stockings were again coated in her juices her body covered in sweat .
I freed her ankles first holding her steady as she moved her legs for the first time in several hours .
Next I disconnected everything , though I left the vibrator and butt plugs in their respective holes .
Finally I freed her neck and fastened a leash to the collar .
Taking the spreader bar along I lead her up from the dungeon and into the house .
This is not as risky as it sounds , I have an excellent security system that warns me of any visitors and a gate ensures that they can only reach the house if I want them to .
I sat her on a kitchen chair and gave her water .
She said nothing but " Thank you Master " at the end all fight temporarily gone .
In fact she seemed so submissive that my hard on returned and this time would not be denied .
I decided to do something about it .
With the gag still hanging from her neck I took her to the living room where I replaced the spreader and used the remaining ropes to secure her wrists to it .
This resulted in a kind of hog - tie which left her kneeling before me as I sat in my chair .
Unfastening my leather pants I pulled my hard dick free then pulled her head towards it .
" I 'm giving you the honor of blowing me slave , do it well and you will be excused punishment for the rest of the afternoon . "
I did consider telling her what would happen to her if she bit me , but I thought that could give her idea's .
I had a ring gag for just this occasion but it was downstairs in the cabinet so I watched with some trepidation as her mouth engulfed me .
I was intending to give her demerits based on lousy technique .
Sam gave great head and I had come to expect a lot from my partner .
It soon became apparent though as the tip of her tongue played lightly over the engorged head that Caroline was a virtuoso on the skin flute .
I gasped , struck dumb as she sucked on my balls , next she deep throated me quickly and easily with no hint of gagging .
I looked down at her blindfolded face , mouth around my dick a dribble of my precum on her chin and the only thought on my mind was that I was glad she could n't see the stupid grin on my face .
Somehow through the haze of rapidly mounting pleasure I remembered what I 'd planned to do during this occasion .
Hands trembling I reached for the remote control unit on the table beside me .
I still do n't know how I found the right button ( she was licking the length of my dick like a lollipop at the time ) , yet I managed to push it .
Then I sat back enraptured whilst somewhere in the bowels of the house a computer executed it 's program .
Ten seconds later the phone rang .
We both stiffened I through release of anticipation , she in shock .
Her mouth was still around my dick so using one hand to hold her head in place I answered the phone .
The voice on the other end was that of the house management computer telling me the internal temperature , the selections on the VCR , the states of the lights , but for Caroline 's benefit I pretended it was a friend a few miles down the road wanting to visit .
" Sure Bob come on over , " I said aware of the faint noises coming from my dick gagged slave , " But give me a few minutes ok , I was just playing with a new toy and need a few minutes to tidy up . "
I hung up , pleased she had n't decided to bite me .
It had been a risk without the ring gag but a small one .
I figured the gag incident would stop her from trying anything too extreme for a while .
I grabbed the side of her head , actively fucking her face for the first time .
She was n't stupid , she took this as a signal I wanted to finish , stopped teasing and instead started sucking hard and bobbing backwards and forwards in a strong persistent rhythm .
I could hear the tiny metal clanking noises that the nipple clamps chain made as it struck the tight leather of the bustier .
I felt I would die in ecstasy and wondered if Caroline would be rescued with me gone .
My hazy mind was full of the headlines " Noted writer dies in kinky sex session , girlfriend unable to free herself dies of exposure . "
Then suddenly I exploded in her mouth .
" Swallow every drop slave , every mark on the carpet is one on your hide . "
She needed no extra encouragement swallowing the cum with a terrified look on her face .
I took hold of the gag around her neck and pushed the rubber mouthpiece against her lips .
" Open wide slave , we have guests coming and it's time to make sure that you stay good and quiet ! "
She hesitated , but only for a second until she remembered the repercussions .
The gag lesson was one that had been well learned .
I strapped the gag tightly ensuring that she could make only the slightest of noises , then I dragged her across the room and behind a large couch .
The spreader bar hog - tie arrangement was strict enough , but to avoid her rubbing her crotch against the floor I turned her on her back so that her heels and shoulders formed a tripod arrangement with her knees and pussy thrust high in the air .
She moaned slightly at the uncomfortable position but hey , she 's the slave .
Still I did feel a little guilty after she gave such good head so I ran quickly to my office and got a little battery box for the dildo and butt plug .
A few second to connect everything and she was buzzing away again .
I 'd set the device to a level that I thought was close to her orgasm point ; it was possible she could get lucky and cum but restricted as she was I doubted it .
" My friend is coming here slave , " I said with maximum malice , " If he even suspects that you are here I 'll make you suffer . "
Retrieving the remote I sat in a chair where I could see her clearly , then I punched in some numbers and waited .
The house has an excellent surround sound system , over fifty compact speakers in discrete places in all the main rooms .
Sam had contacts in the music industry and we had talked about hosting private concerts once we were married .
With this in mind I had extended the system installing a number of mikes and a multitrack recorder so that I could record the events for later enjoyment .
When Sam had dumped me the system had languished and the only use I 'd made of it was during an impromptu game of " blindman 's buff " I 'd hosted during the house warming party .
Still the success of that trick had inspired me to use it to test Caroline .
Across the room came the sound of the door opening .
" Ah Bob , " My disembodied voice said , " What can I do for you ? "
" Sorry to trouble you Dick , but the portable printer I have seems to be broken . "
Bob Cummings was perhaps my closest neighbor and one of those people who are destined to be victims of technology .
When he had discovered that I was a computer columnist he had immediately assumed that I would provide free technical support for his every problem .
I had recorded this incident a few weeks before when his inkjet had run out of ink ( " Oh , you mean I need to refill it ? ? " ) .
Since then I 'd spent a couple of weekends making sure that it would sound like a real live event to someone on the floor in Caroline 's position .
The test was clear , she had been ordered not to draw attention to herself , yet as far as she knew a total stranger had just walked into the room .
I watched her as the conversation turned to printers and refills .
She moved occasionally , mainly thrusting her crotch in the air , but it was unclear if her intention was to get off or get free .
In either case she made no obvious sounds .
I began to wonder if she had discovered the deception , but I could n't see how .
The floors were concrete ensuring no conduction of footfalls and the sound quality was excellent .
I sat and watched her as she made small movements behind the couch .
This was not the thrashing and screaming I 'd expected at this point but by now the voices could be heard only faintly from one of the other rooms .
Several minutes passed then the conversation reentered the room from my study with Bob asking about the list price of my desktop printer ( " I guess you do n't know huh ?
I mean you journo's get given this kind of thing ... " )
Phantom Bob was leaving , if she thought that there was any possibly of rescue she would have to make the move soon .
I held my breath , waiting for the faint muffled scream the sudden thrashing of limbs but it did n't come .
The posture collar made head movement impossible but with the little leg movement she had left she had turned on her side to face the departing sound .
Yet despite the fact that " Phantom Bob " and I held a conversation just in front of the couch behind which she was hidden and she must have known that her gagged screams would carry at least that far ; she made no attempt to alert him to her presence .
Phantom Bob left and the recording ended .
I went over to her and removed the hog - tie and spreader .
I did n't bother to hobble her as high heeled boots are difficult enough to walk in .
Attaching the leash I lead her downstairs .
I removed the posture collar and replaced it with her usual one , removed the blindfold , then I removed the dildo and butt plug along with the leather panties .
She was as expected very wet , and the slight moans that accompanied removal of the dildo seemed to confirm that she had still been denied an orgasm .
I removed the pad gag and replaced the ballgag around her neck .
" Very good slave .
As a reward for your obedience I will leave you ungagged for the rest of the morning as long as you do n't speak , understand ? "
She nodded her agreement .
Then I took her back to her cell fastened her hands in front of her , with a chain to a ring on her collar ensuring that her crotch was out of reach .
Then I refastened her collar to the wire and told her to get some sleep .
She settled down happily , glad that the gag was still around her neck and not in her mouth .
It was about twelve when I took her from the cell and back into the dungeon .
She started to ask questions so I regagged her , she gave me a betrayed look but did n't kick up a fuss when I lead her to the table .
I did have some trouble when I strapped her down so I upped the pressure .
" Well well well Cunt .
So this is a demonstration of the of your obedience to your MASTER .
All you are doing is making your punishment far worse . "
She stopped struggling and looked at me with big frightened eyes , I continued to tighten straps .
I stood back and surveyed my handiwork .
Her gloved hands where cuffed above her head , her collar fastened to the table .
I had fastened her waist to the frame of the table with a wide leather belt and had cuffed her ankles to the two table legs .
She was spread and vulnerable , her pussy on the very edge of the table and at the perfect height for sex .
She must have realized this because she continued to struggle as best she could as I went over to the basement room .
There I collected a towel and a basin I had brought from upstairs .
Coming back to the table I put the basin down next to her and reached inside .
The gag barely muffled her scream when I opened the straight razor in front of her .
It was a family heirloom left to me by some great uncle .
He had apparently taken it with him in his journeys around the world but I suspected that he had never taken it where I was about to .
Gently I used the warm water to dampen the bush of fine brown hair between her legs .
She stiffened beginning to see what I had in mind , I could see her pondering it .
A minute ago she had been convinced she was about to be raped , now she faced this which was in many ways worse .
I started to soap her crotch , being carefull not to touch the bustier or the latex stockings .
By the time I had brought the blade near to her helpless body she had decided that she wanted no part of it and started to squirm as best she could .
Holding the razor up menacingly I smiled .
" I 'd stop that if I were you , this is n't the kind of place I 'd like a nick . "
I played the light reflecting from the blade across her face .
She froze , eyes firmly closed , breathing in short bursts , as still as a statue as I shaved her pussy .
I did n't completely denude the area , I left a small oval patch just above her clit for decorative purposes .
I had to confess that I 'd done a good job as I ran my fingers over her smooth soft flesh .
She groaned a little and I was suddenly aware of my almost painful hard on .
Reaching down I opened her cunt lips and lowered by face onto her exposed clit .
It would appear that the shave had been stimulating to her also , for the little nub was already engorged .
Gently my tongue touched it , she heaved in a huge gasping breath , her hips straining against the imprisoning belt .
I licked and a muffled groan issued from her gagged lips .
I started in earnest , each lick , nibble or suck accompanied by a gasp groan or murmur from the far side of the table .
I thrust my tongue deep in to her , savoring her salty flavor mixed with the smell of the soap and listening to her muffled whinnies as she went wild .
I paused and looked up , fingering her with my gloved hand as I watched her , tear - filled eyes closed , hard thrusting nipples , mouth straining against the ball .
I smiled , my slave on the brink of orgasm .
She noticed the drop in sensation and looked up .
" Want me to fuck you Slave ? "
She shook her head defiantly , I just fingered a little faster .
One set of her lips slid helplessly over the rubber ball , the others over my leather fingers .
Her breathing and moans came in staccato bursts and I knew she was close , so I stopped .
She squealed something and tried to trust her hips up against my hand .
Helpless , so close to cumming but unable to stimulate herself that extra little bit , she thrashed against her bonds .
" I 'll only ask once more Slave .
Do you want to be fucked ? "
Her eyes were full of the terrible internal conflict , she so desperately wanted to cum but the humiliation of her position , to have to beg her rapist to fuck her ......
I helped her out , I turned away .
She gave a muffled squeal and strained against the bonds , gloved hands and booted ankles tugging in futile desparation , the fire in her crotch burning away the last of her self respect .
I turned , " Well Slave ? "
She closed her eyes , and nodded .
In seconds I was in her , my shaft buried in her warm tight hole .
As I thrust her pussy started spasming , drawing me further inside , her passion expressed as little gagged screams her body straining all the time .
Under any circumstances she would have been a good fuck , but combined with her complete helplessness she turned me on more than any woman in my life .
All thoughts of Samantha were swept away as we came together , her muffled scream filled the air as I pumped my load into her .
I pulled out and cleaned us both up with the towel I 'd brought to dry her .
She seemed quiet so I leaned over and removed her gag .
There was silence for a few minutes as I rehobbled her legs and prepared to unstrap her from the table .
At last she spoke , " You raped me ! " " WE had sex , " I corrected , " Rape implies lack of consent , YOU asked me to fuck you twice and that nod was n't my imagination either . "
" I 'm your prisoner , you would have done it to me anyway . "
I smiled , " Be very careful what you say Cunt or you could make life hard for yourself .
Truth is that you wanted it so bad you begged for it , and now that it 's over you are horrified that you actually got off on it so suddenly you are the poor victim again . "
She was silent deep in thought as I eased her off the table and fastened her hands behind her .
I reached for the gag .
" Please do n't , " She smiled at me , a warm deep smile that convinced me that I had chosen the right girl .
" Please Master , I thought we could talk for a while , if you explain what you want ..... "
" Humm , obviously you paid more attention to your psych lectures than your grades suggest . "
She went pale .
She swallowed nervously .
" Who are you ? "
She asked , " I never said I was a psych major . "
I smiled , happy at her discomfort .
" I am your master , " I said .
" I told you once before you are not a random choice .
If you were then the police would probably be looking for you now .
As it is I moved you out of your apartment , and left your back rent so that Mr. Philips will be happy that you 're gone and wo n't ask any questions . "
I stepped back so she could see me counting things off on my fingers .
" Lets see , I disposed of your car , YOU successfully got yourself fired , Alice and Brenda are at that trade show in Chicago and your mother complains that you never write regularly .
Nobody knows you are gone , no one will even notice that you are missing .
Even assuming that anyone reports you missing the police will think you left yourself .
There will be no rescue because no one cares that you 're gone . "
I saw her eyes fill with tears , " Lets face facts here , Caroline Conway was an easy victim , but she does n't exist anymore , all that 's left is a slave who does n't know when to shut up . "
" Please , " She said her voice full of desperation , " You do n't have to gag me again .
I hate it , I can't swallow properly and it hurts .
This place must be sound proof or you would n't have risked leaving me ungagged earlier .
You do n't have to do it I 'll be quiet I promise . "
I smiled .
" You misunderstand Cunt , you are gagged because I want you gagged .
You 're right about the room being soundproofed , but the real point here is that I own you .
Whether you are , awake or asleep , hot or cold , noisy or silent * I* decide .

Titan ’s mysterious dark plains will be named after planets in the series of “ Dune ” science fiction novels by author Frank Herbert .
The US Geological Survey Astrogeology Science Center announced the first plain or “ planitia ” given a name will be designated as Chusuk Planitia .
Chusuk was a planet from the Dune series , known for its musical instruments .
Chusuk Planitia on Titan is located at 5.0S , 23.5W , and in the picture here is the small , dark area next to the “ C ” of Chusuk .
Download a large map of Titan with the named features ( pdf file ) .
The Cassini spacecraft has enabled us to finally see these dark plains on Titan .
This moon is enveloped by an orange haze of naturally produced photochemical smog that frustratingly obscured its surface prior to Cassini ’s arrival .
Since 2004 , the spacecraft ’s observations have taken the study of this unique world into a whole new dimension .
One of Cassini ’s latest images of Titan looks down on the north pole of Titan , showing night and day in the northern hemisphere of Saturn ’s largest moon .
This view is centered on terrain at 49 degrees north latitude , 243 degrees west longitude .
The north pole of Titan is rotated about 23 degrees to the left and it lies on the terminator above and to the left of the center of the image .
Titan is 5,150 kilometers , or 3,200 miles across .
This natural color image was created by combining images taken with red , green and blue spectral filters .
The images were obtained with the Cassini spacecraft wide - angle camera on June 6 , 2009 at a distance of approximately 194,000 kilometers ( 121,000 miles ) from Titan .
Image scale is 11 kilometers ( 7 miles ) per pixel .
Titan is one of the most Earth - like world we have found in our solar system .
With its thick atmosphere and organic - rich chemistry , Titan resembles a frozen version of Earth , several billion years ago , before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere .
Cassini has revealed that Titan ’s surface is shaped by rivers and lakes of liquid ethane and methane which forms clouds and occasionally rains from the sky as water does on Earth .
Winds sculpt vast regions of dark , hydrocarbon - rich dunes and plains around Titan ’s equator and low latitudes .

Hat tip to Emily Lakdawalla !
Cat Sacdalan , a graphics designer , was unhappy at work .
Not only that , her father had been sick , and the fact that she ’d been working at home a lot to be with him did n’t sit well with some of her co-workers .
Cat wrote me that :
For 8 months I ’ve been postponing my resignation .
I ’m guilty of some of those top 10 bad excuses .
It ’s amazing ; it ’s like you wrote down everything I felt ( and more ) .
I finally decided to quit when , last week , my boss told me that people have come up to him , complaining that I should n’t be compensated for working outside the office .
My boss says he appreciates my work but he wants to get rid of the complainers by heeding their request .
So Cat quit .
And this is how she quit :
It takes guts to quit and even more guts to quit in crayon .
I love it !
You can see more of Cat ’s work here .

The EU , in a genuine act of stupidity ( not to be confused with the imaginary acts of stupidity usually recorded in the British press ) , has d...
Dieter Gorny , früher Viva - Gründer , heute oberster Lobbyist der Tonträgerindustrie , hat mich heute zum Lachen und Kopfschütteln gebracht .
Beides gleichzeitig .
Hintergrund : Die Messe Popkomm wird 2009 nicht stattfinden .
Offizielle Begründung Gornys : “ Viele Unternehmen können es sich wegen des Diebstahls im Internet nicht mehr leisten , an der Popkomm teilzunehmen . ”
Abgesehen davon , dass die Messe ohnehin seit vielen Jahren ihre ganz eigenen Probleme hatte , fällt mir zu diesem unglaublichen Satz nur ein Vergleich ein :
Wo sind die Hersteller von Faxgeräten , die anprangern , dass man keine Faxgeräte - Messen mehr ausrichten könne , weil im Internet Texte einfach so verschickt werden , ohne dafür zu bezahlen .
Denn : Gorny vertritt nicht etwa die Musikbranche , sondern nur einen Teil , die Tonträgerindustrie .
Und genau dieser
Teil stirbt derzeit .
Entgegen Gornys Aussagen liegt das aber eben nicht am “ Diebstahl im Internet ” , sondern am jahrelangen Tiefschlaf der Tonträgerindustrie .
Hätte man schon zu Napster - Zeiten mit Download - Shops wie AmazonMP3 reagiert , wäre das kostenlose Downloaden meiner Meinung nach nie zu einer so großen Sache geworden , wie sie es ist .
Stattdessen lamentiert man auch im Jahr 2009 noch herum und versucht , Druck auf die Politik aufzubauen .
In einer Pressemitteilung von heute schreibt Gorny : “ Die momentane Situation ist aber auch ein Ergebnis der Untätigkeit der Politik , die beim wichtigsten Branchenthema Internetpiraterie nach wie vor den Ernst der Lage nicht erkannt hat . ”
Schon vor Kurzem hatte Gorny gefordert , die Zensurinfrastruktur , die in Deutschland nach dem Bundestagsentscheid von gestern aufgebaut wird , auch für P2P - Plattformen zu verwenden .
Um das klar zu sagen : Ich bin keineswegs für eine Freigabe jedweder Musik - oder Filmdownloads , denn auch in Zukunft sollen Bands von ihrer Musik leben können ( auch Musiker mit Live - Auftritts - Phobien ) .
Doch spätestens seit dem Start von AmazonMP3 gibt es für mich kein Argument mehr gegen legale Downloads .
DRM - freie MP3s für kleines Geld .
Genau das hatte ich mir immer gewünscht .
Gornys Lobbyistensprüche zeigen , dass sich die Tonträgerindustrie trotzdem noch nicht mit ihrer Situation abgefunden hat und immer noch in Träumen aus einer vergangenen Zeit schwelgt , in denen Mega - Renditen mit überteuerten Plastikscheiben eingefahren wurden .
Gorny weiß aber wahrscheinlich selbst am besten , dass seine Industrie im Sterben liegt .
Ein Beispiel : Auf Platz 2 der aktuellen Single - Charts befindet sich Emiliana Torrini mit dem Song “ Jungle Drum ” .
Interessanterweise hat die Sängerin das geschafft , obwohl erst am heutigen Freitag eine CD des Songs erscheint .
Ich weiß nicht , ob zuvor schon eine reine Download - Single so weit oben in den Charts zu finden war , aber dieser Fall zeigt die Misere der Tonträgerindustrie sehr gut auf :
Wozu braucht es noch Plastikscheibenhersteller , wenn Künstler doch auch ohne Plastikscheiben Erfolg haben können ?
Die Argumente der Industrie : um bekannt zu werden , um als Newcomer finanziell unterstützt zu werden , etc .
Doch braucht es dazu einen Plastikscheibenhersteller ?
Könnte diese Aufgaben nicht auch eine PR - Agentur oder Künstlerberatung übernehmen ?
Eine meinetwegen auch sehr große , internationale Agentur , die gleichzeitig Verträge mit Downloadshops und Konzertveranstaltern aushandelt , Musiker berät , sie am Beginn ihrer Karriere unterstützt , Internet - Kampagnen entwirft , trommelt ?
Warum begreifen Gorny & Co. das nicht und ändern ihre Geschäftsmodelle entsprechend ?
Warum jammern sie lieber als anzupacken ?
In anderen Ländern sind die Unternehmen doch auch schon weiter , diskutieren sogar ernsthaft über Musik - Flatrates , etc. Wahrscheinlich muss es tatsächlich erst so weit kommen , dass in Deutschland auch P2P - Plattformen mit Internetsperren versehen werden , bis Gorny und Konsorten begreifen , dass die Probleme ihrer Plastikscheibenindustrie viel größer sind und man Stoppschilder nicht essen kann .

I never understood how the phrase “ Time is money ” could ever apply to my life .
After all , no one was paying me 24 hours a day so how could my free time possibly translate to money ?
How could wasting time watching television or playing video games cost me anything when no one was paying me anything anyways ?
It took me quite a while to comprehend the true meaning behind this statement .
And after 10 + years of frittering away countless hours and taking my free time for granted , my business and my child finally made me realize how badly I was selling myself short .
Photo by tlindenbaum
For example , I used to always try to save money whenever I could by doing things myself .
I would try and save a couple of bucks by changing my own oil even if it took me twice as long as going to Jiffy Lube .
One time my car needed new brake pads so I spent a full weekend learning how to replace them myself .
Sure , I ended up saving a couple of bucks but at what expense ?
Could I have used this time more wisely by doing some other activity ?
The other day one of my friends finally bought a house after over 2 years of house hunting .
Turns out that he tried to save money by going with a discount real estate agent .
Basically this agent was willing to refund him .75 % of the sales commission as long he did all of the leg work .
As a result , he wasted tons of time looking at houses that he was not interested in and had to arrange his time around open house schedules .
In the end , he probably saved around 7000 dollars but at what cost ?
He probably could ’ve saved a ton of gas and time by having a real estate agent preview homes for him .
That way he would only have had to look at houses that he realistically had an interest in buying .
Time Is Only Money When You Are Making Good Use Of It
The reality of it all is that time is not valuable until you do something valuable with it .
Most people neglect to factor in the time component when it comes to making or saving money .
And as a result , most people drastically undervalue their time because they are n’t making productive use of it .
When my wife and I did n’t have our business and I did n’t have this blog , we did n’t have any concept of using our time wisely .
So we squandered it away watching television and lounging around with very little to show for it .
As a result , I never used to place much value on my time at all .
While I enjoyed relaxing , I always felt empty at the end of the day .
Since time was not a scarce commodity for me , I was willing to do some stupid things to save money at the expense of my time .
Perhaps one of the most egregious examples of my poor use of time was when I decided to move out of my apartment without the help of a moving company .
I figured I could grab a few friends and save a good deal of cash by moving out myself .
In the end , it took my friends and I an entire weekend to complete the task .
Meanwhile , a moving company could ’ve completed the same task for a few hundred dollars and saved me over a day .
Given that my 3 friends and
I probably spent over 12 hours doing the move , we were paying ourselves roughly 9 dollars an hour per person .
Definitely not worth it .
How Do I Make My Time More Valuable ?
So how can you avoid the same trap that I fell into ?
Do you find yourself selling yourself short ?
Do you spend time on projects that simply are n’t worth your time ?
If you answered yes to any of the above questions , you need to sit down and reevaluate how you budget your time .
The key to making time equal money is to immerse yourself in projects that have long term value and to avoid projects with one off gains .
Instead of thinking about how you can save or make money on a singular project or activity at the expense of your time , think about how you can develop systems that can save or make money for you on a consistent basis in the long run .
In other words , instead of focusing of saving a few bucks here or a few bucks there , try and think of ways that you can provide value for a broader audience .
For example , I maintain this blog in order to motivate others and help them start their own businesses .
I know that every article I write that provides value will pay me back a hundred fold in the long run .
The same is true with my online business .
I know that every hour that I spend working on the website or adding new content or products to the store will eventually net me gains that far outweigh my time investments .
Meanwhile , if I use my time saving a few bucks here and there changing my own oil or doing other things that I ’m simply not efficient at doing , I might save some money once but the time investment would offer no long term value .
How Do I Distinguish Between Good And Bad Time Investments ?
These days , whenever I see an opportunity to save or make money , I ask myself the following questions before proceeding .
How long will it take me to complete the project ?
How much money will I make or save ?
Is the hourly savings or cost worth my time ?
What other projects require my attention ?
If the hourly cost is not worth the money , is this activity something that can provide me with a useful skill ?
Will I enjoy doing this activity ?
While I can not quantify the exact value of an hour of my time , I do know that my schedule everyday is completely packed .
I have to constantly juggle spending time with my daughter , working on our online business or writing articles for this blog .
These days , an activity has to really be worthwhile in order displace some of my other activities that are already providing long term value .
As a result , I rarely try to do anything beyond my core competency by myself unless I ’m really interested in learning a particular skill .
Time is far too valuable to waste on petty projects .
The key is prioritizing your time for activities with the most potential .

Have you read these ?
I have debated here at great length the degree of benefit or harm offered to society by religion .
My position is that religion–even in its so - called moderate forms–causes more harm to modern society than it offers in return .
My argument , in summary , is that religion is the direct cause of significant anti-intellectual sentiment in this country , and that this disrespect of logic and reason , as a foundation for public discourse , erodes American society as a whole .
I feel that , for most people , separating religion from thought regarding civics , politics , and one ’s general approach to life is not possible .
And given that , the mixture that inevitably occurs results in an interpretation of the world that inhibits human progress .
The counter - argument I receive most from religious apologists is that the negativity in religion comes from extremists alone , and that moderate religion is nearly invisible in society .
They go even further , saying that religion as a whole in America nets a positive effect , if anything .
I strongly disagree , and I think this article from Pew Senior Research Fellow David Masci supports my position .
In this article he presents some compelling evidence regarding what American ’s really think about their separation between religion and public discourse .
I hope the apologists take notice .
Disturbing
42 % of Americans outright reject evolution
Another 21 % say that evolution was guided by God
Only 26 % think it happened naturally
26 %
Are you kidding me ?
That ’s only one quarter of Americans that realize humans evolved naturally .
1 out of 4 .
It ’s not some minority of extremists that reject science in America–it ’s the overwhelming majority .
And it ’s not because they do n’t know what scientists believe : nearly two - thirds of adults say they believe scientists agree on evolution .
And it ’s not that they think science is bad , either .
87 % of respondents said scientific developments make society better .
So where ’s the disconnect ?
Simple , they think science is good for some people but not for the religious .
If they have to make a choice between what ’s scientifically correct and what feels right to them , for religious reasons , they ’re going to choose religion .
This is precisely the sentiment that seeps into public discourse and causes harm to modern society .
When asked what they would do if scientists were to disprove a particular religious belief , nearly two - thirds ( 64 % ) of people say they would continue to hold to what their religion teaches rather than accept the contrary scientific finding , according to the results of an October 2006
Time magazine poll .
Breathtaking .
But it gets worse .
Indeed , in a May 2007 Gallup poll , only 14 % of those who say they do not believe in evolution cite lack of evidence as the main reason underpinning their views ; more people cite their belief in Jesus ( 19 % ) , God ( 16 % ) or religion generally ( 16 % ) as their reason for rejecting Darwin ’s theory .
This , in my opinion , clearly explains why it ’s so difficult to debate with the religious right in this country .
Quite simply , if facts do n’t matter as much as feelings , you have no discussion .
I think this can be seen clearly in the current healthcare reform debate .
As Johann Hari points out in a recent piece , the problem permeates all areas of discourse :
They insist gay marriage would cause the institution of the family to collapse .
In reality , where it has already been introduced in Europe , heterosexual families continue just as before .
On the list goes : evolution is a lie , a blastocyst is akin to a baby , torture produces actionable intelligence …
And he goes on to make make my exact point :
How do they train themselves to be so impervious to reality ?
It begins , I suspect , with religion .
They are taught from a young age that it is good to have “ faith ” – which is , by definition , a belief without any evidence to back it up .
You do n’t have “ faith ” Australia exists , or fire burns : you have evidence .
You only need “ faith ” to believe the untrue or unprovable .
Indeed , they are taught that faith is the highest aspiration and most noble cause .
Is it any surprise this then percolates into their political views ?
Faith - based thinking spreads and contaminates the rational .
So , perhaps Hitchens was being a bit hyperbolic when he said , “ religion poisons everything ” , but it does poison rational debate , and therefore the foundation of modern society .
So , yeah , it might as well be everything .
And unfortunately , contrary to what the apologists will tell you , this behavior is not isolated to some small subset of believers .
Polling has shown us repeatedly that much of the American public is willing to outright reject truth not due to a lack of evidence but directly because of religion .
Teaching people to rely on religious upbringing rather than evidence has direct , negative , and lasting repercussions in our society ( stem cell research , abortion , health care , etc. ) .
This type of irrational belief is clearly not something that can be partitioned off from the shared and secular world .
And because of this , the practice of teaching people to put religious beliefs before evidence ( the very definition of faith ) is inherently dangerous .
The sooner we all realize this the better off we will be . ::
ALLies ,
In honor of thefirst anniversary of the weekly Vegas Anarchist Cafe , and in connection with the opening of a new school year on UNLV ’s campus , Southern Nevada ALL has helped to organize a line - up of special programming the A - Cafe ’s Free Speech Soapbox Series , to offer some opportunities for kick - starting some engaging conversations about Anarchy , about the ideas of Anarchism in theory and practice , and about how Anarchist ideals of free association , mutual aid , DIY social change , decentralized resistance , and direct action can apply to our struggles , passions , and dreams for our own community here in Vegas .
I ’m happy to announce that for the first event , which will be held at this week ’s A - Cafe on Thursday 27 August 2009 , I will be giving a special talk , ** What Is Anarchism ? to discuss the ideals of Anarchism in theory and practice , the meaning and reasons for Anarchism ’s opposition to the state , the benefits of a society without rulers or domination , and correcting common misconceptions and replying to common objections about Anarchism , Anarchists , and Anarchy .
For anyone curious about the ideas of philosophical Anarchism , or interested in the conversation .
WHAT : Talk by Vegas ALLy CHARLES JOHNSON on WHAT IS ANARCHISM ?
WHERE : Weekly Anarchist Cafe @ the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf , Running Rebel Plaza ( 4550 S. Maryland
Pkwy , right across the street from UNLV )

15 Movies That Were Almost Turned Into TV Series
If you ’re not an ABC Family aficionado like myself , then you may not be aware that the often - underrated network is preparing to launch a new series on July 7th : “ 10 Things I Hate About You , ” based on the film of the same name .
It ’s hard to say whether this is a good idea or not , though the fact that Larry Miller has carried over his character from the film – patriarch Walter Stratford – is certainly a step in the right direction , but we can say one thing : there have been worse ideas .
It ’s been a television staple to transform motion pictures into weekly TV series , but not every attempt actually makes it to the airwaves .
Here ’s a list of 15 such swings and misses , many …okay , most of which deserved to fail .
1. “ The African Queen ” ( “ The African Queen , ” 1962 & 1977 ) –
It seems only appropriate to start this list out with an attempt at transforming a classic film into a TV series .
The first time around was in 1962 , when James Coburn took on the role of Cap ’n Charlie Allnot , while Glynis Johns played the Hepburn role of missionary Rosie Sayer , but although it aired as an episode of NBC’s “ The Dick Powell Theater , ” it never made it any further .
Fifteen years later , CBS took a stab at it , with the leads played by Warren Oates and Mariette Hartley .
No dice .
If the actual movie ever makes it to DVD ( can you believe it ’s still unavailable ? ) , perhaps one or both of these pilots will be included as part of the bonus material .
2. “ Breakfast at Tiffany ’s ” ( “ Holly Golightly , ” 1969 ) – It sounds nuts , right ?
Granted , if there was anyone in the late ’60s who was the TV equivalent of Audrey Hepburn , it was probably Stefanie Powers , but Hepburn ’s performance was so iconic that it ’s hard to even wrap your head around the idea of anyone else playing the role of Ms. Golightly .
As it turns out , the original author of “ Breakfast at Tiffany ’s ” – Truman Capote – did n’t like the movie , either , calling it “ a mawkish valentine ” to Hepburn , so he was even less ecstatic about the idea of a TV series .
In an interview with Time Magazine , Capote predicted that the show would be even more “ jerky ” than the film and that he would not stand for the TV version “ if they give me all the money in Christendom . ”
One doubts that his position on the matter had anything to do with the series not being picked up , but the end result no doubt pleased him , anyway .
3. “ Diner ” ( “ Diner , ” 1983 ) – This one had a lot of potential , with the film ’s writer / director , Barry Levinson , doing the same duties on the pilot .
There was only one original cast member willing to return , however , but , hey , at least it was Paul Reiser ( Modell ) .
Plus , Mickey Rourke ( Boogie ) and Kevin Bacon ( Fenwick ) were traded out for Michael Madsen and James Spader , respectively , which ai n’t half bad , really .
In an interview with Venice Magazine , Levinson said , “ We had a great cast , but CBS thought otherwise .
They thought it was n’t compatible with the current programming line - up they had . ”
The fools !
4. “ The Jerk ” ( “ The Jerk , Too , ” 1984 ) – When Mr. Burns wanted to make a movie of his life story but Steven Spielberg was n’t available , he demanded of Smithers , “ Get me his non-union Mexican equivalent ! ”
Similarly , when NBC wanted to bring “ The Jerk ” to television and Steve Martin was too busy making movies , they opted for …Mark Blankfield ?
Wow , the dude from “ Fridays ” ?
Really … ?
There ’s only one website which offers anything approximating a legitimate review of the TV movie which was intended to serve as the springboard for the series , and given that the site is called “ The World of Mr. Satanism : Video Picks for Perverts , ” it might be wise to take the opinions with a grain of salt , but for some reason , I find it surprisingly easy to accept the accuracy of their suggestion that “ watching this movie is like stepping in dog shit .
With your mouth . ”
5. “ The French Connection ” ( “ Popeye Doyle , ” 1986 ) – No matter how good this may have been in its time , its cardinal sin nowadays is that no one can look at the man playing the title character without thinking , “ Al Bundy as Popeye Doyle ? ”
Not that Ed O’Neil has n’t had plenty of work and done a sizable amount of solid work since his days at a Fox sitcom superstar , but , still , the man did play an iconic TV character .
I guess it ’s some consolation , then , that the general consensus is that this watered - down version of “ The French Connection ” was n’t actually very good , which would explain why it never got a series pick - up .
6. “ Psycho ” ( “ Bates Motel , ” 1987 ) – Remember how “ Friday the 13th : The Series ” had nothing to do with Jason Voorhees , and how “ Freddy ’s Nightmares ” only had its Elm Street connection through its host ?
The TV movie which was to have served as a springboard to a series ignored the two “ Psycho ” sequels of the ’80s and took Norman out of the picture altogether , killing him off and having him will the ownership of the Bates Motel over to one Alex West ( Bud Cort ) , who had been his bunkmate at the asylum .
( It ’s no wonder they were good roommates : Alex stuffed his stepfather into a dry- cleaning machine when he was 12 . )
In an interview with the Houston Chronicle , Cort said at the time , “ This would not be a series about the ‘ victim of the week . ’
The hotel becomes a place for redemption , a place for a second chance .
The karma of the original ‘ Psycho ’ debacle is shattered by events in our film .
It ’s restored to a place of rest and contemplation .
There is now something magical about the place that gives people a chance to reflect on their lives and go back into the world renewed . ”
Or perhaps not , since the series never came to pass .
7. “ Adventures in Babysitting ” ( “ Adventures in Babysitting , ” 1989 ) – The film was slight but fun .
Apparently , the pilot was even slighter .
There ’s not much that can be said about this one , aside from the fact that its failure to get picked up led to Joey Lawrence ’s schedule opening up and allowing him to pick up the role of Joey Russo on “ Blossom . ”
One other interesting tidbit : the actress playing Chris Parker – Jennifer Guthrie – went on to co-star on “ Parker Lewis , ” where she worked with Maia Lewis , a.k.a .
Parker ’s little sister , who played Sara Anderson in the original “ Babysitting . ”
8. “ Revenge of the Nerds ” ( “ Revenge of the Nerds , ” 1991 ) – If you ’ve purchased the so - called “ Panty Raid ” edition of the original film , then you ’ve had the chance to check out this failed pilot , where the opportunity to bring in a new generation of nerds was ignored in favor of recasting the roles of Louis , Gilbert , Ogre , and all the rest .
Although we loved the fact that Robbie Rist was cast as Booger , we ’re in no way surprised that the show went nowhere .
The following year , however , someone did decide to make a TV movie entitled “ Revenge of the Nerds III : The Next Generation , ” and 1994 brought us “ Revenge of the Nerds IV : Nerds in Love . ”
Thankfully , there ’s been no sign of a Part 5 , although there do continue to be rumblings about a remake of the original .
The horror … the horror …
9. “ Driving Miss Daisy ” ( “ Driving Miss Daisy , ” 1992 ) –
It ’s not that I ca n’t imagine a weekly TV series about the adventures of Daisy Werthan and her trusty chauffeur , Hoke Colburn , especially since it would ’ve starred Joan Plowright and Robert Guillaume , with Saul Rubinek as Daisy ’s son , Boolie .
I mean , that ’s some top - notch talent there , my friend .
But it just was n’t a concept that ever would ’ve flown in the ’90s .
Sure , maybe in the early ’ 70s , when a series like “ The Waltons ” was riding high in the ratings , but in the grunge era , where the kids were shrugging off sentimentality at every turn , it ’s no wonder it never made it beyond the pilot stage .
10 . “ Clerks ” ( “ Clerks , ” 1995 ) – Yes , we all know that Kevin Smith successfully managed to produce a short - lived animated version of his black - and - white ode to slackerdom , but not everyone knows that there was an attempt at a live - action version as well .
Smith had nothing to do with it , however , and as he relates within the extra material on “ A Threevening with Kevin Smith , ” he did n’t even know about the pilot being made until Renee Humphrey ( Tricia in “ Mallrats ” ) told him that she was auditioning for it .
Worse , when he attempted to make peace with the situation and contribute to the show , he was told that his idea was only worthy of a B - plot .
Ouch .
Smith ’s reaction was to go out for a cigarette and never come back , but some time later , someone sent him a VHS dub of the failed pilot , about which he said …
“ It was pretty fucking bad .
Jim Breuer , the dude who used to be on ‘ Saturday Night Live , ’ played Randal , and he looked like he was 50 years old .
Jim Breuer ’s not an old guy , but the way they had him made up , and they were shooting on video as opposed to film , he looked like Randal ’s dad , with a backwards baseball cap and all the attitude .
It just was n’t the same thing .
And the dude who played Dante was , like , a dude who could ’ve been the captain of a football team , just athletic - looking and good - looking and would n’t have problems in real life , particularly with girls and shit .
Part of the charm of Dante is that he ’s an everyman .
If there ’s an impossibly good - looking dude playing Dante , you ’re , like , ‘ What ’s he bitching about ?
This dude ’s got it made in the shade ! ’
So it was just bad .
Keri Russell was in it as some chick who worked in a tanning parlor that was also in the strip mall .
I was , like , ‘ There ’s no tanning parlor in the strip mall ! ’
It was kind of strange , and I had nothing to do with it , so thank God it did n’t get picked up . ”
One other note : although most of the rights to the characters were held by Miramax , which is why Smith did n’t have to be contacted about making his film into a TV series , he took advantage of his opportunity to squelch the use of Jay in the pilot .
( Silent Bob did n’t make an appearance , anyway . )
The producers ’ response : the character was renamed Ray .
11 . “ The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across The 8th Dimension ” ( “ Buckaroo Banzai : Ancient Secrets and New Mysteries , ” 1998 ) – This may be one of the most depressing never - happened series of them all .
The internet is littered with references to how , in the late ’90s , we came thisgoddamnedclose to having this beautiful dream come to fruition .
In late 1998 , Fox commissioned Earl MacRauch to compose a pilot script for the show , which would have followed the continuing adventures of the rock star / brain surgeon and his cohorts , and the process of bringing the series to life came far enough that , if you pick up the special - edition DVD of the original film , you can see a short computer animated sequence that was made as a test for the series , where the Space Shuttle is trying to land with broken landing gear , and Buckaroo maneuvers his Jet Car under the Shuttle and uses it to take the place of the broken gear .
The progress of the show and its ultimate rejection by Fox can be read here , and you can read about a proposed Banzai Institute series that also remains unmade as well as the failed discussions that Frank Darabont had about making his own version .
Damn .
So close , and yet so far .
12 . “ Zero Effect ” ( “ Zero Effect , ” 2002 ) – Kudos to Chronological Snobbery , a blog that wrote about a pilot I never knew even existed … which is a shame , because I just talked to Bill Pullman and would ’ve loved to ask him if the idea of his doing a weekly series as Daryl Zero had ever come up .
If you ’ve never seen the original movie , let me just say this : it ’s one of very few Ben Stiller films which you can defend to the death in a crowd of film enthusiasts and not feel like you ’re fighting in an unwinnable war .
The pilot , it seems , had featured Alan Cumming taking on Pullman ’s role , but as far as who played Stiller ’s character , it ’s hard to say .
As the above link explains , “ You will not be able to find a copy of this pilot on DVD or on the Internets .
Many of those associated with the project never saw the completed pilot following its post production .
There are likely copies somewhere in the vaults of NBC Television , Castle Rock Entertainment , and perhaps even elsewhere in the vast expanses of the Time Warner empire .
( Director / co-writer Jake ) Kasdan no doubt has a copy somewhere amongst his possessions and projects , but he is not sharing it . ”
Given that , a few years later , Kasdan wrote and directed “ The TV Set , ” the story of a TV pilot as it goes through the network TV process of casting , production and finally airing , we can presume that the experience of “ Zero Effect : The Series ” was not a pleasant one .
13 . “ Fargo ” ( “ Fargo , ” 2003 ) – This one is n’t nearly as hard to imagine once you get the right mindset .
Picture it : the weekly adventures of Marge Gunderson … and played by Edie Falco , no less .
According to Emily Nussbam of The New York Times , who caught the pilot – which was directed by Kathy Bates – when it aired on the late , great Trio , “ It ’s got a quirky , ‘ Northern Exposure ’ flavor mingled with a morbid vibe that presages ‘ Six Feet Under . ’
It ’s a blend that might have found its way , over time . ”
But since it did n’t , Falco was able to do “ The Sopranos . ”
14 . “ L.A. Confidential ” ( “ L.A. Confidential , ” 2003 ) – Filmed in 1999 and scheduled to air in 2000 , the failed pilot for the adaptation of the James Ellroy classic did n’t make it to air for three more years … and even then , it ’s fair to say that the reason it finally did see the light of the day was because the man playing Det.
Jack Vincennes had found himself with a serious career upswing .
That man…was Kiefer Sutherland .
Others in the pilot included Pruitt Taylor Vince ( Sid Hudgens ) , Josh Hopkins ( Officer Bud White ) , David Conrad ( Officer Ed Exley ) , Melissa George ( Lynn Bracken ) , and Eric Roberts ( Pierce Padgett ) , but , wow , can you imagine where Kiefer ’s career would be today if he ’d never had the chance to become Jack Bauer ?
Nope , neither can I. Said Doug Herzog , former entertainment president for Fox , “ With all respect to everybody who worked on it , ` L.A. Confidential , ’ I think , clearly was the wrong idea for Fox .
And then , beyond that , it was n’t that good . ”
15 . “ Mr. and Mrs. Smith ” ( “ Mr. and Mrs. Smith , ” 2007 ) – Although the pilot for this adaptation of the Brad Pitt / Angelina Jolie flick was directed and written by the same folks who handled the film – Doug Liman and Simon Kinberg , respectively – it was hard to get too excited about the idea when Kinberg was quoted in a Variety article about the series as saying , “ ” It ’s essentially ‘ Married … With Children ’ with guns . ”
Jordana Brewster and Martin Henderson played the title characters in the pilot , which set up the series as taking place six months after the end of the film , but ABC opted out of pursuing the series any further .
Regency and Dutch Oven , the production companies behind the series , proceeded to shop their product elsewhere , but here we are two years later , so , y’know , not to jump the gun or anything , but it seems like it ’s safe to call time of death at this point .

[ In this in - depth analysis originally posted on his weblog and then on big sister site Gamasutra , veteran game developer Jeff Ward crunches the numbers to craft a sobering look at the realities of independent game development business models . ]
I 'm looking at releasing an Xbox Live Indie Game in the next few months .
Recently , along with colleague Darius Kazemi , I started doing a little bit of math about indie game numbers , and it 's gotten me wondering whether you can actually support yourself , and a company , on indie games -- indie , in this case , meaning a smallish team experimenting with interesting gameplay concepts and styles .
Now , I understand that since this deals more with money than passion , it may end up alienating me from the indie community , but as a developer I want to see small experimental games flourish , and I want to see those people developing them do well for themselves .
This analysis questions whether or not that 's even possible under our current thoughts and models .
We 've been seeing recently a number of small game companies really hitting a wall when it comes to funding .
Introversion had a post on their blog about their money problems , and Mommy 's Best Games , though still pushing ahead , made it clear that the numbers on Weapon of Choice were not good .
We 've had rants from game players about alternative funding models and suggestions from Gabe Newell about public funding for games .
What can we take from all of this ?
What can we do for funding models ?
This whole thing starts with one piece of information :
How many copies of a single game does a developer need to sell per year in order to support themselves ?
Let 's start at a baseline of $ 40,000 per year for a single developer .
This may sound like a lot for indie developers and , let 's face it , it really is .
But it should be a pretty good baseline number , for a lot of reasons .
Include taxation and taking into account health insurance costs and the possibility of supporting any person other than yourself , and $ 40 k starts to sound pretty slim .
Now we need to figure in loss to distributors .
Let 's ignore distributors with upfront costs and approval processes , such as Xbox Live Arcade , PlayStation Network , and WiiWare , because even developing for these services usually requires either an already - proven game or proven team , and we 're assuming neither .
This leaves us with iPhone , PC ( in various forms , two of which we 'll focus on ) , and Xbox Live Indie Games .
For each platform , you need to look at distribution numbers , likely price points , and gross income , meaning the income after your distributor has taken its fair share .
iPhone
Let 's start with the newest ( and , by all accounts , sexiest ) guy on the block , the iPhone .
Most apps on the iPhone sell for $.99 to $ 3 , with Apple taking 30 percent off the top .
Selling on the iPhone is really all about staying new , staying fresh , and staying on top of the most popular list .
In order to do that , you need to stay at the lower price points to encourage impulse buys .
That means staying at around $ .99 for as long as possible .
Here are the numbers :
Price Developer Cut Sales Needed
$ 1 $.70 57,000 / year
$ 2 $ 1.40 28,500 / year
$ 3 $ 2.10 19,000 / year
$ 5 $ 3.50 11,400 / year
So at the largely standard rate of $ 1 , a single developer needs to push 57,000 copies of a game per year in order to support himself , or to push multiple applications which can reach that number .
With the number of iPhones on the market somewhere around 6 to 10 million , how many sales can you expect ?
Mac
Rumors reports that four apps easily hit almost a million sales , but what 's the data like for games , and indie games at that ?
The most telling post probably comes from the developer of Dapple , who wrote a very long post on how much money he actually made on the product ; he has sold a total of about 500 copies .
In addition , this post on the price of apps versus their popularity shows very few indie games in the list and very little money being made , Fieldrunners ( essentially an App Store Launch Title ) being the notable exception .
Is it possible to be an indie and loved on the App Store ?
Only indies who have accomplished this can tell you , but 57,000 copies is a really hard number to hit with something interesting or experimental .
Xbox Live Indie Games
So what about Xbox Live Indie Games ?
Their developer cuts are exactly the same , although the $ 2 price point does n't exist , and the highest amount you can charge is $ 5 .
Until recently , $ 2.50 was the lowest you could charge , requiring about 22,800 copies to be sold per year .
Unfortunately , sales figures came up very short for most developers .
Total download rates are low , as Indie Games were hard to find on the dashboard until recently , and good apps are very hard to find , so I believe most people have been ignoring the service entirely .
Sales for most games topped at probably around 5,000 copies since launch , far from the required 22,000 to support a single developer .
PC
Finally we come to PC .
On the PC , you can expect to be able to charge more , but sales numbers tend to be lower and more is expected of a finished product .
Games average anywhere from $ 5 to $ 30 , even from indie developers .
Hosting it on your own or through Steam , you get more of the pie .
Steam unfortunately does n't publish numbers , but PayPal does , and we can use it as a baseline .
Assuming that you 're looking to get above $ 40,000 here , we 're going to use PayPal 's range for $ 10,000 to $ 100,000 , which is 2.2 percent + $.30 per transaction .
Price Developer Cut Sales Needed
$ 5 $ 4.59 9,000 / year
$ 10 $ 9.48 4,000 / year
$ 15 $ 14.37 2,800 / year
$ 20 $ 19.56 2,000 / year
$ 30 $ 29.04 1,400 / year
Looking at these numbers , it 's almost obvious why most successful indie developers start on PC .
Even with the PC market shrinking ( this talk from GDC shows that you can expect PC sales numbers in the hundreds of copies , thousands if you 're lucky ) , you get to keep a lot more of your money , and the audience is self - selecting .
People interested in indie games tend to have PCs and may buy your game .
( A note to pirates : Look at those numbers and see how much you 're taking from that developer , and the numbers each developer has to hit before even becoming profitable .
That , more than anything , should make you think twice about piracy . )
Hitting these numbers is possible , but not probable .
It 's quite obvious , to me , from these numbers why most successful indie devs are one man shops , making fairly quick games .
This model does n't scale to multiple developers , and definitely not for multiple years .
Alternative Funding Models
So what about Gabe 's suggestion of running a " stock market " for games where you can invest in projects , get a game out of it , and possibly see a little bit from the net profits off ?
So far , we 've seen a commission system partially work .
Let 's assume that for these systems , we 're talking about multi- developer , multi - year projects .
Still talking indie , let 's assume four developers over a year and a half .
Not taking into account taxes , office space , servers , or anything else , this totals $ 240,000 that needs to be raised over the course of a year and a half .
Though this is potentially possible , there are other concerns .
If a person invests in this game with a promise of returns on the net profits ( after other expenses and taxes ) , he needs to understand the risks involved .
After all , if a game company never hits that $ 240,000 number , and can't survive long enough to complete the game , that money is lost .
Attached to this is the idea of due diligence .
Each investor is now an investor in your game , and has possible legal rights .
If you just take the money and never finish the game , they might be able to sue you .
What is there in place to protect the investor and the developer if this happens ?
Provided these legal issues could be worked out , how much net profit would you be looking at losing , and how much would you charge for each point of net profit ?
What would developers look to gain , and what would investors look to gain ?
First , let 's start with a game that sells about 20,000 copies at $ 20 each on PC using the numbers above .
We 're assuming these are good games that have a following , otherwise they would n't have been funded in the first place .
That totals $ 391,000 in revenue on the game , and let 's assume for argument 's sake that we have $ 41,000 in expenses for the game .
That leaves us with $ 350,000 .
Assuming we split to end up getting the funding we need , here 's what the graph looks like :
Percentage of Valve of each Total Revenue to Revenue Revenue to
net available point net invested investors per point developers
70 % $ 3500 $ 245,000 $ 245,000 $ 3,500 $ 105,000
60 % $ 4000 $ 240,000 $ 210,000 $ 3,500 $ 110,000
50 % $ 5000 $ 250,000 $ 125,000 $ 2,500 $ 125,000
30 % $ 8000 $ 240,000 $ 105,000 $ 3,500 $ 245,000
That 's pretty grim .
Only in the 70 percent case do the investors come out just breaking even , and the developers have enough to fund half of their next game .
Is it possible ?
Maybe .
But is it worth it for the investors ?
How many times will an investor lose most of their money from games that are n't finished , or games that do n't break 20,000 to 30,000 copies before they just kind of give up investing ?
How much work is required of developers just to set up the legalities to make sure they do n't get sued , and their investors do n't get screwed ?
Another funding model for indie devs is to keep titles relevant from year to year , maintaining sales of the title up while you work on the next title , and into your third .
By keeping these games selling , you can start to see actual profits .
However , this also means consistently releasing games year after year , and surviving until these games come out .
This takes a lot of startup capital , or at least the ability or desire to eat ramen for years on end , with only the smallest chance of reward .
Conclusion
These numbers make it really obvious to me why most indie ( and , in some cases , non-indie ) business models exist , and why they produce the games they produce .
To be successful , you need to be in one of a few situations :
- A single developer who makes a good title ( Crayon Physics developer Petri Purho , for example )
- A single or set of developers with short release cycles to keep multiple games relivant over short periods of time ( almost all iPhone developers )
- A developer who has an already - popular game and is able to get on one of the more visible services like Xbox Live Arcade , PlayStation Network , or WiiWare ( thatgamecompany , The Behemoth , 2D Boy , Number None )
This is why indie games experiment the way they do -- shorten the development cycle , concentrate on mechanics and prototypes , keep art resources and requirements low , release lots of games quickly .
There needs to be more available .
I 'm sure there are indies out there that want to experiment with things that take longer development cycles -- weird dynamics , involved dynamic art styles , strange narrative structure -- but can't for survivability reasons , and that 's a damned shame .
So maybe there 's not a good living to be made in indie games .
Even with alternative money sources , it does n't look like you can sustain a business , even of a small number of developers , without targeting AAA numbers , which seems to have a quality bar that almost requires a AAA team .
Obviously , the math that is wrong somewhere , as we 've seen success stories happen , but is it worth it for me ( or anyone else ) to attempt the struggle when the reward seems to be mostly more struggle ?
Is there an answer I 'm missing ?
Is there money to be made , or even survivability , in remaining truly independent ?
If there is , can it be done with more models than what we have now ?

This month Ireland ’s largest ISP will assist with an anti-piracy campaign against its own customers .
After making a deal with IRMA , Ireland 's answer to the RIAA , Eircom will first warn alleged copyright infringers before ultimately disconnecting them .
Now , in what appears to be a leaked document , the entire groundbreaking deal is outlined .
Earlier this year IRMA – which controls 90 % of Ireland ’s recorded music and represents the likes of EMI , Sony , Universal and Warner – reached a private agreement Ireland ’s largest ISP , Eircom , to implement a 3 strikes deal for alleged pirates .
Details of the arrangement have been fairly limited but now an apparently leaked document gives a unique insight into the private deal put into place to allow Eircom to avoid further expensive legal action at the hands of the music industry .
The document passed to TorrentFreak , titled ‘ Briefing Note on Arrangement Between Eircom and Irish Recorded Music Association ( IRMA ) with regard to Copyright Infringement March 2009 ’ begins by giving some background to the deal and why it was implemented .
Listing ‘ Key Points of the Draft Protocol ’ the document promises that Eircom will not monitor its customer activities or install equipment to achieve the same , and will not provide any customer details to any 3rd party “ including the record companies ” while adhering closely to laws concerning data protection .
The Evidence
The document explains that IRMA will supply Eircom with IP addresses and evidence to prove infringements .
The document specifically lists not just uploading infringements on peer to peer networks but strangely , downloading too .
Quite how downloading will be proven will remain to be seen .
Under the agreement , IRMA will supply the following information in their infringement notifications :
1. Details of copyright holder ( name and address )
2 . Why the notification is being sent ( i.e. setting out the breach of copyright )
3 . Details of the actual copyright work infringed ( artist , song , title and album title )
4 . The IP address along with a time stamp to show when the investigation was initiated
5 . A time stamp to indicate when the investigation was completed
6. Details of the P2P application used by the alleged infringer
7 . The hash value of the infringed copyright work
The document says that the information provided by the record companies “ will be of the same type as that used in the three previous disclosure actions in the Irish High Court involving the parties , ” noting that Eircom will not act on a notification which does not carry the information listed above .
Additionally , Eircom has requested that IRMA provides independent certification to show that notifications have been lawfully obtained , including “ reputable annual independent certification that the necessary legal , I.T. , entity level and regulatory controls relating to the obtaining , generating and processing of data by Dtecnet [ the anti-piracy tracking company tasked with monitoring infringers ] ( or any other supplier engaged by the record companies ) have been complied with . ”
Handling the ‘ Graduated Response ’
On the first strike , Eircom will inform its customer there has been an accusation of copyright infringement .
On the second accusation the customer is warned that he risks being disconnected if there are further allegations .
The final step is detailed in the document as follows ;
On a third occasion of being detected as infringing copyright , and having reviewed the position , the subscriber will be served by Eircom with a termination notice and , subject to extenuating circumstances arising , will be disconnected thereafter .
So what measures are there to safeguard Eircom ’s customers from errors , unfounded disconnections or other mitigating circumstances ?
According to the document , at all stages in the process Eircom ’s customers will have the right to complain if they feel they have been “ inappropriately or incorrectly identified as infringing copyright , ” and will be dealt with using the ISP ’s existing broadband support systems .
Additionally , this section seem to provide a little room for maneuver in certain circumstances ;
Eircom has also reserved the right to remove a customer from a particular level or not to effect a disconnection where Eircom has received representations or complaints and believes that the infringement as alleged has not taken place or where there are particular extenuating circumstances which would make the disconnection of the customer unjustified .
Eircom will engage with that person at all times to ensure that there is a full understanding of the issues and that any accidental or unintentional infringement can be identified and remedied .
Dealing with the ultimate sanction – disconnection .
Disconnections will only be carried out when Eircom is “ totally satisfied that there is clear evidence of sustained copyright infringement , that the alleged infringing person has had sufficient opportunity to explain its circumstances and that all possibilities that the person was a victim of accidental infringement have been eliminated . ”
If the main conditions are met , Eircom will then disconnect its customer based on two elements – a TOS violation ( copyright infringement is not allowed on Eircom accounts ) and the ISPs legal obligation to disable access to infringing content on ts network , once it has been made aware of it .
Blocking Websites
There had been rumors that Eircom had agreed to block some websites i.e
The Pirate Bay , but according to the document , Eircom has not agreed to implement a website filter – on copyright grounds at least .
However , as part of the settlement it was agreed that Eircom would not oppose a court application by IRMA to force it to block The Pirate Bay specifically but no other sites are mentioned .
Time will tell if the details above constitute the final agreement , but the framework seems entirely consistent with the way the music industry wants ISPs to handle infringement .
This deal with Eircom will be one to watch closely .
This morning I got an email from a friend of mine .
It was an invitation for a social network called Tagged.com .
A straightforward designed email with a witty question : “ Is she your friend ? ”
The button “ Yes ” just craved for click .
So I clickety clicked on it .
Curiosity killed the cat .
Upon selecting “ Yes ” option a web page opened with a short form containing very friendly copy in inline help .
I filled out the form as this looked like something different and I always like to research new stuff .
As I was about to join the 126th social network on planet Earth , I got the screen that offered me an option of finding all of my friends that were already on the network .
All I had to do is enter my username and password from Gmail or some other ( Yahoo , Hotmail … ) account and it would do it all automatically for me .
Very useful , I thought .
So I entered my Gmail user and pass :
Well the next screen was a big surprise .
It listed all the emails from my Gmail account , even from people I wrote to once in a lifetime .
Each of them had a checkbox checked by default .
The big , red button that was saying “ Next ” was just a click away .
In the moment I realised that clicking on that button will cause all of them to receive tagged .com invitation emails with my name as a sender .
What a witty way to harvest millions of users worldwide , do n’t you think ?
I unchecked all of the emails and went into the network .
Classic mySpace layout .
No big deal .
But then I started to think about that emails screen .
Ok , I am from the web business and I knew it was a setup .
But how many people all over the planet just clicked the Next button ?
Suddenly I saw the Matrix .
This is the fastest way to involve “ innocent ” people into social networking business , people that have n’t yet heard of mySpace or Facebook !
Later during the day I heard a lot of my friends were receiving emails from tagged .com these days , and I did a bit of investigation .
It turned out that the company tagged .com has raised 7 million dollars in venture capital , so this is definitely not another Joe - from - the - hood - viagra - pimp - adsense - spamming - mission but something much bigger .
Then I searched for people ’s opinions on blogs and realised that these emails started circulating in October 2006 .
It seems that this Gmail account searching option was introduced in tagged .com system at that time .
The next logical step was to visit Alexa.com and see their traffic graph :
This enormous viral spreading has started at the same time they introduced this subtle spamming method .
“ The tipping point ” is clearly visible , so my question is where does this lead ?
Here is the comparing graph of mySpace.com and tagged .com :
This quiet spamming trick got them approx .
1/6 of mySpace traffic in very short time .
The service has been active for a few years but it was not massive until a few months ago .
I think much of these 7 million raised in ventures are spent on lawyers , to ensure all privacy policies are bullet - proof and to blame the users and their ignorance for this spamming “ side effect ” .
I imagine what will happen very soon .
Hardcore spammers from all the basements and underworlds will create sites that will ask users for Gmail password and soon our Inboxes will be overflowed with invitations for “ Chicken soup lovers network no .
386 ” .
Maybe Google and others will have to modify their systems in order to prevent this .
It seems that these service integration trends on the Internet are a true heaven for creative spammers .
Are we looking at the beginning of the Web 2 bubble boom ?
I hope not yet .

Ein Gema-Aufsichtsrat scheitert mit Ansprüchen auf die " Jodelphonetik " eines Bierzeltschlagers
Egon Frauenberger ist Musikverleger , Produzent und Mitglied im Aufsichtsrat der Gema .
2001 ergänzte er bei seiner Verwertungsgesellschaft die Ehefrau des eigentlichen Autors Karl Ganzer als Miturheberin des " Kufsteinliedes " .
Im Windschatten dieser Änderung ließ er sich auch gleich noch als Bearbeiter eintragen , wodurch ihm Tantiemen aus den regelmäßig auf Volks - und Vereinsfesten gespielten Schlagers zuflossen .
Den in Österreich lebenden Erben des Urhebers versuchte er ( deren Angaben zufolge ) die Änderung mit dem Argument schmackhaft zu machen , dass sie so von einem längeren Urheberrechtsschutz profitieren würden , weil die Ehefrau nach dem Urheber verstarb und die 70 - jährige Frist bis zum Gemeinfreiwerden des Stücks deshalb erst später zu laufen begonnen hätte .
Allerdings ließen sich die Erben davon nicht überzeugen und verlangten eine Rückgängigmachung der ohne ihre Einwilligung vorgenommenen Abwandlung .
Die jedoch verweigerte ihnen die Gema , bei der der deutsche Multifunktionär Frauenberger unter anderem im Aufnahmeausschuss der Textdichter und im Beschwerdeausschuss sitzt .
Erst reagierte die Musikverwertungsgesellschaft gar nicht auf Schreiben , dann verwies sie auf eine angebliche Zuständigkeit der österreichischen AKM , die wiederum auf die Gema verwies .
Schließlich wurde es den Erben zu bunt und sie verklagten Frauenberger auf Erteilung seiner Zustimmung zur Wiederherstellung des ursprünglichen Zustands .
Darauf hin entbrannte ein Rechtsstreit , in dessen Verlauf sich der ( nach eigener Sichtweise ) " Autor und Produzent der meisten Jodellieder der Welt " damit rechtfertigte , dass die exakte " Jodelphonetik " , die für den Erfolg des Bierzeltschlagers angeblich entscheidend war , von ihm stammen würde .
Allerdings kam vor Gericht ans Licht , dass der Musikproduzent 1980 ( als der Tiroler Amateurmusiker Hans Baumgartner Rechte an dem Stück geltend machte ) unterschrieben hatte , dass sein damaliger Vertragspartner Karl Ganzer der alleinige Urheber des Kufsteinliedes sei .
Von den Richtern darauf angesprochen , ob er denn damals die Unwahrheit behauptet habe und eventuell Prozessbetrug beging , reagierte Frauenberger erst mit Schwerhörigkeit und blieb schließlich auch nach einer lauteren Wiederholung der Frage eine verständliche Antwort schuldig .
Zudem wurde in dem Prozess deutlich , dass die " Jodelphonetik " des bereits vorher bekannten " Oktavjodlers " entgegen der ( mit der Strenge eines Jodeldiplomlehrers vertretenen ) Behauptungen des Produzenten in verschiedenen Aufnahmen durchaus verschieden artikuliert wurde .
" Ho - La -Ro - Nicht Ho ! " musste ihn der vorsitzende Richter Peter Guntz deshalb korrigieren - und rief damit eine zu Anfang der Sitzung gemachte Bemerkung in Erinnerung , dass er sich trotz einer Sozialisation mit Loriot nicht hätte vorstellen können , einmal mit solchen Details beschäftigt zu sein .
Letztendlich kam das Landgericht München zu dem Schluss , dass durch den älteren Eintrag eine " stark gefestigte " Vermutung für Karl Ganzer als alleinigen Urheber spricht .
In ihrer mündlichen Begründung des noch nicht rechtskräftigen Urteils betonten die Richter auch , dass Urheberrechtseintragungen schon allein deshalb nicht beliebig geändert werden könnten , weil sich sonst die Fristen zum Schaden der Allgemeinheit verlängern ließen .
Sehr große Schöpfungsanreize scheint dieser posthume Urheberrechtsschutz keiner der streitenden Parteien zu setzen ( die beide betonten , es ginge ihnen nicht um das Finanzielle , sondern bloß um die sachliche Richtigkeit ) .
Tatsächlich sind das Kufsteinlied und seine nun vor Gericht rekonstruierte Geschichte eher Indizien dafür , dass es gewisser schutzfreier Bereiche bedarf , damit etwas Neues entstehen kann .
Dem Freizeitmusiker Karl Ganzer , der keine Noten schreiben konnte , standen diese unter anderem in Form des argentinischen Tangos und der gemeinfreien Jodelfolklore zur Verfügung .
Aus Beidem bastelte er über viele Auftritte hinweg einen Bierzeltschlager , der später einen Dreivierteltakt verpasst bekam und schließlich durch nachhaltigen Oktoberfesteinsatz zu einem Gema - Goldesel wurde .

Michael Steele Takes Credit for RNC Phone Prank
Created : August 05 , 2009 15:35 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
On today ’s call with reporters , Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele took credit for the RNC ’s response to a new Democratic National Committee ad asking voters to call Republicans and tell them to stop ginning up town hall heckling .
The RNC redirected these calls from its main switchboard over to the DNC ’s switchboard — a response , said Steele , to the White House arrogantly blaming regular Americans “ like my mother , like my sister ” for the health care impasse .
“ I thought it was a good idea , ” Steele said .
“ Do n’t sit there and think you ’re going to direct a bunch of angry liberals to call the RNC when I know full well what that ’s all about .
I get the joke .
My response was , talk to your own party , because they ’re the ones ginning this up . ”

From yesterday 's mail :
An idle question from a big Language Log fan :
Do you have any idea if the nice folks in , say Germany or Italy or Spain , go as nuts as Americans seem to when native speakers make " fundamental " grammar errors ?
It appears that the strong form of " going nuts " that we 've called word rage is mainly an Anglophone phenomenon , with the British as the originators and still the champions .
But the sociolinguistic settings in Germany , Italy , and Spain are very different from the situation in the U.S. — and as a result , they have their own kinds of language wars over there .
The most obvious difference is the role of traditional local language varieties .
Each of the European standard languages developed in the midst of a complex dialect continuum , where differences increase with geographical and social distance , and enough distance creates differences like those between German and Dutch , or French and Italian .
As a result , many if not most Europeans speak a local " dialect " that is very different in morphology , pronunciation , and word stock from the standard national language that they also control to one extent or another ; and in practice , the local and standard varieties are often mixed to a variable degree depending on circumstances .
Something of the same kind is also true in the U.S. , but the differences are generally not as great .
Do our European friends comment among themselves as often as Americans seem to about their neighbor 's grammar ?
I do n't know the facts about the conversational density of metalinguistic commentary , and I do n't think that anyone has ever studied this empirically .
But in Europe , there 's more to talk about , since geographical and social differences among language varieties are bigger and more complicated .
Do Germans hotly chastise newspaper editors for an occasional faulty case ?
Do the Spanish roll their eyes when a writer fails to employ the subjunctive ?
Do Italians suspect the imminent demise of civilization if a subject and verb fail to agree ?
There 's apparently quite a bit of concern in Germany about the fate of the dative case , with journalists very much under the gun on this question .
I 'm not sure about the ideology of mood in Spanish , but there was a fair amount of discussion a few years ago about whether a Francophone mass murderer used the subjunctive appropriately .
Those are both instances of concern about the evolution of the standard national language , and there are plenty of those around .
But most European countries have one or more governmental institutions charged with establishing and maintaining language standards — the Institut für Deutsche Sprache , the Académie française , etc. – and perhaps this makes the citizenry less prone to take up pitchforks and torches on their own initiative .
A different sort of struggle is described by Jillian Cavanaugh in " Remembering and Forgetting : Ideologies of Language Loss in a Northern Italian Town " ( Journal of Linguistic Anthropology , 14 ( 1 ) , 2008 ) :
One wintry afternoon in the northern Italian town of Bergamo , I had coffee with Giani , a retired engineer in his mid-sixties , and talked about the impending loss of his dialetto ( ‘ dialect ’ ) , Bergamasco .
Giani , speaking Italian with a strong Bergamasco accent , told me a story about the punishment children endured for speaking Bergamasco when he attended elementary school .
Every morning , the first time the schoolteacher heard a child say something in Bergamasco , he or she would hand that child a wooden baton , which the children cheekily called — in Bergamasco — a bastù .
This child held the baton until they heard another child speak Bergamasco , and then passed it on ; this continued throughout the day .
At the end of the school day , the teacher called the last unlucky child to the front of the class and made them tell who had passed them the baton .
That child was then called up to the front to tell who had given it to them , and so on back to the original offender .
The entire chain of Bergamasco - speaking children was then punished in front of everyone else ( often with a strap ) .
The next day , the gruesome relay began again .
Giani laughed as he told me that on some days , practically the whole class would end up in the front of the room .
“ Everyone was poor and spoke Bergamasco , ” he said , “ and though we suffered for it , we all got through it . ”
In most European countries , I believe that struggles of this kind remain very much alive .
In some cases , the result is the loss of the local variety ; in other cases — for example Catalan — the local variety has become established as a standard in its own right .
In either case , the struggle seems to leave less ideological energy to spare for questions like whether a change in word sense threatens the foundations of civilization .

In January , an Onondaga County sheriff 's deputy pulled over Audra Harmon , who had two of her kids with her in her minivan .
A routine traffic stop escalated quickly .
The deputy , Sean Andrews , accused her of talking on her cell phone .
She said she could prove him wrong .
He said she was speeding .
She denied it and got out of the van .
He told her to get back in .
She did , then he ordered her back out .
He yanked her out by the arm , knocked her down with two Taser shots and charged her with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest .
His rationale on the disorderly conduct charge :
She obstructed traffic when she got out of the van .
The speeding accusation : going 50 mph in a 45 - mph zone .
The scene along Hopkins Road in Salina on the afternoon of Jan. 31 was captured by a camera on the dashboard of Andrews ' patrol car .
Harmon , 38 , says the video is proof of police brutality .
She plans to sue the sheriff 's office today , claiming Andrews was improperly trained in the use of his Taser .
It 's not supposed to be used to take down people who pose no threat , she said .
Andrews , 37 , a deputy for four years , was taken off road patrol after the arrest and will remain in a new assignment until an internal affairs investigation is finished , Sheriff Kevin Walsh said .
Walsh declined to comment because the case is under litigation .
Andrews also would not comment .
He makes $ 49,095 a year .
Harmon was charged with disorderly conduct , resisting arrest and going 50 in a 45 mph zone .
The district attorney 's office dismissed the charges a month later -- after watching the videotape , said her lawyer , Terrance Hoffmann .
The prosecutor could not be reached for comment .
In his report on the arrest , Andrews makes no mention of Harmon threatening him or using foul language .
He said she refused his request to get back in her van , then refused to get out when he said she was under arrest , the report said .
Harmon refused to comply with his commands to put her hands behind her back to be cuffed , Andrews wrote .
Here 's Harmon 's description of that day :
Harmon , a school bus driver for 11 years , was returning home from shopping and picking up her son Casey , 15 , from wrestling practice .
He was in the front passenger seat .
Harmon 's daughter Brandi , 5 , was in the back seat .
Harmon was driving on Electronics Parkway in the left lane and had to slow down to get into the right lane behind Andrews ' patrol car so she could turn onto Hopkins .
Andrews made the turn ahead of her , then immediately pulled off to the side of Hopkins Road and let Harmon pass .
He quickly turned on his flashing lights and pulled her over .
Andrews told Harmon he 'd seen her using her cell phone while she was driving .
In the video , he makes a phone gesture with his hand .
She told him she'd been driving with her right hand on her cheek , but that she had n't talked on the phone for at least two hours .
She says she offered to let him look at the phone to see for himself .
He declined .
Andrews said he also clocked her going 50 mph in a 45 mph zone .
No way , Harmon recalls telling him .
" I want you to show me the tape , " she told him .
" You 'll have to take that up in court , " he responded , according to Harmon .
He told her the evidence was in a box in his patrol car , and started walking back toward it .
Harmon followed .
That 's when he told her to get back in the van .

» Facts on tasers
She says she did n't refuse the order but told him once more that she wanted to see his proof .
Andrews drew the Taser and pointed it at her .
" Mom , get back in the car , " she recalls her son telling her .
A witness , Staci Santorelli , was across the road at the Shoot ' n '
Score soccer center and heard Andrews tell Harmon she was under arrest .
Harmon also says she remembers
Andrews at some point telling her she was under arrest .
" I just wanted to get back in my car where I was safe and where my kids were , " Harmon says .
Andrews told her to get out .
" But you just told me to get in , " she says she told Andrews .
She heard her daughter crying , " Mommy ! Mommy ! "
" I was not getting out of that car , " she says .
" I was scared to death . "
She gripped the steering wheel with both hands as Andrews grabbed her by the arm and pulled .
Harmon stands 5 - foot - 4 . Andrews is 10 inches taller .
After some tugging , he got her out .
She and Andrews stood facing each other for a few seconds , talking .
He had the Taser pointed at her .
" I kept saying , ' Do n't do this in front of my kids , ' " she says .
Andrews fired the Taser , but it only gave her a small jolt , apparently because it hit her winter clothing .
She started to get back in the van .
Andrews pulled her back , opening her front to him before he fired again .
This time , Harmon dropped to her knees .
The Taser probe , like a little arrow with a fish hook , stuck in Harmon 's upper left chest .
The jolt shook her .
Andrews pushed her to the ground face - first and handcuffed her in the eastbound lane of Hopkins Road .
The number of witnesses across the street was growing , Harmon says .
" Are you OK ?
Do you need help ? "
Santorelli and her father yelled , according to Santorelli 's statement to deputies .
" I 'm not OK , and I do need help , " Harmon responded .
As Andrews picked her up and escorted her to his car , Harmon pleaded with the witnesses .
" Please come get my kids ! " Harmon remembers yelling .
The witnesses said they could n't do that , but they asked Harmon for her home number so they could call her husband .
She gave it to them .
" I wanted these strangers to get my kids , because at that point I thought they'd be safer with strangers , " Harmon says .
The kids sat in the car for about 40 minutes until their father arrived and took them home , which was about 500 yards away , she says .
Harmon said she wants to teach police a lesson :
It 's OK to admit you 're wrong .
She said Andrews manufactured the speeding charge once he realized she did n't deserve a cell phone ticket .
Andrews had not clocked her with a radar gun .
Instead , he said in a report , he calculated her speed by following her for " several seconds . "
" I want the public to know these police officers apparently are n't being trained well enough to know when it is justified to use a Taser , " she said .

Many Californians with medical debt are insured HEALTH CARE
More than two - thirds of the 2.2 million Californians who reported being in debt due to medical expenses actually had health insurance when they incurred their debt , according to a study released today by the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research .
Statewide , the study found nearly 1 in 7 - or 13 percent - of non-elderly Californians had medical debt .
The report , based on data collected in 2007 from about 53,000 households , showed that 19.5 percent of Californians were uninsured for all or part of that year .
The greater Bay Area had among the lowest percentage of both medical debt and people without health insurance .
Just 11 percent of Bay Area residents reported being in debt from medical bills , slightly higher than 10.9 percent in the Sacramento region , but significantly lower than in the northern and Sierra counties , where 24.7 percent of those surveyed said they had incurred medical debt .
Napa County had the Bay Area 's highest rate of medical debt at 20.3 percent , compared to 10.4 percent in San Francisco .
As for coverage , about 13.1 percent of Bay Area residents said they were uninsured for all or part of 2007 compared to the San Joaquin Valley rate of 22.7 percent and nearly 23 percent in Los Angeles County .
Researchers released a similar study two years ago , but this time asked about medical debt .
They expressed surprise by the high number of respondents who reported going into medical debt while insured .
" What it really speaks to is that insurance is not able to cover financial risks in the way most people would expect and would want it to , " said Shana Alex Lavarreda , director of health insurance studies for the UCLA center and a co-author of the report .
People who are insured often find themselves in debt because their insurance has limited benefits and high out - of - pocket costs , Lavarreda said .
She said a growing number of people are buying policies with high deductibles or those that require them to pay a percentage of the total bill .
" When you get a high deductible plan , you have less coverage and you 're exposed to more risk , " she said , adding that some people buy policies with deductibles of several thousand dollars in order to afford the monthly premiums .
The consequences of medical debt include delayed care .
According to the survey , 32.3 percent of those with medical debt reported delaying needed care compared to 16.1 percent of those who were debt free .
San Jose resident Yvonne Fadlin , 63 , has been saddled with more than $ 8,000 in medical debt after her health insurance policy refused to cover all but about $ 2,000 of a hospital bill she incurred last year while being treated for diverticulitis , a disease that affects the colon .
Fadlin , who was paying $ 286 a month in premiums , dropped the policy in December and , as of last week , has run out of the medication she takes to control her diabetes .
" I 'm stressed , and it 's stressing my husband , " said Fadlin , adding her husband is unemployed and she has been struggling to work more hours as a licensed vocational nurse .
" Everything is affected - my bills , my health . "
Changes in 0.3 .*:
Added the TFiniteMap type to make type construction more convenient .
Added markAsDirty .
Fixed data corruption issues with Backend .
Binary .
Changes in 0.2 .*:
Improved error handling .
Backend lookup - exceptions are now rethrown in the AdvSTM monad .
Changes in 0.1 .*:
Added the binary serialization backend .
This library provides a thread - safe ( STM ) frontend for finite map types together with a backend interface for persistent storage .
The TMap data type is thread - safe , since all access functions run inside an STM monad .
Any type instantiating Data.Edison.Assoc.FiniteMapX ( see EdisonAPI ) can be used as a map type .
When a TMap is modified within an STM transaction , a corresponding backend IO - request is added using the onCommit hook ( cf. stm-io - hooks package ) .
To ensure consistency , the ( Adv ) STM monad runs these requests iff the transaction commits .
Additional backends ( e.g. HDBC ) can be added by instantiating the class Backend .
Example :
Thread 1 :
atomically $ do isMemb <- member 1 tmap when ( not isMemb ) $ insert 1 " john doe " tmap
Thread 2 :
atomically $ do v <- lookup 1 tmap -- ... do something with ' v' adjust ( \_ -> " jd " ) 1 tmap
The function member will first check whether the key value 1 is in the map ; if not , it sends a lookup - request to the persistent backend and then retries the transaction .
Note that " sending a lookup - request " essentially means adding a call to the corresponding IO - function of the backend to the list of retry - IO actions .
( This is done using the retryWith IO hook of the stm-io - package . )
If the value does not yet exist , function insert adds the key - value mapping to the TMap and sends an insert - request to the backend using the onCommit hook of the stm-io - package .
Note that onCommit guarantees that the backend IO action is only executed iff the transaction commits .
Any changes that were made to the TMap are invisible to other threads until the onCommit actions are run .
Therefore , the threads will always observe a consistent state .
The module Data .
TStorage provides a high level interface to TMap inspired by the TCache package ( ( C ) Alberto Gomez Corona ) .
It can store any type that has a key ( i.e. is an instance of type class HasKey ) .
See file Sample .hs for an example on how to use it .
Warning :
This package is very experimental and the interface will probably change .
As teenagers ' drive for peer approval begins to eclipse their family affiliations , things change in their brains - literally .
Brain scans of teens sizing each other up reveal an emotion circuit activating more in girls as they grow older - but not in boys .
So that urban legend about girls maturing faster than boys is true , if by faster maturity we mean becoming overly emotional drama queens .
A new study says emotion circuitry diverges in the male and female brain during a developmental stage in which girls are at increased risk for developing mood and anxiety disorders .
" During this time of heightened sensitivity to interpersonal stress and peers ' perceptions , girls are becoming increasingly preoccupied with how individual peers view them , while boys tend to become more focused on their status within group pecking orders , " explained Daniel Pine , M.D. , of the National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) .
" However , in the study , the prospect of interacting with peers activated brain circuitry involved in approaching others , rather than circuitry responsible for withdrawal and fear , which is associated with anxiety and depression .
" Nodes of a brain circuit for social emotion and approach behavior activated more in teenage girls than in boys with age .
Functional MRI data ( red ) superimposed on anatomical MRI images .
Credit : NIMH Emotion and Development BranchPine , Amanda Guyer , Ph.D. , Eric Nelson , Ph.D. , and colleagues at NIMH and Georgia State University , report on one of the first studies to reveal the workings of the teen brain in a simulated real - world social interaction , in the July , 2009 issue of the journal Child Development .
Thirty - four psychiatrically healthy males and females , aged 9 to 17 , were ostensibly participating in a study of teenagers ' communications via Internet chat rooms .
They were told that after an fMRI ( functional magnetic resonance imaging ) scan , which visualizes brain activity , they would chat online with another teen from a collaborating study site .
Each participant was asked to rate his or her interest in communicating with each of 40 teens presented on a computer screen , so they could be matched with a high interest participant ( see picture below ) .
Two weeks later , the teens viewed the same faces while in an fMRI scanner .
But this time they were asked to instead rate how interested they surmised each of the other prospective chatters would be in interacting with them .
Teenage participants were first asked to rate their interest in peers with whom they might communicate in an internet chat room ( left ) .
Two weeks later , while in a brain scanner , they were asked to rate how interested the same peers were in interacting with them ( right ) .
Credit : NIMH Emotion and Development BranchOnly after they exited the scanner did they learn that , in fact , the faces were of actors , not study participants , and that there would be no Internet chat .
The scenario was intended to keep the teens engaged -- maintain a high level of anticipation / motivation -- during the tasks .
This helped to ensure that the scanner would detect contrasts in brain circuit responses to high interest versus low interest peers .
Although the faces were selected by the researchers for their happy expressions , their attractiveness was random , so that they appeared to be a mix of typical peers encountered by teens .
As expected , the teen participants deemed the same faces they initially chose as high interest to be the peers most interested in interacting with them .
Older participants tended to choose more faces of the opposite sex than younger ones .
When they appraised anticipated interest from peers of high interest compared with low interest , older females showed more brain activity than younger females in circuitry that processes social emotion .
" This developmental shift suggested a change in socio-emotional calculus from avoidance to approach , " noted Pine .
The circuit is made up of the nucleus accumbens ( reward and motivation ) , hypothalamus ( hormonal activation ) , hippocampus ( social memory ) and insula ( visceral / subjective feelings ) .
By contrast , males showed little change in the activity of most of these circuit areas with age , except for a decrease in activation of the insula .
This may reflect a waning of interpersonal emotional ties over time in teenage males , as they shift their interest to groups , suggest Pine and colleagues .
"
In females , absence of activation in areas associated with mood and anxiety disorders , such as the amygdala , suggests that emotional responses to peers may be driven more by a brain network related to approach than to one related to fear and withdrawal , " said Pine .
" This reflects resilience to psychosocial stress among healthy female adolescents during this vulnerable period .

Apparently , Amazon ( s amzn ) CEO Jeff Bezos ’ abject apology for remotely nuking copies of “ 1984 ” and “ Animal Farm ” from hundreds of unsuspecting Kindle devices was not enough for one Michigan teenager .
Seventeen - year - old Justin Gawronski filed suit against the company in federal court in Seattle last week , charging the Kindle maker with violating its own terms of service , breach of contract and illegal hacking , among other things .
The plaintiff claims the unilateral removal of “ 1984 ” from his Kindle wrecked his work on a summer reading assignment because the notes he took accompanying the e-book now referred to paragraphs and electronic pages that are no longer there .
His lawyer is seeking class action certification for the case .
If I were in Bezos ’ shoes I ’d settle this one quickly , because the issues raised in the Gawronski suit are likely to be the least of Amazon ’s Kindle problems going forward , legally and otherwise .
The biggest legal problem Amazon created for itself with the sneak attack on “ 1984 ” was revealing that it has the capability to remotely delete Kindle books in the first place .
Even if Amazon were to promise not to do it again ( as part of a settlement with Gawronski , say ) it wo n’t be possible to un-ring that bell .
Amazon now will undoubtedly face demands ( and perhaps court orders ) in future copyright disputes to use its powers to zap the offending files en masse , thus turning unwitting Kindle users into legal cannon fodder .
The capability could also land Amazon in the middle of the brewing controversy over software “ kill switches , ” which may soon come complete with subpoenas from the Federal Trade Commission and “ invitations ” to testify before Congress .
The non-legal problems stemming from the episode , however , could prove an even bigger headache for Amazon , and the lawsuit can only draw more attention to the e-tailer .
Though some consumer rights groups have waved the episode like the bloody shirt of excessive DRM , what Amazon did was n’t really a case of digital rights management run amok .
The problem was that the company did n’t really have the rights it thought it had .
What Amazon did have was liability , for distributing infringing works .
And in an effort to manage its liability it threw its customers under the bus .
Call it : Digital Liability Management .
That ’s hardly the image Amazon wants to be projecting right now , as consumers are just starting to pay attention to e-books and e-book devices in significant numbers .
According to a new report from Forrester Research , the percentage of American consumers who had never heard about e-book readers fell by more than half between the first quarter of 2008 and the second quarter of 2009 , to 17 percent from 37 percent .
Meanwhile , the percentage who had seen ( but not yet used ) a device jumped to 36 percent from 21 percent in the same period .
At the same time , Amazon is facing its first serious competition in the e-book market , as described in a new GigaOM Pro report ( subscription required ) .
Last month , for instance , Barnes & Noble ( s bks ) announced the launch of a full - scale assault on the e-book market , rolling out the multiplatform Barnes & Noble eBookstore and releasing an updated version of its eReader application for reading e-books on a wide range of portable and desktop devices .
B&N also said it will become the exclusive e-book store provider for Plastic Logic ’s planned Kindle - killer when it ’s released early next year .
Google , meanwhile , recently announced plans to make an e-commerce platform available to publishers to sell e-books directly to consumers starting later this year .
Sony is also expected to release an updated version of its pioneering e-book reader , perhaps as soon as this week , and has partnered with Google to make thousands of public domain titles available on the devices .
The “ 1984 ” and “ Animal Farm ” kerfuffle , in other words , could not have come at a worse time , strategically , for Amazon , and could ultimately prove more costly than settling the Gawronski case .

Are there going to be more layoffs at AOL ?
An employee asked CEO Tim Armstrong at today 's big all - hands meeting in Dulles .
Tim 's answer , according to a tweet from the event : " Let me be totally straightforward and honest and transparent : I 'll tell you over the next 60 days . "
An AOL source told us that during Tim 's meeting all of AOL New York last week , he " strongly implied " layoffs would be necessary .
Tim said that in the last few years , AOL had cut every cost that it could besides its personnel budget .
He said that in AOL 's European offices , travel budgets are so tight employees are n't allowed to expense gasoline anymore .
The implication , according to our source , was that layoffs are inevitable and that it 's just a matter of how big they will be .
Benchmarking AOL 's headcount against several of its very successful rivals , we figure AOL ( TWX ) will end up reducing staff by ~2,000 .

Ten more companies have joined the Color of Change boycott against Glenn Beck ’s Fox News program .
The additions to the list include Applebee ’s , DirecTV , Travelers Insurance , Kraft , and Vonage .
This now brings the total number of advertisers who have dropped Beck to 46 since he called President Obama a racist .
James Rucker , Executive Director of ColorOfChange.org , said , “ All 46 companies that have distanced themselves from Glenn Beck should be applauded for their stance .
We are still reaching out to companies whose ads we see during Beck ’s nightly program , ” Rucker continued .
“ Based on the fact that many of the recent ads on Beck ’s program are for gold coins and News Corp properties , it looks like Fox News Channel is struggling to place advertisements on Beck ’s show . ”
A quick look at the recent advertisers on Beck ’s show illustrates Mr. Rucker ’s point .
According to Media Matters , here is the list of advertisers on Beck ’s show for August 27 , National Republican Trust PAC — GOPTrust.com , EasyWater , Rosland Capital , 1- 800 - PetMeds , Bank of America , Wall Street Journal , Lear Capital , Liberty Medical , Our Country Deserves Better PAC — TeaPartyExpress.org , Pulaski & Middleman , Merit Financial , The Dannon Company , Inc. ( Activia ) , Goldline International Inc. , Sandals , Ad Council , Fox Fantasy Football , Binder & Binder .

Beck and FNC have gone from garnering ad revenue from the Fortune 500 to advertising that involves tea baggers and fantasy football .
Judging by the above list and the push back that the network is allowing Beck and O’Reilly to do , this boycott is starting to hurt .
The network still has no clue how to combat this .
What FNC and Glenn Beck should have done is very simple .
They should have apologized .
It did n’t even have to be a full apology .
Beck could have claimed that his words have been misinterpreted .
If he would have done this , advertisers would not have gotten nervous , and the boycott would not have been effective .
Beck started this whole thing with his idiotic statement about Obama being a racist , and he had the power to end it , but instead he chose to stand by his statements , and now he and Fox News are paying the price .
The network tried to ignore the boycott .
They tried to send Beck on vacation , but nothing has worked .
With their advertisers fleeing , Beck and FNC are left with nothing but clueless bluster .
State police Lt. Col. Steven G. O’Donnell said there is nothing prohibiting caregivers from lacing their marijuana with phencyclidine ( PCP ) or other powerful drugs .
[ Providence Journal ]
" It ’s very unregulated , " he said .
" It makes no sense to us .
We regulate hamburger and food , but we do not regulate medical marijuana .
There are no checks and balances . "
Legal medical marijuana has been around for more than a decade now , but that certainly has n't stopped bitter law - enforcement spokespeople from conjuring horrific doomsday fantasies about it .
Police in Rhode Island are still struggling to understand the issue , it seems :
No , no , no , you misunderstand , sir .
It 's medical marijuana that 's legal in Rhode Island , not PCP .
Got it ?
Medical m-a-r-i-j-u-a-n-a .
You can still arrest people for PCP .
I doubt this will be an issue though , because for some reason , medical marijuana laws do n't seem to result in increased use of PCP .
It 's awesome .
But O'Donnell still does n't get it .
There 's something bothering him about marijuana policy , but he can't quite figure out what it is :
Here , lets try that line again , but this time without the word " medical . "
I think we 're onto something here .
If we could all just agree that marijuana – medical and otherwise – needs to be monitored for quality and sold by licensed professionals , maybe we can finally put this whole mess behind us .
Google released Chrome for Mac OS X and Linux Thursday -- but only in rough developer preview versions that the company warns are works in progress .
" In order to get more feedback from developers , we have early developer channel versions of Google Chrome for Mac OS X and Linux , but whatever you do , please DON'T DOWNLOAD THEM , " Google product managers Mike Smith and Karen Grunberg said in a blog post , evidently trying to employ a little reverse psychology .
" Unless of course you are a developer or take great pleasure in incomplete , unpredictable , and potentially crashing software . "
Until now , Google 's open - source browser has been a Windows - only product , and some Mac and Linux users have been clamoring for their own version .
Google coders have been working to rebuild some Chrome components , such as its graphical interface and its sandbox that isolates different processes from each other , to move beyond just Windows .
Google offers three versions of Chrome : stable , beta , and developer preview .
The Mac OS X and Linux versions fall into this last , category , the most buggy and least tested and complete .
Nine staff have been sacked from their local authority jobs for snooping on personal records of celebrities and personal acquaintances held on the core database of the government 's National Identity Scheme .
They are among 34 council workers who illegally accessed the Customer Information System ( CIS ) database , which holds the biographical data of the population that will underpin the government 's multi-billion - pound ID card programme .
The disclosures , obtained by Computer Weekly using the Freedom of Information Act , will add to calls for the government to come clean over the security of the National Identity Scheme .
The CIS database , run by the Department for Work and Pensions , stores up to 9,800 items of information on 92 million people , including sensitive data , such as ethnicity , relationship history , whether someone is being investigated for fraud and whether they have special needs .
Freedom of information requests by Computer Weekly , have uncovered a string of breaches by council workers :
Cardiff and Glasgow councils sacked staff after they looked up celebrities ' personal records
Tonbridge and Bromley councils sacked workers for looking up their friends
Brent sacked someone who looked at their girlfriend 's details
A worker at Torfaen was sacked for looking at his own details
But this may just be the tip of the iceberg .
Many of the breaches were discovered after sample checks , raising concerns that other breaches may gone undetected .
Over 200,000 government officials have access to the database , including staff at 480 local authorities , and numerous government departments , including the Department of Work and Pensions , HM Revenue & Customs , and the Courts Service .
The Child Support Agency uses the CIS to trace missing parents ,
Gus Hosein , a management systems academic with the London School of Economics , said that breaches were inevitable .
" Human nature and the propensity of governments to abuse privacy means that the only real safeguard is to not collect this information in the first place , " he said .
" Create a central store and you will get abuse " .
A DWP spokesman said , " The small number of incidents shows that the CIS security system is working and is protected by several different audit and monitoring controls , which actively manage and report attempts at unauthorised or inappropriate access . "
In other breaches discovered by Computer Weekly , Exeter sacked someone for being unable to justify an access to the database .
Hertsmere and Penwith ( now part of Cornwall ) councils sacked people for looking at records they should n't , but could n't say what the records were .
Carmarthenshire Council disciplined a person who illegally used the CIS to look at the records in July 2008 of someone " known personally " to them , but refused to give details .
Solihull took disciplinary action after a CIS breach in February 2008 .
Peter Sommer , visiting professor at the London School of Economics Information Systems Integrity Group , said , " Any system in which you have a large number of users can never be secure .
Instead of giving generalised assurances , the government should say explicitly what level of security failures they consider to be acceptable .
Politically , that is a very awkward thing to say . "
The government plans to extend use of the CIS , beyond its present community of DWP government partners and customers .
Its next phase of development , called CISx ( CIS cross - government ) , will give access to departments such as the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency .
A Home Office spokesman said the CIS breaches should not reflect badly on the National Identity Scheme , which is still in development .
The CIS might be pegged as the biographical store for the Identity Scheme , he said , but Home Office data would be stored separately from data held by the DWP and protected by " strict access controls " .
" IPS [ Identity and Passport Service ] will make the systems supporting the National Identity Scheme as secure as possible , building on an excellent track record with the current passport database , " he said .
The DWP is conducting the ongoing development of the CIS in close partnership with the Home Office and HMRC .

The trial of a couple accused of the manslaughter of their daughter by gross criminal negligence continues before an Australian court .
Homeopath Thomas Sam , 42 , and his 36 - year - old wife Manju have pleaded not guilty to the death of Gloria Thomas , their 9 - month - old daughter .
According to the Brisbane Times :
Gloria was not taken to the emergency department of the Sydney Children ’s Hospital until her skin was weeping , her body malnourished and her corneas melting , the court heard .
Prior to this , it is alleged that Manju took Gloria to India against the advice of a paediatrician , who wanted her to see another specialist .
Once there , it is said that she ignored the creams doctors prescribed for Gloria ’s eczema , instead administering homeopathic drops .
Once Thomas had joined them for his brother ’s wedding , the prosecution claims that the couple continued to administer homeopathic remedies despite Gloria ’s deteriorating condition .
However , Manju did not extend this treatment to herself when she developed extreme abdominal pain shortly before the wedding , going instead to a conventional hospital where she was diagnosed with gallstones .
Prosecutor Mark Tedeschi stated :
The Crown case is that they put their social obligations well ahead of any concern for Gloria ’s wellbeing .
Gloria ’s eczema was so bad that passengers on the plane back to Australia thought she was suffering from burns or was covered in tumours , and was in inconsolable pain .
Despite this , it took eight days for her parents to take her to Sydney Children ’s Hospital , where she succumbed to sepsis three days later .
According to the Australian Daily Telegraph :
Forensic pathologist Ella Sugo has told a NSW Supreme Court jury she had to get advice from an expert in third world malnourishment when she put together her report on Gloria because she had never seen , and has never seen since , a child in such bad condition .
The defence argues that the first - time mother had been “ badly let down ” by a Sydney paediatrician , and that the parents should not be found guilty because they came from a culture were homeopaths were on equal footing with conventional doctors .
However , Thomas allegedly told police in an interview that he failed his daughter by disregarding conventional medicine and pursuing alternatives :
I could have done better .
I should have taken better care of Gloria .
The pair face up to twenty - five years in prison if found guilty .

Advertisement Microsoft has allowed the public to get their hands on its new hands - free games controller for the first time .
The US firm showed off the " Natal " technology , designed for use with its Xbox 360 console , at the European games convention gamescom in Germany .
The controller uses a microphone combined with visual and infrared cameras to control the onscreen action .
It was first unveiled at the E3 Expo in Los Angeles in June this year , but had not been on public display until now .
Kudo Tsunoda , Xbox 360's general manager and creative director of Natal , said that as consoles evolved from being a dedicated games machine into " living room entertainment " , it was important to develop a new control interface .
" The current controller is a barrier to some people using our console , " he said .
" To many users , the vast array of buttons and analogue sticks is plain confusing . "
Mr Tsunoda said that Natal would allow casual users to use the console while at the same time delivering " extra fidelity to core users " .
Two demos were on show at gamescom for people to try out , including a playable version of Burnout Paradise in which users control cars using an imaginary steering wheel , moving their feet forwards or backwards to control the speed .
Heat maps
At the heart of the Natal system is an infrared sensor that detects a person , their movements and their distance from the sensor .
The device calibrates itself to the room 's temperature and then looks for warm bodies around the room .
Clothes , people , size , lighting - we 're making Natal so it will work in all conditions

Microsoft unveils new controller
Once detected , it scans the person 's shape and tries to match it against profiles it stores in its memory .
If the person is new , it asks them to create a new profile .
If it finds a match , it loads the person 's profile and begins to work out their position .
If a person moves towards the sensor they become " hotter " ; as they step back they get " colder " .
Natal plots 48 different points on a person 's body , such as hands , feet and elbows , to create a wire - frame virtual manikin that mimics a person 's movements .
Mr Tsunoda said that this means that even if someone - or something - were to move in front of a player , the sensor would not get confused , providing some of the player was still visible .
The system will allow players to automatically log on to the Xbox Live network , which allows players to compete with other gamers across the internet .
It would also monitor and adapt as people change shape , he added .
" If you take a young child , they grow at quite a fast rate , " he said .
" However , these changes over days or weeks are slight .
So if there are small day - to - day changes , Natal will recognise that and update your profile . "
Mr Tsunoda said that because everything was done in infrared , it negated any problems they could have encountered with normal light .
" Clothes , people , size , lighting - we 're making Natal so it will work in all conditions .
" And , yes , you can even log in and play Natal in the dark . "

The Future of Farming : Eight Solutions For a Hungry World
The challenge of growing twice as much food by 2050 to feed nine billion people — with less and less land — is everyone ’s problem .
But scientists are hard at work fomenting a second green revolution .
The Classic Dungeon Adventure Game
This is n't the game that started the Adventure Game craze , the " Collosal Cave Adventure " started that .
However , this is the game that spawned commercial computer games around 1980 .
When this game appeared at work , seemingly everyone stayed into the evening and was amazed at the detail and puzzles .
Forget Myst .
This game stretches the imagination and has interesting puzzles .
As was customary at the time , computer games were free .
The source code for this one bears an Infocom copyright , however it allows free noncommercial distribution .
I obtained it in 1991 and compiled it for MS / DOS .
Of course it will run under Windows !
The program was written in Fortran , and I 'm not providing the source , lest it spoil the game !
Back around 1980 , the folks at Infocom wrote a game interpreter and rewrote Zork to run on it , making it possible to play the game on Apples , TRS - 80's , CP / M boxes , and other systems of the day rather than being limited to mainframes .
THIS program is the original mainframe version .
It is equivalent to Zork I + about half of Zork II + the endgame of Zork III .
If by some chance the only version of the game you ever played was on a mainframe , this version may be somewhat of a treat as it is the last mainframe version and has the Bank of Zork and Maze puzzles which did n't appear in early versions .
For all these versions , just unzip the files somewhere and run from that location .
These programs run from the command line .
Dungeon Adventure Game ( AKA " Zork " ) for DOS and Windows ( 194 k )
Dungeon Adventure Game ( AKA " Zork " ) for Mac OS X ( 270 k ) ( Recompiled - now a 64 - bit Intel CPU only binary , also uses static library )
Dungeon Adventure Game ( AKA " Zork " ) for Linux ( 201k ) . -- built for 32 - bit Linux .
If you have a 64 - bit distribution you will need to add 32 - bit support .

Royal Mail has condemned the action by workers Postal workers in a Teesside town have staged a 24 - hour strike in a row over working conditions .
About 180 staff at the Middlesbrough delivery office began the walkout in the early hours of Saturday .
The Communication Workers Union ( CWU ) members were protesting over a modernisation programme by Royal Mail .
The industrial action is part of a UK - wide campaign .
Royal Mail said modernisation was necessary to combat increased competition in the industry .
Pete Sansum , the CWU 's delivery representative in Middlesbrough , said : " We do not like to take action and we do not like to impose any issues on our customers .
' Intensifying competition ' " But the reality is our members are being pushed and bullied and we have to try and take some action to stop this . "
Other industrial action took place in Greater Manchester , the West Midlands and Wales on Saturday .
A Royal Mail spokesman said : " We will be doing our best to mitigate the impact of strikes in any area where the CWU is taking action .
" We are again talking with the union having met them more than 50 times already in recent months .
" We again urge the CWU to call off its strikes and to join Royal Mail 's drive to complete the modernisation of the business as we tackle the intensifying competition from electronic media and the impact of the recession on mail volumes , now falling at around 10 % a year . "

The American health care system is exceptionally good at cutting - edge technologies .
The top five American hospitals together conduct more clinical trials than any entire European country .
Yet over all , our health care system has failed us .
Troll through World Health Organization data and cringe : Americans live shorter lives than Greeks , our kids are twice as likely to die by age 5 as Portuguese children , and American women are 11 times as likely to die in childbirth as women in Ireland .
Over all , we rank well below most European countries in our health statistics ( for which you can also blame the Danish in your hand as you read this ) .
The larger problem is that we over - invest in clinical care like CAT scans and underinvest in public health .
There should be a Nobel Prize for Public Health , so that we might get more great minds wrestling with nonmedical pieces of the health puzzle , like industrial hog farms that can serve as breeding grounds for viruses and bacteria , from swine flu to MRSA .
President George W. Bush did an excellent job making preparations specifically for a flu epidemic , partly because of the avian flu scare and partly because he read a book about the 1918 influenza epidemic .
But he and other presidents starved the broader public health system , so that today it is in desperate shape .
Hospitals lack spare beds , ventilators and staff to cope with an epidemic .
One study found that a flu epidemic would mean that 10 million Americans would need to be hospitalized  compared with a total of nearly one million beds in America , about two - thirds of them occupied .
Last year , Representative Henry Waxman ordered a review of “ surge capacity ” in hospitals available for a terror attack , and found that more than half the emergency rooms studied were already operating above capacity .
We do n’t know whether this swine flu will be as lethal even as a typical flu season ( the boy who died in Texas last week has already received more attention than all 36,000 Americans who die in a typical year of the flu ) .
So far it has been mild in this country , but we know that the first wave of flu in 1918 caused few deaths but was followed three months later by a different form that killed tens of millions of people around the globe .
We do know we need to take precautions .
These include not only washing our hands with soap and water , but also instituting far - reaching health care reform in the coming months .
“ If a severe pandemic materializes , ” Dr. Redlener said , “ all of society could pay a heavy price for decades of failing to create a rational system of health care that works for all of us . ”
True story : Early in my career I worked for a life insurance company as a policyholder service representative .
My specific area of expertise ( and what led me into the pension business ) was annuities and IRAs .
The vast majority of my day was spent explaining to ( justifiably ) angry policyholders why their annuity was worth $ 225.00 or so at the end of the first year , despite the fact that they had put in $ 1,500.00 .
The explanation was simple :
The policy had a front - end load of 85 % of the first - year deposit .
Oh , I had charts and numbers to show them that they ’d actually recover that 85 % in year 35 or so , and had developed quite the standard pitch for why it was actually * better * for them to eat the charges in the first year and accumulate for their retirement future .
Honestly , I believed what I told them .
I had bought the company line that an 85 % loss in the first year would be recovered before they retired , and that extra one - tenth of one - percent earnings credit would be worth every point of the 85 % first - year load .
Anyone with a lick of financial sense will tell you this is utter nonsense .
It was a money grab for a fairly young company ( not going to tell you which one it was ) .
To make things uglier , this particular product was sold to young military families who thought they were being responsible and saving for retirement .
They also thought they ’d have the funds available to them if they had to take them out .
They did , of course .
15 % of them , anyway .
What insurance companies are great at : selling stupid .
They write the book on it .
They work hard at it , invest a lot of money into it , and not simply to sell customers , but the public in general .
They will sell you just about whatever they think you ’ll buy , and if there ’s any doubt that you wo n’t buy it , they ’ll sweeten the pot with something to make you think you should buy it .
Not all that different from other companies , except that insurers are dealing with serious life , death , and health decisions that affect us all on a daily basis .
If you buy a crummy TV because the TV salesman convinced you it was a good deal , it just means you do n’t have some bells and whistles that other TVs have .
But if you invest retirement dollars , or health care dollars into a crummy product , it ’s another thing entirely .
Because of my own experience , I find it very difficult to take stories like this one in today ’s New York Times seriously .
Evidently employees of Humana are offended that insurers are being singled out as villains in the health care reform battle .
Lisa A. Toombs , 40 , a technology project manager and mother of three , said she had been taken aback by the attacks .
“ The way I see it , ” she said , “ the people who work for the insurance companies are average people .
We ’re not crazy lunatics running around trying to get at people . ”
Well , true enough .
They ’re not .
But they are enslaved to the policies of the company who signs their paycheck , and to be clear here , they ’re also a marketing target .
After all , they need buy - in from their employees on their practices , and they also use their leverage as a large employer to spread their message :
“ You hear the horror stories about individuals having coverage denied , not getting full coverage , C.E.O. ’s getting golden parachutes , ” said Napoleon Dobbins , 57 , a manager of Humana ’s Medicare call center .
“ You do n’t hear about the good , only the bad . ”
The workers said they found the political attacks surprising given the insurance industry ’s engagement in this year ’s debate .
The companies have agreed to stop rejecting applicants with pre-existing health conditions if the government will mandate health coverage , creating vast new markets .
Beyond their trumpeting of the party line ( a not - so - carefully disguised agreement to take on tens of millions of captive policyholders ) , there is also a fear that changing the status quo will put them out of a job .
This fear is reinforced by company management , who uses subtle , yet effective techniques to let employees know that any change or challenge to their ascendant place will put their own livelihood at risk .
Insurance companies always land on their feet , even when they ’re playing both ends of the risk game , like AIG .
There is always a new product , a new way to get a piece of the action , and they know this .
As the article points out , Medicare Advantage has profited them well over the past six years .
Humana ’s profit margin was 2.2 percent in 2008 on revenues of nearly $ 29 billion .
Its revenues have more than doubled since 2004 , with almost all of the growth coming from the sale of privately administered Medicare Advantage plans .
Those plans now account for the vast majority of Humana ’s business , a real vulnerability if Mr. Obama succeeds in cutting Medicare Advantage because of its comparatively high administrative costs .
Medicare Advantage was the Bush Administration end - run around Medicare .
After failing to privatize Social Security ( a disaster narrowly averted ) , they went for Medicare with the Part D expansion as cover for the privatization effort .
Humana ’s profits on Medicare Advantage are n’t unique .
Every insurer credits Medicare Advantage for the larger and larger profit numbers they ’re reporting .
So yeah , of course they do n’t want to see those reforms happen .
After all of the confusion and crazy allegations , there is this :
The health - insurance - for - profit model works against the interests of individuals .
The virtual lock insurers have on the “ markets ” work against the interests of employers , who want to provide benefits to their employees at the lowest possible cost .
The healthy bottom lines of companies like Humana depend on putting a large segment of citizens in this country at their mercy .
There are many models for increasing health care efficiency , while decreasing costs that do n’t include padding the bottom line of large corporations .
Doctors spend extraordinary amounts of money and time dealing with claims issues , from having to fill out justification for a particular prescription in triplicate to fighting for their decision to refer a patient for testing .
The purpose of this article is to gin up sympathy for the employees of these companies , who feel demonized by the debate .
My attitude is that they ’re victimized right alongside everyone else .
They ’re underpaid , overworked , stressed , and get to watch the CEO carry home millions while they struggle to make ends meet in their own homes , while receiving messages every day that reforms will cost them their jobs .
It ’s workplace abuse , delivered legally and subtly .
While I have sympathy for them , I also have hope that they ’ll be able to see beyond the messaging to what ’s true .
The messengers , in this case , carry the message their handlers have given them to carry .
They ’ll back it up with facts and figures , just like I did .
But eventually , they ’ll step away and realize that the message they ’re carrying is a bundle of smoke and mirrors .
You Call this a ' Recovery ' ?
53 economists surveyed by Bloomberg this week said that ‘ the worst is over ’ for the economy … clearly , the stimulus is working .
Hmmm … let ’s take a closer look .
The Reuters / University of Michigan index showed that consumer sentiment declined in early August to 63.2 from 66.0 in July .
It is the lowest reading since March , and is significantly worse than the 69.0 reading that economists surveyed by MarketWatch had expected .
“ From a consumer finance position , people are still struggling , ” said Scott Hoyt , senior director of consumer economics for Moody ’s Economy.com .
“ Wages have fallen from the previous year and consumers [ still ] do n’t have alternative sources of cash . ”
Keep reading to see what Bill has to say about this so - called ‘ recovery ’ …
Guess how many jobs the US private sector has added over the last 10 years ?
Almost none .
Private sector employment is back to levels of 1999 .
There are more jobs in restaurants and health care … but many fewer in manufacturing .
Net gain : zero .
The only job gains have been in the parasite sector – government .
On the evidence , this trend is going to continue .
Now , the feds have a new post called “ pay czar . ”
As near as we can tell this is a busybody who undertakes to control salaries in the industries that the feds have bailed out .
There will be a lot more jobs running the regulatory / bailout apparatus .
Then , too , there are all the make - work jobs of the shovel ready boondoggles the feds began in an effort to replace private spending .
Back in the private sector , 72 banks have failed so far this year .
And a record 34 million Americans are getting food stamps .
Naturally , incomes are falling .
Now , imagine the consumer …he ’s already paying 15 % of his disposable income to debt service … and then his income is cut in half !
This means that 30 % of his remaining income must be used just to service the debt .
Impossible to do without big cuts in spending …
The poor consumer hit the wall in 2007 .
He was spending all he earned … and paying more of his income in debt service than at any time in the last 60 years .
He could n’t continue to living on future earnings – there just were n’t enough of them .
That is why the finance industry has topped out .
It loaded Americans up with enough debt already .
And it ’s why the credit cycle has turned .
All of a sudden savings rates are back up to 7 % .
Consumers are cutting back … raising chickens in their back yards … driving less …planting gardens and squeezing their nickels .
The private sector is de-leveraging .
And there wo n’t be any durable economic boom or lasting bull market on Wall Street until this process is finished .
The above is just an excerpt from Bill ’s standout essay from this week .
You can read it in its entirety here .
That ’s it for us this today .
Enjoy the rest of your weekend ,

The first attempt by a team of British engineers to smash the longest - standing land speed record was dashed when the car 's turbine became stuck .
The Hampshire - based team earlier began four days of attempts to break the world steam car record at Edwards air base , in California 's Mojave Desert .
They hope their steam car , Inspiration , will reach speeds of 170 mph ( 274 km / h ) .
The current world steam car record of 127mph ( 204 km / h ) was set by American Fred Marriot in 1906 in Florida .
For FIA records , two runs in opposite directions , which have to be less than an hour apart , are averaged out .
How steam car 's speed compares
The team said it had unofficially beaten the steam car record during test runs on Saturday .
It is hoped the official attempts will resume as soon as possible .

The 25 ft - long ( 7.6 m ) three - tonne car , nicknamed the " fastest kettle in the world " and the " lean , green , mean machine " , has been 10 years in the making in Lymington .
It is being driven by its main financial backer Charles Burnett III .
But project manager Matt Candy earlier admitted there had been problems during the test runs .
" We 've had overheating electrical components , so we 've started using an awful lot of dry ice every day to cool those , " he said .
" We 've also had a lot of gas pressure problems , due to the temperature causing the liquid propane to vaporise further up the car than it normally does .
" We 've had vapour locks .
We 've had pumps that could n't cope with the extra pressure . "
Fred Marriot set the record in a steam car dubbed " the Rocket " in 1906
But the car still achieved a 137mph ( 221 km / h ) average over two test runs .
The British team includes test driver Don Wales , nephew of the late Donald Campbell and grandson of Sir Malcolm Campbell .
Between them , those two ancestors achieved more than 20 land and water speed records .
Mr Wales told the BBC that the main engineering obstacle was to develop a compact boiler system which every minute could turn 40 litres ( 8.8 gallons ) of water into superheated steam at 400C ( 752 F ) , at 40 times atmospheric pressure .
The team was forced to abandon a test run in March on Thorney Island , near Emsworth , when technical problems set in .
The longest - standing land speed record is recognised by the Federation International Automobile ( FIA ) .
American Fred Marriott set the record in a steam car dubbed " the Rocket " on Ormond Beach , Florida , now known as Daytona Beach .

Bolt set a new world record of 9.58 seconds in the men's 100 m at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin , a speed of 23.3 mph .
Mark Webber had the highest average speed of 119.61 mph in his Red Bull at F1's Hungarian Grand Prix in July .
Mallard , a Class A4 steam locomotive , set the steam locomotion land speed record - 125.88 mph - on 3 July 1938 .
Fred Marriott has held the current land speed record for steam - powered vehicles since 1906 , when he reached 127.659 mph in his Stanley car .
The British Steam Car team say their car has reached 137.14 mph in testing , but this is an unofficial figure .
They hope to reach up to 170 mph in their record attempt ( indicated by yellow bar ) .
British - built
Thrust SSC set the world land speed record in October 1997 , reaching 763.035 mph in a desert in the US state of Nevada .
The speed of sound changes according to factors including temperature and altitude , but a standard figure given is roughly 768 mph .

Girandoni air rifles and Girandoni style air guns - A major research study .
Austrian Large Bore Airguns Girandoni style air rifles and pistols - preliminary research presentation . .
By Robert D. Beeman Ph.D .
Updated 30 September 2006
For the VERY latest information concerning amazing new discoveries about the Lewis and Clark airgun , please click on : the Lewis Assault Rifle section AND see the latest notes in the What 's New section of this website .
Large bore antique airguns have always been a specialty of the Beeman Airgun Collection .
In the last three decades , Mrs. Beeman and I have been fortunate to acquire one of the largest collections of Austrian large bore airguns and information about them .
This is a preliminary presentation about some specimens from that , starting with the best known of these arms : the famous Girandoni system airguns first developed slightly before the 19th century .
The eventual demise of these military airguns by about 1810 had little to do with their effectiveness , but was more involved with the logistics of keeping them charged in combat , the inability of contemporary gunsmiths to maintain the guns , and with the political implications of such weapons which mistakenly were believed to be " silent " .
That the design was widely copied later in civilian circles indicates that it was well accepted by discriminating civilian gunsmiths and shooters .
The system really was more suited to hunters who do not fire so many shots as a soldier , who can have the air reservoirs pumped up at leisure - even by a servant , and whose lives generally do not depend on the gun .
Virtually all of the 19th century copies of the Girandoni system airguns proudly bear the name of the maker and the city of his shop .
Truly outstanding copies , sometimes richly ornamented with gold and silver coatings and inlays , deeply engraved , and bearing superb , ornate stocks bear the names of such makers as Contriner , Lowentz , Fisher , etc..
Lowentz and Schembor of Vienna and Staudenmayer , Fisher , and Mortimer of London produced a very few high quality Girandoni system repeaters and even single shot air rifles and shotguns with the characteristic Girandoni styling .
There are other makers of lesser rank and quality .
Copies made after 1900 generally are unsigned and some are crude , even clumsy .
The Girandoni system is not easy to reproduce in high quality .
After some detailed coverage of the Girandoni military repeating air rifle , we will consider the Girandoni repeating air pistol , several Girandoni style airguns in the Beeman Airgun Collection and some of the myths about the Girandoni system guns .
They following material is only a preliminary posting of our research .
The most intense research is now concentrated on the Girandoni repeating air rifles .
The next phase will concentrate on the Girandoni system airguns and Girandoni style air guns .
One of our major research objectives is to greatly increase the knowledge , understanding , and appreciation of these special airguns .
We constantly are seeking additional specimens , references , and information so that we may present the best single source of information on this group .
What is our background in this area of study ?
Mrs. Beeman and I have been intensely interested in antique large bore airguns , especially the Girandoni system rifles and pistols , for over three decades .
This began long before our interest in collecting and studying airguns of the 20th century .
During that time we have studied such airguns with the late Henry Stewart ( who started us on the trail to the Lewis airgun ) in his astonishing gunroom , and in person in the collections at the Tower of London , Beeman Airgun Collection , Virginia Military Institute , Smithsonian Institute , U.S. National Firearms Museum , U.S. Army War College , Fort Clatsop Museum , German National Museum , Military Museum of Turkey , Kopenhagen Tøjhusmuseum ( Royal Danish Arsenal Museum ) , Milwaukee Public Museum , Zurich Landmuseum , Bern Historical Museum , Solthurn Zueghaus , Deutsch Jagdmuseum - Munich , Jagdmuseum Kranichstein - Darmstadt , Waffensammmlung des Kunsthistorischen Museum and Heeresgeschichtliches Museum – Wien , Staatliches Museum – Schwerin , Victoria and Albert Museum – London , and several other important gun collections throughout the world ..
The Jagdmuseum Kranichstein in Darmstadt , Germany and the Heeresgeschichtliches Museum in Vienna , Austria were especially valuable in our quest for information on this design .
In most cases , Mrs. Beeman and I were allowed to work in the private research facilities of the museums , in discussion with and active participation of the arms curators , studying , photographing , and even disassembling these incredible arms .
In addition , we have studied airguns at innumerable gun and airgun shows in America and overseas and we carry on a long and vigorous exchange of information with other museums and leading collectors all over the world .
We are enormously fortunate to have been able to develop the Beeman Airgun Collection .
A great deal of study has been done in that collection , which includes several models of the Girandoni design .
Antique large bore airguns are the main emphasis of the Collection , apparently the world ’s largest such collection .
In addition to developing a reference library on these guns , I have had the wonderful opportunity to study original references in person at many museums and at the U.S. Library of Congress .
Only a minor amount of the basic literature about the Girandoni - system airguns is available in English - and some of that is represented by very weak material in secondary sources , such as W.H.B. Smith , Eldon Wolff , and especially such popular general audience works as Nonte and Wesley .
I have concentrated mainly on the key works , which are in German .
I have also studied some of the less important papers which are in Italian and even French .
It is only too clear that many of the so - called references are simply wrong , have incorrect dates , and have repeated popular myths about these guns .
( For instance , virtually everyone had been repeating centuries - old misinformation about caliber , magazine capacity , and air bypass mechanisms . )
Some of Baer ’s writings , though wonderful and often original , continued to repeat incorrect information .
( As does some of the material in Joe Mussulman ’s truly outstanding Lewis and Clark website – he is committed to correcting those few points soon . ) .
Even some of the great recent work by Geoffrey Baker and Colin Currie needs additional information and fine tuning , due to photographic distortion , lack of access to certain parts of the museum specimens , and mistakes in the literature on which they were depending .
More than anyone , these authors are aware of this and are furiously working to make their book highly accurate for the sake of those who would like to recreate one of these guns .
We have been supplying very detailed information on the Beeman Girandoni .
Colin Currie , working with Geoffery Baker on that detailed structural guide to the Girandoni airgun , flew to the USA in December 2005 to examine museum quality reproductions and castings of this gun and to confer with master gunmaker Ernie Cowan and gun historian Rick Keller about them .
Working together , we are correcting and enlarging our own and each other ’s work .
I sincerely believe that the five of us will soon produce the most through and accurate information pool ever available on this incredible gun design .
The Girandoni Repeating Air Rifle Presented here is information which finally develops a fairly clear picture of the features and history of the Girandoni military repeating air rifle .
This information has become especially interesting and relevant because so much of it is new .
The operation and special features of this gun , even its shortcomings , may be even more important to us than its fabled firepower .
After inventing an ingenious , but unreliable and unsafe , multiple feed system for powder burning firearms in the very late 1700s , Bartholomäus Girandoni ( also spelled Girandony , Girardoni , etc. ) of Vienna very successfully adapted the system to large bore airguns .
Most of the following details are from the wonderful presentation of the design and details of this gun recently published by the British gun researchers Geoffrey Baker and Colin Currie ( 2002 ) and the meticulous and precise physical research of Ernie Cowan and Rick Keller , both combined with research and analysis by Robert Beeman .
The Girandoni system was adopted , in great secrecy , as the Austrian military repeating air rifle ( Hummelberger and Scharer , 1964 /65 ) .
It has been recorded that the system was invented in 1780 , but deliveries of these guns to the Austrian army did not begin until between 1787 and 1791 .
Hoff ’s ( 1977 ) classic reference on antique airguns and Hummelberger and Scharer ( 1964/65 ) indicate that about 1500 Girandoni military airguns were produced and that finally they were retired from service to Olmütz in Bohemia in 1815 .
Specimens , apparently from 1797 , and similar to , but more advanced than the military models , are known from Joseph Lowenz and Joseph Contriner in Vienna .
Hoff indicates that other Viennese gunmakers started making most of their copies of the Girandoni system well after the Austrian Army had given up all interest in such guns in 1815 .
Samuel Staudenmayer also began to make modified versions of these guns in his London shop from about 1806 to 1832 .

This is the actual specimen which most historians now believe is the very airgun carried and used by Meriwether Lewis in the Lewis and Clark expedition of 1803 - 06 .
There is an extensive section of this website devoted to a carefully detailed discussion of these exciting discoveries !
This actual specimen was donated by Dr. and Mrs. Robert Beeman to the U.S. Army War College 's Heritage and Education Museum in Carlisle , Pennsylvania on September 25 , 2006 .
It is on display at the NRA 's National Firearm Museum until May 2007 .

Such valves , with a single coil spring around a valve spindle with a valve seat at the forward end , were common in butt reservoir guns for at least one hundred years prior to the Girandoni airgun .
The actual Girandoni airguns are unusual in having a coil spring made of brass – very advanced for the period and difficult to make , but necessary because moisture from air condensation would rust an iron or steel spring ..

The heavy flat mainspring extends along the forward two thirds of the lock plate .
This unusually strong mainspring allowed much greater stored air pressure than a V shaped spring ( thus allowing the potentially higher power of the Girandoni design . ) .
The boat shaped air release wedge and striker latch are visible along the bottom rear edge of the lock plate .
Note the shaft of a drift punch , restraining the mainspring , just barely visible below the large hole which is bisected by the forward edge of the hammer .
The tumbler wedge , sear bridle , and sear lever are evident to the right .

Reproducing the receiver for a museum copy .
First , the actual receiver must have a plastic casting ( top two images ) made by making a flexible mold around the receiver , removing the receiver and then adding a special fluid to the mold cavity which expands , as it hardens , to the same degree as the later molten brass will shrink as it cools .
A rammed sand mold is made around this plastic casting , with a separation line .
The plastic casting is removed and the rammed sand mold filled with molten brass .
The resulting brass casting ( 3rd and 4th images ) is removed after cooling and then roughly machined to shape ( bottom image - note fin for clamping while working the piece .
It will be ground off as one of the last steps . ) .

Original drawings of the Girandoni military air rifle hand pump and air reservoir .
The extremely long thin pump at the left must have been clumsy to carry in the field ; but the photo of the Girandoni support pack system in Hoff ( 1976 ) makes it clear that the soldiers did carry them .
The long pump has a snap - off foot pedal / combination tool which could be held to the ground with the user ’s boots .
By moving the cylinder up and down while it is attached to the pump , air could be pumped , into the air cylinder .
The head of the piston consisted of a stack of seven , oiled leather washers .
Note that the little cross sectional view at the top left shows that the full diameter bore of the pump continued right out to the end as the vent hole of the pump .
This reduces the lost volume at the end of the pump , which needs to be kept to a minimum as air is compressed into this space as well and just expands again when the pump is extended .
These long , special high - pressure hand pumps could have been used to completely charge the air reservoirs but may have been mainly used to top off the pressure of partially pumped and partially expended bottles which otherwise would present a continuing problem to the individual soldiers A pump like the shorter , larger diameter pump shown is similar to the air pumps of most airguns and air canes .
Such a pump could have been used in the Girandoni shop and away from field action , to produce high pressures to test the air reservoirs .
The small diameter of the air vent passage .
would allow much higher pressures , with much greater effort , to be put into the tanks for testing .
These most unusual long pumps really reveal the genius of Girandoni .
With almost no dead space , these pumps would be extremely efficient - but their large bore size would prevent the field soldier from over - pumping the air rifle - this causing his rifle to improperly function or even to cause the air tank to explode .

Head of the air pump from authentic museum copy of the Girandoni Military Air Rifle made from the above diagram .
Two especially clever design features are shown here .
First , note that the plunger , surrounded by several leather seal rings , can come right to the end to the pump , thus eliminating virtually all dead air space - an arrangement necessary to produce very high pressure in the gun 's air reservoir .
Second , note that the plunger head with its seal rings can be projected out of the pump body ( as shown above ) so that sealing oil may be applied directly to the leather seals .
The seals may then be pulled into the pump body ( as shown below ) and a wrench applied to the lock nut - to precisely expand the seals to just the right seal and friction .
Note that the pump rod is prevented from turning during this adjustment because its square shaft is held from turning by the square hole in the other end of the pump body .

Operation of the Girandoni airgun system :
The Girandoni military air rifle is a butt reservoir air rifle with a rifled bore .
This conical iron air reservoir serves to hold a supply of highly compressed air and to act as the rifle ’s buttstock .
An external tubular magazine , along the right side of the barrel is described as holding 20 lead balls which are gravity fed to a transverse loading bar at the breech end of the barrel .
A flat spring running the length of the outside of the magazine holds the loading bar to the left .
When the gun is held muzzle up and the left end of the loading bar is pushed by the shooter , the bar moves to the right , and a cavity within the bar receives a ball by gravity feed from the magazine .
The ball is moved into firing position behind the barrel as the magazine spring is allowed to push the loading bar back to the left .
Until very recently we did not have an understanding of the internal operation of a Girandoni air rifle .
This lack of solid information led us into considerable confusion and error .
Thanks to the recent exhaustive work of Baker , Currie , Cowan , and Keller , and Beeman , we now have a clear picture of the internal operation of this airgun .
Presented here , for the first time , are color diagrams , by Geoffrey Baker , of the functioning of the ingenious lock and valve system of the Girandoni repeating air rifle .

Trigger is pulled , allowing hammer to start forward and have tumbler wedge engage notch of striker latch .
Wedge will push the striker assembly against air valve and start to release compressed air from reservoir Figure 22 .
Tumbler wedge is beginning to push on the striker assembly which has started to force open the air valve in the reservoir .
Air pressure is building to force the ball up the barrel .
The wedge will be forced out of the striker latch notch as the tumbler ’s wedge rotates further , clockwise , to the rear .

Wedge is now rising out of the latch notch .
Air valve is fully open .
High pressure air is forcing the ball up the barrel .
In the next stage the wedge will move back and slide out of the striker latch notch .
The air pressure and the valve spring in the reservoir will then force the air valve shut .
The hammer will then move forward and return to the rest position as shown in the first operation figure above .

Detail of first click when cocking .
As the hammer turns the tumbler counter - clockwise during cocking , the striker latch ( orange ) is snapped up as the rear lip of the tumbler wedge passes the point at the tip of the lower arrow .
Firearms lack a striker latch , therefore firearms do not produce a click at this point during cocking .
( This , and all following diagrams , by Geoffery Baker . )
Fig. 26 .
Detail of second click when cocking .
As the tumbler turns counter - clockwise , the sear ( yellow ) snaps into the normally deep half - cock notch at the tip of the lower arrow .
The depth of this notch normally prevents the sear from coming out of the notch .
This prevents the gun from discharging and serves as a “ safe ” position .
( Early production of the Girandoni air rifles did not have a half - cock position . )
Fig. 27 . Detail of third click .
As the tumbler rotates counter - clockwise , the sear tip snaps into the full - cock notch at the point of the arrow .
The gun will now discharge when pulling the trigger causes the sear to slip out of this shallow notch .

Tumbler is pushing down mainspring into its cocked , tensed position .
Pulling the trigger allows the sear ( yellow ) to move out of the full cock notch and release the potential force of the mainspring to push against the rear section of tumbler and cause it to rotate around the tumbler pivot pin .

( Upper diagram is a side view .

When the air valve closes , propelled by high pressure air in the reservoir , it gives a sudden acceleration to the striker assembly .
The striker latch guide screw limits the forward movement of the striker latch towards the barrel .
The first operational figure above shows that this screw is supported at both ends to resist the beatings of the striker latch being driven forward .
Its outer head is rounded for appearance and protection to the shooter ’s finger .
The striker latch guide screw does not have any adjustment role Note that the striker latch is not symmetrical .

After moving a ball into firing position , the gun is cocked by pulling back on a hammer - like cocking lever .
Moving the cocking lever back causes an internal tumbler on the inner end of the cocking lever ( hammer ) to force the mainspring down into a compressed position .
The cocking lever is held to the rear , against the pressure of the mainspring , by the half cock or full cock sear notches .
When the trigger is pulled and the tumbler is in the full cock position , the rearmost section of the trigger forces the sear out of the full cock notch .
The released force of the mainspring forces the tumbler to rotate , bringing the tip of a wedge shaped part on the tumbler into the notch of the striker latch .
The force of the mainspring is converted into a straight line motion as the wedge pushes the striker latch and thus the attached striker pin against the forward end of the air reservoir ’s valve .
The tip of the striker pin forces open the valve and releases a short blast of compressed air to force the ball up and out of the barrel .
The wedge then slips past the striker latch and the air valve spring , aided by air pressure in the reservoir , forces the air valve shut and returns the striker assembly back into its resting position .
Movement of the wedge is reversed during re-cocking , depressing the striker latch and allowing the wedge to pass without disturbing the striker assembly and air valve .
This all can be repeated so rapidly that all 22 balls could be fired in less than a minute .

The Girandoni lock system is a quite sophisticated , well - designed timed release design and the repeating mechanism reveals its genius by its efficiency and simplicity .
Baker and Currie ( 2002 ) make the very interesting observation that there was n’t another conventional military shoulder arm comparable to the firepower of the Girandoni repeating air rifle until the 1860 Spencer repeating firearm rifle of the American Civil War .
However , the Spencer had only a seven shot magazine and had to be reloaded frequently by the rather clumsy Blakeslee loader .
The Girandoni military air rifle had a gravity feed ball magazine listed at 20 rounds .
Each Girandoni - bearing military shooter was issued two extra air cylinders and four very efficient speedloader tubes , each containing twenty additional balls .
A fully loaded Girandoni kit had eighty of those large caliber balls ready for rapid action !
In typical use , discharged , or partially discharged , air cylinders would be exchanged for fresh full ones by runners going back and forth to stationary wheel pumps or special two axle wagons designed to carry up to 1000 pre-charged air cylinders , both positioned behind the combat lines .
Certainly the soldiers were not going to fully pump up their three cylinders in regular use as this would require about 4500 strokes with the hand pump !
Even a single cylinder could have taken over an hour and one - half of hard pumping action !
But the long slim pump , designed almost without dead space , while inefficient in the filling of cylinders , would be useful in “ topping off ” high pressure in partially expended cylinders .
The outstanding study of the history of the Girandoni Military Repeater Air Rifle by Walter Hummelberger and Leo Scharer ( 1964 ) reveals that the success of the Girandoni air rifle in warfare has been a mixed matter .
About 1780 , the Austrian military authorities , driven by Emperor Joseph ’s personal involvement and great enthusiasm for the Girandoni airguns , had secretly begun the development of the so - called Austrian Military Model 1780 Repeating Air Rifle .
By August 24 , 1787 , when Istanbul declared war against Russia , some air rifles and pumps were the only things that were ready for war .
It was realized from the beginning that it might not be practical to provide all the compressed air for these guns from little individual hand pumps .
So Girandoni developed a wheeled pump to fill the removable air bottles of the guns .
Originally , it was planned to have one such wheeled air machine for each five air rifles , plus the long hand pumps , but only two of the wheeled pumps actually were produced .
Later , it was decided to issue a hand pump to only every other soldier , underlining that the soldiers mainly were expected to depend on pre-charged air bottles brought to them by runners .
Girandoni developed a two axle wheeled wagon , or transporter , to safely carry up to 1000 of the pre-charged air bottles .
The conical butt reservoir may seem primitive , but actually this shape is extremely functional .
One of the most annoying features of many airguns with buttstock shaped air reservoirs in the Beeman collection is the difficulty of getting the vertical axis of the buttstock to line up with the vertical axis of the receiver .
A conical butt reservoir is round in cross section and thus there is no alignment problem ; one only need screw it onto the receiver until it is snug .
Thus the flat ring gasket between the receiver and reservoir , made of cow horn , can be of any reasonable thickness , regardless of tolerances , wear , oil swelling , or humidity .
The reservoir shape has little ergonomic disadvantage as recoil is negligible .
The steps in making a conical butt reservoir are shown in the illustrations .
Riveting the edges of the rolled edges is a somewhat difficult operation , even today .
However , the real trick is brazing the rolled edges and the base cup .
At first , standard brazing technique was used , but this just would not result in a leak proof reservoir .
Finally , the answer was found in information about 19th century steam tank fabrication .
The old , but very effective , technique was to heat the riveted reservoir red hot and submerge it in molten brazing metal !
Learning this also answered something that had puzzled us : why were the Girandoni reservoirs coated , inside and out , with copper like metal ?
This inner coating also provided a rust proofing against moisture resulting from the expansion of compressed air .
Making the reservoirs , in an authentic manner , will be one of the major challenges to those who would attempt to replicate these guns today .
Emperor Joseph personally was involved in the most detailed matters of the Austrian military airgun project and their use in combat .
He realized early that the air guns must be “ deployed correctly and maintained at the best standard .
It is necessary that the simple soldier , whose intelligence is generally quite limited , is given this training immediately upon receiving the gun – and that the training is delivered in individual parts and not too much at once . ”
It was determined that two corporals would have to be especially trained to train and supervise the rank soldiers in the use of the Girandoni airguns .
Thus every 20 air - riflemen would be supported by these two special corporals plus a specially trained officer .
In addition , there would be a specially trained journeyman gunsmith for each 100 airguns and a supply of replacement seals , air reservoirs , mainsprings , etc .. .
Even with this intense support , there was considerable malfunctioning and poor maintenance of the airguns .
Emperor Joseph was soon complaining that “ we appear to have a miserable bunch of riflemen , none of who is suitable for service with the air rifles . ”
By end of November 1788 the Emperor seems to have ordered that the air rifles be taken away from the troops .
The General Artillery Director , the Duke of Colloredo himself , reported on July 21 , 1789 : “ Due to their construction , these guns were much more difficult to use effectively than normal , as one had to handle them much more cautiously and carefully .
In addition , the soldiers using them had to be supervised extremely carefully , as they were unsure about the operation .
The guns become inoperable after a very short time – so much so that after awhile no more than one third of them were still is in a usable state .
We needed the whole winter to repair and replace them . ”
After this it was deemed wise to take back the airguns and issue them only to select , specially trained Tyrolean sharpshooter units .
The last order given by the Emperor prior to his death was “ to select the most promising and skilful soldiers to use these guns . ”
Because of extensive service work , and most importantly , the lack of Emperor Joseph ’s interest and involvement , the airguns still had not been issued on December 16 , 1792 .
However , the Tyrol Sharp Shooter Corps indicated “ that these weapons were really accurate and effective ” in the Turkish War and in 1790 against Prussia .
( Contrary to many accounts , they never saw service against any of Napoleon 's troops . )
The air rifles were later supplied only with the wheeled and short hand pumps behind the lines – the idea being that captured airguns would not be very useful without the pumps !
Thus , the Girandoni air rifle in combat required persons highly trained in its use and supported by wheeled air pumps and wagons of pre-charged air bottles .
These air guns easily were put of service and needed constant and expert tending .
A Girandoni air rifle was predestined to give inexperienced users trouble and charging with individual hand pumps was punishing to the user .
The dependability of the gun for lethal combat , under field conditions , especially without the backup of dozens of other airguns , was not high .
Because of the sophisticated nature of the flat mainspring and the timed release mechanism , Baker and Currie ( 2002 ) suggest that the Girandoni system is capable of much greater power than air rifles of less advanced design .
As of May 2003 they were only willing to indicate that this system could project a lead ball , of about one - half inch diameter , of about 210 grains to a muzzle velocity of at least 500 fps for about 117 ft. lbs. of muzzle energy .
Colin Currie reported ( personal communication May 18 , 2003 ) that the Royal Armories of Leeds , England recently charged the Heiberger .433 caliber air rifle , a formerly single shot air rifle made about 1750 but converted to a 23 shot Girandoni - style repeating system , apparently in the early to mid-1800s , to about 800 lbs /sq. inch and achieved a muzzle velocity of over 900 fps with balls of 120.4 grains for a muzzle energy of 217 ft. lbs .
He reported that 1500 strokes were needed to pump up the Heiberger ‘s buttstock reservoir to operating pressure after 20 shots had been fired from one charging / loading .
Larry Hannusch ( personal communication , Nov. 27 , 2002 ) reported that he has fired his own large bore Girandoni - system rifle ( by Lowentz ) producing 200 ft lbs .
muzzle energy at 750 psi pressure , but that a muzzle energy of up to 150 ft. lbs. would be more typical at conservative pressures .
Many references to the Girandoni air rifles mention lethal combat ranges of 125 to 150 yards and some extend that range considerably .
Currie and Baker also suggest that the Girandoni system could operate well at pressures well above 1000 psi , perhaps to double of that , and that they feel that the working pressure as supplied by special pumps , and thus the potential power , of the original guns was far higher than the figures normally quoted .
Keller and Cowan ( personal communications 9 November 2004 and 14 February 2005 ) think that the original air reservoir pressures topped at about 800 psi .
The potential muzzle energy will be more accurately determined from tests now underway with exact museum copies of these guns .
The power could be in the .38 Special area of modern firearms , or even , as probably overstated by Fred Baer ( 1973 ) into the range of the .45 ACP cartridge , famous in pistols and submachine guns favored by police , gangsters , and the military for several wars of the 20th century .
In any case , that heavy lead ball , fired from a Girandoni - system airgun , could be a very lethal object !
High air reservoir pressures , translating into high power , could be an advantage in battle where charged cylinders were being shunted to and from the shooters .
However , such pressures and volumes of air per shot for such large bore airguns present such a fearful appetite for compressed air that modern shooters of pre-charged pneumatic rifles resort to SCUBA tanks and motorized pumps for charging .
The power levels discussed above were very potent for the period .
However , foot pounds of energy do not tell the whole story .
Few hunters today would venture after big game with the energy levels of the old big bore airguns or flintlocks , but those big lead balls , about a half - inch in diameter , have a special effect – as does a deadly arrow with “ only ” fifty foot pounds of striking energy .
One has to respect a gun capable of shattering a huge lead ball against a distant steel plate , especially when a typical Girandoni system gun could deliver about 20 of those heavy missiles within the minute and another 80 rather suddenly !
The simple great inertia and the large wound channel of those big lead balls also makes them far more dangerous than paper figures would suggest .
Side Note on the Beeman Girandoni military air rifle :
We purchased the illustrated specimen from the private collection of an American antique gun dealer about 1975 without any provenance .
The master gun reproduction maker / historians , Ernie Cowan and Richard Keller , have made just four ultra precise museum copies of this specimen .
They are extremely impressed with the excellent craftsmanship and engineering - all parts are arsenal marked as matching and very well fitted .
The air reservoir bears a brazing metal coating - a feature of the Girandoni produced airguns .
Cowan and Keller , directly studying the actual gun , indicates that not only are they convinced that this was one of the military models of the Girandoni military air rifles , made somewhere in the middle of the actual Girandoni production ( construction details , such as the presence of a half cock , would place it about 1798 ) , but that it probably was an actual combat gun which was illegally possessed outside of the military circle .
This is evidenced by the apparent removal of the serial number on what clearly is an authentic Girandoni military model .
The receiver profile seems to be somewhat lower and thinner in the locations where the serial number would be expected and the front of the air reservoir end cap , where another serial number would be expected , appears to have been filed shorter .
( Close examination shows that the front of this tapered brass piece falls a little short of the diameter of the adjoining receiver . )
The true military status of this wonderful specimen , as revealed by factory markings and exact measurements , was confirmed by the British airgun historians , Currie and Baker .
They have been producing a series of books detailing the construction of famous historical types of airguns .
Their feeling is that this airgun is an authentic military production specimen diverted to the civilian market .
Baer ( 1973 ) indicates that Girandoni was accused of diverting some specimens to the more profitable civilian market .
Some specifications : Unloaded weight = 9.2 lbs. , loaded w/ 20 lead balls = 9.6 lbs .
Weight of empty air reservoir assembly = 3.0 lbs .
The barrel is wrought iron .
Rifling is excellent , and relatively shallow ( about 5 thousands of an inch ) , commensurate with high efficiency in an airgun . ) .
The air valve consists of three stacked pieces of hard leather , cut to a 60 degree slope to match the slope of the brass valve seat .
The front sight is brass or bronze .
Finish of protected iron surfaces is a dull dark , hot bluing .
MYTHS ABOUT THE GIRANDONI AIRGUNS
There are several oft - repeated tales about Girandoni system airguns which we now know to be fanciful .
Some historical accounts simply are not true or they may contain comments that are not true .
First ,
One of the most common myths is that Napoleon ordered the hanging of anyone in possession of an airgun .
The late Arne Hoff , famed arms historian and curator of the Royal Danish Arsenal , and others , have commented that this story , told as the “ eye witness ” war experience of French General Mortier , has now been quite thoroughly refuted ( Baer , 1973 ) .
This story may have grown from the fact that many towns , fearing these unfamiliar , terrifying guns - even without any negative incidents , banned airguns .
A death penalty was common for many offenses , so it is possible that some airgunners were put to death .
One story relates that the city fathers had a gunsmith , who knew how to make airguns , blinded !
Second , apparently there never was any incident of the air rifles being used against Napoleon ’s troops .
Third , it is often related that these guns were silent .
A number of city , and other governmental decrees of the 1800s , made the guns illegal , often largely on this basis .
I can state from personal firing of a fully - charged museum copy of the Girandoni military air rifle that the discharge sound is quite audible , though by no means as loud as a similar large bore flintlock firearm .
However , the fact the guns discharge without smoke or muzzle / pan flash does make locating the position of someone firing such a gun much more difficult .
( Modern note : Powerful , modern , silenced , 9 mm PCP airguns are being used by U.S. Seals in Iraq to snipe at insurgents .
Firing an M - 16 at dawn or dusk could attract a lot of return fire to the flash point . )
A GIRANDONI SYSTEM " HYBRID " This combination of a Girandoni system and an older Heiberger single shot air rifle is especially interesting .
Upper images - RHS and top views of the Heiberger / Girandoni Combination .
Middle image : Barrel and repeater assembly removed from Heiberger converted airgun , rear view .
Note that the decorative lines of the second rear sight , loading block retainer bolt heads ( grooved rectangular units on top of each end of the loading block ) , plain finish , magazine spring , magazine length , and magazine hatch handle are exact Girandoni styling .
Also note the brass bore liner which reduces the volume of the transfer chamber ( the round profile rear extension ) between the reservoir valve and the lead ball in firing position .
This bore liner would also jet the air towards the ball and serve to reduce rust due to adiabatic condensation .
The round profile extension ( steel ? ) behind the wrought iron barrel / loading bar assembly surely is an addition specifically made to fit it to the Heiberger action - no such extensions are known in other Girandoni- system airguns and the profile , length , and threads exactly fit the Heiberger action .
( This extension has rifling continuous with the rifling in front of the loading block - this would be the result of relining and rerifling the entire barrel or of " freshening " the original rifling . )
( BTW : Owner David Swan , in England , assures me that the Girandoni - system addition is NOT marked as to maker - the report in Airgun Hobby magazine that it was marked with the Contriner name was an editing error . )
David uses 11 mm ( .433 " ) lead balls , which may be a loose fit in the bore ..
The barrel is rifled with 12 grooves with a right hand twist , with 1 turn in 25.5 inches , a much faster turn than found in flintlock firearms of the period .
The rifling twist of this arm is a little faster than the 26.25 inch twist of the original Girandoni military air rifle barrels , evidently an adaptation to the higher velocity of the slightly smaller projectile of this gun .
The ID of the magazine tube is 11.9 mm ( 0.470 " ) and the loading block ball recess is 12.1 mm ( 0.476 " ) in diameter ; measurements consistent with these parts having been acquired from a standard 11.75 mm Girandoni military air rifle ..
Lower picture : Lead balls , .11 mm ( 433 " ) caliber , before and after being fired at a steel plate from the converted Heiberger repeating air rifle in 2002 .
Note lack of any rifling marks .
Fig. 32 . Single Shot Air Rifle by C. Heiberger of Vienna , made ca. 1750 - 1760 , converted to Girandoni system repeater action , apparently using the barrel , magazine , and action from a Girandoni - system air rifle .
Conversion ca. 1815 - 40 .
This conversion could have been rather easily accomplished by simply adding a short barrel extension to a barrel assembly , with attached loading block , magazine tube , and even sights , from a disabled Girandoni- system airgun into the Heiberger receiver .
Note that the Heiberger conversion has two rear sights : an original one on the receiver and a Girandoni style one which came with the added barrel / repeater assembly ( that forward Girandoni sight is too low to be seen by the shooter over the original rear sight ! ) .
This 23 shot repeater has a standard V - shaped internal mainspring .
The nature and size of the external cocking lever ( " hammer " ) indicates that the mainspring was very powerful .
The round section buttstock air reservoir may also be a later Girandoni - system item .
Fires very loudly and flattens its discharged balls very impressively against a distant steel plate .
The high sound may be a side effect of loose ball fit .
Probably a " one -off " item , of considerable power and great firepower , without decoration but in excellent condition .
While understandably lacking many design features of the Girandoni military repeater , it functions well and would have been a fearsome weapon .
The Heiberger does have at least a couple of superior features not found in the later regular Girandoni air rifle design : an air bypass lever ( on the left lock plate ) and a far stronger fused two - part receiver body of heavy cast bronze both top and bottom .
This particular gun may be the only such conversion ever made ; no other such specimens are known .
No case or pump are known for this gun .
Of course , because it was built as a hunting arm , rather than as a military arm , no speed loaders ( " spare magazines " ) are known .
The workmanship of the conversion is of a considerably lower quality than the original Heiberger gun .
It does not appear to have been done by a highly skilled gunsmith .
This Heiberger / Girandoni-system conversion gun had been stored as No. 425 in the Salm - Reifferscheid Armory , Schloss Dyck ( Dyck Castle , near Düsseldorf , Germany ) until 1992 and apparently has never left Europe .

GIRANDONI REPEATING AIR PISTOL Figure 33 .
Girandoni Repeating Air Pistol - About 1800 .
Approx . 9 mm .
This superbly - made , gold - plated , silver inlaid , deeply engraved pistol on the exact Girandoni system clearly was made for an important , perhaps royal , user .
Note that the barrel is signed " Girandony " - a spelling that was used by Girandoni .
It has been suggested that this pistol was made by the master airgunsmith Joseph Contriner for Girandoni , but he signed his work " JC " - the lock on this gun clearly shows a " JG " .
Bartholomäus Girandoni did have sons named Bartholomäus and Johann Girandoni .
This suggests , as was previously not known , that Johann , described as especially talented and trained by his father in technical skills , may have been involved in the production of the Girandoni repeating airguns - perhaps in the Contriner shop in Vienna , after his father 's death in 1799 .

© 2005 , Robert David Beeman A VERY SPECIAL GIRANDONI SYSTEM AIR RIFLE
Made in the 1940s during WW2 , this gun does n't look like a Girandoni , but examination shows that it clearly was built by someone familiar with the Girandoni repeating airgun system .
The story is that this gun was built in Austria by a partisan bicycle maker during the Nazi occupation in WW2 .
The repeating magazine is spring fed and on the left side of the barrel , for the convenient use of a right handed shooter .
The gun was charged with the accompanying bicycle type pump .
Smoothbore , as would be expected , but firing a 11 3/ 4 mm lead ball ( .463 " caliber ) ( the very same caliber as the original Girandoni Austrian military repeating air rifles ! ) , this would have been a fearsome weapon against sentries , drivers , military leaders , etc. at ranges up to perhaps 100 yards .
To a freedom fighter , the lower discharge sound and the lack of flash or smoke would have been huge values .
And it did not need powder , primers , or bullets - only easily cast lead or soft - metal balls !
The builder surely drew his inspiration from an Austrian museum which displayed a Girandoni system airgun .
The excellent quality reflects the experience of a perfectionist bicycle maker with considerable time on his hands - consistent with such a craftsman in an occupied area .
Note that this gun has a spring fed magazine , rather than the gravity fed magazine of the original Girandoni military air rifle .
While a gravity feed mechanism might be simpler , and even more dependable , the spring fed magazine has great advantages for the purposes of this gun .
It is more suited for operation from a vehicle or firing slot where it would be impractical to tip up the rifle for loading and it allows firing with minimal motion at the firing point - very important to a sniper .
Basic specs : A husky 12.2 lbs. , 45 " overall , glare - free , w/ almost camo anodized type finish .

A truly elegant double barreled rifle - left barrel is a percussion , muzzle - loading firearm .
The right barrel is a breech loading , butt - reservoir air rifle - about .40 caliber - Pushing forward on a lever in the trigger guard causes an invisible breech block to rise up out of the top of the receiver for easy , fast loading .
Deeply inlaid gold letters include numerals on the left side let you set a four step power selection lever for bunnies to bear !

What may be the pinnacle of evolutionary development of the Austrian Girandoni system is shown in the accompanying picture of a 19th century Austrian side - by - side double - barrel air / percussion combination .
The key feature of the genius of the Girandoni system , a sliding breech block with a ball socket , has here evolved into a concealed , vertically moving breech block with a similar ball socket .
The firepower of the long magazine has been replaced with the combination of firepower and dependability of a double - barrel gun with two completely different power sources .
The round - bottom , conical flask air reservoir has evolved into a leather covered air container shaped like a modern long arm buttstock .
Do Lukens Air Rifles show Girandoni Styling ?
I have commented in the Lukens airgun paper on this website , that , as previously discussed between myself and the late Henry Stewart , that the “ shape and style ” of the Lukens airgun receivers seemed to be similar to the receivers on Girandoni - style Austrian butt reservoir air rifles in the Beeman collection .
Thus , I was obliged to again compare the receivers of Girandoni style repeating airguns with those of Lukens single shot air rifles .
Although there is superficial external similarity due to being rounded , as is common , and having the air reservoir connection , barrel base , and lock in similar locations , as would be dictated by function , the receivers , and also the air reservoirs , of the two lines of airguns are very different .
Internally , and in all the lock areas , the Girandoni airguns and the Lukens airguns are completely different .
The Lukens and Girandoni receivers are vastly different .
The Girandoni receiver basically is just a single brass top piece , cast from side to side , with the lower area of the receiver being just the trigger guard and an extension of the wooden stock .
A simple notch along the lower , right edge of the brass casting holds the rear tip of the lock plate , simplifying assembly .
The Lukens / Kunz air rifles have a two receiver piece brass receiver , cast from side to side and brazed along the center line - the solid metal receiver completely enclosing the central area of the gun , top and bottom .
In the Lukens the air transfer tube is brazed into place when the two side shells are joined .
In the Girandoni the air transfer channel is a tunnel drilled and filed or cast in place .
This is detailed in the paper on the Lukens gun itself .
When Stewart , and later I , made the remark about similarity of Girandoni and Lukens styling we were not aware of the complete contrast of the mechanisms and structure .
We were only referring to superficial cosmetic appearance and the presence of a butt reservoir .
Similar cosmetic styling , but certainly not structure , of the receiver was found at least as far back as a single shot air rifle by C. Heiberger , a Luftbüchsenmacher ( airgun maker ) of Vienna , about 1750 .
And while the Lukens butt reservoir is not very much like the Girandoni reservoir , it is similar to butt reservoirs found on external lock air rifles that go back two centuries .
Conclusion :
There appears to be not the slightest indication that the style or design of either gun was influenced by the style or design of the other .
The styling of each can be traced as separate back to at least the mid-1700s .

An intriguing feature of these pumps is their ingenious design : the upper end of the pump shaft is square in cross section .
After pushing the pump head out for cleaning and oiling the seals would be pulled just into the pump ’s bore .
Then the square shaft passing through a square guide cap would hold the shaft still as the threaded pump seal nut was turned to expand the seals , thus providing perfect fit and tightness .
Geoffrey Baker ( personal communication , 10 November 2004 ) commented :
The shorter larger diameter pump would not reach as high a pressure as the longer thinner one .
The air vent has lost volume which is not much of a problem at lower pressures .
For high pressure it is essential to have as little lost or “ dead ” volume as possible .
Girandoni was a genius .
He very cleverly got around this problem by continuing the pump tube right up to the end .
Air cane pumps are similar to the shorter one and the air vent is relatively large .
Modern pumps like the Slim Jim variety used by the now defunct Brocock Company had a tiny air vent but they are designed to pump to much higher pressures than the aircane ones .
( The short .
thick pump is the type known from most specimens of antique airguns . ) .
The impact of firing seems to loosen this screw . [ 1 ]

Most of the construction workers earn the equivalent of $ 310 a month

Some 70,000 construction workers in South Africa have gone on strike , halting work on stadiums being built for the 2010 World Cup .
Unions are threatening to wreck the tournament if their demands for a 13 % wage increase are not met .
Organisers say they are confident the grounds will still be ready , unless the strike continues for months .
On Monday judges rejected a request from the employers to outlaw the strike , which unions say is indefinite .
The BBC's Mpho Lakaje in Soweto says scores of workers are outside Soccer City stadium wearing blue overalls and brandishing sticks .
" We are struggling for our country , " they chanted after downing their tools at midday .
The government must help us , otherwise we are going to delay 2010
Union spokesman Lesiba Seshoka
South Africa passes World Cup test Soccer City union organiser Patrick Geqeza blamed management inflexibility for precipitating the strike .
" We feel bad about going on strike .
[ But ] they do n't want to meet us half way , " he told AP news agency .
At present most of the workers are being paid 2,500 rand ( $ 310 ; £ 192 ) a month .
Map of stadiums
World Cup :
One year to go " The government must help us , otherwise we are going to delay 2010 .
We will strike until 2011 , " AFP news agency quoted NUM spokesman Lesiba Seshoka as saying .
Protesters outside Durban 's Moses Mabhida Stadium were forced to disperse because their application to protest was turned down , the South African Press Association reported .
Before they left , the NUM's Bhekani Ngcobo told workers the union would make sure that no temporary labourers were employed .
Five entirely new stadiums are being built for the World Cup , while five are being modernised .
Danny Jordaan , head of the World Cup organising committee , said he respected the right of the workers to strike but felt the dispute would be resolved without affecting the construction schedule .
" The construction workers have been the lifeblood of the 2010 Fifa World Cup project , " he said in a statement .
" Their hard work has ensured that we are on track to meet our deadlines and that our stadiums will be among the best in the world next year . "
Correspondents say if the strike continues projects such as the high - speed rail link between the airport and Johannesburg will be of greater concern than the stadiums .
The rail - link is scheduled to be operational just two weeks before the tournament starts .
The next World Cup will be the first to be hosted by an African country .

The year was 1921 .
America was entering a decade of robust prosperity .
Later called " The Roaring Twenties " , it was a time of unparalleled economic expansion .
Debt money from Wall Street banks was plentiful and easy to obtain .
The " Great War " was over .
America was flexing her industrial muscles .
Factories were being built and expanded in every major city .
Automobiles began rolling off Detroit assembly lines in record numbers .
The stock market began making millionaires .
People were HEALTHY and HAPPY ­ largely because the dreaded " world mystery disease " ( which decades later became known as the " 1918 Flu Pandemic " ) had disappeared .
Two entire years had passed with no dreaded " mystery deaths " being reported .
America had cause to celebrate , and celebrate they did !
As a matter of fact , the American Public in general was so optimistic and HAPPY in 1921 , that relatively few people were unhealthy as well .
For the first time in decades , hospital beds were empty .
The fledgling American Medical Association , formed by John D. Rockefeller just a few years earlier , was worried .
Business was sagging .
Profits from vaccines and drugs were spiraling .
Something had to be done , and done immediately .
False , faux epidemics of smallpox were created to solve the problem , and keep the Medical Mafia 's cash registers ringing .
We know this dastardly plan actually happened , thanks to a citizen 's WATCHDOG GROUP in Kansas City , Missouri named " The Advertiser 's Protective Bureau " , who filed , and successfully prosecuted criminal charges against the Missouri state chapter of the AMA ­ the Jackson Medical Society .
The ' Protective Bureau 's " official report of this cold - blooded plot reads as follows : " In the Fall of 1921 , the health of the city was unusually good , but slow for the doctors .
So the Jackson Medical Society met and resolved to make an epidemic in the city .
According to the minutes of this meeting : ' MOTION WAS MADE AND SECONDED , THAT A RECOMMENDATION BE MADE BY THE COMMITTEE , TO THE BOARD OF HEALTH , THAT AN EPIDEMIC OF SMALLPOX BE DECLARED IN THE CITY .
( Investigation later revealed that there was NO SIGN OF AN EPIDEMIC at the time , in the city , or anywhere in the state or region ! )
' It was moved and seconded that a day be set aside , termed VACCINATION DAY , on which physicians would be stationed at ALL SCHOOLS , clinics , public buildings and hospitals to vaccinate " free of charge " .
( Vaccinations are never " free " .
The taxpayers are always forced to pay for every one of the " free " vaccines . )
" IT IS FURTHER RECOMMENDED THAT WIDE PUBLICITY BE GIVEN , STATING THAT VACCINATION IS A PREVENTIVE OF SMALLPOX , AND URGING THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF VACCINATION FOR EVERY MAN , WOMAN , AND CHILD IN THE CITY . "
The Protective Bureau proved in court that there WAS NO EPIDEMIC before the vaccinations !!
The court records show that the Medical Society manufactured vast amounts of posters , fliers , newspaper stories and ads featuring horrific and lurid pictures of diseased children covered with massive smallpox sores and open wounds .
Some pictures actually showed children 's corpses covered with the same ugly sores .
The PANIC - DRIVEN message was clear --- VACCINATE EVERYONE , or face a deadly public disease .
There was a " sweeping epidemic " in the city ; the disease was " highly contagious " and would " strike anyone who was not vaccinated " was the bill of goods sold !
( Does this sound at all familiar today ­ 88 years later ? ? )
The Medical Mafia 's propaganda blitz was successful , and over a million previously healthy and happy American citizens were hypnotized and terrorized into placing the vaccine toxins into their bloodstreams .
All public school children in the region were vaccinated while at school !
Parents who dared question the vaccination of their children were ostracized and publicly vilified .
THE COURT RECORD ON THIS CASE IS VERY CLEAR .
In the weeks and months following the " mass vaccinations " ­ the area 's hospital beds were filled to over - flowing with VACCINE - INDUCED SMALLPOX CASES !
Tens of thousands of people became ill , and many hundreds of innocents died , and many more were permanently crippled !
Of course , THE NEWSPAPERS THEN TRUMPETED HOW WISE THE MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENT WAS TO PROMOTE THE VACCINES ­ stating how much worse the death toll would have been without the vaccination campaign !!
Untold MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS of profit was generated by this massive " medical " fraud .
Thanks to the ADVERTISER'S PROTECTIVE BUREAU , however ; the massive fraud was exposed and criminally prosecuted to a successful conviction .
During the trial , three amazing facts were proven beyond any " reasonable doubt " .
Fact 1 : The poster and advertising pictures showing the diseased and dying children used so successfully by the " doctors " , WERE NOT EVEN CASES OF LOCAL SMALLPOX CASES AS THEY WERE BILLED TO BE !
The Protective Bureau documented that they were pictures of ENGLISH CHILDREN who were victims of " court - proven " cases of SMALLPOX VACCINE POISONING !!
One of the pictures was of a 5 - week - old baby named Mona Stevenson , of Humphrey Street , Burnley , England .
A previously healthy and happy baby , Little Mona had been vaccinated for smallpox at 5 weeks of age .
Four weeks later , her pox-ridden little body was placed in a tiny coffin and buried .
The horrific photos of Little Mona and others in England had previously been published in British newspapers where details of the resulting CRIMINAL TRIALS were also given .
The full details of the trials , as well as the pictures , were also included in a comprehensively large medical boot titled " THE HISTORY AND PATHOLOGY OF VACCINATION " by Edgar M Crookshank , MD ­ professor of Bacteriology at the ultra-elite Kings College , London England .
Fact 2 : Vaccines containing LIVE VIRUSES , weakened ( i.e. attenuated ) or otherwise universally causes more diseases than the vaccine ever could prevent .
Fact 3 : Vaccine - Induced - Disease ( VID ) is an extremely effective socio-economic tool .
It has the potential to generate BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WINDFALL PROFITS , while permanently changing the social structures of large groups of people .
While the Protective Bureau won the criminal court case ­ the American People lost .
The case should have made front - page headlines around the nation , showing the Modus Operandi of certain corrupt " medical practitioners " .
How , by means of fraud , treachery , and trickery , they made millions of dollars in windfall profits while thousands of innocent , trusting , and naïve Americans suffered and died .
The entire sordid affair , with all its damning details , was kept out of the American Press .
John D. Rockefeller 's AMA , with its millions of dollars of influence ­ made sure of that !
Amazingly , even though thousands of people had died or become crippled by this managed manslaughter , the doctors involved were only given a light penalty in the form of a token fine .
The medical establishment as a whole was not upset in the least by the exposure ­ and has continued on unabated perpetuating the same crimes against humanity ­ creating vaccine - induced - diseases while fleecing the people continually until this present day .
It is a proven ( albeit little - known ) fact , EPIDEMIC / PANDEMIC MANUFACTURING IS STANDARD PRACTICE with the world - wide " Medical Mafia " circles .
In order to maximize profits and re-shape geographical regions , they often manufacture a false - flag " emergency " .
If there is an outbreak of mild seasonal virus , they call it an influenza pandemic , give it a fancy new name , and then actually CREATE THE PANDEMIC by means of mass vaccinations using ATTENUATED , or LIVE VIRUSES !!
Remember the shocking words of the AMA's Dr. Simon Louis Katzoff who said : " DOCTORS LIVE BY DISEASE , SO THE PUBLIC CAN EXPECT THE SUPPLY OF DISEASE TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION . "
OTHER DOCUMENTED CASES OF V.I.D.E.O.s ( Vaccine Induced Disease Epidemic Outbreaks . )
Case 1 : Following the lead of their colleagues in Kansas City , the exact same events occurred in Pittsburgh , PA under the direction of Pittsburgh 's " Health Director " , Dr. C.J. Voux in the autumn of 1924 .
As in Kansas City , a group of public watchdogs brought suit against Voux and his vaccine - promoters .
As in Kansas City , the vaccine promoters were found guilty .
The case documented that over 1,000,000 vaccine shots were " sold " to the residents of Pennsylvania , even though there had been ZERO documented cases of smallpox in the region .
It was successfully proven that ONLY AFTER the million shots had been given , that a smallpox epidemic began .
This vaccine - induced , manmade " epidemic " resulted in 330 deaths and at least 1,680 cases of severe smallpox that caused permanent , crippling damage to the survivors .
Moreover , it cost the city a total monetary loss of $ 3,069,616 ; although Dr. Voux and his accomplices had collected more than $ 10 million in hospital and related care revenues ­ they were not forced to pay for damages or reparations .
As in the Kansas City trial , a small , insignificant fine was levied , and the case was not widely publicized .
Case 2 : The initial batches of Dr. Jonas Salk 's polio vaccine produced thousands of cases of poliomyelitis in vaccinated individuals .
( One such case was Franklin D. Roosevelt ­ who was stricken weeks after receiving a vaccine . )
This was due to an unsafe amount of LIVE VIRUSES in the vaccine itself .
Dr. Sabin then introduced his " improved " vaccine with " attenuated " or " weakened ' live viruses in 1958 , and the following year his vaccine was made to be compulsory ( mandatory ) in all school - age children in a number of states .
As a result , polio increased a whopping 300 % in these states .
For example , Tennessee reported 119 polio cases in 1958 , after " vaccination " this total increased to 386 cases in 1959 , Ohio ­ 17 cases in 1958 , 52 cases in 1959 , Connecticut ­ 45 cases in 1958 , 123 cases in 1959 , and North Carolina : 78 cases in 1958 compared to 312 cases in 1959 AFTER forcing compulsory shots in school children .
The modern record is equally damning .
The ONLY cases of recorded polio in the modern era is immediately following vaccinations .
Poliomyelitis , you see , is a water - borne virus and is caused by drinking contaminated water .
During the early 60's , water - treatment facilities became standardized across America ­ small amounts of CHLORINATION effectively wiped out polio viruses .
The conquering of polio had NOTHING TO DO with the vaccine needles and swallowing sugar cubes .
In fact , as author Ed Haslem documents so well in his book , " http://doctormarysmonkey.com/ "
Dr. Mary 's Monkey , the Sabin vaccines were actually contaminated with mutated GREEN MONKEY VIRUSES ( SV - 40 viruses to be specific ) which has caused untold millions of SOFT - TISSUE CANCERS and deaths worldwide .
( The cancer " industry " has reaped BILLIONS of dollars from this " contamination " over the years , of course . )
" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edikv0zbAlU
"
Dr. Maurice Hilleman has actually confessed as being a part of this very activity .
Case 3 : Knowingly added to " hepatitis " vaccines , HIV viruses were inoculated into thousands of homosexual men and intravenous drug users in America 's inner cities resulting in the " AIDS epidemic " in the 80's .
Purposefully placed in SMALLPOX VACCINE SYRINGES , HIV was also introduced into African nations as a tool of ethnic cleansing and GENOCIDE .
The covert development and weaponization of the HIV / AIDS virus and its monkey - virus origins , along with the amazing story of how the scientists involved are tied to President Kennedy 's assassination is well documented in " http://doctormarysmonkey.com/ "
Dr. Mary 's Monkey .
The covert biological experimentation labs responsible for this mayhem are today consolidated into the NIH , the NAIDS , the National Cancer Institute , and Ft. Detrick , Maryland .
The Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) in Atlanta became the centralized hub of pandemic and epidemic creations and propagation .
Case 4 : The 1976 " Swine Flu " Fiasco and Fraud is perpetrated .
A solitary soldier at Ft. Dix collapses and dies following a reaction to an " experimental " vaccine while completing an intense physical " forced march " exercise at Ft. Dix .
Immediately , the CDC swings into action , declaring a nationwide SWINE FLU PANDEMIC is pending .
Providentially , of course , the CDC just happens to have 200+MILLION DOSES of Swine Flu vaccine already stockpiled , prepared with ATTENUATED ( live , yet weakened ) viruses and experimental ADJUVANTS .
President Gerald Ford , ( with proven ties to Big Pharma and Nixon 's covert viral weapons labs ­ also a key member of the " Warren Commission 's " obfuscation of the JFK murder ) rolls up his sleeves on national TV and dutifully takes the vaccine .
40 million vaccines are given to naïve American human guinea pigs .
A rash of auto - immune disorders ( Guillan - Barre Syndrome GBS , and lupus ) as well as a large number of deaths is immediately attributed to the vaccine , and the mass vaccination campaign is halted .
( What happened to the other 140 million vaccines , one may ask ? )
In 1979 , the television news magazine 60 Minutes did a documentary investigation on this travesty - for - money scandal .
Against all odds and the threats of Big Pharma , the OBJECTIVELY FAIR 60 Minutes program aired ONE TIME .
There was no follow - up story , No criminal indictments were ever issued .
There was no MASS - MURDER - FOR - HIRE trial .
As a result , America has largely forgotten the 1976 SWINE FLU SCANDAL !

Part I of the 60 Minutes story ; and " http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4c9Is1T3z4 " Part II .
Case 5 : During the first Gulf War ­ Operation Desert Storm , an experimental anthrax vaccine was forcibly given to 140,000 rear - echelon support troops .
This experimental vaccine included an oil - in - water adjuvant called squalene ( aka MF - 59 made by NOVARTIS ) .
Despite voluminous studies showing dangerous toxicity factors conducted on " oil - in - water " adjuvants at such prestigious research labs as UCLA ­ the U.S. Military brass consented to the experimental injections .
As a result , ALL 140,000 troops developed a condition subsequently named " Gulf War Syndrome " .
This sordid tale is explained in a very honest and credible book by " http://www.vaccine-a.com/ "
Gary Matsumoto , called , Vaccine - A. ALL MODERN " PANDEMICS " ARE CAUSED BY VACCINE NEEDLES
As this author has repeatedly declared during many public radio interviews , the deadly 1918 Influenza Pandemic was the direct result of live - virus - contaminated Typhus Fever Vaccines mandatorily given to U.S. and Allied military personnel during World War I .
During that era , viruses were not yet discovered and diseases were thought to be bacterial only .
These deadly typhus fever vaccines were manufactured by John D. Rockefeller 's research labs and Chinese pharma factories .
The vaccine " seed stock " consisted of viruses harvested from human typhoid fever patients , cross-injected into swine herds to create increased " seed stock " , and then injected into chicken and turkey eggs for further incubation of the pathogens .
The final , harvested " vaccine material " then was injected into HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF HUMAN VEINS .
The result was a massive ' pandemic ' that claimed the lives of as many as 50 million people worldwide .
In 1918 , the viral pandemic was an honest mistake ­ the result of a combination of a very bad vaccine and gross ignorance about viruses and the diseases they cause .
However , the continued denial of these FACTS , and the subsequent REVERSE ENGINEERING OF THE KILLER VIRUS in Ft. Detrick labs ( 1997 -2003 ) is inexcusable and constitutes a veritable crime against humanity .
Moreover , the ONLY WAY a modern " SWINE FLU PANDEMIC " can actually materialize is by injection of certain LIVE VIRUSES via vaccine needles .
Make no mistake , the world is NOT experiencing a true pandemic explosion at this time ­ but it most assuredly WILL when and if the planned mass influenza vaccinations are completed worldwide .
THE DANGERS INHERENT IN " DUPLEX " VACCINES FROM DESIGNER VIRUSES " Modern Medical Practitioners " , including some well - meaning " osteopaths " , would have the world believe the MYTH that vaccines containing attenuated ( weakened ) live viruses cannot cause the viral disease conditions they are targeting .
This is a most dangerous misconception for the following SCIENTIFIC reasons .
Traditional " common " vaccines targeting measles , mumps and rubella for instance , contain small amounts of " attenuated " live viruses which have been " weakened " but not 100 % killed outright .
Research has shown that these weakened " live " viruses create a very mild form of the disease in the human that has been vaccinated , which in turn creates a cellular immunity from that pathogen .
The science behind this is correct , and valid for the most part .
To keep the targeted viral pathogen in a perpetually weakened state , specific amounts of formaldehyde and ether are typically added , and in some formulations , mercury in the form of thimerasol is added as a preservative to keep the egg albumin cells from decaying and dying prematurely .
The established theory behind all of this ' vaccination ' is the " protect the herd " theory which originated with Pasteur in the late 19th century .
As in all vaccines , a certain small percentage of the herd will develop severe , ' full blown ' disease states CAUSED by the attenuated viruses in the vaccine itself , and another percentage will exhibit side effects from the chemicals added to the vaccine ­ but if the vast majority of the herd is " protected " from the disease condition ­ the vaccine is approved and stamped " safe and effective " .
Science has also proven that each viral pathogen has its own unique characteristics that produce its own set of symptoms in the human hosts .
Thus , each viral pathogen has its own unique fingerprints of replication and reproduction as well .
Each virus also has a different level of effectiveness in its attenuated ( weakened ) state .
Moreover , some viruses have shown the ability to " drift " and acquire additional genetic alterations over time .
THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE OF THE SO - CALLED " NOVEL " RECOMBINATION VIRUSES that have been " reverse engineered " in the world 's weapons laboratories !
When the RNA of the virus is spliced with other viral genes , the resulting " Franken - virus " is very unpredictable .
Studies conducted ( yet currently unpublished ) by Terrence Tumpey , Jeffrey Taubenberger , and others at the NIH and CDC show that these ' resurrected pandemic viruses ' do not exhibit the NORMAL tendencies of traditional , NATURAL influenza viruses such as seasonal H3N2 human strains .
They are best described as " Viral Wild Cards " .
This is just one problem with the headlong , mad rush to vaccinate Americans with a series of reverse - engineered lab - created viruses , attenuated or otherwise , in an UNTESTED , UNTRIED , EXPERIMENTAL VACCINE that has not been subjected to LONG - TERM CLINICAL TRIALS TO DETERMINE THE LEVELS OF " DRIFT " or even ATTENUATED TENDENCIES OVER TIME .
To supposedly minimize this " safety " issue , the CDC is now recommending a DUPLEX vaccination , of all things .
A " duplex " vaccination basically involves a two - shot series .
The first shot consists of a VERY WEAK , HIGHLY ATTENUTATED dose of the live virus .
This is intended to create an initial immune response patterning the specific virus injected .
Within a couple of weeks of the 1st shot , a BOOSTER SHOT is given .
The booster shot has only lightly attenuated , or even FULL STRENGTH VIRUSES in the injection .
This 2nd shot is then intended to create a full - strength immune system response in the human subject .
This is , at the very least , BAD SCIENCE and borders on insanity for self - evident and fairly obvious reasons .
By their own admissions , the NIH scientists in their various writings have declared that the level of potency of these REVERSE ENGINEERED VIRUSES show abnormal , almost RANDOM tendencies in their attenuated states .
Nobody really knows what will happen over time as the inevitable " genetic drifts " occur .
It is a literal crap shoot .
It is highly probable that even the HIGHLY ATTENUATED FRANKEN - VIRUSES can swiftly regain their FULL POTENCY even in the presence of ether and formaldehyde .
( See Addendum Below ) Secondly , the full - strength BOOSTER shot viruses could just as easily " DRIFT " into something much more deadly than the " original ' recombinant virus that it is targeting .
I submit that the scientists responsible for this " pandemic " are not stupid .
They have to know these facts as well as I do .
Therefore , I can only conclude that this entire affair is following the Modus Operandi of the medical elite since the 1920 engineered smallpox epidemics .
It is all being ORCHESTRATED first and foremost for MONEY , and secondly , for social and geographical restructuring of the " human herd " .
Also , it must be understood that this " Novel 2009 Influenza " is not easily nor readily transmissible between humans .
( See published study in the addendum ) .
If this report is accurate , how then did the " Pandemic " begin , and why the need for mass vaccinations at all ??
Like the " study " shows , the only way the test ferrets could contract or transmit the 2009 " Novel Swine Flu " was by and through INOCULATION OF THE DISEASE !!
Humanity demands an answer , and demands it NOW !!!

Recent reports of mild to severe influenza - like illness in humans caused by a novel swine - origin 2009 A( H1N1 ) influenza virus underscore the need to better understand the pathogenesis and transmission of these viruses in mammals .
In this study , selected 2009 A( H1N1 ) influenza isolates were assessed for their ability to cause disease in mice and ferrets and compared with a contemporary seasonal H1N1 virus for their ability to transmit to naïve ferrets through respiratory droplets .
In contrast to seasonal influenza H1N1 virus , 2009 A( H1N1 ) influenza viruses caused increased morbidity , replicated to higher titers in lung tissue , and were recovered from the intestinal tract of intranasally inoculated ferrets .
The 2009 A( H1N1 ) influenza viruses exhibited less efficient respiratory droplet transmission in ferrets in comparison with the highly transmissible phenotype of a seasonal H1N1 virus .
Transmission of the 2009 A( H1N1 ) influenza viruses was further corroborated by characterizing the binding specificity of the viral hemagglutinin to the sialylated glycan receptors ( in the human host ) by use of dose - dependent direct receptor - binding and human lung tissue - binding assays .
Syracuse.com reported :
In January , an Onondaga County sheriff ’s deputy pulled over Audra Harmon , who had two of her kids with her in her minivan .
A routine traffic stop escalated quickly .
The deputy , Sean Andrews , accused her of talking on her cell phone .
She said she could prove him wrong .
He said she was speeding .
She denied it and got out of the van .
He told her to get back in .
She did , then he ordered her back out .
He yanked her out by the arm , knocked her down with two Taser shots and charged her with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest .
His rationale on the disorderly conduct charge :
She obstructed traffic when she got out of the van .
The speeding accusation : going 50 mph in a 45 - mph zone .
Dr. Kallmes has begun a small , pilot study , he said , in which patients are given only the numbing drugs to see if they alone can help .
But he said he was not ready to give up on vertebroplasty .
He said more studies were needed to determine whether there were specific subgroups of patients for whom it might work .
People who want the treatment should still be able to get it , he said  but only if they enter a clinical trial that collects data on every case .
In an editorial accompanying the articles , Dr. James N. Weinstein , director of the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice , said , “ Compassionate care and tincture of time , in and of themselves , can have an effect . ”
In an interview , Dr. Weinstein , who does not perform vertebroplasty , suggested that rather than abandoning the procedure , doctors could let patients decide for themselves , by telling them , “ This is a treatment option no better than a placebo , but if you want to consider a placebo because you might benefit from it , you might want to know that . ”
Dr. Robert R. Recker , president of the National Osteoporosis Foundation , said the group had not taken a stand on vertebroplasty .
He also leads the osteoporosis research center at Creighton University , in Omaha , and said he had referred patients for the treatment , and thought it helped some .
Despite the new findings , he does not think it should be abandoned .
“ I think there needs to be more studies , ” Dr. Recker said .
Dr. Kallmes said the only way medical practice would change would be if Medicare and other insurers were to stop covering vertebroplasty or to cover it only when it was part of a study .
But patients might still be able to get a similar procedure that also uses cement , kyphoplasty , which has been growing even faster than vertebroplasty  also without placebo - controlled studies .
Susan Pisano , a spokeswoman for America ’s Health Insurance Plans , a trade group for private insurers , said that so far there had been “ considerable coverage ” of vertebroplasty , but the new evidence could change that .
Dr. Marcel E. Salive , a director in the Medicare division that decides what treatments to cover , said Medicare had no national policy on vertebroplasty and had been letting the states decide .
They have been covering it .
Dr. Salive said Medicare had looked into the treatment in 2005 but found a lack of randomized , controlled studies .
The new studies provide “ the kind of evidence we look for when making coverage policy , ” he said .
But he said it was too soon to tell whether the research would affect coverage .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The son of actor Oscar - winning actor Michael Douglas could face life in prison for selling large amounts of an illegal drug over a three - year period before his arrest late last month , court records show .

Cameron Douglas , 30 , a sometimes actor who appeared with his father and grandfather Kirk Douglas in “ It Runs in the Family , ” is accused of selling tens of thousands of dollars worth of methamphetamine , according to a complaint unsealed this week .
Douglas was arrested at a Manhattan hotel on July 28 , and had charges against him read in Manhattan federal court the next day , but news of his arrest surfaced only Wednesday .
Rebecca Carmichael , a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney ’s Office in Manhattan , would not comment on whether Douglas had applied for , or been granted , bail .
Douglas faces a mandatory minimum of 10 years in prison and a maximum period of life for two counts of possessing and distributing forms of methamphetamine known by the street names of “ crystal meth ” and “ Ice , ” which is smoked in a pipe .
Douglas received large quantities of crystal meth in California then sent them to New York via FedEx between 2006 and 2009 .
He worked with accomplices who are cooperating with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration , the complaint said .
In several different recorded phone calls Douglas referred to the drugs as “ pastry ” and “ salts , ” the complaint said .
One of his attorney ’s , Allison Menkes , declined comment .
A spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration also declined comment .
A next court date has not been set .
Douglas was arrested and charged with possession of cocaine in 2007 in Santa Barbara , California .
Throughout the United States , cities are deploying “ smart ” electronic fare collection infrastructures .
In 2003 , San Francisco launched a $ 35 million pilot program to replace approximately 23,000 mechanical parking meters with electronic units that boasted tamper resistance , payment via smart card , auditing capabilities , and an estimated $ 30 million annually in fare collection revenue .
Other major cities , including Atlanta , Boston , Chicago , Los Angeles , New York , Philadelphia , Portland , and San Diego , have made similar moves .
This presentation details our evaluation of electronic parking meters , including hardware disassembly , smart card protocol emulation , and silicon die analysis .

BART 's overtime bonanza could grind to halt BART CONTRACT Pact for agents , operators would change work rules
Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close BART 's overtime bonanza could grind to halt 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
BART paid 145 train operators and station agents more than $ 20,000 apiece in overtime last year , and one of those employees earned more in overtime than his normal base pay , a Chronicle salary analysis found .
But work rules that contribute to high overtime pay for station agents and train operators could be changed if those workers approve a new contract today .
" Changing ' wasteful work rules ' that lead to excessive overtime was one of the goals of the contract negotiations , " Jim Allison , a BART spokesman , said Monday .
" Management feels the tentative agreement ... meets that goal . "
Members of the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1555 rejected a similar contract proposal two weeks ago and had threatened to shut down the regional commuter rail system with 343,000 boardings a day by walking out .
" We 're confident that this is going to be ratified , " said Local 1555 President Jesse Hunt .
" Rather than this being a hard sell , we truly feel we now have a tentative agreement that meets our members ' concerns . "
Full details of the proposal for the more than 800 members of ATU have not been made public , but the four - year contract deal would reduce overtime , limit forced layoffs , charge workers more for premium health benefits , and freeze wages unless cost savings can be identified later .
BART 's two other biggest unions have already ratified their contracts .
Labor talks with BART 's unions began in April .
Faced with a projected budget deficit over the next four years topping $ 300 million , BART management wanted to cut $ 100 million in labor costs .
The targeted savings in the proposed contract for train operators and station agents would account for a little more than a third of that amount , BART General Manager Dorothy Dugger said .
One of the more contentious issues was the work rules .
The transit agency paid train operators and station agents a total of $ 8 million in overtime last year .
Systemwide , BART employees earned more than $ 24 million in overtime .
BART provided , at The Chronicle 's request , a breakdown of pay for the 3,427 full - time and part - time employees on the payroll in 2008 .
More than 700 BART employees topped the $ 100,000 mark in pay last year .
Dugger was the top earner , with $ 334,857 in gross pay .
Of the 356 station agents , 30 made more than $ 20,000 in overtime .
Of the 472 train operators , 115 earned more than $ 20,000 in overtime .
For station agents , the median base pay was $ 58,960 , and the median overtime pay was $ 4,096 .
For train operators , the median base pay was $ 60,039 , and the median overtime pay was $ 8,760 .
Overtime is calculated at a minimum rate of 1 1/2 times regular pay .
One train operator , Ron Gadola , earned $ 62,432 in overtime last year , or $ 656 more than his base salary .
He is assigned to operate trains between Lake Merritt in Oakland and Fremont .
Gadola could n't be reached for comment Monday .
But Hunt said Gadola regularly worked 12 - hour shifts almost every day of the year .
Hunt said overtime is almost always available for members of his union - " the frontline employees " - who operate the trains and staff the stations .
Overtime costs were driven up last year , he said , when two electrical fires at the Hayward maintenance yard caused extensive damage and disrupted service in parts of the East Bay for almost two months .
More station agents and train operators were needed to work during that period , Hunt said .
BART also relies heavily on overtime to run service to the Oakland Coliseum during events , including concerts and A's games , he said .
" Any overtime that our members work is a response of management asking people to work , " Hunt said .
" The overtime is service driven . "

Republican hypocrisy apparently knows no limits .
Gov. Mark Sanford 's pitiful confession that he had cheated on his wife and stolen from the tax payer was a sad sight to behold .
I almost felt sorry for the man , clearly pained by what he had done to his family .
But then I remembered what a sanctimonious asshole he had been for his entire political life - berating Democrats for their ' liberal values ' and assuming moral authority over people like Bill Clinton who had cheated on their wives .

He said of his vote to impeach Clinton , " I think what he did in this matter was reprehensible ...
I feel very comfortable with my vote . "
Indeed .
Destroying a man 's career for infidelity seemed so easy to Sanford , he did it almost gleefully .
But of course when it came to his own infidelity , Sanford hesitated to give up everything he had worked for .
Why ?
Because he rightfully understands that personal issues have nothing to do with his public life .
That cheating on you wife does not make you a bad governor - or even a bad person .
Just human .

But people like Sanford , like the majority of his party , have one rule for themselves , and one rule for others .
Socialism for the rich and the free market for the poor , no marriage for gays , but sordid bathroom romps in airports for them .
Dick Cheney 's militant stance on everything other than gay marriage is indicative of Republican style morality .
He only supports gay marriage because it personally effects him .
Had Cheney not dodged the draft for Vietnam , it is entirely possible he would n't have pressed for war at every given moment in his political career .
Perhaps if Sanford 's infidelity had happened earlier , he may not have tried to ruin someone else 's life for the same offense .
But it did n't , and now Sanford must reap what he sowed .
He deserves everything the media chucks at him , and some .
The press should lay of his marriage , but not his outrageous hypocrisy - a disease the Republican party just cannot get rid of .

The goal of XMLVM is to offer a flexible and extensible cross-compiler toolchain .
Instead of cross-compiling on a source code level , XMLVM cross-compiles byte code instructions from Sun Microsystem 's virtual machine and Microsoft 's Common Language Runtime .
The benefit of this approach is that byte code instructions are easier to cross -compile and the difficult parsing of a high - level programming language is left to a regular compiler .
In XMLVM , byte code - based programs are represented as XML documents .
This allows manipulation and translation of XMLVM - based programs using advanced XML technologies such as XSLT , XQuery , and XPath .
XMLVM serves as an umbrella for several projects .
For all projects , a Java class file or a .NET executable is first translated to an XML - document .
Based on the XML - document generated by the front - end , various transformations are possible .
The first transformation cross-compiles from .NET to JVM byte code .
Another transformation enables Java or .NET applications to be cross-compiled to JavaScript so that they can run as AJAX applications in any browser .
Yet another transformation allows to cross -compile a Java program to Objective - C to create a native iPhone application .
You can even cross compile an Android application to run on the iPhone

Let 's face it , work is n't supposed to be lots of fun .
As my grandfather used to say , they call it ' work ' for a reason .
That 's why everyone needs to blow off a little steam during the day , and some research suggests doing so actually makes us more productive .
To keep from going crazy , we need to take a little break here or there .
For those of us stuck behind a computer all day , this often takes the form of software and web sites .
There are going to be some people reading this who think “ ah ha , I 've just been given a list of sites to block at the firewall so my people will work harder ! ”
Not a bit of it , plenty of the names on this list are very useful and blocking them is counter - productive , as well as making the IT manager look like the Grinch .
This week , we count down some of our favourite wastes of time .
At least , we will count them down at some point ... right after I check this one last site …
Honourable Mention : Instant messaging
Iain Thomson : Fair 's fair , there is a strong business case for instant messaging .
It 's an invaluable tool for non-physical meetings and I use it daily to get in contact with the UK office without running up huge phone bills .
But that said it 's also a time sink in other ways .
How often are you sitting at your desk working on something when some slacker who you have no interest in hearing from suddenly IMs because they are at a loose end .
Unfortunately politeness requires that you answer and before you know it you 've spend ten minutes in useless chatter and your train of thought has been hopelessly derailed .
But , I hear you say , is n't that just the same as an unwanted phone call ?
Not at all , thanks to the wonders of technology .
If you do n't want to be disturbed you can always shut the phone off and pretend you 're out .
With IM they know you are there and there 's no escape .
This is why I only turn the IM system on when contact would be welcomed .
Shaun Nichols :
Yes Iain , if only there were some sort of message you could put up to tell people that you 're away from the desk or busy with work at the moment ...
Even with away messages there 's a problem , however .
Perhaps you 're not busy talking to someone else via IM with legitimate business , but that one friend who just seems to have way to much free time sees you and sends the " hello " message , followed a few minutes later by the dreaded " are you there ? " and then " hellooooo ? "
Aside from the time - wasting dangers , there are other worries with instant messaging .
Perhaps you have a conversation with your girlfriend in one window , a quick chat with a co-worker or boss in another window , and yet another containing a back - and - forth with your best friend .
We 've all been there , and we all know full well the dangers which arise when you 're not paying very close attention to which window you 're typing in .
Even if you get along really well with your boss he's not going to want sweet nothings appearing in his IM box by mistake .
Honourable Mention : SMS messaging
Shaun Nichols :
Like our other honourable mention , text messages are a very useful technology that can easily become a distraction .
The big risk about text messaging is that it is almost completely silent and easy to conceal .
This can make it very easy to sneak in a text message or five while sitting at your desk .
Helpful if you 're setting up a dinner date , but hazardous if you 're whittling away the minutes filling a friend in on last night 's date .
This becomes an even bigger problem for those of us that have friends on the dole .
Getting through that 3:00 - 4:00 pm stretch is hard enough as it is , but it 's nearly impossible when your out - of - work buddy is texting you from the couch with his theories about the connections between Greek mythology and Everybody Loves Raymond .
Iain Thomson : With friends like that Shaun ...
SMS does have valuable uses , and it's of enormous value to the phone companies who make billions a year out of it .
SMS , despite being very old technology , is still the most profitable data service on mobile phones today .
But we 're all seen the effects of SMS on some people , particularly the youth of today .
The next generation is going to get a crick in its neck from constantly being bent over a mobile phone and scientists are already noting that extreme texters have begun using their thumbs to point at things rather than the traditional index finger .
Humanity will only be saved because these people will get run over trying to cross roads while typing LMAO one more time .
10 . B3TA
Iain Thomson :
In 2001 three highly talented British basket - cases set up B3TA ( pronounced Beta ) to showcase and create the weirdest stuff online and the rest is , as they say , history .
I suspect Shaun rues the day I sent him his first link to the site .
The site is more addictive than crack , and much more fun .
The Friday newsletter is a thing of joy to read and the forums are full of both unusual links and some of the best Photoshopping and computer animation this side of Hollywood .
There 's a weekly Photoshop challenge and a Question of the Week contest too , all voted on exclusively by the membership .
It has spawned some of the internet 's most enduring memes , including the infamous Badger , Badger , Badger animation which is the most persistent earworm I 've ever encountered .
Several of my friends want to kill me for passing it on to them .
As a timewaster it is excellent .
At CES this year I introduced an American journalist to the site 's sick joke wiki and he spent the next two days lambasting me for ruining his productivity and supplying him with enough jokes to get him tarred and feathered in his home state .
The membership could best be described as ' quirky ' , but the quality of submissions is so high you can spend hours clicking and laughing .
My days would be poorer indeed without the stories of SpankyHanky , Legless , Grandmasterfluffles et al , the skilled animation of the other members and the knowledge that crackhouseceilidhband has taken flashmobbing to unusual new areas .
Shaun Nichols :
For my fellow Americans who are not quite familiar with the site , B3TA is sort of like 4 Chan , minus the shock porn .
Iain turned me on to B3TA shortly after his arrival in the US office , and because of that I have an excuse I can try whenever I spend a bit too much time on the site and nearly miss a deadline .
It does n't work but hey , it 's worth a shot if I 'm desperate .
Anyone who thinks that British humour is a completely dry , sophisticated affair need look no further than B3TA .
Though the jokes are often very clever , there 's also a fair amount of goofy , silly humour .
I would recommend to everyone here in the States that we pull an " Office " and embrace B3TA .
Maybe we can send back Simon Cowell as compensation .
9. Wikipedia
Shaun Nichols :
When you need to look up a quick fact or double - check some stats , Wikipedia can be a very useful tool .
When you need to buckle down and get work done , however , it can be a terrible vice .
We 've all been there ; you pop on for a quick look - up to verify a date in history or maybe settle a break - room argument .
Then a link on that page looks interesting , so you check it out .
Then another link catches your eye .
Before you know it you 've spent 45 minutes reading up on Soviet freight aircraft of the late Cold War-era .
So it ’s not just questionable sources that one needs to be wary of when searching Wikipedia , there 's also the lure of soaking up useless facts while you 're supposed to be getting work done .
Iain Thomson :
It 's the random article button on the Wikipedia page that has been my downfall in the past .
Picture the scene ; it 's lunchtime , the sandwich is laid out before you and Wikipedia is open .
A few trial clicks and before you know it you 're hooked .
It 's a deadly trap that 's difficult to wean yourself off .
That 's not to say there are n't benefits .
I now know more than any man should about rotary vane air compression , the debate over the correct plural for octopus and US Airforce experimental aircraft post World War Two .
This may at some point be of use , but I 'm betting it wo n't be at the next industry press conference I attend , unless things get really weird .
8. Fark
Iain Thomson :
In days of yore we used to use the term Slashdotted to describe the effect of having something posted on the popular tech news site and then having your servers fall over when the rush of traffic hit .
Nowadays we use the term Farked .
Fark collects the news from around the world and posts it on a continually updated board .
What makes it special is that the submitters of links are volunteers and supply their own headlines .
Most of these are so good you should n't view the site while drinking a cup of tea in case the keyboard and monitor get an unexpected bath from reading something too funny .
Nevertheless the site does serve a purpose .
It breaks news early , both serious and weird , and is useful for keeping up with what 's going on in the world .
On the other hand it 's an enormous time sink because , however way you spin it , learning about lunacy in Florida or oddballs in other parts of the world is seldom useful for work .
Shaun Nichols : How I ever lived before Fark , I 'll never know .
It 's like a news aggregator that goes ahead and makes all of the snarky comments for you .
And to think there was a day when people had to actually hold up a newspaper and make the sarcastic comments about the stupidity of it all on their own !
What 's even more dangerous about Fark is that if you read it long enough , you too begin to talk like a " Farker . "
While this can be quite satisfying at times , it also can get you in a bit of trouble when around others who have yet to become jaded by the site 's cutting and merciless approach to news analysis .
My grandmother still has n't forgiven me for referring to her beloved kitten Troubles as " the ugliest thing you 'll see all day . "
7. Boards / Forums
Shaun Nichols :
One of the great things about the internet is that it allows pretty much anyone with any sort of interest to find a community of like - minded individuals .
Often the best way to connect with others around the world is through a message board or forum .
Just as phone conversations with friends can carry on far too long , an internet conversation with a web friend can run late and get you into trouble at work .
If you sit behind a desk , however , this can be even more of a danger than talking on the telephone .
While the boss can see and hear you yapping on the phone and shoot you a dirty look , someone has to be standing behind you looking over your shoulder to see the activity on your screen .
How do you tell if someone is typing up a report or debating with a guy in Miami about which 1980s Bill Murray film was the best ?
Iain Thomson : I 'd say Shaun 's initial point cuts both ways ; like - minded individuals joining together is fine , so long as their interests are benign .
But when it comes to forums he raises the most meaningful point .
At work , so long as people can't see your screen , you could be doing pretty much anything online and it would take monitoring software to tell the difference .
Unluckily for Shaun I sit right behind him so can see his screen , but luckily for him I do n't worry too much if he pops onto the boards occasionally - so long as the work gets done on time and to the highest standards .
One of the finest explanations of the downfalls of forums came in , of all things , the West Wing .
You can see an explanation here but I 'd advise getting the full episode to appreciate the full danger of forums .
What else made it to the list ?
Read on to discover how workers spend their time !
AS a teenager , Mr. Schwab worked in a factory .
Then he and his brothers formed Schwab Brothers Trucking in Buffalo , spending several years hauling coal with a single truck before the company took off as a major highway and sewer contractor .
But default and bankruptcy followed , and Mr. Schwab , pursued by regulators and tax collectors  and suddenly the subject of unwelcome publicity in the local newspaper  decamped to Florida around 1969 and later took over his first demolition outfit , Cuyahoga Wrecking .
Demolition companies make much of their money on shrewd projections of what they can reap by selling off the scrap .
Mr. Schwab had a knack for that , as well as sparkling blue eyes and a salesmen ’s gift for gab .
“ He could talk the skin off an orange , ” said Mike Taylor , executive director of the National Demolition Association .
In a business dominated by Italians and Jews , Mr. Schwab , a German - Irish Catholic , was often mistaken for a Jew and tossed out Yiddishisms here and there .
“ I am uneducated , ” he would acknowledge years later , “ but I ’m not unsophisticated . ”
A little bit Horatio Alger , a little Jesse James , Mr. Schwab was part of a generation of wreckers that emerged after World War II when there were no rules , no environmental inspectors and no fear of the lung - searing properties of asbestos .
His companies were hired to dismantle the 1964 - 65 World ’s Fair , to gut Grand Central Terminal , to knock down 17 power plants and a slew of steel mills .
“ We had one - third of the country ’s steel - making capacity under demolition , ” he said .
“ The commodities market went crazy .
We thought we ’d get $ 35 a ton ; instead we got $ 165 a ton . ”
By the 1980s , he had control of the banks and owned a huge chunk of Hilton Head , was building housing developments in Florida and looking to run a casino .
He had mansions in Pelham Manor , N.Y. , and Ocean Ridge , Fla. , that were officially owned by his 15  count ’em  children , whom he listed as the shareholders of two holding corporations that he created to shield the properties from creditors .
The ride up was not bump - free .
Mr. Schwab ’s wife , Mary Louise , filed for bankruptcy in 1969 , relating to the business , and twice he had been criminally charged in Buffalo .
One case ended in a mistrial , the other with his acquittal .
Power station worker ' murdered six people with home - made electric chair '
Deadly : Dmitry K is accused of rigging up an electric chair in his garage ( file picture )
A Russian man killed at least six people with a home - made electric chair , police have revealed .
The power station worker , identified only as Dmitry K , is also accused of designing an electric carpet which would kill anyone who stepped on it .
The 30 - year - old lured his victims by posting an advert on an internet website claiming he wanted to buy computer parts , detectives said .
Once at his house , he asked them to sit in an improvised electric chair before tying them up and hitting a button on his computer to activate the current .
After the victim was dead , he took the body to a forest and burned it .
Police only tracked the killer down to his house in in the city of Yekaterinburg , in the Urals , after finding the remains of a 23 - year - old student .
The man had been so badly burnt that officers were only able to identify him from dental records .
They also found fingerprint evidence which linked the victim to Dmitry K .
He has admitted the murder - but detectives suspect him of killing at least five other people .
Investigator Vladimir Davydov said : ' We are fairly sure that there were many more victims .
' He attacked this victim in his garage , tied him into his death chair and sent a huge electric charge through his body . '
Dmitry K told investigators he would admit other murders if they could find the bodies .
He also claimed he had designed a device which would remotely stop cars passing by his house - and then electrocute drivers when they stepped on his door mat .
He had been planing a machine to erase people ’s memory with an electro - magnetic ray , he added .
CANNIBALS AND RELIGIOUS FANATICS
There have been a string of horrific killings in Russia in recent months .
In March , police arrested Olesya Mostovschikova , 27 , for axing a woman to death before cooking and eating her .
The details of the case were horrific - but it was not an isolated incident .
In January , 16 - year - old schoolgirl Karina Barduchyan was killed and cannibalised by a 21 - year - old butcher and his florist friend in St Petersburg .
Yuri Mozhnov and Maxim Golovatskikh told officers they had cooked and eaten her with potatoes because they were hungry .
Last September in Yaroslavl , Satanists killed and ate Olga Pukhova , 15 , and Anna Gerokhova , 16 , after a ritualistic killing .
In the same month , police revealed they had arrested two Jehovah 's Witnesses for murdering 13 people during a nine - month killing spree .
Claiming to be on a mission from God , Vladimir Gurianov , 44 , and Elvira Egorycheva 46 , hacked , shot and bludgeoned their victims in a case that left even hardened Russian detectives shocked .
They claimed to be on a mission from God .

It might be interesting to see who owned the 94th street apartment .
To my understanding , you do n’t just show up in town and immediately blunder into an apartment to sublet long term , in NYC .
To : RegulatorCountry
I agree with you .
But how do you find out who owned it ?
Did people actually own apartments back in the early 80s ?
To : Albertafriend
Did people actually own apartments back in the early 80s ?
Well , yes .
It was n't public housing , owned by the government .
Somebody in the private sector owned it .
Whether it was an individual flat that was owned , or the entire building that was owned , somebody owned it .
NYC apartments are peculiar .
Getting into a rent controlled building is a coup , because it 's very expensive to rent there , even in a poor economy such as the early eighties .
If it was not rent controlled , and was such a deal that he could almost immediately sublet , legally , somebody did him a favor , and that somebody likely knew he was coming .
So , you might take some of the mystery away , from at least one benefactor .

Just read an article about female circumcism done in Kenya ..... That should give them something to think about .
They circumcise the women but NOT the men ?????
Naw did both from age 8 till adulthood with the same knife .
Real sanitary .
Part of the Moslem tradition .
http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/african_history/45388
There are some tribes that do not circumcise their members at all .
One of these tribes is the Luo tribe .
Because the Luo tribe does not circumcise neighboring tribes view that tribe as consisting of children .
You will find boys from the neighboring tribes teasing and bullying members of the Luo tribe .

In 1992 , the first multi-party elections took place .
What does that have to do with circumcision ?
Kenyans wondered what would happen if an uncircumcised male won the election .
Since the uncircumcised are viewed as children , in their eyes it would be the equivalent of having a seven year old become president of the United States .
( Looks like that ’s what we have ! )

BRITAIN'S leading fashion retailers are threatening to boycott Australian wool after farmers said they would keep mulesing sheep .
Next and Marks & Spencer are among major chains to condemn the decision as " totally unacceptable " and pledged to seek wool from non-mulesed Australian farms , or from other countries , UK papers reported yesterday .
Marks & Spencer pledged to use non-mulesed merino wool for its men's suits after 2010 .
In a letter to Australian wool industry leaders , the retailer is said to have stressed the " 2010 deadline is not negotiable and loss of confidence in M&S wool products could well lead to widespread customer boycotting and loss of revenue for the whole supply chain " , the newspaper said .
The British Retail Consortium was " disappointed " by last month 's statement and members " will seek to use suppliers who do n't use mulesing " next year .
" Next has expressed a preference for using non-mulesed and non-clip mulesed merino wool , " a spokeswoman for the retailer said .
Animal rights activists have long campaigned against mulesing , the practice of cutting a slice of flesh from a sheep 's rump to stop the animal dying of flystrike .
Farmers had agreed to stop mulesing in 2010 , but in July said they had not found a better way to stop the fly maggot infestations .
Wool body Australian Wool Innovation said the decision was based on scientific advice .
Australia is the world 's largest wool producer .

As a personal [ beneficiary ] of Senator Kennedy , I 'd like to add a short true story .
Back when I was a kid , perhaps 12 , my younger brother was diagnosed with a mental disability .
The school system would no longer admit my 9 year old brother and he had to be sent to a private institution which was way beyond my parents means .
One Thursday evening the phone rang at dinner time and I was the one who was closest and answered it .
To my great surprise , the man on the other end said he was Senator Ted Kennedy and he wanted to speak to my father .
My dad got on the phone .
A few minutes later after a one sided conversation by the Senator , my father ended the call with " Thank you so much . "
Tears ran down my father 's face .
The senator had gotten a letter from my mom telling him how awful it was that our state of Massachusetts no longer helped the handicapped .
He read the letter and called to say he personally would pay for my brother 's stay and education at a private institution .
My brother , and the rest of the family were saved by this great man .
He had compassion .
He had his demons as well .
But for America , he was a hero .
With great sorrow I brave his passing .
Thank you Senator Ted .
For me .
My family .
For the country .
I still remember my dad with all those tears telling us that our family would be better off because a stranger wanted to be of help .
I 'll never forget that either .
I 'm proud to have been a recipient of his great philanthropic efforts .
Oh , and he never asked for anything in return ... not a vote , not a payment ... just for my brother to have a chance .
And he took advantage of that .
One of our readers , David G. , is a personal friend and a TPC reader .
He left these comments on a post down thread , and I felt compelled to pass them along .
David graciously consented : Thank you so , so much for sharing that wonderful , touching moment , David .
Special does n't even begin to describe it , or Senator Kennedy .
OTL : Dream Chaser
reams were her gift .
Every morning , she 'd wake up and tell her husband , Al , how she 'd dreamed about angels or daughters or catastrophe .
Good or bad , she 'd always wake up with a story to tell -- until the day she never woke up at all .
Al never had that gift .
His dreams were vague , or they 'd escape him 20 seconds into his day .
He had nothing to jot down like she did , nothing to file away for a conversation over dinner .
Even after she died some 11 years ago , he never dreamt of her , could never summon her back into his subconscious .
This frustrated him to no end , because , once he was awake , all he did was daydream about her .
But then , about 10 weeks ago , in the middle of his deepest sleep , Al Joyner finally saw Flo Jo .
She had driven up in a car , smiling , and strolled casually toward him .
She was stunning , as always , and wore her hair in a bun , just the way he 'd always adored it .
He asked her , " What are you doing here ? "
And her response was , " I 'm just coming to check on you . "
He did n't know what to say next .
Their daughter , Mary , was about to graduate from high school , and he wanted to ask , " Are you here for graduation ? "
But before he could speak , his alarm clock went off .
The buzzing jarred him , and his dream was barely intact now .
He could see her leaving , climbing back into her car , smiling again .
He wanted more , wanted a full - blown conversation , but an instant later , Al was awake , the moment over .
He sat up in bed , both agitated and wistful .
That was it ?
That was the whole dream ?
He had n't finished .
There was so much to tell her , about him and Mary and premonitions that had come true .
There was also news to share , news she 'd probably beam about .
The next night , he went to bed early , hoping Flo Jo would reappear , hoping the dream would pick up where it left off .
But when he woke up , nothing .
He wanted to punch his pillow .
Nothing .
An agonizingly slow start
She has just been in the air these days , in the ether .
Twenty - five years ago this month , Al Joyner won a shocking gold medal at the Olympic Games in Los Angeles and fell in love with a lady in tights .
He has tried to move on with his life , but 25 years is 25 years , and he has begun to sense her again , in the wind , in his mind , as if it were yesterday .
Kevin Winter / Time Life Pictures / Getty Images Florence and Al Joyner were track and field royalty .
Just in July , for instance , the L.A. Sports Council invited Al and many of the 1984 medalists back to the creaky Coliseum , where one by one they were welcomed by raucous applause .
If it was n't Mary Lou Retton , it was Edwin Moses .
If it was n't Greg Louganis , it was Bart Conner .
The audience heard tales of Mary Decker and Zola Budd , Michael Jordan and Bobby Knight .
But as Al roamed the grounds and stared at a freshly lit Olympic flame , another story kept rushing back to him , a mystical story no one really knew about , a story he was dying to share : the story of Florence and Al .
He had first laid eyes on that woman in 1980 , at the U.S. Olympic trials in Eugene , Ore .
He can still remember the time ( 7 p.m. ) , the place ( a sign - in table ) , their ages ( both 20 ) and her face ( gorgeous ) .
She looked so elegant , he assumed she was a trainer .
He was wrong .
He asked for her name , and she told him , " Florence . "
He told her his , and that was the extent of their conversation : an insecure man and an introverted woman literally passing in the night .
The next day , he saw her warming up for the 100 meters and did a double take .
He asked around , and learned she was a UCLA sprinter who would soon be teammates with his talented high school sister , Jackie Joyner .
He rushed to find Jackie , who was warming up for a race herself , and said , " Jackie , there 's this girl from UCLA named Florence Griffith , and you need to find out if she has a boyfriend . "
" Yep , she has one , " Jackie said .
" Well , if they break up , let me know . "
" She 's not going to like you . "
" What do you mean , she 's not going to like me ? "
" Because I do n't like you . "
That did n't stop
Al from digging .
He found out Florence 's boyfriend was an 800 - meter runner , David Mack , and although Al turned sheepish and never spoke with her again in Eugene , he pasted Florence 's UCLA track photo onto his bedroom wall at Arkansas State .
" I had a girlfriend back in Arkansas who said , ' Why do you have a picture of this girl ? ' "
Al remembers .
" And I said , ' That 's the girl I 'm going to marry . ' "
Al gets the gold , not the girl
Al 's hope was to romance Florence at the ' 84 Olympics .
He had it all mapped out :
He 'd wine and dine her , sweep her off her feet .
But then everything changed in January ' 81 : His mother died .
Mary Joyner was only 37 years old when she contracted a bacterial infection that led to a massive hemorrhage of her adrenal glands .
When
Al got to her , near his hometown of East St. Louis , Ill. , she was in a coma with no discernible brain activity , her head swollen to twice its normal size .
Because Mary had been estranged from Al 's father , and because Al and Jackie were the oldest of Mary 's four children , the two of them had to decide when to turn off the respirator .
Al had never really faced death until then , and it was excruciating to say goodbye to her .
Mary had been strong and beautiful herself , a former nurse who had chased Al off the streets , who had urged him to maintain his job as a shoe - shiner .
She 'd wanted him to be trustworthy , and , one day , as a teenager , he ended up rescuing a little girl who had been drowning at a local pool .
The little girl returned the next day calling Al , " sweet man by the water , '' and soon that became his nickname : " Sweetwater . ' '
Mary loved what her son was becoming .
She 'd tell Al , " Make sure your words are always sweet as honey , because you never know when you 'll have to eat 'em . ''
It 's why he was so popular .
She taught him how to be a gentleman , and , even though his sister was the more acclaimed athlete , his mom often had said , " One day , Al will shine brighter . '''
So , as Al watched his mother come off life support , watched her turn cold and die , he made a pact with himself : win the ' 84 gold for mom , make all his training pay off .
Bob Thomas / Getty Images Joyner on his way to gold in the triple jump at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles .
Before the ' 84 U.S. Olympic trials , he flew to Los Angeles to prepare with UCLA coach Bob Kersee and his squadron of athletes .
Al slept on the floor of Jackie 's apartment , took a bus daily to Westwood and vowed not to be distracted by that beautiful woman again .
But he could n't help but fall in love with Florence Griffith .
He'd get the sweats whenever he saw her -- " I was so nervous around her " -- and he liked that she was n't a mischievous partyer .
The truth was , she was something of a loner , an eccentric .
As a child growing up in L.A. , she wore mismatched socks and rode a unicycle to school .
She wore one braid up and one braid down , did walking handstands around the block .
She was called " Dee Dee , " but she also answered to " Jackrabbit , " because she 'd annihilate people in footraces .
Her speed provided her with self - esteem , but still , as a young adult , she was a bit of a recluse .
By the ' 84 trials , she had a new boyfriend : Olympic hurdler Greg Foster .
But most nights ,
Al noticed Greg flirting with other women .
It galled Al , to the point where he confronted Foster .
" Where 's Florence ? "
Al asked him .
" Up in the room . "
" Greg , I do n't know why you 're down here talking to these other women when you got the most beautiful woman upstairs . "
" What ? "
" Greg , if you ever let her go , she 's going to be mine . "
After that , Al bit his lip .
He was too focused on his gold medal to court Florence now , and simply hung around the group .
Florence had no sense of his crush -- " To her , I was just Jackie 's nice brother , " he says -- and he became a master at bumping into her .
One day , at the Olympic training camp in Santa Barbara , Florence was about to drive off in her new red Nissan 300ZX with teammate Alice Brown , when Al flagged her down .
" Can you give me a lift ? " he asked .
" It 's a two - seater , " she said .
" I 'll lie down in the hatchback . "
" OK . "
He would 've happily stood on the roof , just for the chance to ride with her , and if the other athletes had been paying closer attention , they would 've seen through him .
He purposely walked with Florence to the Team USA photo in the Olympic village , and in the days before her 200 - meter final , he was asked by Valerie Brisco - Hooks ( Florence 's main competitor ) to predict a winner .
" Florence , " Al had said instantly .
It did n't pan out that way .
Although Florence won every preliminary round , Brisco - Hooks flew by her in the finals .
Al felt badly for Florence , but he had his own event to tend to .
He was a triple - jump afterthought , expected to be the third American behind Mike Conley and Willie Banks .
And when he tweaked his ankle in his first qualifying attempt and botched his second , his entire Olympics boiled down to a third all - or - nothing jump .
But he channeled his mother , tempered his breathing and jumped 55 feet , 9 ½ inches to put him into the next day 's finals .
He went to bed that night refreshed .
He called his college coach and said , " All I have to do is wake up tomorrow -- and go get my gold medal . "
The next day , his first jump was free and easy -- a lifetime best : 56 - 7 ½ .
Suddenly , the heat was on everyone else .
His good friend Conley fouled on a last attempt to catch him , while Banks , a Southern California native who had the Coliseum crowd behind him , kept mistiming his leaps .
Al had the gold , in arguably one of the biggest upsets of the ' 84 Games .
During the medal ceremony , he thought of his mother .
He 'd woken up and gotten his gold medal ; why could n't she have woken up from her coma ?
As he listened to the national anthem , that 's all he could think about :
What 's so hard about waking up ?
He felt alone .
Florence had barely batted an eye at him yet .
He felt utterly alone .
The first premonition of death
He was about to leave L.A. for Arkansas when he sidled up to Florence for a goodbye : " If I ever come back to California , will you show me around ?
Show me Disneyland ? "
Her answer was " Yes , OK , " and he later sent her a Christmas card along with one of his promotional photos .
She sent him back a picture of herself with her silver medal -- and , for the first time , he had a sliver of hope .
He began mailing her friendship cards that were borderline sappy .
She certainly knew of his crush now , and by 1986 , he flew to L.A. to train for the ' 88 Olympics with Jackie -- and to put the full - court press on Florence .
" I told everybody in Arkansas the only reason I wo n't come back is if I marry Florence Griffith , " Al remembers .
" And they said , ' Well , we 'll see you soon . ' "

Joyner did n't want to ruin his chances at a relationship , so he backed off for a while .
Florence later called and asked him out .
He arrived the week of Halloween , and purposely drove by the bank where she worked .
She was decked out in her costume -- a wedding dress -- and Al could n't resist saying : " Oh , you 're ready to marry me ? "
She gave him a playful yes , to which he replied : " You know how serious I am , right ? "
She laughed , then changed the subject .
He reminded her of her promise to show him L.A. , and she claimed she had n't forgotten .
The courtship began .
He found out she worked out at a local Bally 's fitness center , so he joined the club himself .
" Cost me 600 - some dollars , " he says .
They began going to dinner and listening to music at her apartment off Florence Avenue in L.A .
She liked Anita Baker records , so he bought some , too .
He started to stay up late with her , while she 'd braid people 's hair or manicure people 's fingernails .
Her interests far exceeded track and field .
She loved arts and crafts , and sewing and constructing handmade children 's mats .
Most of the time , she'd be up until 2 or 3 a.m. , dabbling in her hobbies , and Al patiently sat with her , although he knew they 'd end up overtired .
Eventually , he told her to get more rest and to stop eating at McDonald's .
She was n't insulted and asked him , point - blank , " Al , how did you win your gold medal ? "
He told her he believed in himself when no one else would , and that struck a chord with her .
People never believed in her , either .
Some called her the " Silver Queen , " because she 'd had a spate of second - place finishes .
So Al told her he believed in her 1 million percent -- and that 's when he realized he'd better back off .
" I had to stop calling her , " he says .
" I thought about high school and how girls I 'd be out with would all of a sudden want to be just friends .
I did n't want to ruin the relationship .
So I just stopped .
Stopped being around her , stopped practicing with her . "
Weeks later , while he was staying with Jackie and her coach - husband , Bob Kersee , in Long Beach , the phone rang .
It was Florence , looking for Al .
She asked him out .
They drove to a nightclub with one of Florence 's girlfriends .
It did n't feel like a date .
But every time another man asked Florence to dance -- and there were about 50 taps on her shoulder -- she said no .
She 'd dance only with Al , and from then on , they were serious boyfriend - girlfriend .
She reminded him of his mother , while Al reminded her of nobody .
" Because no one has ever treated me as well as you , " she told him .
" You really are sweet man by the water . ''
They had a favorite song , " All My Life " by K - Ci and JoJo , and Al could n't believe how much the lyrics fit them : " Girl you are ... Close to me -- you 're like my mother .
Close to me -- you 're like my father .
Close to me -- you 're like my sister .
Close to me -- you 're like my brother .
All my life I prayed for someone like you .
Yes , I pray that you do love me , too . "
He decided to propose , and the only question was when .
Al was a numbers man , and when it came to Florence , he 'd decided his lucky number was seven .
He had met her seven years before at 7 p.m .
She was the seventh of 11 children .
Their next date was on July 17 .
It was 1987 .
So that became his plan : propose to her at 7 p.m. on 7/17/87 .
" If she was going to say no , it had to be on all my lucky numbers , " he says .
He booked a limo and made reservations at the trendy Brown Derby restaurant .
But when he arrived , she had curlers in her hair .
" Why a limo ? " she asked him .
" I just want to go to McDonald's . "
He begged her to just drive with him , and when the song " Stand By Me " came on the radio , he said , " You 're the most beautiful , straightforward woman I know .
Will you marry me ? "
They set their wedding date for late 1988 , after the Olympics .
But on Oct. 1 , 1987 , Florence was horrified by a Los Angeles earthquake that registered a magnitude of 5.9 .
She grabbed Al by the shirt and said , " Let 's go .
I do n't want to die without being married . "
She had never spoken before about death , and she seemed serious , agitated .
It shook Al a bit , so he drove her to Las Vegas for a quick , impromptu Oct. 10 wedding , nine days after the quake .
She wore her Halloween wedding dress .

Track & Field 's first couple
The married couple soon could be seen sprinting down Victory Boulevard , near their home in Van Nuys , Calif .
And that was the whole idea -- so Florence could envision victory .
Before their marriage , she seemed to lack a certain race - day arrogance , and as her new full - time coach , Al stepped up the positive reinforcement .
He got her to bed early -- no more marathon nail sessions -- and monitored her diet .
She was eating mostly fish and chicken , taking vitamins , drinking more water .
In the gym , she was doing squats , lunges and every other leg exercise under the sun .
Her philosophy was " To run like a man , you have to train like a man . "
But when she showed up chiseled at the ' 88 U.S. Olympic trials in Indianapolis , the whispers reflected exactly that : masculine testosterone steroids cheat .
While Al steamed , she ignored it -- and set the world record in the 100 meters with a 10.49 .
Ten - four - nine !
The track world was so stunned , critics claimed it was wind - aided , or the clock had malfunctioned .
They pointed out she had n't even been a top - 10 sprinter in 1987 and doubted she could knock 0.27 of a second off her previous best legally .
She had run as fast as Jesse Owens in 1936 -- the equivalent of a 9.5 - second 100 - yard dash -- and faster than some current international men's champions .
Not only that , she had raced with her hair down , wearing a risqué , purple one - legged bodysuit -- an athletic negligee , she called it .
She 'd also worn her fingernails 4 inches long , colored immaculately .
She was a modern star -- Flo Jo -- celebrated and ridiculed simultaneously .
But her drug test came back clean , and even though there was evidence of a late breeze in the race , her 10.49 stood .
She and Al were on cloud nine .
Before the trials , he had spent months building her up , teaching her how to run relaxed , giving her motivational books , writing " Gold Medal " on the walls of their home .
He 'd work her out at 4 a.m. sometimes , and she even defeated him in a race one day , prompting him to say , " No woman will beat you -- you 'll run a 10.5 . "
Her response was " Al , have you lost your mind ?
If I run that fast , they 'll dissect me . "
She was n't lying .
AP Photo / Rusty Kennedy Flo Jo reflects on her world record in the 200 - meter finals at the 1988 Seoul Olympics .
She won in a time of 21.34 seconds .
As the accusations increased , Al 's instinct was to lash out .
But she'd hush him , the way his mother used to .
She 'd say , " If I stop to kick every barking dog , I 'm not going to get to the places I need to go . "
Or she 'd tell him , " Al , you know how hard I trained . "
She still had gold medals to win , more bodysuits to design .
In Seoul , at the ' 88 Summer Games , she was the world 's hottest name .
Despite getting off a bus with legends Edwin Moses , Evelyn Ashford and Steve Scott , she was the one who was bum - rushed by fans .
And she lived up to her billing .
Again racing with her hair down , she swept the 100 and 200 with a wind - aided 10.54 and a world - record 21.34 , respectively .
She later won a third gold in the 4x100 relay , and constantly hummed " The Star - Spangled Banner , " her new favorite song .
After Seoul , the daggers continued to fly .
Critics claimed Flo Jo wore heavy makeup to hide steroid - induced acne , and an 800 - meter runner , Darrell Robinson , told a German magazine , in a paid interview , that he had sold her human growth hormone six months before the ' 88 Games .
He claimed she had slipped him 20 $ 100 bills and that she 'd said , " If you want to make a million dollars , you 've got to invest some thousand dollars . "
Flo
Jo could n't bite her lip any longer .
She went on the " Today " show and called Robinson a " crazy , lying lunatic . "
Years later , Robinson 's credibility would take a hit when he tried to commit suicide by drinking antifreeze .
But the damage was already done .
A melancholy Al urged Florence to turn back to her hobbies .
She 'd never wanted to be a career sprinter , anyway .
Her goal had always been to win one gold medal .
She 'd always wanted to act , design clothes , stay up late , color hair , become a cosmetologist .
And so , by February 1989 , Al thought she should just get on with the rest of her life .
Because the track season was about to begin -- and she had n't trained a second -- she decided to retire at age 29 .
The cynics said she was dodging new out - of - competition drug testing , but Al says that 's false , that there was a more logical , overriding reason .
In fact , he will tell you that in New York City , the day of her announcement , Flo Jo went out shopping .
For baby clothes .
Little girls ' baby clothes .
Then along came Mary
A closet , tucked away in a spare bedroom , began to explode with dresses .
There were pinafores and jumpsuits and UCLA cheerleading outfits , all ready for a tiny , crawling daughter .
Down the hall , there was a den full of dolls , play kitchens and little pink strollers .
" We had a hope chest that turned into a hope room , " Al says .
There was just one problem with all of it : Florence was n't pregnant .
She 'd simply assure
Al that she 'd soon be having a baby girl , and that this girl would be an extraordinary singer , the one talent Florence wished she 'd had .
It seemed curious and presumptuous not to buy a single item of boys ' clothing , not to buy one truck , but Al sensed Florence 's conviction and knew not to chide her .
Courtesy Al Joyner Mary was born Nov. 13 , 1990 .
A year later , she finally was pregnant , and Al noticed how much she glowed .
She 'd eat whatever she wanted , guiltlessly , and no longer felt the urge to head to Bally's .
After years of toning her body , Florence gained 63 pounds during her pregnancy .
" I called her ' Prego , ' " Al says .
She gave birth on Nov. 13 , 1990 ( with makeup on ) to -- what else -- a healthy baby daughter .
It amazed Al a bit to see how clairvoyant Florence had been , but it would n't be the last time , especially when the little girl began to sing .
Florence had named the child Mary -- to honor Al 's mom -- and by age 2 , little Mary was already belting out , " The Star - Spangled Banner . "
The toddler could n't speak complete sentences yet , but she could belt out her mommy 's " Olympic song , " which had Al speechless .
Mother and daughter were inseparable , and by the time Mary was 2½ , Florence would sit her down at the kitchen table and teach her the ABCs .
Florence would break out books , flash cards and shapes to quiz Mary all morning , before they'd head out to the track in the afternoon .
That was little Mary 's first sandbox : the long - jump pit .
While Florence was training other runners or doing wind sprints herself , Mary would dig up the pit with her tiny shovel .
Before long , she began to do knee pumps and jump - rope drills with the sprinters , and Florence told people only one person was capable of breaking her records : Mary .
Before long , Florence was a soccer mom , chauffeuring Mary to gymnastics classes in their new hometown of Mission Viejo , Calif .
Florence kept hand - made signs in her car , so she could flash " Your headlights are on , " or " Your gas tank is open " to other drivers .
Who thought of things like that ?
But Florence was happy in her domestic life , setting up arts and crafts booths at swap meets and doing her friends ' hair and nails .
You'd have never known she was an Olympic champion , except for the two times a day she 'd peer up at the clock and say , " Look at the time ; it 's 10:49 . "
Al 's lucky number might have been 7 , but Florence had adopted 10 - 4 - 9 , her world record in the 100 meters .
It did n't matter whether it was a.m. or p.m. ; Florence had a sixth sense to look up and locate the clock at the stroke of 10:49 .
She never had to be reminded or prompted ; it was just one of her eccentricities .
She 'd simply smile and say , " What time is it , people ? " and move on with her day .
Al had long known about Florence 's quirks and had always considered them endearing .
When she 'd travel overseas , she 'd write Mary exhaustive letters , so the girl would have mail waiting for her every day .
But , soon , it was a little over the top .
Florence would even sit down at home and write letters to her daughter , sealing them and scribbling : " Do Not Open Until You 're 16 . "
Al dutifully packed them away , thinking it was Florence just being Florence .
But then came some darker moments , some premonitions that were somewhat difficult for Al to digest .
One morning , after she 'd watched the movie " Ghost " the previous night with Mary , Florence woke up desperately grabbing for him .
" Al , I had this dream and you were crying , " Florence said .
" And I was telling you I was all right and everything was fine , but I could n't reach you .
But I was telling you everything was fine .
I just could n't get to you .
You should know this . "

Even as a toddler , Mary delighted her parents with her singing .
Her dreams had long been colorful and vivid , but now there seemed to be a certain distressing element to them .
She woke up another morning sobbing , and when Al asked her what was wrong , she said , " I do n't want to leave Mary without a mother . "
" Well , I do n't want to leave her without a father , either , " he said .
" No , seriously , " Florence said .
" If something happens to me , I want you to get married again . "
" Come on , forget it , " Al said .
" No , seriously , " she snapped .
He tried lightening the moment , and told her , " Well , if something happens to me , you can't get remarried .
I 'll haunt you . "
But she was n't budging .
She said this was a crucial conversation , that she was sick about this .
So he told her , straight - faced , " I 'll never marry again , no way . "
He meant it .
He used to tell people he and Florence argued about only two things : who loved the other more and who could clean the kitchen better .
He told her there was no other woman for him , but Florence began wagging a finger at him .
" No , you will get married again , because I 'll be the one to send her to you , " she said .
" How will I know ? " he asked .
" You 'll know , " she said .
" Come on , how will I know ? "
" You 'll know , Al . You 'll know . "
Periodically , Florence would reprise the conversation , telling
Al maybe it was better if they all died together , because no one could take care of Mary better than they could .
He chalked this up to Florence 's creative mind .
She was n't ill , as far as he knew .
She had suffered an apparent seizure in 1996 while flying to St. Louis on business , but there 'd been no lasting complications or reason for concern .
She was busier than ever .
Not only was she writing a book called " Running for Dummies , " she also was planning to open a salon and training to run marathons .
Her plan was eventually to do a 30 - mile jaunt , and by 1998 , she already was running 22 miles in 2 hours , 46 minutes .
Mary would jog or ride her bike alongside her , which thrilled Florence to no end .
Mary was already a promising athlete and could long - jump between 7 and 8 feet .
She was mature beyond her years , already in third grade by age 7 , already able to play the piano by ear .
Florence was n't about to push her into anything , but it seemed Mary preferred gymnastics most of all .
She competed for a club team called " The Little Guns , " and Florence was one of the team moms .
Soon , Mary was talking ad nauseam about an upcoming meet in Santa Barbara against elite competition .
Al and Florence would n't dare miss it , and on Sunday , Sept. 20 , 1998 , they drove the 100 miles to watch her .
Little Mary ended up taking first place in the balance beam and second in the vault .
With her parents grinning , she stepped up on a podium -- her own " Star - Spangled Banner " moment -- and bowed down to receive her award .
The next morning , Florence was dead .
Sudden death
Florence never woke up from her last dream .
That 's about the simplest way to put it .
Those final hours -- from gymnastics meet to 911 call -- are etched in Al 's mind , and if he 's told it 100 times , he 's cried 100 times .
When they returned from the meet , Al went to an office he kept near their home in Mission Viejo to review an endorsement proposal for a hair product .
He came home late and shot up to the upstairs bedroom to say goodnight to Florence .
She already was curled up in bed with Mary , who slept in their room every night , and Al 's only words were " I love you . "
Florence answered : " Love you , too . "
AP Photo / Susan Sterner Flo Jo had announced in June 1996 that she would not seek a spot on the U.S. Olympic team because of Achilles tendinitis .
A little more than two years later , she was gone .
He would 've climbed into bed with them , but he says he had a craving for ice cream and did n't want Florence to smell it on his breath .
She had been razzing him about getting back into shape , and he knew the ice cream was a no - no .
So he says he devoured the ice cream downstairs , lay down on the couch and fell asleep .
In the morning , he heard the ringing of their alarm clock , and walked upstairs to rouse the ladies out of bed .
Florence used to purposely keep the alarm on Al 's bedside table because she hated early mornings and would do anything to prolong a dream .
So Al thought she was letting the alarm ring " to be funny . "
But this also was a school day for Mary , and Al plowed into the room to say , " Come on , we 're running late . "
Neither of them budged .
It confounded him , so he moved closer .
He could see that Mary 's eyes were shut and that her legs were resting on top of Florence , who was face - down .
He then tried rustling Florence out of her sleep , and when Florence still would n't move , he flipped her over .
Her eyes were wide - open and motionless .
He screamed , waking Mary .
With Florence in his arms , he told Mary to call Florence 's mother on a downstairs telephone .
He then dialed 911 , howling , " My wife 's gone .
My wife 's goooone . "
They asked him to perform CPR , and , being a former lifeguard , he was more than capable .
But there was nothing close to a pulse .
Sobbing , Al began to speak to Florence , telling her , " This is not the way the story is supposed to end .
I 'm supposed to go before you .
You 're supposed to watch Mary grow up , see what she 's going to turn out to be . "
Right then , Mary bolted back into the room , asking , " What 's wrong with Mommy ? "
And before
Al could answer , the paramedics arrived , followed by a coroner .
Al and Mary were shooed out of the room , and 20 minutes later a paramedic brought Florence 's wedding ring to Al , along with a nail they had broken , one of Florence 's 4 - inch - long painted nails .
Al put the nail in his pocket .
Before long , they were bringing Florence down the stairs in a body bag .
Al ushered Mary to a side room , then watched the gurney emerge .
He says the coroner was crying .
Helicopters and TV crews hovered outside -- because Flo Jo was dead at 38 -- but all Al could think about were Florence 's dreams , those elaborate , foreboding dreams .
He instantly recalled the one in which she 'd been trying to tell him she was OK , but could n't find him .
He realized she 'd been trying to prepare him for this moment .
It felt like his mother 's death , and he found himself thinking again , " What 's so hard about waking up ? ''
He blamed himself for not sleeping upstairs that night -- " I might 've saved her , '' he says -- and he sat the rest of the day in shambles , remembering their runs down Victory Boulevard .
Eventually , something flashed into his scattered , flustered mind , something he found curiously symmetrical .
He 'd met Florence Griffith 18 years before at 7 p.m. , and he'd found her dead , next to their 7 - year - old child , at 7 a.m .
Seven , he decided , was now his unlucky number .

While pallbearers carry Flo Jo's casket after the funeral Sept. 26 , 1998 , Al Joyner holds Mary , next to his sister , Jackie Joyner - Kersee .
Mary 's life - saving decision
Florence 's family wanted to take Mary away from that house immediately , but Mary would n't leave .
" I 'm staying with Daddy , " she insisted .
When he thinks back on it , Al says " Mary saved my life , " because in those initial hours , he says he wanted to kill himself -- " so I could catch Florence . "
But Mary 's presence alone , her pristine face , gave him a reason to continue living .
" No telling what I would 've done , " he says .
He kept waiting for Mary to cry , but , peculiarly , she did n't .
She 'd always been a weepy child , but whether it was denial , or pure shock , Mary decided she had to be " strong for my dad . "
At the funeral , she and a friend sang a gospel song " The Wind Blows on Me , " and she stayed composed .
Even after
Al had his and Florence 's song , " All My Life , " played at the service , Mary did n't weep .
When the pastor asked her whether she 'd like to have the casket opened so she could say a final goodbye to her mom , Mary answered : " No , let everyone see her . "
So 2,000 people paraded up for a viewing , she and Al bringing up the rear .
A concerned Al waited and waited for her to wilt .
He slept on the floor of her bedroom every night and kept her home two weeks from school .
On her first day back in the third grade , her teacher called Al , midday , and Al figured , OK , she 's finally broken down .
Instead , the teacher told him that his daughter was OK and that Mary wanted to make sure he was OK , too .

He was n't OK , not even close .
He kept Florence 's broken finger nail in a box , and says he would n't sleep in the master bedroom , " because it was n't the same -- she was n't there .
All I would do is look up and I would think she was going to come through that door .
I was waiting for her to come through the garage .
I was looking in the kitchen .
But it was n't happening ; it was never happening . "
He needed time alone , to deal with the autopsy and the media crush .
By late October , the sheriff - coroner 's office announced Florence had suffered an epileptic seizure brought on by a congenital abnormality in her brain .
Her body had locked up while she was sleeping facedown , and she had suffocated in her pillow .
Quieting all the cynics who were assuming her death had been heart - related due to steroid abuse , the announcement was a victory of sorts -- at least to Al .
Florence had been dissected , all right , and Al 's comment was , " She took the ultimate drug test .
I told them to test for everything .
And there was nothing there , and there never was . "
Her detractors pointed out that there was n't enough urine in her bladder to test for steroids , and that there were signs of heart abnormalities .
Al wanted to scream " Let her rest in peace , " and was worried all the negativity would seep its way to Mary .
The girl still had n't cried in front of her father , and he knew there had to be a frightened child in there , somewhere .
Of course , she was a mess .
She just did n't want Al to know it .
That first day back at school , she actually had burst out crying , and asked her teacher for a tissue .
She then wrote a letter to heaven that began : " Dear God , is it true that my mother passed away ?
If so , can I have her back for just one more year ? "
Another time , at home , she locked herself in the bathroom , sobbing .
Florence 's niece , Darnesha Griffith , a track star at UCLA , had been taking care of Mary that day , and persuaded Mary to open the door .
" What 's wrong , Mary ? " Darnesha asked .
" Well , I watched the movie ' Ghost ' with my mom , " Mary said , " and I need to ask you a question . "
" What ? " Darnesha said .
" Is my mom going to kick the can ?
Like the ghost , Patrick Swayze , kicked the can ? "
Weeks later , Mary was finally sobbing in front of Al , too .
They had been driving on the freeway one day when she burst into tears and asked , " If anything happens to you , who 'll take care of me ? "
" I 'm not going anywhere , " Al told her , and father and daughter became inseparable .
On her first Mother 's Day without her mom , Mary made cards for both Florence and Al .
Her note to Florence read " Mommy , be proud of Daddy , he 's started training again . "
And her message to Al was " I love you , Daddy . "
Al became a playground attendant at her school , a class dad .
He took her to late - night movies .
Whenever the clock turned 10:49 , he'd tell her , " Mommy 's saying hi . "
They slowly began to adjust .
He began coaching at UCLA , so he gave her a cell phone when she was only 8 , urging her to call him anytime , any place .
He 'd leave practice early to relieve Mary 's nanny , or he 'd bring Mary to practice with him , pointing her toward the long - jump pit .
In fact , Mary decided to quit gymnastics and asked Al to start a track club for her .
She had an easy stride and began hurdling chairs and limbo sticks in their living room .
Al gave her Florence 's gold medal from the 100 meters , but curiously , she did n't want to flaunt her talent or draw attention away from her friends .
And when Al suggested she get up at 4 a.m. to train -- the way Florence used to -- she was n't enthused .
Track and field began to fluster her .
" People 'd say , ' Oh , of course you run , ' " Mary says .
" It was just expected .
You have an Olympic dad , an Olympic mom , an Olympic aunt and a cousin [ Darnesha ] who won the indoor and outdoor [ titles ] in the NCAAs .
You feel like you 've got to do something with track .
You 'd better be good , or else you 're kind of letting the name down .
And that 's what I had trouble with . "
Then , one morning , Mary awoke recalling a dream :
She 'd been in a major gymnastics competition , in front of a large throng , and she 'd been the star .
She mentioned this to Al and said , " Daddy , I want to do gymnastics again . "
It floored him .
Not that she 'd picked gymnastics , but because of her elaborate dream .
He braced himself .
Mary had the gift .
Courtesy Al Joyner Mary has been in the spotlight at times during her young life .
Mrs. Right , delivered by Flo Jo
Four years later , Al was still mourning , and he looked it .
He was always tired or famished , and friends told him he could n't help Mary unless he helped himself .
His male friends urged him to go out at night and mingle -- with the opposite sex .
He had a hard time going down that road .
He remembered Florence begging him to remarry , remembered her saying she 'd send him a sign when Mrs. Right appeared .
Was he supposed to find a lady with a December birthday , like Florence's ?
Someone with long nails ?
He was perplexed .
Courtesy Al Joyner
Al remarried in 2003 , exchanging vows with Alisha Biehn .
One night , a buddy talked him into a night on the town , and he struck up a conversation with an attractive blonde who was a runner herself .
He had n't told her his last name , but she began raving about Flo Jo and Jackie and said it was sad what happened to Florence .
It was eye - raising , but Al did n't consider it a sign .
Her name was Alisha Biehn , and when he eventually admitted who he was , he was impressed she did n't seem threatened by his storybook love with Florence .
" She was the first woman I 'd come across who was n't wondering , ' Could he love me that way ? ' "
Al says .
Their dating escalated , and his friends noticed him smiling again .
He took her to see the Lakers play the San Antonio Spurs one night , and , as they left the Staples Center -- and exited onto Florence Avenue -- " All My Life ' ' came on the radio .
Alisha heard the words ( " Close to me -- you 're like my mother , close to me -- you 're like my father " ) and said , " I dedicate this song to you . "
Al nearly crashed .
" I had a tear in my eye and I smiled , " Al says .
" I said , ' Wow , you 're the one . '
That 's when I knew .
Like Florence said , I just knew . "
They married in June 2003 , and their main worry was 12 - year - old Mary .
She sang at their wedding , but , deep down , she was feeling abandoned and starting to rebel .
She had asked her father five years prior , " If something happens to you , who will take care of me ? "
And Al had answered , " I 'll never leave . "
But now a part of him was leaving .
She had to share him with a stepmom , live in a new house .
She began slacking off at her new public school , so Al punished her by pulling her out of gymnastics .
He then put her back in private school -- the same school she 'd been attending when her mother died -- and Al told friends , " I always try to do what Florence would 've done . ''
He sensed Mary 's life was beginning to spiral .
She had run track as a freshman in high school , but when she felt she flopped at the elite Arcadia Invitational Meet , she lost interest in the sport .
" She was too hard on herself , " Al says .
" Her mother did n't even get invited to that meet as a ninth - grader . "
Mary was crumbling under all the expectations , and it did n't help that , one day at school , her mother 's name appeared in a math word problem : " If Flo Jo increased her 22 - second 200 - meter time by 0.8 percent , what would her time be ? "
She could n't escape it .
Another time , on a trip to Las Vegas , Mary saw a wax statue of her mom at Madame Tussauds and wanted to faint .
She began locking herself in her room , and Al knew he had to do something .
So on her 16th birthday , he gave Mary five letters from Florence , five letters Florence had written to her when Mary was 2 .
Five letters that read " Do Not Open Until You 're 16 . ''
Mary could hardly breathe as she read them .
Because at the top of the first letter , Florence had written the time of day : 10:49 .
Mary and Flo Jo , reconnected
Mary was rejuvenated .
The message in those letters , in general terms , was for Mary to be true to herself .
She did n't have to race to uphold the family name .
Just find her passion , whatever that might be .
Mary felt a sudden mystic connection to her mother , as though they 'd just sat down and chatted .
In a curious way , her mother had given Mary life , from the grave , and this made Mary and Darnesha and Al all wonder how supernatural Florence actually was .
" I mean , who writes letters for their kids to open when they 're going to be 16 , when they 're only 2 ? " Darnesha says .
" Very eerie . "
Mary leaned on all of this , for the better .
Al gave her Florence 's old red 300ZX to drive , and Mary became almost a reincarnation of her mom .
She combed her hair with her mother 's monogrammed brushes and , just like Florence , found herself glancing up at a clock every morning at 10:49 a.m .
" I would n't even have to think about it , " Mary says .
" I 'd look up , and it'd be 10:49 , and I 'd feel like she was thinking of me or trying to say something .
It 's a very important number to me .
" I do n't plan it .
It just happens .
Like just accidental .
I wo n't look up at 10:48 or 10:50 .
I 'll look up at 10:49 .
Sometimes I do it twice a day .
It 's almost comforting . "

Al has wished Mary luck and told her he would be there if she needed help training .
Whatever Florence was whispering to Mary -- and Mary felt her presence -- the most profound change could be found in Mary 's music .
Suddenly , it meant the world to her .
Long before Mary was born , Florence had prayed for a musically gifted daughter -- partly because Florence could n't hold a tune -- and Mary somehow seemed to channel that prayer .
" The music thing , nobody else had done that , " Darnesha says .
" Not her mom , her dad , nobody .
She was proud of herself .
She defined who she was . "
Mary considered music " her therapy , " and the little girl who used to suppress her tears and lock herself in bathrooms wrote and performed a stirring song on YouTube entitled " Let Me Cry A Little . "
By her senior year of high school , it was clear she was comfortable in her own skin -- her mother 's daughter .
She posted a Christmas song on YouTube and sang several others a cappella .
Al bragged about it to anybody who would listen .
His life was fuller and busier , too .
Alisha had given birth to a son and daughter , and he 'd accepted a job as a track coach at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista , Calif .
Twenty - five years after his ' 84 gold medal , this is who Al had become : father of three , and seemingly husband of two .
" I know he 's remarried , " Darnesha says .
" But Florence is still the love of his life . "
The Olympic anniversary gala this July only reinforced that .
As he roamed the L.A. Coliseum -- having left both Alisha and Mary at home -- he searched for Florence , for any sign of her , any message .
Then suddenly someone played the national anthem -- her national anthem -- and he felt her .
The people at his dinner table then watched a grown man get teary - eyed .
" I realized then how the ' 84 Olympics changed my life , " Al says .
" Changed my life because it was the doorway for me to meet my future wife .
When I look back on it , those Olympics meant more to me than anything else that 's ever happened in my life .
And being there again was overwhelming , joyful and sad .
I thought I 'd let Florence go .
But that night let me know I had not let anything go .
It made me wish I could see her .
I found myself standing exactly where I got my gold medal , and I felt exactly how I felt 25 years ago : alone . "
Mary , lucky Mary , seemed to be able to channel Florence -- much more easily than Al .
At her high school graduation , he had told Mary , " Mom would be proud of you , " and Mary had answered , " She is . "
Who knows what Mary has heard from Florence , or thinks she 's heard ?
Who knows what Mary has dreamt ?
But a couple of weeks before the anniversary gala , 18 - year - old Mary pulled Al aside and gave him stunning news :
She was getting back into track .
" I just feel like I 'm destined to , I guess , " she says .
" If anyone has the genes to reach my mom 's potential , I guess it 's me . "
Al wished her luck and told her he would be available if she needed help , if she needed a partner , if she needed someone to run down Victory Boulevard with her .
Mary is trying to do this under the radar -- and sometimes she gets cold feet -- but her hope is to slowly ease back into shape and be ready to sprint and long - jump for Santa Monica College this September .
She has been training periodically with one of Al 's Olympic athletes , who just told Al : " She can really run .
It just depends if she wants it . "
So that 's why Florence is in the air right now , in the ether .
Al says all the time that his goal is to get to heaven so he can ask her his questions , ask her how she knew their baby would be a girl how she knew their baby would be able to sing how she knew Alisha would be coming how she knew she 'd die young whether she 's the one who nudged Mary to run again .
If he could lure Florence back into his dreams , maybe he'd know .
All he'd have to do is wake up , and he'd have his answers .
If only he had the gift .
He 'd trade in his gold medal if he could have the gift .

WASHINGTON 
The changing global climate will pose profound strategic challenges to the United States in coming decades , raising the prospect of military intervention to deal with the effects of violent storms , drought , mass migration and pandemics , military and intelligence analysts say .
Such climate - induced crises could topple governments , feed terrorist movements or destabilize entire regions , say the analysts , experts at the Pentagon and intelligence agencies who for the first time are taking a serious look at the national security implications of climate change .
Recent war games and intelligence studies conclude that over the next 20 to 30 years , vulnerable regions , particularly sub-Saharan Africa , the Middle East and South and Southeast Asia , will face the prospect of food shortages , water crises and catastrophic flooding driven by climate change that could demand an American humanitarian relief or military response .
An exercise last December at the National Defense University , an educational institute that is overseen by the military , explored the potential impact of a destructive flood in Bangladesh that sent hundreds of thousands of refugees streaming into neighboring India , touching off religious conflict , the spread of contagious diseases and vast damage to infrastructure .
“ It gets real complicated real quickly , ” said Amanda J. Dory , the deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategy , who is working with a Pentagon group assigned to incorporate climate change into national security strategy planning .
Busting Loose -- The Mother of Re-Invention
I think for most of us , it 's not on the level of gee , I 'd like to be President of the United States .
And , in fact , who really wants that ?
What a pain in the ass .
I can't imagine having to spend 16 hours a day dealing with politicians , radio talk show hosts , angry vegetarians and the cast of " Fantasy Island , " aka North Korea .
Frankly , as a guy and a Player , I 'd rather grow up to be Johnny Depp -- all the notoriety and half the grief , 50 times the money , a 45 - acre private island in the Bahamas , a creative outlet in the movies .
Plus , I get to play a pirate .
Arrgggh .
Women , I 'm thinking Oprah ?
Kate Winslett ?
Angela Merckel ?
I do n't know , you tell me .
We have plenty of creations to choose from .
( Oh , then there 's the guy whose " job " was to eat his way through the two most famous
For me , it 's started out on a little less grand level .
it 's a combination of realizing what I can play at now , and what I would like to discard .
Sort of like the guy in a series of radio commercials for STP Oil , the " I do n't wanna be that guy " guy .
He laments not being able to do simple manly things like changing the oil in his car , home repairs or hunting .
He knows more about cooking oil than motor oil .
He wants to get grease on his hands .
I can relate .
I do n't want to be that guy who looks at everything through the prism of whether he can afford it or not .
I do n't want to be that guy who sits in front of his computer 13 hours a day until his eyes bleed and his brain synapses fry because he 's too lazy to get out of the house .
I do n't want to be that guy who cruises travel sites every day , but never books a flight anywhere .
I do n't want to be the guy who settles for a McDonald 's hamburger when he could be eating sushi -- in Japan .
I do n't want to be the guy who uses coupons at the grocery store .
I do n't want to be the guy with basic cable when he could have HBO and Cinemax .
I do n't want to be the guy who takes his date to an art reception because there will be free food and wine .
You get my point .
Eventually , as I realize what I do n't want to be , when I understand the limitations I 've put on myself , then I can start playing in a bigger arena .
For example , I 've noticed a change in my response to the question , " what do you do ? "
No , I 'm not answering , " I seek enlightenment through a process called Busting Loose , so that I can realize my true essence as an infinitely abundant and joyful being . "
I have n't quite come out of the closet in that regard .
But now the answer is along the lines of , " Well , this week , I 'm writing a screenplay and solving the newspaper crisis . "
Or " Today , I 'm producing a television show and saving the non-profit arts community . "
Or " Next week , I 'm launching an internet marketing campaign and I 'm going to give the local music scene an international presence and make it bigger than Austin . "
I 'm thinking bigger and more creatively .
I do n't want to confine myself .
I 'm realizing I 'm more than just a persona defined by a certain set of skills and society 's expectations -- and my own stories .
Plus I get bored easily .
So one crusade morphs into another depending on whether I 'm still having fun with it .
But I 'm expanding as a Player in ways I would never have considered before .
I 'm approaching people I would never have approached , just for the fun of doing it , and asking for things I would never have asked for , for the same reason .
The response is n't even important .
It 's the taking the chance that is fun .
Understanding we are living in an illusion of our own creation is the mother of re-invention .
So take a minute and think about what you 're doing this week .
Anyone for tennis and buying a villa in Tuscany ?
Thought so .
One of the great gifts of Busting Loose is the chance to re-invent ourselves on the playing field while we do the serious behind - the - scenes work through the Process .
I 'm seeing so many more possibilities that I did n't realize before .
I think for most of us , it 's not on the level of gee , I 'd like to be President of the United States .
And , in fact , who really wants that ?
What a pain in the ass .
I can't imagine having to spend 16 hours a day dealing with politicians , radio talk show hosts , angry vegetarians and the cast of " Fantasy Island , " aka North Korea .

Arrrggh indeed . ) For me , it 's started out on a little less grand level .
it 's a combination of realizing what I can play at now , and what I would like to discard .

PRINCETON , NJ --
The states of the union differ remarkably from one another in terms of their residents ' religions .
Non-Catholic Christians -- the largest religious group in the country today -- are heavily concentrated in the South and nearby states , while constituting only a minority of residents of Northeastern states , and of many Middle Atlantic and Western states .
States that have lower percentages of non-Catholic Christians are proportionately much more heavily dominated by those of other religions , particularly Catholics , who are heavily represented in the Middle Atlantic and New England states .
Americans with no religious identity at all tend to be found most frequently in the Northeast and Northwest ( plus Hawaii ) , while members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints are most prevalent in Utah and surrounding states , and Jews in Mid-Atlantic states .
The accompanying maps give a portrait of this remarkable pattern of religious dispersion in the U.S. for these religious groups , based on a new analysis of more than 170,000 Gallup interviews conducted between January and June of this year .
A good deal of the religious dispersion across the states is explainable by historical immigration patterns -- particularly the impact of the large waves of European Catholics and Jews who came through ports of entry in the Middle Atlantic states in the 19th and early 20th centuries .
( The analysis does not include Muslims or other non-Christian religions due to small sample sizes . )
The geographic concentration of Mormons in and around Utah reflects the cross-country migration of that group in the mid-1800s from Illinois and other Eastern states to their new home .
The fact that certain states like Oregon and Vermont consist disproportionately of residents with no religious identity is more difficult to explain , with hypotheses focusing on the particular and idiosyncratic cultures of those states and / or the migration of certain types of Americans to those states over the decades .
Protestants / Other Non-Catholic Christians
The largest religious group in America is the 54 % of Americans who identify themselves as Protestants or who identify with a non-Catholic Christian religion .
There are significant differences in the distribution of this group of non-Catholic Christians across the states of the union .
In some states , the percentage of Protestants / other non-Catholic Christians rises to 80 % or higher .
In others , the percentage of those who are Catholic , some other religion , or no religion at all is so large that it drives down the percentage who are Protestant / other non-Catholic Christian to below one - third .
The proportion of non-Catholic Christians is clearly the highest in the traditional Bible Belt states of the South .
In fact , all of the top 10 states in terms of proportion of non-Catholic Christians are Southern or on the fringes of the South ; Mississippi and Alabama are at the top , with 81 % and 80 % Protestant / other Non-Catholic Christian , respectively .
The state with the lowest proportion of non-Catholic Christians is Utah .
As will be seen below , the large percentage of Utah residents who are Mormon reduces all other religious categories to low representations .
Other states that are low in terms of non-Catholic Christian representation are those with high percentages of Catholics , including Rhode Island , Massachusetts , Connecticut , New York , and New Jersey .
Catholics
About 24 % of all American adults identified as Catholic between January and June of this year .
The distribution of Catholics across the states is heavily skewed toward the New England and Mid-Atlantic states , the regions of the country through which the large waves of Catholic immigrants from Europe arrived in the 19th and 20th centuries .
The state with highest percentage Catholic is Rhode Island , at 53 % , followed by Massachusetts , Connecticut , New Jersey , and New York .
Two Midwestern states , Wisconsin and Illinois , are also in the top 10 states in terms of the percentage Catholic .
States with higher percentages of Hispanic residents , including California and New Mexico , are above average in the proportion of their residents who are Catholic .
Louisiana , home to immigrating French Canadians ( Cajuns ) several centuries ago , also has an above - average Catholic population .
The 10 states with the lowest percentages of Catholics are all in or close to the South , with the exception of Utah ( with its high concentration of Mormons ) .
Mississippi , with a 6 % Catholic population , has the lowest proportion of Catholics of any state .
Jews
About 2 % of American adults are Jewish , and the distribution of Jews across states is skewed toward Mid-Atlantic and New England states , as well as Florida and California .
New York has the highest percentage of Jewish residents , at 7 % .
This figure is for the entire state of New York ; the percentage Jewish in New York City is higher .
New York is followed by the District of Columbia and New Jersey , with 5 % to 6 % Jewish residents .
Other states with a 3 % or higher Jewish population are Massachusetts , Florida , Maryland , Rhode Island , California , and Connecticut .
A number of states have so few Jews that the estimate of the Jewish population rounds down to 0 % .
As one example , out of the 959 randomly selected adults Gallup interviewed in Montana from January to June of this year , none identified their religion as Jewish .
Latter - day Saints ( Mormons )
Mormons , who make up about 2 % of the U.S population , have the most extremely differentiated geographic pattern of any of the religious groups used in this analysis , with the highest concentrations , as would be expected , in and around the state of Utah .
Sixty - one percent of Utah residents interviewed by Gallup identified as Mormons .
Although this is by far the highest concentration of Mormons in any state , the fact that about 4 out of 10 Utah residents are not Mormon underscores that Utah has a more diverse religious population than has been the case in previous decades , and certainly in the 19th century , when Brigham Young brought his band of religious followers across the country to settle in the territory that later became Utah .
Idaho and Wyoming -- both contiguous to Utah -- have 19 % and 10 % Mormon populations , respectively , while two other states contiguous to Utah also have above - average percentages of Mormons -- Arizona at 6 % and Nevada at 5 % .
A number of states , mostly in the Midwest and East , have less than a 1 % Mormon population .
No Religious Identity
As was the case in a state - by - state analysis of the percentage of Americans saying religion is important in their daily lives , the states with the highest percentage of adult residents saying they have no religious identity are in the Northeast and the Northwest regions of the country .
Oregon tops the list , with 25 % of its residents claiming no particular religious identity , followed closely by Vermont at 24 % .
Other states with at least 20 % " no religion " are Washington , Alaska , New Hampshire , Hawaii , and Maine .
At the other end of the spectrum , the most religious states in the union , based on the lowest percentages of those saying they have no religion , are Mississippi , where only 6 % do not have a religion , followed by Alabama , Arkansas , North Dakota , and Louisiana .
Gallup.com 's " State of the States " series reveals state - by - state differences on political , economic , and wellbeing measures Gallup tracks each day , based on data collected between January and June 2009 .

New stories will be released throughout the month of August .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 178,543 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Jan.
2 - June 30 , 2009 , as part of Gallup Poll Daily tracking .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±1 percentage points .
The margin of sampling error for most states is ±3 percentage points , but is as high as ±7 percentage points for the District of Columbia , and ±6 percentage points for Wyoming , North Dakota , South Dakota , Delaware , and Hawaii .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

About the only lesson Barack Obama has learned from the Hillary and Bill health insurance debacle of 1993 - 1994 is to leave Michelle Obama out of his current drive to get something — anything — through the Congress labeled “ reform ” .
Otherwise , he is making the same mistakes of blurring his proposal , catering to right - wing Democrats and corporatist Republicans , who want an even mushier “ reform ” scam , and cutting deals with the drug , hospital , and health insurance industries .
His political opponents become bolder with each day as they see his party base in Congress weakening , his polls dropping , and a confused public being saturated with unrebutted propaganda by the insatiable profiteering , subsidized health care giants .
Their campaign - money - greased minions on Capitol Hill and the corporatist Think Tanks and columnists are seizing on President Obama ’s aversion to conflict and repeated willingness to water down what he will fight for .
The loud and cruel baying pack comes in the form of William Kristol ( “ This is not time to pull punches .
Go for the kill . ” ) , Senator Jim DeMint ( R - SC ) ( “ If we ’re able to stop Obama on this , it will be his Waterloo .
It will break him . ” ) , and Charles Krauthammer yammering wildly about medical malpractice and tort law .
Krauthammer does not substantiate his claims or mention the many victims of malpractice as he gleefully predicts “ Obamacare sinking . ”
All these critics have gold - plated health insurance , of course .
Hillary tried to appease the drug and hospital companies .
Obama invites them to the White House , where they presumably pledged to give up nearly $ 300 billion dollars over ten years without any specifics about how this complex assurance can be policed .
No matter , in return Obama and his aides agreed not to press Congress to authorize the federal government to negotiate drug prices with the drug industry .
Do n’t worry : the taxpayers will pay the bill .
At a meeting on July 7 at the White House between drug company executives , Obama ’s chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , and Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus ( D - MT ) , the industry , according to The New York Times , was promised that the final legislative package would not allow the reimportation of cheaper medicines from Canada or other countries even if they meet our drug safety standards .
Since these industry meetings at the White House are private , no one knows how many other concessions were made .
What is known is that Barack Obama knows better .
A former supporter of single payer health insurance ( often described as full Medicare for all with free choice of physician and hospital and the elimination of hundreds of billions of dollars of corporate administrative costs and billing fraud ) , then - Illinois state senator Barack Obama predicted , in 2003 , that it would be enacted once Congress and the White House were controlled by Democrats .
Well , that is now the situation , but , as President , he believes single payer is not “ practical ” .
Single payer health insurance is supported by a majority of the American people , majority of physicians and nurses , and nearly ninety members of the House of Representatives .
( See H.R. 676 and singlepayeraction.org . )
A clear replacement of the private health insurance companies with federal insurance , as Medicare for the elderly did in 1965 , allows for clear language .
Twenty thousand people die in America each year because they cannot afford health insurance , according to the Institute of Medicine .
Hundreds of thousands more suffer because they have no insurance to treat their diseases or injuries .
Single payer means everyone is covered from birth , as is the case now in every western nation .
Imagine no lives lost or suffering due to no health insurance .
Fuzzy proposals , regularly altered and over - complicated due to the hordes of avaricious corporate lobbyists , make politicians like Obama very susceptible to lurid descriptions and lies by his vocal , well - insured opponents .
Finally , the Obama people are using “ health insurance reform ” , rather than the misnomer “ health care reform ” which opened them up to charges that government would take over health care .
All proposals , including single payer , are based on private delivery of health care .
Now enters the well - insured libertarian Cato Institute with full - page ads in the Washington Post and The New York Times charging Obama with pursuing government - run health care .
A picture of Uncle Sam pointing under the headline “ Your New Doctor . ” Nonsense .
The well - insured people at Cato should know better than to declare that this “ government takeover ” would “ reduce health care quality . ”
About 100,000 lives are lost from medical - hospital negligence per year , according to the Harvard School of Public Health .
This vast tragedy is hardly going to get worse under universal government health insurance that assembles data patterns to reduce waste , enhances quality , and transparency .
By contrast , the secretive big health insurers who make more money the more they deny claims , ignore their loss prevention duties .
In 1950 , when President Truman sent a universal health insurance bill to Congress , the American Medical Association ( AMA ) launched what was then a massive counterattack .
The AMA claimed that government health insurance would lead to rationing of health care , higher prices , diminished choices and more bureaucracy .
The AMA beat both Truman and the unions that were backing the legislation , using the phrase “ socialized medicine ” to scare the people .
Fifty - nine years later , “ corporatized medicine ” has produced all these consequences , along with stripping away the medical profession ’s independence .
Today , the irony is that the corporate supremacists are accusing reformers in Washington of what they themselves have produced throughout the country .
Rationing , higher prices , less choice , and mounds of paperwork and corporate red tape .
Plus , fifty million people without any health insurance at all .
On Thursday , July 30 , 2009 , there will be a mass rally for a single payer system in Washington , DC .
It is time to put what most Americans want on the table .

The answer is both .
Technology is making life more convenient and enjoyable , and many of us healthier , wealthier , and wiser .
But it is also affecting work , family , and the economy in unpredictable ways , introducing new forms of tension and distraction , and posing new threats to the cohesion of our physical communities .
Despite the complicated and often contradictory implications of technology , the conventional wisdom is woefully simplistic .
Pundits , politicians , and self - appointed visionaries do us a disservice when they try to reduce these complexities to breathless tales of either high - tech doom or cyber-elation .
Such polarized thinking leads to dashed hopes and unnecessary anxiety , and prevents us from understanding our own culture .
Over the past few years , even as the debate over technology has been dominated by the louder voices at the extremes , a new , more balanced consensus has quietly taken shape .
This document seeks to articulate some of the shared beliefs behind that consensus , which we have come to call technorealism .
Technorealism demands that we think critically about the role that tools and interfaces play in human evolution and everyday life .
Integral to this perspective is our understanding that the current tide of technological transformation , while important and powerful , is actually a continuation of waves of change that have taken place throughout history .
Looking , for example , at the history of the automobile , television , or the telephone -- not just the devices but the institutions they became -- we see profound benefits as well as substantial costs .
Similarly , we anticipate mixed blessings from today 's emerging technologies , and expect to forever be on guard for unexpected consequences -- which must be addressed by thoughtful design and appropriate use .
As technorealists , we seek to expand the fertile middle ground between techno- utopianism and neo-Luddism .
We are technology " critics " in the same way , and for the same reasons , that others are food critics , art critics , or literary critics .
We can be passionately optimistic about some technologies , skeptical and disdainful of others .
Still , our goal is neither to champion nor dismiss technology , but rather to understand it and apply it in a manner more consistent with basic human values .
Below are some evolving basic principles that help explain technorealism .
PRINCIPLES OF TECHNOREALISM
1 . Technologies are not neutral .
A great misconception of our time is the idea that technologies are completely free of bias -- that because they are inanimate artifacts , they do n't promote certain kinds of behaviors over others .
In truth , technologies come loaded with both intended and unintended social , political , and economic leanings .
Every tool provides its users with a particular manner of seeing the world and specific ways of interacting with others .
It is important for each of us to consider the biases of various technologies and to seek out those that reflect our values and aspirations .
2 . The Internet is revolutionary , but not Utopian .
The Net is an extraordinary communications tool that provides a range of new opportunities for people , communities , businesses , and government .
Yet as cyberspace becomes more populated , it increasingly resembles society at large , in all its complexity .
For every empowering or enlightening aspect of the wired life , there will also be dimensions that are malicious , perverse , or rather ordinary .
3 . Government has an important role to play on the electronic frontier .
Contrary to some claims , cyberspace is not formally a place or jurisdiction separate from Earth .
While governments should respect the rules and customs that have arisen in cyberspace , and should not stifle this new world with inefficient regulation or censorship , it is foolish to say that the public has no sovereignty over what an errant citizen or fraudulent corporation does online .
As the representative of the people and the guardian of democratic values , the state has the right and responsibility to help integrate cyberspace and conventional society .
Technology standards and privacy issues , for example , are too important to be entrusted to the marketplace alone .
Competing software firms have little interest in preserving the open standards that are essential to a fully functioning interactive network .
Markets encourage innovation , but they do not necessarily insure the public interest .
4 . Information is not knowledge .
All around us , information is moving faster and becoming cheaper to acquire , and the benefits are manifest .
That said , the proliferation of data is also a serious challenge , requiring new measures of human discipline and skepticism .
We must not confuse the thrill of acquiring or distributing information quickly with the more daunting task of converting it into knowledge and wisdom .
Regardless of how advanced our computers become , we should never use them as a substitute for our own basic cognitive skills of awareness , perception , reasoning , and judgment .
5 . Wiring the schools will not save them .
The problems with America 's public schools -- disparate funding , social promotion , bloated class size , crumbling infrastructure , lack of standards -- have almost nothing to do with technology .
Consequently , no amount of technology will lead to the educational revolution prophesied by President Clinton and others .
The art of teaching cannot be replicated by computers , the Net , or by " distance learning . "
These tools can , of course , augment an already high - quality educational experience .
But to rely on them as any sort of panacea would be a costly mistake .
6 . Information wants to be protected .
It 's true that cyberspace and other recent developments are challenging our copyright laws and frameworks for protecting intellectual property .
The answer , though , is not to scrap existing statutes and principles .
Instead , we must update old laws and interpretations so that information receives roughly the same protection it did in the context of old media .
The goal is the same : to give authors sufficient control over their work so that they have an incentive to create , while maintaining the right of the public to make fair use of that information .
In neither context does information want " to be free . "
Rather , it needs to be protected .
7 . The public owns the airwaves ; the public should benefit from their use .
The recent digital spectrum giveaway to broadcasters underscores the corrupt and inefficient misuse of public resources in the arena of technology .
The citizenry should benefit and profit from the use of public frequencies , and should retain a portion of the spectrum for educational , cultural , and public access uses .
We should demand more for private use of public property .
8 . Understanding technology should be an essential component of global citizenship .
In a world driven by the flow of information , the interfaces -- and the underlying code -- that make information visible are becoming enormously powerful social forces .
Understanding their strengths and limitations , and even participating in the creation of better tools , should be an important part of being an involved citizen .
These tools affect our lives as much as laws do , and we should subject them to a similar democratic scrutiny .

Prázdniny , vysvědčení .
Doba vyhazování taháků a zapomínání všeho , co jsme se " nadrtili " zpaměti ...
Ne nadarmo se pak říká , že ze škol je nejd ůle žitější to , co nám zůstane v hlavě , když všechno zapomeneme .
Jak v takovém testu obstojí naše školy ?
Zejména ty střední a vysoké ?
Kdysi se vzdělanci učili nazpaměť třeba celé pasáže Bible .
Ale dnes je " doba paměti " za námi .
Kdybyste před patnácti roky k testu posadili profesora z Harvardu a průměrného patnáctiletého studenta , vyhrál by jistě ten vzdělanější a starší .
Tak tomu bylo od počátku civilizace až doposud .
Jenže pokud byste jim dnes k stejnému testu povolili přístup na internet , jist výsledkem bych si předem rozhodně nebyl .
Vzpomínám si , co mi kdysi dalo práce rozdiskutovat své vysoko školské studenty , kteří by přece měli být na učené disputace zvyklí .
Nebyli .
Deformace z mnohých středních a bohužel i vysokých škol ze studentů učinila zapisovače .
Přednášky tak často vypadaly jako ve středověku : předčítač ( který si říká kantor ) čte skripta bez přidání jediné kritické my šlenky a od skupiny zapisovačů ( kterým se říká studenti ) očekává stejně bezmy šlenkovité zanesení předčteného .
Kdo potom vše co nejvěrněji zopakuje , vyhrává od předčítače jedničku s hvězdičkou .
Kdo na vše rychle po zkoušce zapomene , má dokonce šanci uchytit se i ve skutečném životě .
Naopak na všech zahraničních školách , které jsem navštívil , jsme se chodili na přednášky a semináře pohádat , přít se a diskutovat .
Četlo se doma a před předná škou .
Studenti přece snad umí číst sami a profesoři přece umí psát a existují kopírky , tak proč ztrácet cenný čas , kdy jsme všichni pohromadě a můžeme debatovat ?
V Dánsku i Americe platilo , že kdo přečtený text dokázal kriticky rozšířit , dát do kontextu , aplikovat nebo naopak vyvrátit , vyhrává .
A podobná pravidla pak platila i pro zkoušky .
Studoval jsem paralelně českou i anglickou literaturu .
Anglická literatura se učila tak , že jsme každý týden ( ano ! ) přečetli jednu knihu ( na jeden předmět ! ) a na hodině jsme text rozebírali a kritizovali .
Vůbec nikoho nezajímalo , kdy kde umřel nebo se narodil Kafka či Camus ( dodnes to vlastně nevím a nezajímá mě to ) , ale zajímalo nás , proč napsali , co napsali , jak dosáhli kýženého dojmu .
Učili nás , jak psát kreativně , poutavě , jak využívat předností psaného textu .
Pak jsem přijel do Čech , nikoho nezajímalo , co jsem četl a jak hluboce jsem nad textem přemýšlel , zato po mně chtěli jména stovky autorů ( které nečetl ani kantor ) a počty knih , které napsali .
Místo krásné literatury tupé memorování .
A tak se stalo , že místo skutečné filozofie často přednášíme jen její dějiny .
Z ekonomie se často stává aplikovaná matematika , z fyziky souprava vzorečků , které je třeba si zapamatovat .
Proč ?
Protože se z toho dobře zkouší .
Prostě na absolvování vám u nás stačí tahák .
Proto jsou taháky tak pronásledovány .
Protože kus papíru nahradí kantora i se vším , co celý rok " předával " ... Pamatuju si , že v Dánsku problém s taháky nebyl : při zkouškách totiž byly často povolené klidně celé učebnice , proč by také ne ?
K čemu je mi memorace vzorečku , dat a jmen , když neznám souvislosti ?
Dějiny se " zkoušely " třeba takto : porovnejte příčiny vzniku první a druhé světové války .
Při psychologii se žádala interpretace snu .
Pochopiteln ě ani s jedním , ani s druhým vám tahák nepomůže , protože ani v jednom případě neexistuje jediná " správná " odpověď .
Chápu , že tento přístup u nás mnohé popuzuje , ale pokud se vše , co nás kantor naučil a co po nás chce , vejde na kousek papíru , je to pro naše školy smutné vysvědčení .
Instant - On is an attractive to have for any system , but most commercial OSs have n’t been able to accomplish this .
Users are generally left waiting the few minutes to boot , and for some people in a hurry , that ’s simply not good enough .
The aptly named program known as Presto is available for $ 19.95 , and is installable on most any Windows computers .
It installs a Xandros - based partition and boots up quite instantly .
“ Presto allows on - the - fly computing to check email , browse the web , chat with friends , make Skype calls , create documents , download media , apps and games , or enjoy music , videos , and movies stored in a user ’s Windows folders . ”
I ’d say that ’s worth $ 20 , and they ’re also offering to work with OEMs to get it on new computers on a mass scale .
Out there in West Texas , they know how to do things right .
Like spring surprise mayoral resignations .
The mayor of San Angelo , J.W. Lown , abruptly announced his resignation just days before he was to be sworn in for his fourth term as mayor , the San Angelo Standard Times reports .
Surprise Number One :
He made the announcement from Mexico , where he had suddenly bolted to .
Surprise Number
Two :
He was resigning because he is in a relationship with an illegal alien and they 're trying to fix the alien 's status .
Surprise Number Three : Both Lown and the Mexican citizen are guys .
As in HE'S GAY .
In San Angelo .
Lown is obviously a well - respected public servant :
He won the most recent re-election with 89 percent of the vote , and stunned city council members were effusive in their praise for his work .
But it 's also obvious they did n't know he was in the closet .
Lown told the paper he would come back to the city " if the people of San Angelo will welcome me back . "
Let 's hope they do .
It could be fascinating .
Some would be troubled by the illegal - alien thing , of course .
Some because he was helping someone he knew was illegal , and was mayor of the town while doing so .
Others might just hate the Messkins .
But the whole gay thing , in West Texas ?
Hard to say .
You would hope people would be open - minded , but then again we 've been to West Texas .
Boy , there 's a TV movie here for someone : Popular , young attractive mayor of a prairie town , torn by love , decides to go back to Mexico to help his partner get legal .
He has to give up a job he also loves ... and he has to come out .
J.W. Lown , get yourself an agent .
The consumer electronics scene in the U.S. is wonderful and horrible at the same time .
The devices , technologies and innovation are wonderful .
The provision of wireless access is horrible .
U.S. carriers are some of the most backward , unscrupulous and anti-customer companies in the nation .
So , carriers , this column 's for you .
Here 's what I hate about how you do business .
A recent survey by Nielsen found that low prices for wireless service is the No. 1 thing customers want from carriers .
Yet this is exactly what U.S. customers are n't getting .
According to a new survey from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , the U.S. is in the top three most expensive countries for wireless service worldwide ( Canada and Spain are the others ) .
According to the report , Americans pay an average of $ 635.85 per year for cell phone service ( compared with $ 131.44 per year in the Netherlands ) .
Why do Americans pay five times more for cell phone service than the Dutch ?
Dropped calls , lack of service , nonexistent coverage in many rural areas -- the inadequacies of U.S. wireless services are well known .
But what really irks mobile enthusiasts is the slow rollouts of new technologies .
The most bleeding - edge phones are rarely , if ever , sold in the U.S.
In Japan , people are routinely using 4G services , watching TV and using cell phones as credit cards .
If U.S. carriers are charging the most for service , why are we getting the least ?
Why are we always behind ?
Sure , you 've got a dozen excuses why the U.S. market can't support new technologies the way European and Asian markets do .
Making up excuses is something you 're really good at .
Providing new technology , not so much .
Like so many of your standard policies , the subsidizing of cell - phone handsets ( and increasingly netbooks and other mobile broadband devices ) is presented as a benefit , when it is , in fact , another way to get more money out of us .
If cell phones were n't subsidized , then we'd know how much we 're paying for the phone and how much we 're paying for wireless services .
With the subsidy , we have no idea .
You 'd probably pay $ 599 for a new iPhone 3GS with 16 GB of storage .
But for eligible customers who sign a new , two - year contract , the subsidized price is $ 199 .
Do you think AT&T spreads the $ 400 difference over the life of your contract ?
Or is it $ 600 ?
$ 800 ?
How much are you paying for that discounted phone ?
You wo n't and can't ever know .
Subsidies do n't save you money .
They cost you money .
The business model is to prevent you from knowing the price of your handset so you can't make an informed decision .
The truth is that the word " subsidy " does n't describe the pricing .
Nobody is subsidizing your phone .
A subsidy is when one organization -- say , the government -- provides money to another organization or person to encourage some form of behavior .
Some farmers , for example , get a subsidy from the government to grow certain types of crops .
Food stamps for the poor are a subsidy .
When you get a " discount " on your cell phone , YOU pay the difference , not the carrier , not the handset maker .
Sure , they 'll bury the costs in a muddled monthly bill .
But believe me , you 're the one paying .
Tehran ’s hard - line Revolutionary Court warned Sunday that those criticizing its ongoing proceedings against postelection protesters could face jail time themselves .
The threat came after a chorus of reformists and even some political conservatives labeled as a sham the televised court hearing Saturday of about 100 defendants arrested in the unrest that followed the disputed June 12 presidential election in which incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the winner .
Iran ’s main opposition figure and presidential candidate , Mir-Hossein Mousavi , two former presidents and a former commander of the Revolutionary Guard voiced strong criticism of the proceedings , in which prominent moderate politicians and others stand accused of conspiring with the West to foment weeks of unrest across Iran .
Mousavi said their confessions “ showed signs of medieval torture ” and he termed the trial a “ sham ” meant to distract attention from allegations of vote - rigging that continue to dog Ahmadinejad as his Wednesday inauguration to a second term nears .
Mousavi and many other prominent Iranian figures have vowed to skip the swearing - in ceremony .

Mousavi predicted the confessions would backfire .
“ Our people show sympathy to their children whose faces they saw after 50 days of no news , ” he said in a statement carried by his website , Ghalamnews.ir .
“ Do n’t worry at all , ” he added , addressing the prisoners .
“ You should know that our people understand you and they know that saving your life is the most significant matter now . ”
Defendants could face jail terms of 10 years if convicted .

The nation is bracing for further confrontations between security forces and supporters of Mousavi this week as supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and Iran ’s parliament confirm Ahmadinejad for a second term .
One of the country ’s main cellphone operators , Irancell , co-owned by South Africa ’s MTN , warned customers Sunday that it would be suffering unspecified “ technical ” problems over the next three days , which coincide with the anticipated unrest .
Iranian authorities have charged a number of former officials , journalists and scholars , including Iranian American social scientist Kian Tajbakhsh , of masterminding the protests .
The charges of acting against national security appear to rest largely on confessions extracted from suspects detained for weeks in solitary confinement without access to legal counsel or their families .
At least four defendants on Saturday implicated themselves in a conspiracy in long , rambling confessions that were aired on television Saturday and again on Sunday .
Former President Mohammad Khatami vehemently denounced the proceedings as a “ show trial ” in comments published on Baran.org.ir , the website of a charity he oversees .
Advertisement
“ Such confessions expressed under special circumstances lack any legal standing , ” he said in a meeting late Saturday .
“ The regime and nation were insulted , and what we heard in the show trial were repetitions of what we had already heard . . . [ from media ] . . . in violation of legal and religious norms . ”
Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , another former president who oversees two powerful government bodies , and former Revolutionary Guard commander Mohsen Rezai were also critical of the trial , prompting the Revolutionary Court to issue its warning .
“ People who give their views to online media and newspapers without having any information about legal affairs and seek to disturb public opinion by casting doubt on the trials should know that such acts amount to punishable offenses , ” the court said .
The unusual mass trial , which the pro-Ahmadinejad Fars news agency said would resume Thursday , appears to be outside the normal channels of Iranian justice .
Judiciary chief Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi has been silent about the proceedings , while some prominent hard - liners have condemned the airing of confessions as unconstitutional .
Advertisement
Critics said the indictment , prepared by the office of Tehran ’s prosecutor Saeed Mortazavi , at times read like editorials in the nation ’s most extreme newspapers , especially Kayhan , which on Sunday called for authorities to put both Khatami and Mousavi on trial on charges of acting against God , offenses that carry the death penalty in Iran .
Some lawmakers have already petitioned the judiciary to arrest both men .
The indictment says reformists now under arrest plotted for years to stage a revolution against the Islamic Republic with the help of Iran ’s Western rivals , and had long planned to accuse Ahmadinejad of cheating , regardless of the facts .
Mousavi and others quickly rejected such allegations .
An additional 10 suspects were tried behind closed doors Sunday , the semiofficial Iranian Students News Agency reported .
Many of the defendants have been behind bars since mid-June , when hundreds of thousands of Iranians poured into the streets to protest the election results .
Some were beaten or shot by security forces and pro-government Basiji militiamen .
Advertisement
The government has acknowledged that at least 30 people were killed in the unrest , but human rights groups and Western analysts say more than 100 have died , including several college students attacked in their dorms by pro-government militias .
Also among the dead is Mohsen Ruholamini , the son of an advisor to former Revolutionary Guard chief Rezai .
Ruholamini , whose friends say he was beaten in Evin Prison , died during a meningitis outbreak there .
In a letter published Sunday , Rezai called on the judiciary to prosecute the “ wayward elements ” who attacked the university dorms .
“ If such a trial is not held , no justice has been done and the Islamic regime of Iran will suffer another blow , ” the semiofficial Iranian Labor News Agency quoted the letter as reading .
“ Chain errors will go on and the society will never witness calm . ”

Special correspondent Ramin Mostaghim in Tehran contributed to this report .
Every night without fail , Jim Turner is there at the far corner of the bar , chain - smoking his Marlboros and sipping ice - cold San Miguel from the bottle , watching over the Little Ones .
He considers them family , but they ’re not his children .
They ’re the dwarfs and other little people the 70 - year - old Iowa native has rescued from the heartless streets of this capital city to offer them friendship and honest work .
For 35 years , the former Peace Corps volunteer has operated the Hobbit House , a bar themed on J.R.R .
Tolkien ’s fantasy novels , a realm marked by all things miniature .
Under his care , hundreds of dwarfs have adopted new cultural identities .
They ’re no longer shunned or even feared as supposed evil spirits , but have become popular characters called hobbits -- merry figures who serve drinks , crack ribald jokes and even entertain onstage .
Advertisement
At Turner ’s bar , on a dingy block of strip clubs and speak - easies in central Manila , the dwarfs draw a loyal crowd .
They ’re entertainers who get the joke , always ready to use their small size for a few good - natured laughs .
The Hobbit House features what may be the world ’s smallest Elvis impersonator .
There have been hobbit jugglers , comics , dancers , flame - eaters and a singer who sounded eerily like Frank Sinatra .
Many of the waiters and bartenders are the grandchildren of the dwarfs who helped Turner launch the bar .
There ’s now even a second location , at a tourist resort in the central Philippines .
Yet critics have accused Turner of exploiting his workers .
Stubbing out a Marlboro , he frowns .
Advertisement
“ We took many from the worst slums in Manila , where they were mocked and ridiculed , ” he says .
“ Now they ’re no longer carnival freaks .
They ’re respected entertainers and businesspeople . ”
And Turner is their godfather .
Workers tell of the night when two drunken Australians began playing catch with terrified little people ;
Turner stepped between two ruffians nearly twice his size and threw them out of the bar .
He has provided many of his workers with loans and housing and has paid tuitions .
Several years ago , he gave them something perhaps even more precious : the Hobbit House itself .
He founded a corporation , naming seven of his employees the main stockholders .
Now they make the decisions and call the shots .
From his perch at the bar , Turner watches over the business as a consultant and takes only enough salary to pay his bills .

The dwarfs call him tito and kuya , “ uncle ” and “ older brother . ”
Pidoy Fetalino , a 35 - year veteran of the bar , likes to stroll into business meetings , raise his hand to greet average - sized clients and proudly announce that he ’s the establishment ’s general manager .
Over drinks after the bar closes , he gets emotional about Turner , who has helped him put two children through college and discover self - respect .
“ He ’s our protector , a big man with a big heart , ” Fetalino says .
“ One day he said to us : ‘ This Hobbit House belongs to all of you .
You earned it . ’
A lot of us cried that day . ”

One afternoon , Turner sits on the street - side patio as colorful jeepneys race past , their horns blaring , seats filled with passengers .
An elderly dwarf limps in with two small men .
Naida Morehon retired from the Hobbit House two years ago when her knees gave out .
Her husband died last year and she needed money .
As always , Turner took care of things .
“ Hi , Naida , ” he says , lighting a cigarette .
“ Did you get the check ? ”

She hurries to embrace him .
Seated , Turner is face to face with Morehon , who places her small hand on his cheek .
“ I did , Tito , ” she says .
“ What would we do without you ? ”

A young idealist

Turner arrived in the Philippines in 1961 , a young idealist out to change the world .
Among the first group of Peace Corps volunteers in the country , he taught English for two years in a rural province , then moved back to Manila .
Slowly , he became consumed by this poor , exotic and often - maddening country .
He wanted to stay .
After years in Manila , Iowa seemed more like the foreign country .
He did odd jobs , eventually becoming a television station manager .
That ’s when he was introduced to his first dwarfs .
“ We ran a lot of variety shows where we cast midgets , dwarfs and transvestites , ” says Turner , a graying man with bushy eyebrows .
“ They were a staple of TV then . ”

In 1972 , then - President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law and shut down the station .
Turner needed work , so he and some friends came up with an idea for a theme bar .
He ’d read Tolkien ’s books as a boy in Cedar Rapids and knew that little people were easy to find in Manila .
His first stop was a business called Central Casting , where he hired two dwarfs to work as doormen .
Word got out and little people from all over the country began asking for work .
Soon Turner was overrun with little people .
They worked as waiters and bartenders and he built them miniature sets of stairs that they climbed to conduct business at the towering wooden bar .
But they soon wanted more :
They asked to entertain .
So Turner let them have the stage for vaudeville - type acts that featured little people as the big stars .
His first performer was a woman named Little Lucy , who ate fire and juggled , balanced on a fulcrum .

“ For a while , ” Turner recalls , “ everyone wanted to be an Elvis impersonator . ”
Often , life at the Hobbit House was surreal .
In one act , a dwarf dressed as a security guard patrolled with a Great Dane three times his size .
On New Year ’s Eve , some of the performers wear diapers and bonnets and carry rattles onstage to become tottering symbols of the infant year .
For a while , after an employee ’s uncle closed his pet store , monkeys roamed the bar .
There were parrots , turkeys , an eagle and even an alligator .
Turner eventually found homes for them too .

During martial law , the bar became the watering hole of the city ’s political subversives : anti-Marcos reactionaries , U.S. spies , protesters on the run from the law .
In the mid-1970s , when Francis Ford Coppola filmed “ Apocalypse Now ” in the Philippines , the Hobbit House was a regular hangout for the director , actors and crew , Turner says , doing his impersonation of Marlon Brando shouting for another drink .
Over the years , he learned that not all of the hobbits were fairy - tale characters .
He had to fire some who stole from the till .
But Turner quickly recognized the ones he could trust .
They are people like Fetalino .
He started as a cashier , but when Turner heard he ’d had two years of college , he sent Fetalino for management training .
He ’s been general manager for 15 years .

“ You see the hurdles they scale , ” Turner says , “ and you realize that no matter how many problems you have , if you ’re average size in this world , you ’ve got the game half - won . ”

Life without Jim
The Monday rush is here and the workers at the Hobbit House are ready for action .

But sitting around a table , a few quietly voice a common concern :
What would they ever do without the nurturing and guidance of Jim Turner ?
Although he swears he ’s in perfect health , they know he drinks and smokes too much .
A decade ago , when he got sick , a large group of employees went to visit him in the hospital .
An exhausted Turner had to tell nurses not to admit any visitor less than 4 feet tall .
Many say it gives them comfort knowing he ’s there at his perch , with a green lamp by his side so he can see bills and paperwork in the darkened bar .
But they know he ’s getting older and more frail .

[ Haskell - cafe ] ANN : Elerea version 1.x.x
Hi all , Having taken a short break from my profiling project , I updated my little FRP library called Elerea [ 1 ] along with the runnable example programs [ 2 ] .
The interface was changed into a monadic - applicative hybrid that distinguishes stateful and stateless combinators for safety reasons .
Since this is a major change , this release bears a new major version number .
Most importantly , the latcher was removed due to various practical issues , and it is replaced by much better behaved stateless higher - order constructs .
The library is capable of handling arbitrary higher - order signals , e.g. dynamic collections of signals , as shown by the renewed breakout example ( which used to cheat so far by treating the state of the brick collection as a single value ) .
I intend to write some tutorials later , but feel free to experiment until then .

Six days ago , a Pakistani journalist on the run from Taliban militants landed in the United States holding a valuable key to sanctuary : a visa granting him the right to work for the Voice of America radio service for one year .
But today Rahman Bunairee is in an immigration lockup in Virginia after being detained upon his arrival at Dulles International Airport .
“ We are concerned and upset ” about the detention , said Joan Mower , a spokeswoman for the VOA , which is funded by the U.S. government .
“ We are trying to find out what happened and working to get it resolved with other government agencies . ”
Advocates expressed disbelief at the predicament facing Bunairee , whose reports on Pakistani television and the Voice of America made him a target for the Taliban .
Militants blew up his house and threatened him in recent months , according to officials at the government news service and the Committee to Protect Journalists , a press freedom group based in New York .

“ His employer arranged to bring him to Washington so that he could continue his journalism in relative safety , ” said Bob Dietz of the Committee to Protect Journalists , who met with Bunairee in Pakistan in July .
“ U.S. authorities must explain why they are holding a journalist with a valid U.S. visa and release him immediately . ”
Privacy laws prevent officials from discussing the case , said Kelly Nantel , a spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement .
“ Due to confidentiality and policies to protect the rights of certain non-citizens and non-nationals of the United States , ICE generally refrains from public comment , ” she said .
“ Our obligation to ensure the safety of the individual and the integrity of the process has to come first , before rumor and rhetoric . ”
The explanation for the detention of the 33 - year - old journalist may turn out to be simple .
But for the moment it is a mystery , with the extra twist that he came here to work for a U.S. government agency .
Depending on what he told inspectors at the airport , officials may have concluded he was seeking political asylum or was a potential political refugee .
In such a case , they would detain the traveler in order to evaluate his potential case for asylum and determine whether he misrepresented his reasons for travel , according to experts on immigration law .

Bunairee ’s advocates doubt he would have requested asylum .
The journalist left his wife and four children behind in Pakistan .
He wanted to return home , hoping that after a year the danger would have subsided , Dietz said .
“ He gave no indication that he wanted to get out for good , that he was going to try to stay in the U.S. , ” Dietz said .
“ He did n’t want to separate from his family . ”
The U.S. embassy in Islamabad granted Bunairee a J - 1 visa for him to work in Washington for the Voice of America ’s Deewa Radio , which broadcasts in the Pashto language to the Pakistani - Afghan border region .
He had worked as a stringer for the radio network since 2006 , in addition to reporting as a Karachi - based correspondent for Pakistan ’s Khyber Television .
Bunairee ’s reporting brought him frequently to his native Buner province in northwest Pakistan , a region that has been the scene of combat during the last year .

Two days after Bunairee appeared on a talk show in July , armed men went to his home in Buner , ordered 11 of his relatives to leave and blew up the house .
Bunairee moved his family to Karachi , but the threats and danger persisted .
There were incidents in which gunmen climbed the wall of his bureau in Karachi when he was not there , Dietz said .
“ I saw him in Islamabad in late July , and he was staying in a guest house and maintaining a very low profile , ” Dietz said .
“ You could say he was in hiding .
He was trying to figure out what to do . ”

Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment have teamed up for a 3D CG animated adaptation of Dr. Seuss 's The Lorax .
According to Variety , the feature will be co-directed by Chris Renaud and Cinco Paul & Ken Daurio , with Paul & Daurio writing the script .
Though published in 1971 , The Lorax has a timely " green " theme .
It is narrated by a greedy entrepreneur who , despite warnings from the tree - loving Lorax , strips a forest of its stock of Truffula trees to manufacture clothing .
The results are catastrophic as all the animals leave and nothing 's left .
The picture is targeted for a March 2 , 2012 , release , which falls on the birthday of Theodor Geisel , who died in 1991 .
Nominal Size Outside Diameter Inside Diameter 1/4 " .375 " .315 " 3/8 " .500 " .430 " 1/2 " .625 " .545 " 5/8 " .750 " . 667 " 3/4 " . 875 " 785 " 1 " 1.125 " 1.025 " 1 - 1/4 " 1.375 " 1.265 " 1 - 1/2 " 1.625 " 1.505 " 2 " 2.125 " 1.985 "
If you have any doubt about the pipe size take a piece with you to the home center and match it up .
3. ) Measure carefully to determine how much new pipe you will need .
It is not recommended that you use the old fittings ( elbows , shut - off valve , etc. ) so measure beyond those fittings .
You cut the pipe to length when you get it and the new fittings home and are ready to install them .
4. ) Now that you have all the required fittings , pipe , tools , and other supplies close at hand you are ready to begin .
At this point , you need to shut off the water supply to your home because you will be removing the old cold - water shutoff valve at the heater location .
Once the water supply is shut off place a bucket under the valve to catch the water remaining in the pipe .
You do not need to disassemble this valve because you will not be reusing it .
5. ) Using your propane torch , heat the feed side of the old valve while grasping it with a pair of Channel Lock pliers .
Apply the heat evenly by moving the flame all around the valve .
When the old solder melts twist the valve with the pliers breaking it free , and then pull it off the pipe .
Using a wire brush brush as much of the old solder as possible from the pipe while the solder is still in a molten state .
Soldering copper tubing and pipe is as much an art form as it is a skill but it is an art form that anyone can master with a little patience and practice .
Although you can learn to solder copper pie successfully in as little as an hour or two , practice , practice , practice makes the job go quicker .
Preparation the cutting and dry fitting of all the copper pipe and fittings before you soldier the first joint is the first key to doing the job successfully the first time .
Before I get into cutting and dry fitting the systems components , let us discuss the tools and materials that you will need to do this job .
1. )
Measuring tape .
A 25 - foot locking tape is a good tape to start with .
2 . ) Plumberâ€™s torch .
A propane torch with an electric start head is a good choice .
3 . ) Tubing cutters .
One standard size cutter and one for working in close quarters .
4 . ) A hacksaw 5 . ) A tubing brush 6 . ) Flux brushes 7 . ) Channel Lock pliers .
Channel Lock is the is a brand name and trade name for tongue and groove pliers .
8 . ) Screwdrivers1. )
Lead - free plumberâ€™s solder 2 . )
Paste soldering flux 3 . ) Emery cloth 4 . ) BernzOmatic Heat Cloth 5 . ) Rags1 . )
Copper pipe ( Type and size determined by job ) .
2 . ) Copper fittings ( Type and size determined by job ) .
Every plumbing project that you undertake will require different materials but the procedure for working with them will be the same .
For this basic tutorial , we will be replacing an older , electric hot water heater with new , energy efficient one .
1. )
Shut off the branch circuit breaker feeding the heater .
2 . ) Using a non-contact circuit checker , verify that the circuit has been shut off .
3 . ) Disconnect the wires at the hot water heater .
4 . ) Shut off the water inlet valve .
5 . ) Open all the cold water taps throughout the house and then drain the tank .
Connect a garden hose to the drain valve and drain it in a laundry sink or some other appropriate area .
6 . ) Once the tank has drained completely , allowing time for the water in the cold water pipes to drain back into the tank , cut the copper pipes as near the top of the tank as possible .
7 . ) Remove the old tank and store for proper disposal .
1. )
Place the unit in position .
The first thing that you notice is that the new unit is several inches shorter than the old one was so we are going to have to extend the hot and cold water lines .
Letâ€™s begin .
2 . ) Measure the diameter of the old copper pipe .
The copper pipes attached to the hot water heater will be either Ð…â€ or Ñ•â€ in diameter .
As you can see from this chart , Ð…â€ and Ñ•â€ are nominal sizes and the actual size varies considerably .
6. )
Repeat this procedure to remove the old elbow from the hot water line feeding the house .
Remember you are replacing this elbow with a new elbow .
Reusing old copper fitting is asking for trouble .
7 . ) While the pipes are cooling off , disassemble the new valve .
Never sweat solder a valve without first removing its guts because the intense heat will destroy valve washers and packing .
7 . ) Using a piece of emery cloth , clean the outside of the old pipes until a bright copper finish appears .
Make sure the cleaned area extends at least Ð…â€ beyond the end of the fitting after it is slid over the end of the piped .
Solder , no matter how much flux you use , will not bond properly to dirty copper .
Remember , if there are leaks and you have to remove a fitting to redo the joint , you will have to use another new fitting and thatâ€™s wasted money .
8 . ) Slip the new valve body and elbow in place .
9 . ) Measure and cut two lengths of copper pipe so they fit snugly between the fittings on the hot water heater tank and the elbow and the shutoff valve .
By snugly , I mean that the pipe is fully seated in both fittings .
This is called dry fitting the pipe and fittings .
10 . ) Once everything fits together properly , disassemble them .
Clean the inside of the valve inlet and outlet with a wire brush .
Do the same for the fittings on the tank and with the elbow .
Now we are ready to reassemble and solder .
We will begin with the feed side .
11 . ) Using a flux brush , apply a thin coating of flux to the outside of the pipes and to the inside of the pipe fittings .
The flux not only assures a good bond between the copper pipe and the solder , it prevents the copper from oxidizing when heated .
Oxidation makes for a very bad bond between the solder and the copper if it bonds at all .
Remember a bad bond mean a leaky joint .
12 . ) Reassembled the fluxed pipe and fittings .
13 . ) Now apply heat to the pipe and fitting .
Position your torch so that the tip of the light blue inner flame just touches the pipe .
This part of the flame is the hottest and will bring the pipe and fitting to soldering temperature .
Watch the flame touching the pipe on the side away from the torch , when it turns green the pipes has reached soldering temperature .
Now remove the heat and apply solder to both ends of the fitting .
If the joint was properly heated , the solder will flow evenly into the joint by capillary action .
14 . ) For a professional appearing joint , wipe the still hot joint with a wet cloth .
15 . ) Repeat steps 11 through 14 for the hot water discharge side of the tank .
16 . ) Once the pipes are cool to the touch .
Reassemble the shutoff valve , close the valve , close all the water taps that you had opened earlier , and then reopen the shutoff valve on the main water supply .
17 . ) Open the tank valve and check for leaks .
No leaks !
Great job !
18 . ) Wait .
Weâ€ ™re not done yet .
Reconnect the electrical feed and turn on the CB ( Circuit Breaker ) .
Now we are done .

A composite image of 50 men from the sample , showing the mapping points
Men with symmetrical faces are less likely to lose their memory and intelligence in later life , according to researchers .
Psychologists at the University of Edinburgh found a link between facial symmetry and mental performance between the ages of 79 and 83 .
The researchers analysed results of the 1932 Scottish Mental Survey and mapped the faces of subjects from photographs .
They said it could show a link between physical condition and mental decline .
Facial symmetry , the researchers argued , may indicate a man has experienced fewer genetic and environmental disturbances such as diseases , toxins , malnutrition or genetic mutations during his development .
Dr Lars Penke , who led the study , said : " Previous research has suggested that cognitive decline is an aspect of body - wide ageing .
This link could show that facial symmetry can be used as a marker which could predict this decline . "
The team was unable to find comparable results in women .
One explanation suggested by the researchers was that DNA has a different effect on ageing among women .
Another theory was that mental decline is delayed in women because , on average , they live longer .
The results of the study have been published in the journal Evolution and Human Behaviour .

Mitch was the best .
I was going through much stress being hurt and basically unloved by my employer .
He was always there when I needed his help .
He always called me back if he was in court .
He was humorous sometimes and that aleved alot of anxiety .
I was satisfied with his suggestions and guidance .
Very professional .
He always was able to explain things to me and was very nice .
He also obtained a very nice settlement for me .
Thank you Mitch .
Try to buy an Atom - based mobile Internet device ( MID ) or ultramobile PC ( UMPC ) .
Seriously , try Froogle or Pricegrabber and see if you can find an Atom - based MID or UMPC in stock anywhere .
Without some serious digging , you 're going to come up empty - handed , and this is true even for MIDs like the Archos 9 that were hyped in blog posts by gadget enthusiasts .
As it stands in 2009 , the much - ballyhooed MID / UMPC form factor is a total flop , despite the fact that Intel has been touting it as a core part of its mobile vision since 2007 .
Ars teamed up with retail channel data provider Dynamite Data to do an availability check across the online retail space for Atom - based MIDs and UMPCs .
We went through a " MID Purchasing Guide " that Intel gave us and came up with very little to show for it , which suggests what many have suspected all along : the MID / UMPC is a solution looking for a problem .
Chapter I : The ghost page
But before we get to the data , take a look at the page that prompted this investigation .
It 's Intel 's list of MID / UMPC products intended to showcase what the company 's technology can do .
But if you wanted to buy any of those products , you'd be out of luck , because everything there is based on Intel 's old McCaslin platform ( pre- Atom ) and is out of production .
So the MID is such a low priority at Intel that the company has n't even updated this page .
Ars spoke to Intel Mobility Group VP Shane Wall , and sprung this ghost page on him .
He was a little surprised to see that it was so out - of - date , and said he'd get right with marketing to get it updated .
We then told him that we had been looking everywhere for an Atom - based MID or UMPC in the channel , but had come up empty handed .
Our Google - fu is pretty strong , and we had come up with nothing .
Wall assured us that the MID , which is a form factor that includes the UMPC but that also includes portable media players and a range of other mobile , Internet - connected devices , is still a priority for Intel .
" MIDs are very much alive and well , " said Walls , " and are still are very central to our strategy in the mobile handheld space .
And we have a roadmap that certainly goes beyond 2012 . "
Intel 's current MID platform is Menlow , which is also the platform used in netbooks .
So from a hardware perspective , a MID is essentially a more expensive netbook that comes with no keyboard ( and that 's probably a big part of the problem ) .
Walls told us that Intel has over twenty currently shipping MIDs in the US , Europe , and Asia - Pacific .
So we asked Walls if he could get us a list of them .
A day later , the list arrived , and I went shopping .
Chapter II : the search
Intel 's " MID Purchasing Guide " was all of two slides , and for the US MIDs , here 's the complete list :
Archos : 9 " Tablet
Clarion : MiND
Fujitsu : U820
Panasonic : U1 Toughbook , H1 Toughbook
UMID : m1
Yukyung Viliv : S5 , X70EX
There were a few more products listed for other regions , many marked as " coming soon . "
We sent the guide over to Kristopher Kubicki , the lead tech guy at Dynamite Data , and he ran channel availability and price checks on all of the items — or , the ones that he could find , at least .
Most companies that monitor the retail channel use surveys to gather their pricing and availability data , but Dynamite Data actually spiders the product webpages of a long list of e-tailers and scrapes the information from them .
This lets the company track price and availability info in real time , so the data that Kris sent back today is up - to - the - minute .
The Archos 9 " tablet is not yet on the market , despite the fact that the gadget press has been drooling over it since the start of this year .
Recent rumors put the UK launch date in October , but nobody knows when ( or if ) it will hit US shores .
The Clarion MiND is an interesting case , because 23 retailers list it in stock , but the price varies wildly from just over $ 200 to over $ 600 .
As with every other asset in the world ( stocks , real estate , etc. ) such severe price volatility indicates low volumes .
" When we see channel pricing all over the place that indicates that it 's not moving , " Kris told Ars .
Such price swings also suggest that the device may be near the end of its life , so the manufacturer just is n't putting any more of them into the channel .
The Fujitsu LifeBook U820 had the second best showing , in stock at 63 out of 77 retailers .
But the retailers where it was listed as out - of - stock or discontinued included names like Amazon , Newegg , and Buy.com .
Importantly , the U820 does n't really qualify as a MID , since it 's actually a netbook with a rotating touchscreen that can be used in tablet mode .
The Panasonic U1 Toughbooks were the clear winner in our Menlow MID channel availability contest : in stock at 97 of 130 locations .
The Toughbook H1 was pretty much absent from the channel , listed as out - of - stock at a number of outlets .
The UMID m1 and Yukyung Viliv are available only at Dynamism , which is a specialty importer .
So they 're absent from the normal US retail channel .
What all of this means is that if you want to get your hands on an actual Atom - based tablet MID — and not just a netbook that can transform into a tablet — then the $ 2,500 to $ 3,000 Toughbook U1 is your only option .
Ouch .
Chapter III : the future ( ? )
Intel 's official line is that the MID is a work - in - progress , and that they 're pleased with the results so far .
" In terms of design wins , " Intel 's Walls said , " it 's what we had hoped it would be at this point .
And in terms of volume it 's above what are internal targets are . "
Regardless of where Intel has set the bar internally , the retail channel situation makes it clear that the MID is an idea whose time has not yet come .
But Intel still claims to be convinced that the MID will soon have its moment .
The MID was name - checked at the recent Intel Technology Summit as one of Intel 's main mobile market segments , and Walls made a valiant effort to get us to look not at where the MID is , but at where it 's headed with the upcoming Moorestown platform .
" Where are we in the MID story ?
We 're in the beginning of that .
The initial class of devices that we could address are UMPC , the next class is dedicated media and gaming machines .
The next is the smartphone space , where the volume is at . "
Excuse us , but did he say gaming ?
We pressed him on it , but all Walls would say is that Intel has no products that he would preannounce .
But , he quickly amended , " the full Internet " includes online games , which are flash - based .
( There 's that " full Internet == Adobe Flash " thing again .
Intel had better milk this before the ARM port is done . )
Walls told us that in - browser , flash - based gaming is taking off in Korea and China .
We were happy to take his word for that and move on , because we really wanted to hear more about this idea of a Moorestown - based mobile gaming device .
" Obviously we have a pretty good graphics part in there that we could take advantage of , and over time we 'll see people taking advantage of that weith specialized devices that will emphasize gaming , " Walls said .
So there you have it : Intel expects that at some point , someone will make an Intel - based gaming portable .
And maybe they 're right , but the real question is , will anyone actually be able to buy one ?
Gills Onions , which both grows the eponymous crop and claims to operate the largest onion processing facility in the US , does n't do things on a small scale .
The cost of removing the onion waste left over after packaging was costing it over $ 400,000 a year , so the company looked for a way to reduce or eliminate that waste .
Through a partnership with the Southern California Gas Company , Gills eventually found a way to turn this waste stream into 600 kw of electricity .
We talked with Hal Snyder , the VP of Customer Solutions for SoCalGas , to get the details on this project .
Snyder said that Gills had a history of working with SoCalGas on energy efficiency work , and the collaboration on this project was an extension of that relationship .
The onion waste — the tops , bottoms , and skins left over after an onion is cut for packaging — provided a tempting target .
" Any organic material has the potential for creating energy , " as Snyder put it .
The initial thought was that all of the onion could be processed for fuel , but cellulose bioreactors are still very much at the developmental stage .
But the onion waste contains a significant amount of material that 's not cellulose , and squeezing it can release a liquid that Snyder called a complex mix of sugars and lipids ; the remaining cellulose is being evaluated for its potential as fertilizer or cattle feed .
The onion juice , however , has already found a use — in a 150,000 gallon ( 550,000l ) anaerobic bioreactor , where it serves as food for a type of archaebacteria called a methanogen .
These organisms thrive in the absence of oxygen , and the waste product of their metabolic use of carbohydrates and lipids is implied by their name : methane .
Given a constant flow of onion juice , the archaebacterial population is largely self - sustaining ; Snyder said the original stock came from a similar Anheuser - Busch project .
The organisms themselves provide some of the heat needed to keep the bioreactor running at an optimal temperature , and Gills uses waste heat from a natural gas burner to provide the rest .
The bacteria produce some waste , but Gills is working with people at the University of California , San Diego to see if it has some value as fertilizer ; it may ultimately be returned to the onion fields .
But the key byproduct of the archaebacteria is the methane , which constitutes about 75 percent of the gas coming off the bioreactor ( which is a pretty high ratio , as these projects go ) .
It gets fed to a pair of 300 kw fuel cells , which convert it directly to energy .
( Based on the size and manufacturer , these appear to be the hardware in question . )
All told , the setup saves Gills about $ 700,000 of energy costs a year ; combined with the reduced disposal costs , the setup is saving the company over a million dollars a year .
That said , the setup is n't cheap , since it includes a lot of customized equipment , and the up - front costs were in the neighborhood of $ 9 million .
But SoCalGas participates in a state - mandated self - generation credit program that will contribute a total of $ 2.7 million to the project , cutting the payback time to only six years .
" Right now , it takes subsidies and support because this is emerging technology , " Snyder said .
" The technology exists , but it 's about scale , size , and number of projects .
It 's just not at the scale where prices are declining yet , but it will be .
Any organic waste , I think , will work with this process . "
He mentioned that SoCalGas is looking into other wastewater streams as potential power sources ; he specifically mentioned a carrot processing facility that might have a profile very similar to Gills ' .
We asked Snyder about the fact that many landfills are now being used to produce natural gas — the Gills project is essentially diverting some of that potential fuel source upstream .
He suggested that figuring out what makes sense requires a careful analysis of the costs of transporting waste , the quality of the raw materials , etc .
But the new focus on sustainability and domestic supplies of energy is ensuring that these sorts of analyses are actually getting done .
" It 's an exciting time to be in the energy business , " he said .

In 2002 , Kianna Karnes , a forty - one - year - old nurse and mother of four in Brownsburg , Indiana , was given a diagnosis of kidney cancer .
She had surgery to remove the tumor , but a year later the cancer spread to her bones .
Karnes ’s doctors treated her with interleukin - 2 , a protein that stimulates the immune system and , in its synthetic form , was the only medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use against kidney cancer .
The drug causes high fevers and the accumulation of fluid in the lungs , and it shrinks tumors in only fifteen per cent of cases .
“ High - dose interleukin - 2 damn near killed her , ” Karnes ’s father , John Rowe , recalled recently .
“ It ’s a brutal treatment , but her husband pushed her pretty hard , because he did n’t want to lose her . ”
Karnes did not improve on interleukin - 2 , and Rowe began to look into experimental therapies .
Four years earlier , he , too , had received a diagnosis of a life - threatening cancer , chronic myelogenous leukemia , for which there were few effective treatments .
He had found the Web site of a man from South Carolina with leukemia , who had enrolled in a clinical trial of an experimental drug , now called Gleevec , and had experienced a remarkable remission .
Rowe learned about a trial comparing Gleevec with interferon , then the standard therapy for his illness , and asked his doctor to help him apply .
He was the last patient to be admitted .
“ Luckily , I got the good stuff , ” he told me , referring to Gleevec .
His cancer has been in remission for five years .
While Rowe was recovering , he worked on Capitol Hill , in the office of Dan Burton , a Republican congressman from Indiana , who chaired the House Government Reform Committee .
He became friendly with Frank Burroughs , whose daughter Abigail had died of a head - and - neck cancer at the age of twenty - one , after being denied admission to a clinical trial for a drug that might have helped her .
After her death , Burroughs founded the Abigail Alliance , an advocacy group that seeks to make experimental drugs — commonly defined as drugs that are being tested by a pharmaceutical company and have yet to be approved or rejected by the F.D.A. — available to people with terminal illnesses .
In 2004 , Rowe learned from the Abigail Alliance that Pfizer and Bayer had each developed a drug for kidney cancer and were conducting clinical trials .
But , while he was trying to enroll Kianna in a trial , she learned that her cancer had spread to her brain .
Surgeons removed the tumors , but a history of brain cancer almost always disqualifies a patient from participating in a trial .
Such patients are prone to seizures , and it can be difficult to distinguish symptoms caused by an experimental therapy from those caused by the illness it is supposed to be treating .
Rowe tried to obtain one of the drugs through a provision in F.D.A. regulations known as “ compassionate use , ” which allows pharmaceutical companies , with the agency ’s permission , to release an experimental drug to a patient who is not enrolled in a clinical trial .
With the help of the Abigail Alliance he contacted Pfizer and Bayer to discuss compassionate use , but he made little headway .
“ By this time , we were way down the road , and Kianna was in dire straits , ” Rowe said .
“ So I finally asked Congressman Burton for help . ”
Burton told a staff member to look into Karnes ’s case , and , in March , 2005 , Rowe got a call from Robert Pollock , a journalist on the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal , who had been writing about the efforts of politicians in Congress to prevent the husband of Terri Schiavo , the brain - dead Florida woman , from removing her feeding tube .
“ I think if the Congress can pass a law for Terri Schiavo , a single person , that ’s O.K. , ” Pollock told Rowe .
“ But there are a lot of people like your daughter .
And I think Congress should pass a law to help all of them . ”
On March 24th , the Journal published an editorial titled “ How About a ‘ Kianna ’s Law ’ ? , ” urging Congress to pass legislation requiring the F.D.A. to grant dying patients access to experimental drugs .
That morning , Burton ’s office contacted Pfizer and Bayer , as well as the F.D.A .
In the afternoon , an F.D.A. official called Rowe and told him that if either of the companies submitted an application for compassionate use on Karnes ’s behalf the agency would approve it .
A couple of hours later , Kianna ’s doctor heard from representatives of Pfizer and Bayer , offering to prepare applications for Karnes .
“ At nine - forty - one that same night , Kianna died , ” Rowe told me .
“ Just like Abigail .
Too little , too late . ”
By January , both experimental drugs had been approved by the F.D.A. for use against advanced kidney cancer .
“ Here is a case where her old man understood about clinical trials , ” Rowe said .
“ I knew about compassionate use ; I had a friendship with a powerful member of Congress ; I ’ve got the Wall Street Journal behind me .
But I still could n’t save her life .
Now , what about the thousands of people out there who do n’t have these kinds of resources available to them ?
I do n’t know that either of these drugs would have saved Kianna ’s life .
But would n’t it have been nice to give her a chance ? ”
Families of seriously ill patients are understandably consumed by a desire to help , and stories about unexpected recoveries inspire hope that an experimental drug might prove to be lifesaving ; it ’s possible that Abigail Burroughs and Kianna Karnes would now be alive had they been able to take one .
Yet a similar impulse — to protect patients ’ lives — lies behind F.D.A. regulations restricting access to such drugs .
Guaranteeing drug safety has been part of the agency ’s mandate since 1938 , when Congress passed the Federal Food , Drug , and Cosmetic
Act after more than a hundred people died from taking a medicine for strep throat which contained diethylene glycol , an active ingredient in antifreeze .
Today , the vast majority of patients with life - threatening diseases are treated with drugs that have been approved by the F.D.A. after a stringent evaluation process designed to insure that they are safe and effective .
It typically takes a pharmaceutical company six and a half years from the time it discovers a promising molecule to gather enough data to apply to the F.D.A. for permission to test a drug on patients .
Completing the clinical trials requires , on average , another seven years : an initial set ( Phase I ) , usually involving fewer than a hundred patients , to determine the maximum tolerated dose and likely side effects ; a second set ( Phase II ) , involving several hundred patients , to identify the diseases — or stages of a disease — that are affected by the experimental therapy ; and a final set ( Phase III ) , in which the drug is given to several thousand patients and compared with another drug that has already been approved by the F.D.A. , or with a placebo .
After the trials , the F.D.A. reviews the results and , usually in consultation with an advisory panel of experts , decides whether to approve an experimental drug .
Drug companies pay most of the costs for clinical trials , and by the time a drug reaches the market the manufacturer will have spent nearly a billion dollars on its development .
Nearly ninety per cent of drugs that enter Phase I trials are eventually abandoned because they are shown to be unsafe or ineffective .
( Last week , Pfizer announced that it was cancelling its Phase III trial of torcetrapib , an experimental drug for heart disease , after eighty - two patients in the study died .
Pfizer had spent almost a billion dollars on torcetrapib , which had shown exceptional promise in earlier trials .
“ This drug , if it worked , would probably have been the largest - selling pharmaceutical in history , ” Steven E. Nissen , the chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic , told the Times . )
In the past decade , the number of new drugs approved by the F.D.A. has fallen sharply .
According to a recent article in the Journal of the American Medical Association , between 1994 and 1997 the agency approved an average of nearly thirty - six new drugs a year , but between 2001 and 2004 the approval rate averaged just twenty - three a year .
The Bush Administration , seeking to reverse this trend , has appointed new leaders to the F.D.A. , including Andrew von Eschenbach , the recently confirmed commissioner , who is a cancer specialist from Houston and a close friend of the Bush family ; and Scott Gottlieb , the deputy commissioner for medical and scientific affairs , who , as a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute , published frequent editorials arguing for a more flexible approach to drug approval , particularly for cancer drugs .
“ The FDA is trying to save patients from the harmful effects of new medicines that have n’t fully proved their mettle , ” Gottlieb wrote in an Op - Ed piece in the Oklahoman , in May , 2005 .
“ In the process , many more patients will die waiting for the good medicines than from using bad ones . ”
At the same time , the Abigail Alliance , which shares this view , has gained political influence .
In November , 2005 , Senator Sam Brownback , a Republican from Kansas , who survived melanoma and is the co-chair of the Senate Cancer Caucus , introduced a bill that would compel the F.D.A. to make experimental drugs available to seriously ill patients who have exhausted standard treatments .
Brownback , who had met with Frank Burroughs and read about Kianna Karnes in the Wall Street Journal , called the bill “ Kianna ’s Law . ”
Six months later , the Abigail Alliance won its first victory in court against the F.D.A. , when the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld , in a two - to - one decision , the group ’s argument , in Abigail Alliance v. Andrew von Eschenbach , that access to experimental drugs is a constitutional right .
The opinion — by Judge Judith Rogers , a Clinton appointee , and Chief Justice Douglas Ginsburg , a Reagan appointee — shocked legal scholars and officials at the F.D.A. , which had begun drafting proposals aimed at increasing patients ’ access to experimental drugs .
The agency , determined not to cede control of drug regulation to Congress or the courts , intends to release some of the proposals for public comment this week .
According to senior F.D.A. officials , the agency is also developing plans for a program that would encourage drug companies to distribute experimental drugs to thousands of cancer patients through their personal physicians .
If adopted , the program would constitute the most ambitious initiative by the agency in two decades .
The F.D.A. ’s reforms , the D.C. circuit - court decision , and the Brownback bill present different guidelines for providing access to experimental drugs , and it ’s not clear which , if any , of the proposed changes will ultimately take effect .
Nevertheless , the efforts reflect an unlikely convergence of interests between patient - advocacy groups and the deregulation - minded Bush Administration , and they underscore the F.D.A. ’s vulnerability to political pressure .
Some critics worry that the current regulations are n’t strict enough to protect patients .
( In September , the Institute of Medicine , a branch of the National Academy of Sciences , released a report that was sharply critical of the F.D.A. , and , in particular , of a rule passed by Congress in 1992 that allows pharmaceutical companies to pay the agency substantial fees to expedite reviews of their drugs .
The report castigated Congress for failing to provide the F.D.A. with sufficient funds to monitor drugs after they have been approved .
It cited Vioxx , the arthritis drug that was withdrawn in 2004 after it was found to double the risk of heart attack . )
The challenge will be to insure that deregulation does not occur at the expense of science and safety .
“ The common perception is that safety and ef-ficiency in drug development are not compatible , ” Scott Gottlieb told me .
“ I do n’t think that ’s true . ”
During the first four decades of the twentieth century , drug companies often tested experimental medications by sending them to doctors to give to their patients .
The F.D.A. required little information from drug - makers about side effects and had no standard criteria for determining safety or efficacy .
In 1960 , Frances Kelsey , a doctor and pharmacologist , joined the F.D.A. as one of seven full - time physician drug reviewers .
Assigned to evaluate thalidomide , which had been approved in forty - two countries , including much of Europe , as a sedative and an anti-nausea drug , Kelsey was shocked at how little data the agency had about the drug ’s safety , and she was concerned about its side effects .
Richardson - Merrell , which wanted to market thalidomide in the United States , had already distributed it to twenty thousand patients in this country , but Kelsey refused to approve the drug and ordered the company to conduct additional clinical studies .
Later , it was discovered that thousands of mothers — most of them outside the United States — who took thalidomide during pregnancy to combat nausea had delivered babies with severely deformed arms and legs , segmented intestines , and closed ear canals .
In 1962 , Congress passed the Kefauver - Harris Amendments , which required pharmaceutical companies to show the F.D.A. that their drugs were effective and gave the agency greater control over clinical trials .
However , with the advent of the AIDS epidemic , in the nineteen - eighties , regulations that had been praised for protecting the public ’s health were attacked as too restrictive .
AIDS activists demanded what they called “ expanded access , ” arguing that AIDS patients who were not enrolled in a clinical trial should be allowed to take experimental drugs under the supervision of their personal physicians .
( They also requested that the F.D.A. do away with clinical trials of AIDS drugs in which some patients received a placebo . )
In 1987 , the F.D.A. agreed to allow patients who could not participate in clinical trials — because they were too sick or lived too far from a university hospital , where trials are typically conducted — to obtain experimental drugs from their doctors on a compassionate basis , or as part of a national expanded - access program .
In both cases , only experimental drugs that had completed at least Phase II of clinical trials were eligible for distribution .
AIDS activists persuaded the F.D.A. to relax its policy on experimental drugs in part by relying on dramatic protest tactics and sympathetic media coverage ; members of ACT - UP and other groups covered themselves with fake blood and staged “ die-ins ” in front of the White House and the National Institutes of Health .
Pharmaceutical companies , under political pressure to provide promising therapies for AIDS patients , who at the time faced certain death , agreed to distribute the drugs , despite considerable legal and financial risks .
( Drug companies are typically reluctant to supply experimental drugs outside a clinical trial , fearing that patients who suffer adverse reactions will sue the company or that the F.D.A. will demand more extensive safety testing .
Moreover , manufacturing an experimental drug for thousands of patients in an expanded - access program is hugely expensive , and there is no guarantee that the F.D.A. will ultimately approve the drug for sale . )
Doctors , too , got swept up in the campaign to distribute experimental drugs .
I began treating patients with AIDS in 1981 , and for more than a decade I watched helplessly as they grew sicker and died .
In 1994 , saquinavir , the first anti-H.I.V. protease inhibitor , was tested in clinical trials .
In test - tube experiments , the compounds were remarkably potent in preventing the virus from multiplying , and studies on rodents suggested that they were relatively safe ; the only known side effect was liver damage , and then only at very high doses .
Word of the inhibitors ’ promise spread rapidly through the AIDS community , and , like many doctors , I was eager to get the drugs to my patients as quickly as possible , by enrolling them in clinical trials .
Hoffman - LaRoche , the company that made saquinavir , invited several physicians at my hospital to run one of the trials , and four slots in the study were reserved for patients from my practice .
I agonized about which names to submit .
Some of my patients were expected to die within weeks , and yet I thought it was possible that the drug would help them .
Others , who appeared healthier , had abnormal blood - test results — including elevated levels of liver enzymes — which were likely to disqualify them , so I repeated the tests in a vain effort to obtain values in the normal range .
Heartsick , I eventually submitted the names of twenty patients to the nurse in charge of administering the trial , believing that they were the most likely to be accepted .
Most of the rest had no chance of being admitted , because they had serious infections , such as cytomegalovirus and systemic cryptococcus ( a fungus ) .
Tom ( a pseudonym ) , a physician living near Boston , belonged to this group .
He had developed a cytomegalovirus infection in his retina and was slowly going blind , but each time he visited the clinic he pressed me for information about saquinavir and asked me to tell him when the clinical trial would begin .
His father begged me to persuade Hoffman - LaRoche to bend its rules and admit Tom .
I said that I would try but had little hope of succeeding , explaining that the trial was designed to assess the drug ’s safety , and if Tom ’s vision got worse while he was taking the protease inhibitor we would have to report it to the drug company as an “ adverse event . ”
Although we might suspect the infection of his retina to be the cause , Hoffman - LaRoche would have to list “ declining vision ” — and the F.D.A. would have to consider it — as a possible side effect of the drug .
Saquinavir proved to be strikingly effective against H.I.V .
Within a few months , the immune systems of most patients who had taken the drug improved and the amount of H.I.V. in their bodies decreased .
They gained weight , and had fewer infections .
Tom , who had been denied admission to the trial , soon lost his sight and , not surprisingly , became clinically depressed .
I assured him that I would make every effort to see that he did not suffer .
He developed seizures , and a brain scan revealed a large mass with the characteristics of a lymphoma .
He refused further treatment , was placed on a morphine drip at home , and died with his family at his bedside .
At the time , newspapers were filled with stories of AIDS patients whose lives had been saved by the protease inhibitors .
It was later discovered that the drugs caused significant side effects in some patients , including an increased risk of diabetes and elevated cholesterol , but , when used with other anti-viral drugs , protease inhibitors helped reduce the death rate from AIDS in the United States by at least seventy per cent .
It is possible that Tom would still be alive if he had been able to take saquinavir .
In the case of other experimental AIDS drugs , however , doctors ’ expectations were tragically misplaced .
In 1980 , I spent ten months on a fellowship at U.C.L.A. , collaborating with other researchers on a project to purify gamma interferon , a naturally occurring protein made by immune cells .
Many scientists had a near - mystical regard for gamma interferon , believing that it could help the immune system defeat infections , as well as cancer .
Our laboratory succeeded in purifying a small amount of gamma interferon — the first step toward developing a drug — and we published our results in Nature in 1982 .
Not long afterward , Genentech , a biotechnology company , announced that it had created a synthetic version of the protein and was planning to conduct clinical trials .
In 1984 , after I had returned to Boston , I helped run a trial of gamma interferon for AIDS patients who had Kaposi ’s sarcoma , a cancer that causes large lesions on the skin and , in many cases , respiratory failure and internal bleeding .
Gamma interferon appeared to be the ideal treatment for these patients .
It had been shown to have powerful anti-viral effects in test - tube studies and to reduce the size of tumors in rodents .
I enthusiastically told my AIDS patients about the trial , including George ( also a pseudonym ) , who had recently moved to Boston to be with his partner .
George was in reasonably good health ; he had not developed any serious infections , and his Kaposi ’s - sarcoma lesions were mostly on his chest and arms .
The goal of the trial was to test the effects of different doses of gamma interferon , and George belonged to the group that received the largest dose .
Like many participants , he experienced unpleasant side effects — fevers , muscle pain , and headaches — but he was determined to finish the trial .
After six weeks , however , new lesions appeared on his skin and in his mouth , and a chest X - ray suggested that the cancer had spread to his lungs .
George was not the only patient who grew sicker on gamma interferon .
None of the patients improved , and in at least four cases we believed that the therapy had hastened the tumors ’ growth .
Ultimately , the trial was judged a failure .
( Gamma interferon has since proved effective in treating children with a rare immune - system disorder called chronic granulomatous disease . )
George reluctantly agreed to undergo chemotherapy , which had little effect .
He returned to Califor - nia , where his family lived , and died five months later .
( Although I continue to conduct basic research , I currently have no consulting relationships with pharmaceutical companies whose drugs are under review for approval by the F.D.A. )
If Congress passes Brownback ’s bill , or the D.C. circuit court ’s opinion in Abigail Alliance is upheld , there will doubtless be more cases like George’s .
Brownback told me that the goal of his bill is to “ get more testing of treatments and options available in the system for cancer patients , much as we did during the AIDS crisis . ”
However , AIDS is caused by a virus whose presence in the body can be measured by a simple blood test , and is thus much easier to monitor than cancer .
Lung cancer , one of the most common forms of the disease , encompasses a dozen different kinds of tumors ; a given drug is likely to help only a small sub - set of patients , and it is often impossible to predict which ones .
Nevertheless , Brownback ’s bill would grant conditional approval of experimental drugs that have completed Phase I or Phase II testing , based on preliminary evidence — from test - tube experiments , animal studies , computer simulations , and individual patients — that they might be beneficial and safe .
“ If the potential risk to a patient of the condition or disease outweighs the potential risk of the product , and the product may possibly provide benefit to the patient , ” the bill asserts , then the F.D.A. is obligated to approve the drug if a physician and a patient request it .
( The new law would coexist with the current system : if an experimental drug approved under the scheme did not win F.D.A. approval at the end of Phase III trials , it would no longer be distributed . )
Brownback ’s bill would grant access to experimental drugs to patients with “ serious or life - threatening ” illnesses ; the decision in Abigail Alliance limits such access to patients who have terminal diseases .
In both instances , patients would be taking drugs whose risks and benefits are largely unknown .
“ We all know that Phase I testing does n’t prove that a drug is safe enough , ” Sonia Suter , a professor of law at George Washington University and an expert in medical ethics , told me .
“ There are very small numbers of participants in Phase I , and they are treated for a very limited period of time .
So if you believe that there is this constitutional right , that there are risks you are willing to take and not have the government interfere , why have a cutoff at Phase I ?
Why not just say , ‘ Any drug I ’m willing to take , ’ because of some anecdotal experience , or some animal study , or the molecular structure , is reason to think the drug might work ? ”
In June , F.D.A. lawyers , in an attempt to have the decision in Abigail Alliance reversed , asked that the entire panel of judges on the D.C. circuit court hear the case en banc .
The request was granted last month ; the full court will hear the case next year .
Many constitutional - law scholars believe that the opinion is flawed and that the case could eventually go before the Supreme Court .
In the opinion , the circuit - court judges cite the case of Nancy Cruzan , a young woman who had suffered brain death after a car accident and whose parents were seeking legal permission to disconnect her from life support .
In 1989 , the case went before the Supreme Court , which ruled that patients have a right to decline medical treatment .
( With regard to Cruzan , however , the Court said that her parents had not demonstrated “ clear and convincing evidence ” that she would prefer to die than to be sustained on life support .
Several of Cruzan ’s friends later testified about her wishes in a lower court , and Cruzan ’s feeding tube was eventually removed . )
The judges in Abigail Alliance reasoned that the same right of self - determination that allows someone to refuse treatment allows him to “ choose to use potentially life - saving investigational new drugs . ”
They pointed out that for “ over half of our Nation ’s history ” — until the passage , in 1906 , of the Pure Food and Drug Act , which made it a crime to sell mislabelled or adulterated medicines — “ a person could obtain access to any new drug without any government interference whatsoever . ”
“ This is the kind of case that you see tugging at people ’s heartstrings , ” Ira Lupu , a professor of constitutional law at George Washington University , said .
“ Everyone has a friend or a sibling or , especially , a child who has a fatal illness .
You think they ’re going to die in three to six months anyway , so giving them a drug is their only hope .
You can see that the sympathies attached to this could push a judge who is otherwise quite disciplined over the edge . ”
By relying on the Cruzan decision , Lupu said , the D.C. circuit court “ walks away from a long - standing aspect of common law : touching somebody without his consent is a battery .
The Supreme Court assumes , in Cruzan , that the right to refuse continued treatment is a constitutional right , because it is based on the long - standing right to be protected from battery .
As a matter of philosophy , it may seem to make sense that if you can refuse treatment you can also have access to treatment .
But , from the perspective of constitutional law , it is very hard to see what platform this court is standing on . ”
Even if the D.C. circuit - court decision survives legal challenges or Brownback ’s bill passes , neither gives pharmaceutical companies any incentive to make experimental drugs widely available .
Under the existing regulations , only once a drug is approved does the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services decide whether it will be covered by Medicare , and private insurance companies usually follow the government ’s lead in determining which drugs to cover .
Brownback ’s bill could be amended to require the government to reimburse companies for the costs of experimental drugs , but they would still face daunting practical and financial obstacles .
Richard Merrill , a professor at the University of Virginia Law School and a prominent expert on drug regulation , said that Brownback ’s legislation “ would require a major investment to scale up production of an experimental drug ” — after treating only a few hundred patients in Phase I and Phase II trials — “ and it would not be at all clear that the drug had a good chance of ultimately being widely marketed , because its safety and efficacy could prove problematic in more extensive human testing . ”
Brownback ’s bill stipulates that drug companies cannot be held liable for a patient ’s adverse reactions to an experimental medication .
But this may not be enough to reassure pharmaceutical companies , and it could inadvertently encourage retailers of alternative therapies that have little or no basis in science .
“ The bill opens the space for products that are sold by charlatans , ” said David Parkinson , an oncologist who worked at the National Cancer Institute for many years and is now a senior vice - president at the biotech company Biogen Idec .
One of Parkinson ’s tasks at the N.C.I. was to evaluate herbal remedies and animal extracts , such as shark cartilage , that are sold in health - food stores and on the Internet , accompanied by testimonials from patients about their anti-cancer benefits .
Some of these products could pass Phase I trials , Parkinson said , and , under Brownback ’s bill , the F.D.A. would be compelled to approve them .
In March , the F.D.A. approved the use of a drug called Gemzar , in combination with a standard chemotherapy medicine , as a treatment for recurrent ovarian cancer .
The agency ’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee , a group of cancer doctors and statisticians , had voted , nine to two , against approving the treatment , on the ground that it did n’t significantly improve the survival rate of patients .
In July , Richard Pazdur , the director of the F.D.A. ’s Office of Oncology Drug Products , issued a statement defending the agency ’s decision to overrule the committee .
He cited data from Gemzar ’s manufacturer , Eli Lilly , showing that patients who were given the drug as part of their chemotherapy regimens had longer periods of remission than patients who did not take the drug .
“ Although improvement in overall survival remains the gold standard , ” Pazdur wrote , “ delay in disease progression ” has been advocated as a “ surrogate ” for clinical benefit in cancer patients .
Many cancer doctors saw the F.D.A. ’s decision as evidence that the agency is willing to adapt to patients ’ needs .
When I spoke to Pazdur , he mentioned this — and the agency ’s recent approval of similar drugs for kidney cancer ( Nexavar ) , multiple myeloma ( Revlimid ) , and a rare gastrointestinal tumor ( Sutent ) .
“ We need to be more flexible in how we evaluate drugs for patients like this , ” Pazdur said .
“ The provision is that the drug ’s benefits have to be clinically meaningful — and it does n’t mean delaying the progression of the tumor by two days — so you ’re not approving iffy drugs . ”
Pazdur said that the F.D.A. has rarely denied a patient ’s request to obtain an experimental drug under the compassionate - use provision .
( He recalled only one instance in which the agency has done so : in the case of a boy with a brain tumor whose parents had refused to give him radiation therapy , the standard treatment for his condition .
“ That ’s not a regulatory issue ; that was bad medicine , ” Pazdur said . )
He also cited a recent program — modelled on the expanded - access programs for AIDS patients in the eighties — in which the drug Iressa was given to more than twenty - four thousand lung - cancer patients after a Phase II trial yielded promising results .
( Ultimately , Iressa was not approved ; few patients in Phase III trials improved on the drug , and its use is now restricted to those patients . )
Nevertheless , Pazdur acknowledged that pharmaceutical companies currently have little motivation to comply with requests for experimental drugs .
“ There are some companies that flat out refuse to even get involved in expanded access , ” he said .
“ We are told over and over by the industry that the F.D.A. will find some toxicity in the expanded - access program , and the evil Dr. Pazdur will take out his ruler and slap your hand , and the drug will be killed . ”
Pazdur is overseeing the F.D.A. ’s plans for a new program that will enable pharmaceutical companies to distribute experimental drugs to thousands of cancer patients through large networks of community - based oncologists .
To be eligible for the program , drugs would have to be at the end of Phase II trials or partway through Phase III , depending on the kind of drug and cancer involved .
The oncologists who administer the drugs would be required to report their patients ’ progress and any side effects to the F.D.A. and to the pharmaceutical companies .
The doctors would also have to answer simple questions about the drug — whether patients did better on a high dose twice a day or on a lower dose three times a day , say , or whether it helped patients with an advanced stage of cancer .
Take a number .
Take a second number .
Add both together to produce a third .
Again , add the last two numbers to produce the next .
Repeat ad infinitum .
What can be more boring ?
Well , the simple sequence you just generated has been studied for more than eight centuries , and continues to fascinate mathematicians , artists and numerologists alike .
Countless research publications deal with Fibonacci sequences and related matters , there is a magazine dedicated to Fibonacci sequences , and every two years you can attend an International Conference on Fibonacci Numbers and Their Applications .
In a recent blog I introduced the term ' Fibonacci Chaos ' .
This might seem a misnomer .
Are n't Fibonacci sequences very well behaved ?
Apart from the first few terms , each next number is about 1.618 times the previous .
So when you plot the Fibonacci numbers on a logarithmic scale perfect regular behavior results ( see figure ) .
' Fibonacci Chaos ' , much ado about nothing then ?
Well , let me try to convince you that a very rich chaotic dynamics is hidden in these ' boring ' Fibonacci sequences .
Moreover , the simple discrete structure of Fibonacci sequences provides us with a perfect playground to build insight into the emergence of chaos in reversible dynamic systems .
The hallmark of chaos is the phenomenon called ' sensitive dependence on initial conditions '.
This is about the proverbial butterfly in Rio flapping its tiny wings and thereby causing a chain of events amplifying into a hurricane hitting Texas coast a few weeks later .
In more mathematical terms the butterfly effect is characterized by an exponential dependence on initial conditions : a slight perturbation in the initial condition gets multiplied each timestep until the whole evolution is unrecognisable from the unperturbed evolution .
So where is the butterfly in the Fibonacci sequence ?
First , we need to view the Fibonacci sequence as a dynamics .
Think of each next number in the sequence as a next step in a Fibonacci time evolution .
The question now is whether or not small perturbations in the initial conditions ( I.e. in the first two terms of the sequence ) multiply exponentially into the Fibonacci evolution .
To check for such butterfly effect , rather than starting with the standard initial values 0 and 1:0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 , ... we start with arbitrary numbers ' a ' and ' b ' .
Let 's see what we get:a , b , a+b , a+2b , 2a+3b , 3a+5 b , 5a+8 b , ... Do you recognise the original Fibonacci numbers appearing again ?
Now let 's create a perturbed sequence by keeping the first number ( a ) unchanged , whilst slightly modifying the second number into b+d .
If we do this and then list the differences of the corresponding terms in both sequences , a Fibonacci sequence appears that describes the evolution of the perturbation : 0 , d , d , 2d , 3d , 5d , 8d , ... As we saw in the first figure , Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially .
And so does this perturbation evolution sequence .
Hence here we have our Fibonacci butterfly .
Each step in the Fibonacci evolution of the perturbation represents a [ golden magnification ] .
Whilst each seperate golden multiplication in itself is rather modest , they quickly add up .
It takes only 45 golden steps to billionfold magnify a butterfly wing flap .
But there is more to this Fibonacci chaos .
To reveal some of the subtleties of the chaotic behaviour hidden in Fibonacci sequences , we need to decompose the numbers in this sequence into their most elementary building blocks , and study the effect of the Fibonacci dynamics on individual bits .
Bit Turbulence
The Fibonacci sequence when represented in binary format reads :
0 , 1 , 1 , 10 , 11 , 101 , 1000 , 1101 , 10101 , 100010 , ...
We can place these bit strings on a grid , each subsequent number on a next row , with the bits ordered from right to left in order of increasing significance , and such that the bits in each vertical column have equal significance .
When we color code the bits ( white for ' 0 ' and blue for ' 1 ' ) a remarkably chaotic figures result :
It might seem surprising that such a simple rule ( add the last two numbers to get the next ) results in such a rich behavior .
Notice that I have shown two binary evolutions for slightly different starting conditions ( 1 , 1 and 3 , 3 , respectively ) .
Both evolutions behave qualitatively the same : both grow with the same slope ( the base - 2 logarithm of the golden ratio ) , within the triangle of growth both have a 50:50 distribution of white and blue cells , and both evolutions appear visually similar and equally random .
Yet , with the exception of the rightmost columns ( we shall shortly see why ) a bit - by - bit comparison of corresponding cells reveals that both patterns are completely uncorrelated .
Again a manifestation of the ' golden butterfly ' .
One may generate many of such evolutions , each with different starting conditions .
When averaged over a long enough evolution , each pattern will be statistically independent of the others .
Yet hidden in these apparently random patterns is a remarkable regularity .
A period - doubling structure that comes into effect when bits get added into the evolution .
I have stressed this structure by drawing red rectangles in both Fibonacci evolutions .
The rightmost column has boxes covering three timesteps .
The next column to the left has boxes of length 6 , the next column 12 , and so on .
( Notice that box lengths 48 and beyond run out of the short evolution displayed in the figure . )
If you look carefully , you should notice that in both evolutions the columns of boxes show a perfect repeat pattern .
In other words : each individual evolution has one unique box of each size , and for each pattern the boxes at certain bit position are all identical .
Needless to say that between the two figures , corresponding boxes will differ dramatically .
If you opt to follow the Fibonacci dynamics of just the first n bits [ modular arithmetic ] , the observed period doubling causes a [ Poincare recurrence ] every 3.2 ^ ( n - 1 ) steps .
If you increase the bitstring length to n+1 bits , the recurrence occurs in 3.2 ^n steps .
Each bit added increases the recurrence by a factor of two .
What mechanism causes this period doubling ?
Let 's reduce the Fibonacci dynamics to its most basic form .
We set n=1 and track just one single bit .
It should be clear that for single bit operation the Fibonacci dynamics reduces to a ' [ exclusive or ] ' ( XOR ) operation : each next bit in the evolution is the XOR of the last two bits .
The unique nonzero Fibonacci bit sequence that follows is
0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , ...
The same would hold for higher significance bits added , were it not that higher significance bits are affected by the carry of bits generated from the operations on the less significant bits .
This transport of bits from less significant levels to bits at levels of higher significance is akin to the effect smaller eddies have on larger ones in turbulent flows .
It is this ' bit turbulence ' that causes the period doubling .
Phase Space Dynamics
Rather than displaying the Fibonacci sequence as it unfolds in time , the Fibonacci evolution can be visualized in more compact form by displaying the evolution dynamics .
This boils down to plotting the evolution in what physicists refer to as ' phase space ' .
Each point in the phase space of a dynamical system represents the information that is needed to determine its full evolution .
For our Fibanacci system , the evolution is determined by specifying two subsequent numbers in the Fibonacci evolution .
So Fibonaci phase space consists not of Fibonacci numbers , but of pairs of subsequent Fibonacci numbers .
In other words , the phase space is a two - dimensional coordinate grid .
On this grid , Fibonacci evolutions are represented as a trail of positions , one position for each timestep in the evolution , and each position in the trail having coordinates corresponding to consecutive elements in the Fibonacci sequence .
We will distinguish the different evolutions using symbols of different colors to indicate the trail of position .
For a single - bit Fibonacci sequence , the phase - space is a 2x2 grid .
A three - point trail and a single - point trail can be distinghuished on this grid ( indicated in the figure as circular symbols of different colors ) .
These correspond to the zero sequence ( 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , ... ) and the sequence previously represented by the box of length three ( 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , ... )
Now what happens if we do not limit ourselves to one bit , but to one digit ?
The phase space grows to a 10x10 grid , on which an interesting pattern consisting of multiple evolutions develops :
What about the generation of phase space plots in even higher bases ?
These are easy to achieve once you realize that single position base -r Fibonacci is equivalent to mod r Fibonacci arithmetic .
Experimenting with Fibonacci phase space plots gives a lot of insight into the nature of chaos in time - reversible systems .
Starting with a compact cloud of points , you will observe that in the next timestep this cloud has stretched ( by a factor equal to the golden mean ) in one direction , and compacted ( by a factor equal to the inverse of the golden ratio ) in the other .
Mathematicians refer to this phase space stretching and compaction as ' Anosov diffeomorphism ' .
It is at the very heart of all chaos behaviors observed in nature .
Hey Look At Me! I 'm Climbing A Bridge !
by David ' Hades ' Becker [ Wednesday , 26th of August 2009 - 08:23 PM ]
So The Saboteur tried to sneak by with a quiet showing of the game .
Either because they were drowned out by al the Blizzcon news and other GamesCom news that was all a flutter .
But you know what ?
We at AggroGamer here caught these sneaks trying to get past everyone 's view .
We caught the game in action here and we caught it red handed .
Climbing , driving and sneaking on the peripherals of everyone 's views .
Ok , enough of the espionage talk now .
We know that this game has been on all our radars for some while now .
Just playing up the whole Saboteur concept .
In the end though , here are some more screens showing off the actions that I spoke of above .
Like I spoke of above too , they look very nice .
I kind of wish there were a bit more " animated " views of the game because there is only so much you can get from a still , but beggars can't be choosers right ?
We can get an idea of things from these shots too .
Like , hey look at me I 'm climbing a bridge .
Or , hey I 'm driving a car .
Or even , hey I 'm sneaking past Nazis , those dirty scum bags .
Completely what he is thinking in every one of those shots .
Enjoy for now , until the game hits PC , PS3 , and 360 on December 12th .
Or we get more to show off .
Which ever comes first .
Bloomberg sued the Fed to force it to reveal the names of the banks that have dumped all their crap assets onto the Fed 's balance sheet ( a.k.a. , the taxpayer ) .
And Bloomberg won !
But the Fed is still refusing to reveal which banks it has secretly bailed out .
And the Fed is now appealing the ruling .
The Fed says its refusal to reveal the names is about " competition . "
Please .
Paul Kasriel of Northern
Trust explains the real reason :
The Fed is scared to death that the revelation will trigger another run on some banks .
On November 7 , 2008 , Bloomberg LP sued the Federal Reserve Board under terms of the
Freedom of Information
Act to obtain the names of borrowers of funds from the Federal Reserve
as well as lists of the collateral posted by the borrowers .
On August 25 , 2009 , a U.S. District
judge ruled in favor of Bloomberg , ordering the Federal Reserve Board to turn over to Bloomberg
the requested information within five days .
At this writing , the Fed has yet to comply and has yet
made a decision to appeal the ruling .
The Fed has been reluctant to reveal the names of its
borrowers allegedly out of a concern that such a revelation could have an adverse competitive
impact on the borrowers .
The reason I bring this up is that it is similar to a situation that arose in 1932 with the
Reconstruction Finance Corporation ( RFC ) .
The RFC was established by an act of Congress on
January 22 , 1932 , for the purpose of making loans to financial institutions , railroads and to extend
credit for crop loans .
The Treasury provided some capital to the RFC and the RFC was permitted
to borrow from the Treasury .
Initially , the RFC granted credit primarily to banks .
These loans
coincided with a reduction in bank failures and currency held outside the banks declined .
On July 21 , 1932 , the RFC was authorized to make loans for self - liquidating public works
projects , and to states to provide relief and work relief to needy and unemployed people .
This
legislation also required that the RFC report to Congress , on a monthly basis , the identity of all
new borrowers of RFC funds .
On orders from the Speaker of the House of Representatives ,
commencing in August 1932 , the names of banks borrowing from the RFC became public
information .
This publication of the names of banks borrowing from the RFC discouraged current
borrowers from continuing their borrowing and prospective borrowers from commencing
borrowings out of a fear that depositors would judge this borrowing as a sign of financial
weakness .
By November 1932 , the outstanding amount of RFC loans to banks had decreased .
In mid February of 1933 , a Detroit bank began having difficulties .
The RFC was willing to lend to
this bank , but because of a dispute between one of the Michigan senators and Henry Ford , a large
depositor in the bank , the RFC loan was not allowed to be made .
A bank panic started in
Michigan as a result .
This Michigan bank panic served as a catalyst for a nationwide bank panic .
The failure of the Detroit bank was not because the bank was reluctant to borrow from the RFC .
But one can only speculate as to whether other banks in Michigan and nationwide were reluctant
to borrow from the RFC because their names would have been published .
And one can only
speculate that if these other banks had willing to borrow from the RFC if a nationwide bank could
have been averted .
Today , we have federal deposit insurance .
Therefore , the probabilities and magnitude of depositor
runs on banks are much reduced compared with 1933 .
Yet , we can see “ runs ” by stockholders and
other creditors of banks if there is a suspicion of financial problems .
If the Fed is required to publish the names of financial institutions to which it has extended credit and this publication
induces financial institutions to refrain from borrowing from the Fed , one can only speculate if
this would be the tinder for another liquidity conflagration in the coming months .

CNN Has Discovered Internet Trolls - [ briefly ]
06:30 PM EDT - Apr , 24 2009 - ( 1 comments )
Embedded video from CNN Video CNN has done an amazing piece of investigative journalism and uncovered something called an internet troll :-)
Official advice says women should not drink more than three units a day Women who drink moderate amounts of beer may be strengthening their bones , according to Spanish researchers .
Their study of almost 1,700 women , published in the journal Nutrition , found bone density was better in regular drinkers than non-drinkers .
But the team added that plant hormones in the beer rather than the alcohol may be responsible for the effects .
Experts urged caution , warning that drinking more than two units of alcohol a day was known to harm bone health .
Osteoporosis is a common problem for post - menopausal women , increasing the risk of disabling bone fractures later in life .
Further research Scientists have been hunting for supplements which might help women maintain the strength of bones into old age .
The study authors , from the University of Extremadura in Caceres , said they did not recommend anyone drank beer to boost bone health , but said that ingredients of beer called phytoestrogens deserved further research .
They recruited volunteers with an average age of 48 , and used ultrasound to measure the density of bones in their fingers .
The results were cross checked against factors such as their weight , age and alcohol use .
Women defined as " light " or " moderate " beer drinkers , covering consumption of up to 280 grams of alcohol a week - equivalent to up to five units a day , were found to have superior bone density to non-drinkers .
The findings echo those from earlier research projects , including one conducted at St Thomas ' Hospital in London , which suggested that drinking an average of eight units a week of alcohol could be beneficial .
However , experts were quick to point out that the line between a " healthy " dose of alcohol and a damaging one might be very fine .
Health concerns
At 35 units a week , the upper limit of the " moderate " alcohol consumption defined by the study is double the recommended maximum for women .
Dr Claire Bowring , of the UK's National Osteoporosis Society , said that while the findings mirrored previous studies , it would not be recommending any woman to increase her alcohol consumption as a result .
" While low quantities of alcohol may appear to have bone density benefits , higher intakes have been shown to decrease bone strength , with an alcohol intake of more than two units per day actually increasing the risk of breaking a bone .
" There are also many other health concerns linked with alcohol which can not be ignored . "

Eyes off my man ( Image : Matt Baron / BEI / Rex Features )
Women : do you have a man ?
If you do , better beware .
Chances are that some lone female has her eye on him .
A new study provides evidence for what many have long suspected : that single women are much keener on pursuing a man who ’s already taken than a singleton .
“ The single women really , really liked the guy when he was taken , ” says Melissa Burkley of Oklahoma State University in Stillwater , who conducted the “ mate - poaching ” study with her colleague Jessica Parker .
Advertisement
They asked 184 heterosexual students at the university to participate in a study on sexual attraction and told the volunteers that a computer program would match them with an ideal partner .
Half the participants were single and half attached , with equal numbers of men and women in each group .
Meet Mr Right
Unknown to the participants , everyone was offered a fictitious candidate partner who had been tailored to match their interests exactly .
The photograph of “ Mr Right ” was the same for all women participants , as was that of the ideal women presented to the men .
Half the participants were told their ideal mate was single , and the other half that he or she was already in a romantic relationship .
“ Everything was the same across all participants , except whether their ideal mate was already attached or not , ” says Burkley .
The most striking result was in the responses of single women .
Offered a single man , 59 per cent were interested in pursuing a relationship .
But when he was attached , 90 per cent said they were up for the chase .
Men were keenest on pursuing new mates , but were n’t bothered whether their target was already attached or not .
Attached women showed least interest and were slightly more drawn to single men .
Stamp of approval
Burkley and Parker speculate that single women may be more drawn to attached men because they ’ve already been “ pre-screened ” by other women and found to be satisfactory as a mate , whereas single men are more of an unknown quantity .
Burkely said that similar mate - poaching strategies have been reported in birds and fish .
But previous studies of people had only asked whether participants found other potential partners attractive , so she designed hers to specifically probe whether participants would pursue a relationship .
“ The next question is why , ” says Burkley .
So in further studies , she plans to further explore women ’s motives for pursuing “ taken ” partners .
Apart from the explanation of “ pre-screening ” , another possibility , she says , is that in US society , women are socialised to be competitive , so they derive self - esteem by mate poaching from rival women .
Other researchers say the study provides interesting insights into mate poaching .
“ It tells us something about the role of social desirability in mate preference , ” says Fhionna Moore of the University of Abertay Dundee , UK , whose own research has shown that richer women are more choosy about mates .

A recent study on the small business sectors in different countries has knocked down the notion that the U.S. economic policy welcomes and fosters entrepreneurs .
Rather , the Center for Economic and Policy Research , which conducted the study , found that the United States has one the smallest small business sectors — as a portion of total national employment — in the world .
The study looked at 22 wealthy industrialized nations and found that the United States had the second lowest share of self - employed workers , ahead of only Luxembourg .
The United States also ranked close to the bottom in terms of the portion of the work force employed in small business manufacturing : the U.S. share of 11.1 % compares with 14.4 % in Sweden and 18.1 % in the United Kingdom
In other words , despite a long tradition of celebrating self - starters and business owners who create jobs and collectively serve as a powerful economic engine , the United States has a comparatively weak and small business sector .
While the study ’s authors theorize that high health costs are to blame for the lack of a more robust small business sector , what ’s even more striking is how many would - be entrepreneurs agreed .
A New York Times blog earlier this month about the study generated a flurry of responses , which were overwhelmingly in agreement that unfriendly health care policies were choking the small business sector .
“ For most entrepreneurs , the biggest cause of hesitation before starting a business is the lack of health insurance , ” wrote one former small business owner .
“ You can plan for the loss of income while you start a business , but you ca n’t plan for a health problem .
This becomes truly frightening when you ’re out there by yourself .
Entrepreneurs are famous for their ability to imagine they can overcome any obstacle , but it ’s hard for any responsible adult — especially one with a family — to justify taking a chance like that . ”
The commenter stressed that for most small business owners , high health care costs represented a much larger impediment than corporate tax rates .
“ It ’s absolutely true that health care costs are stifling small business formations , ” said another commenter .
“ I ’m a 50 - something male with routine health issues .
The pre-existing screening of health providers makes me uninsurable , as a practical matter , for anything I ’m likely to need coverage .
The private pay fees are a multiple of the insurance reimbursement making the whole thing untenable . ”
Both the study and the comments it generated support some recent EPI research that health care reform would be good for small business .
EPI ’s recent Briefing Paper , Health Care Reform : Big Benefits for Small Businesses , noted that only 35 % of businesses employing fewer than 10 workers currently offer health insurance , and those that do usually pass on a higher share of the cost to workers than do larger businesses .
A key problem , the research paper finds , is that small businesses typically pay more for health insurance because of the way policies are sold .
Reform that would create more competition among insurers and reduce their administrative costs would significantly reduce the cost small businesses incur providing health insurance , it finds .
Other research from EPI ’s director of health policy research , Elise Gould , challenges the popular argument made by opponents of health care reform , that reform would impose a heavy cost on small businesses .
In Small Business and Health Reform , Gould notes that the proposed surcharge on high incomes contained in the House health reform bill would not affect the overwhelming majority of small business owners .
Although the level of self - employment and small business employment in the United States is already low by comparison to peer countries , it appears that even more of these self starters could be forced to abandon their work if health care remains so expensive .
“ After nearly a decade of self - employment I took a full - time job two years ago , ” wrote yet another individual commenting on the study ’s findings .
“ The primary reason was health insurance . ”
Narcotics agents said Tuesday they had little doubt that the nearly 90,000 - acre La Brea fire was started by Mexican drug traffickers who were tending a large , sophisticated marijuana farm planted on the side of a mountain .
The growers apparently fled as firefighters approached the source of the fire and are still at large , Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said .
Their abandoned site was similar to other illicit plots planted by Mexican nationals and discovered by drug agents in recent years .
Investigators found 30,000 top - grade cannabis plants ranging in height from 2 feet to 6 feet .
Stacks of propane tanks , melted irrigation tubing , empty fertilizer canisters , mounds of trash , a torched cooking stove and a semiautomatic rifle were also found at the Los Padres National Forest location , the sheriff and other agents said .
U.S. Forest Service fire investigators believe a propane - fed camp stove sparked the fire Aug . 8 .

“ This is the trend , ” Russ Arthur , a special agent for the U.S. Forest Service , said at a Santa Barbara news conference .
“ I ’ve been involved in hundreds of arrests and all of the suspects have been Mexican nationals . ”
Drug rings south of the border send workers to plant in densely forested areas of the U.S. in early spring .
The workers care for the plants for four to five months , camping out until it is time to harvest , agents said .
California ’s state and national forests are favored locations because of the good weather and soil .
The remote pot farm where the La Brea fire started is in a steep , overgrown canyon more than a mile from the nearest road , investigators said .

Growers terraced the plants up a mountainside , diverting a nearby stream to provide drip irrigation to the plants , they said .
The fire burned away from the farm and it appeared that the growers stayed for a while until firefighters drew close .
They fled and are believed to still be in the forest , attempting to leave on foot , Sheriff ’s Lt. Sonny Legault said .
Authorities cautioned rural residents not to approach people leaving the forest because they could be armed .
It ’s been a record year of pot seizures for the state and federal agents who work with the Santa Barbara County narcotics unit each summer to eradicate illicit farms .
So far they have pulled 225,058 plants with an estimated street value of $ 675 million .
Advertisement
Many of the illegal farms were not far from where the fire started .
In late July , agents pulled 113,000 plants from one site , a record for the multi-agency team .
Legault said the increase in seizures is not a result of more law enforcement manpower .
He said pot growers have become more sophisticated , planting multiple sites with bigger farms .
Brown agreed , saying it ’s virtually impossible to get rid of all the marijuana grown in the state ’s forests .
He suspects that there are many more undetected pot farms .
Advertisement
“ The reality is we could have an army out there and not be able to cover all of that ground , ” the sheriff said .
After a 10 - day battle , firefighters on Tuesday were close to completing containment lines around the La Brea fire .
Firefighters were still dousing hot spots and making aerial attacks , officials said .
Grounds crews are on the lookout for the fleeing individuals , Forest Service officials said .
Arthur , the special agent , said other smaller fires have been started accidentally in forest lands by suspected drug traffickers .

But the La Brea fire , he said , is the largest .

Why women go off sex :
What happened when 100 couples kept a candid diary about their bedroom antics
Is it hormones , husbands who 've got tubby - or just boredom ?
To help find out , 100 couples kept a brutally honest sex diary for a year .
The results surprised even this usually unshockable expert ...
After 12 years of writing about sex , I felt pretty confident that nothing could surprise me .
I thought I knew it all .
I 've been agony aunt for Company Magazine for many years .
I 'm one of Scarlet Magazine 's ' Pleasure Aunts ' ( not as questionable as it sounds ) and have written countless features and five books on the ins and outs of making love .
I even had a radio phone - in show , where the producer and I regularly had hissed , frantic exchanges over what the next caller might be about to reveal and whether it could potentially shut down the station .
I 've had sackfuls of letters detailing every kind of female sexual worry , demand , hope and confusion .
A new book by Australian sex therapist Bettina Arndt , The Sex Diaries : Why Women Go Off Sex And Other Bedroom Battles , charts the deepest , private emotions of both genders - and reveals a hidden world
At parties , I 'm often asked what the most common problem is , and I always say it 's : how can we spice things up in the bedroom ?
Women write wondering why they 've gone off sex , and what they can do to get their missing mojos back .
I 've written the answer to this a thousand times - get a babysitter , book a hotel room , buy some new underwear - basically , remind yourself that you 're sexy .
And as sex writers seldom get any reports on whether their advice worked , it 's easy to assume that the world is full of relieved couples rekindling their dormant passion over bottles of pricey room service wine .
Or at least it was , until I read The Sex Diaries .
Australian sex therapist Bettina Arndt persuaded 98 couples to reveal all in personal diaries kept over the course of a year .
And far from the cosy , all - girls - together whingeing I anticipated - Ooh , men !
They always want it , do n't they ? ' ) , the book charts the deepest , private emotions of both genders - and reveals a hidden world that 's truthful , painful and sometimes inspiring .
' The twentysomething women are much more sexually confident than past generations '
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
The diaries are n't really about sex at all , but about the emotions that surround sex with someone you love - fear , intimacy , gratitude , guilt , resentment , loneliness , hope .
In fact , the last thing these real couples are worried about is ' spicing it up ' , new positions , or the size of his equipment .
They 're more concerned about why their wife does n't seem to love them any more , or why their husband still hopes for sex when he wo n't even take out the rubbish to show he cares .
As a ' sexpert , ' I did n't expect such brutal honesty .
Letters to problem pages tend to be brief , often focusing on practical - even technical - sexual issues .
And it 's a rule of thumb that any sex survey must be taken with an entire Dead Sea - sized teaspoon of salt , as people exaggerate , downplay , and just plain lie in order to appear ' normal ' .
These diaries prove , repeatedly , that there is no ' normal ' .
There 's only ' I 'm having the sex life I want ' or ' I 'm not ' .
But the act of writing privately , rather than ticking boxes , obviously encourages reflection and honesty .
' Exploring the limits of sexual potential has little to do with clever techniques , ' says Bettina Arndt , ' but a lot to do with how two people feel about themselves and each other outside the bedroom . '
And reading many of the extracts forced me to question plenty of my assumptions .
That the twentysomething women are much more sexually confident than past generations , for instance .
We may assume that all the post - Sex And The City openness , the brazen behaviour and the one - night stands mean they 're happily in control - but one diarist is already tired of her partner 's sexual expectations at the age of just 20 , while others struggle to have their needs met , with no idea how to ask .
Flic Everett and husband Simon
I may get letters which suggest that the average 25 - year - old girl 's biggest worry is how to fine - tune her new man 's performance for maximum orgasms , but on a deeper level , younger women are clearly longing for intimacy and understanding - just as men are .
Writing for women - and talking to them during radio phone-ins and at events - it's often tempting to dismiss their pestering partners as sexually voracious testosterone - driven factories .
My past , attempted - ego - boosting advice to women has tended towards the ' He 's lucky to have you , he should be grateful for anything he can get ' variety .
But The Sex Diaries reveals a much more tender , intimate truth about men in relationships .
Men who are n't , in fact , surfing internet porn every night , or resentfully putting up with the middleaged wife while they fantasise about the hot 21 - year - old next door .
It comes as a poignant surprise , in fact , to discover that the majority are still deeply in love with their wives ; they just want the chance to be physically closer to her , and to feel loved and accepted in return , despite their balding heads or round tummies .
' Every day I received page after page of eloquent , often immensely sad diary material , ' reveals Arndt , 'as men grasped the opportunity to talk about what emerged as being a mighty emotional issue for them . '
One typical fiftysomething male correspondent writes : ' I still find my wife sexually attractive and would love to make love to her .
I understand that we are getting older , but I miss the affection and the closeness .
I could just sit down and cry - [ but ] a male my age does not cry , nor does he speak about the problem . '
It 's not only men .
Several women also express a sadness that their levels of sexual desire are so ill - matched with their partners . '
Bombarded with sexualised adverts , suggestive TV and feisty articles ( some , admittedly , written by me ) suggesting that the key to great sex is simply a noholdsbarred approach and a satin thong , it 's no wonder so many suffer in silence .
Who wants to be the lone voice in a world of smug sexual satisfaction ?
Few would dare to admit they feel vulnerable , or unloved in their own bed , and that they do n't understand why their spouse no longer desires them .
But , plainly , they do .
Sometimes , just a few simple words can entirely change your attitude - and I felt mine , feisty feminist that I am , shift at the sad question from one male diarist : ' What happened to this lover I married ?
Where did she go ? '
It 's been too easy for me to counsel women to have sex only when , where and how they want it , regardless of their partner 's feelings .
The sudden awareness that , often , this is n't just about thoughtless men expecting sex on tap has made me far more aware that , as women , we use sex to punish , to withhold and to send coded ' You 're not getting it right ' messages instead of communicating our true feelings .
The husband lamenting his lost ' lover ' had decided that rather than pester his wife for sex and be met with egocrushing refusal yet again , he'd wait until she felt like initiating it .
He 's been waiting eight years so far - but he loves her too much to leave .
Not in the mood :
Many women do n't understand what has caused their once - passionate desire for their spouses to wither and die
Maybe growing up in the Seventies , with a mum who read Spare Rib , subconsciously convinced me that men were the new second sex - that they'd had their own way in bed for thousands of years and that now women should set the pace .
And , yes , most sexual abuse is still perpetrated by men .
But most of my correspondents - and the couples in The Sex Diaries - are just ordinary , loving partners for whom sex is an expression of intimacy and love .
It became clear reading the diaries that my sometimes knee - jerk response ( ' Well , it 's his fault for pestering ' ) was lacking in compassion for at least one half of the couple in question , and that truly valuable advice should take both their needs into account .
But while some women go on an undeclared sex strike through resentment over unwashed dishes , neglected duties , anger or disappointment , plenty more do n't understand what has caused their once - passionate desire for their spouses to wither and die .
After years of fairly comprehensive research , I have generally concluded - and declared - that it 's simply the waning of the ' in love ' hormones which bond couples in the first 18 months , and that sexual passion can generally be rebooted by a free night without kids , dirty washing or work deadlines .
This may be partially true , but it may also be way too simplistic .
Because what Arndt surmises , after reading her couples ' diaries , is not that most women are ardent lovers whose passion is gradually crushed by domesticity and boredom , it 's that many women do n't have a particularly high libido to begin with .
' It 's surprising - but most men are still deeply in love with their wives '
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
It 's given a huge boost by the hormonal cocktail of falling in love - and lust .
But when the endorphins ebb away , she simply reverts back to normal , leaving her passionate partner bemused , stranded and wondering where the sex went .
The women , meanwhile , are often longing for tenderness - and do n't know how to ask for it .
They worry that a tired cuddle will be misconstrued as a sexual invitation , so withdraw altogether .
My own response might once have been : ' You 'll just have to tell him exactly what it means , and he 'll have to respect your boundaries . '
But perhaps the biggest revelation of all is that sexual desire - for women , at least - is seldom sparked , magically , by gazing upon their partner 's slightly sagging physique , investing in new bed linen or launching an Ann Summers trolley dash .
According to The Sex Diaries ' happy couples , it 's a simple matter of Just Doing It .
A combination of husbands scaling down the pestering and giving more practical help with children and housework , and women simply choosing to have sex , rather than waiting for lightning to strike , was the unexpectedly simple key .
Initially , of course , like some reluctant diarists , I was shocked at the idea that women should engage in a modern version of ' lie back and think of England ' .
I have always railed against women feeling sexually obligated , or ignoring their own needs in favour of his .
But the crucial point is that , unlike men , women often do n't feel sexual desire until they 're physically touched .
The Sex Diaries features honest admissions from many women that unless they simply decide to do it , they 'd probably never have sex again .
But when they do go for it , the sex is often as good as it used to be .
' I'm definitely a " just do it " person , ' admits one diarist , Glenda .
' I never have any problems once we start .
It always feels good . '
Previously , I might have dismissed these women as born - again Stepford Wives - women who needed their consciousness raising before their libidos .
But as I 've got older , my past certainties about what makes successful sex have been challenged by anecdotes from friends , by my own changing feelings and now by The Sex Diaries .
The new book by Bettina Arndt
It 's not as simple as ' spicing it up ' , or telling him to back off till he 's completed his chores check - list .
And it 's not as easy to dismiss men's desires in favour of our own .
Couples with good sex lives , it transpires , meet each other half way .
Sometimes one is n't in the mood , but does it anyway and ends up enjoying it .
Sometimes a cuddle is enough .
But what really struck me was the revelation that in long - term relationships , sexual frustration is n't usually about sex at all : it 's about loneliness and rejection .
And maintaining desire is n't all about hormones and hotel rooms : it 's much more a matter of choosing to show your partner you love them - even if you do n't always feel like it .
Maybe to an ordinary couple that sounds simple enough .
But to a sexpert who 's become used to a rarefied world of tricks and toys , positions and pulsations , it can be difficult to imagine what 's really going on in people 's bedrooms .
Piecing together a general idea from letters requesting help with esoteric erotic problems , or bemoaning ' boring - in - bed ' boyfriends , it would be easy to think the whole country 's at it every night .
The Sex Diaries is proof that it is n't .
And a timely reminder to me - and my fellow sexperts - that sometimes , feelings are much more important than facts .

Spencer was at a Senate hearing and this is very disturbing .
Defense Department General Counsel Jeh Johnson moved the Obama administration into new territory from a civil liberties perspective .
Asked by Sen. Mel Martinez ( R - Fla . ) the politically difficult but entirely fair question about whether terrorism detainees acquitted in courts could be released in the United States , Johnson said that “ as a matter of legal authority , ” the administration ’s powers to detain someone under the law of war do n’t expire for a detainee after he ’s acquitted in court .
“ If you have authority under the law of war to detain someone ” under the Supreme Court ’s Hamdi ruling , “ that is true irrespective of what happens on the prosecution side . ”
Martinez looked surprised .
“ So the prosecution is moot ? ” he asked .
“ No , no , not in my judgment , ” Johnson said .
But the scenario he outlined strongly suggested it is .
If an administration review panel “ determines this person is a security threat ” and “ for some reason is not convicted of a lengthy prison sentence , I think we have the authority to continue to detain someone ” under “ law of war authority ” as granted by the September 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force , Johnson said .
And beyond that source of authority “ we have the authority in the first place . ”
I ’m no lawyer , but that sounds a lot like Johnson is claiming inherent presidential authority from the Constitution to detain someone after he ’s been acquitted in court if the president believes that person to be a security threat .
[ Update : I think I 'm wrong about that .
Johnson is claiming authority from the law - of - war construct for such detentions , and that does n't stem from any constitutional interpretation of inherent power .
Apologies . ]
Oh , and Johnson also suggested that the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay might remain open after January 2010 , since “ you ca n’t prosecute some significant subset of 220 people before January . ”
He said the administration will continue to detain some of those Guantanamo detainees , “ whether at Guantanamo or somewhere else . ”
Snake wine is an alcoholic beverage that includes a whole venomous snake in the bottle .
It originated in Vietnam and can be found around Southeast Asia .
The snakes , preferably venomous ones , are usually not preserved for their meat .
They are preserved to have the snake poison dissolved in the liquor .
However , because snake venom is protein - based , they are unfolded and therefore inactivated due to the influence of the denaturing effects of ethanol .
A large venomous snake can be placed into a glass jar of rice wine , often with many smaller snakes , turtles , insects , or birds , and left to steep for many months .
The wine is drunk as a restorative in small shots or cups
Body fluids of snake are mixed into wine and consumed immediately in the form of a shot .
Snake blood wine is prepared by slicing a snake along its belly and draining its blood into a mixing vat with rice wine or grain alcohol .
Snake bile wine is done through a similar method by using the contents of the gall bladder .
Snake meat , liver , and skin can be prepared to accompany the drinks
Former Republican Congressman Tom Davis , reportedly President Barack Obama 's top candidate for cyber security czar , voted repeatedly to expand the government 's internet wiretapping powers , and helped author the now - troubled national identification law known as REAL ID .
Citing White House sources ,
Time magazine on Friday identified the the former head of the Government Reform Committee as the president 's number one candidate for the new position .
Davis ' reputation as a tech - smart moderate who knows his way around D.C. makes him an attractive pick for the administration , the magazine reported .
But an examination of Davis ' record in Congress shows that he 's been on the wrong side of key privacy issues , including the controversial REAL ID Act , which aims to turn state driver 's licenses into a de facto national identification card linked by shared databases and strict federal authentication standards .
" Given his role in REAL ID , Tom Davis would not be a good choice for privacy , which is something that President Obama specifically promised to protect in his remarks on the cyber security strategy , " says Jim Harper , the director of information policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute .
" Many cyber security planners refer obliquely to ' authentication ' and ' identity management ' programs that would devastate privacy , anonymity and civil liberties .
Davis would probably work to roll past these issues rather than solve them . "
The creation of a federal " identity management " program is one recommendation in the broad cyber security report published by the White House last month , although the report makes no specific proposals on implementing an internet I.D. card .
If picked as cyber security czar , Davis would be given the difficult and sensitive task of coordinating a government - wide strategy to secure the government 's computer networks – as well as help secure the wider internet .
That 's a job fraught with perils ranging from inter-agency disputes over territory , and significant issues about what the government 's role should be in improving security on the internet at large .
Davis , who served seven terms representing Virginia 's high tech district , was known as an outspoken moderate in an increasingly base - oriented Republican party .
He declined to run for re-election in 2008 .
In announcing the creation of the new position last month , Obama stressed that privacy was key to the government 's cyber security efforts .
But Davis ' most notable action on privacy was his failed attempt to undo a measure that put a chief privacy officer in every major government agency .
The ACLU 's legislative scorecard on Davis shows he disagrees with that group on many privacy matters .
For instance , he voted consistently to give the government wide latitude to wiretap the internet and spy on Americans ' communications .
That program , including the NSA 's massive database of emails known as " Pinwale , " made news recently again when The New York Times reported that the NSA examined Americans ' domestic e-mails without authority .
That track record would not put Davis out of the running with Obama , who , after winning his party 's nomination , embraced expanded government wiretapping powers , and voted to extend retroactive legal immunity to the telecom companies that helped the Bush 's administration 's secret spying .
Last summer , Davis joined with then - senator Obama , a wide swath of centrist Democrats , to legalize the Bush program , granting the NSA the right to gather billions of communications records of foreigners and Americans , and read Americans ' international communications without warrants .
The law includes the caveat that if a particular U.S. person is targeted , the government must get court approval .
But Davis could excel in a new role as cyber security czar , says Marc Rotenberg , who heads the Electronic Privacy Information Center .
" He 's a good pick , " Rotenberg says .
Davis gets things done , supports bipartisanship , and comes from a civilian and industry background , rather than from the shady intelligence world , according to Rotenberg .
" [ It 's ] much easier for a former House chairman to stand up to the Director of National Intelligence and the NSA than some of the other candidates , " Rotenberg says .
That will be important going forward .
Bush went through a succession of so - called cyber - security czars , who found they were either powerless or stuck in bureaucratic battles they could not win .
But Rotenberg 's organization has not always been a fan of Davis .
After 9/11 , Davis pushed for changes to open government laws that created an even larger shield for information that private companies gave to the government .
Specifically , Davis won protections for companies that run critical infrastructure – such as railroads and chemical plants – allowing them to tell the Department of Homeland Security about dangerous practices without the fear that the public could petition to see the information .
David Sobel , a Freedom of Information
Act attorney , testified against that provision in 2002 , when he worked for Rotenberg at EPIC .
" We are discussing the desire of private companies to keep secret potentially embarrassing information at a time when the disclosure practices of many in the business world are being scrutinized , " Sobel said , referring to the overstated corporate profits that were being discovered in 2002 .
" If a company is willing to fudge its financial numbers to maintain its stock price , what assurance would we have that it was not hiding behind a ' critical infrastructure ' FOIA exemption in order to conceal gross negligence in its maintenance and operation of a chemical plant or a transportation system ? "
Davis did not return a call to his office at the consulting firm Deloite .
A White House spokesman declined to comment on Davis , saying only that " no decision has been made yet , so any reporting of anyone being offered the job is not accurate . "
