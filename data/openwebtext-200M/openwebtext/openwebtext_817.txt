Problems at home , worried about losing your job in the economic crisis , or just feeling down ?
Russian medical experts have the answer – take the bus .
Travelling on Moscow 's crowded metro system is provoking a wave of despair among commuters , psychologists in the city say .
About 150 people commit suicide on the metro each year and the figures are expected to rise as more Russians are laid off and confronted with money woes .

" The roar of the oncoming train compounds stress and people have the temptation to solve all their problems with one swift movement , " psychotherapist Sergei Nazarov told the newspaper Novye Izvestia .
He also said that using the metro for long periods each day could lead to panic attacks and a paranoid fear about being followed .
In neighbouring Ukraine , the authorities are also worried about the metro blues .
Regular electricity shortages mean that often only half the lights in the metro are lit , and the Kiev operators are so worried about an increase in suicides that dramatic measures are being taken .
All the " No Exit " signs are to be removed , because of the negative moods they can induce in commuters , reports Novye Izvestia .
And there are plans to re-record the on-train announcements that the doors are closing using a child 's voice , to promote a happier atmosphere .
The Moscow metro , much of which was built during Stalin 's reign , is one of the most efficient in the world .
Many of the stations are stunningly opulent " people 's palaces " , built in a socialist realist style .
Nevertheless , using the metro can be stressful because of overcrowding and poor air quality .
A metro spokesman , Dmitry Gaev , said the number of passengers each day has decreased by 200,000 over the past few months , probably as a result of recent job losses .
But he added that about 9 million people still used the metro system every day , so the drop in passenger numbers was hardly noticeable .
Foreigners and Russians from the provinces who move to Moscow often complain about overcrowding on the metro .
Considerations of personal space are put to one side as passengers rush to fill the cars before the doors close .
The tide of human traffic is such that the drivers often do n't wait for everyone to board the train before shutting the doors , often leading to an undignified scrum .

Dizzyingly long escalators lead down to the stations , which are some of the deepest in the world .
Many were built with the idea that they could function as shelters in the event of a nuclear attack .
The air quality so far below street level is very poor – many of the ventilation shafts are positioned close to main roads , meaning that the air inside the metro stations is polluted .
The situation is even worse for metro workers , who clock up 12 - hour shifts deep under the streets of the Russian capital .
In addition to the health risks of breathing in polluted air , they also suffer from the stress of being underground for so long .
" Over time every single station employee or driver gets ill in some way or another , " says Svetlana Razina , the leader of the Metro Workers ' Union .
But for all the problems associated with the metro , Muscovites are sceptical about suggestions to use alternative forms of transport .
" Using the metro is really unpleasant , " said Dmitry Sharapov , 29 , who spends 45 minutes underground each morning and evening to get to and from work .
" But what 's the alternative ?
Drive , or take the bus ?
It would take me twice as long and there would be just as much pollution .
If it did n't lead me to suicide , it would probably lead me to murder . "

Two influential English economists argued as much today at the International Scientific Congress on Climate Change .
In a morning plenary talk , Nicholas Stern of the London School of Economics and Political Science explained the reasons why he's more optimistic about the likelihood of a new , effective global climate agreement today than he was two years ago : the rapid advancement of low - carbon technology , the deepening of public awareness , the Obama administration 's commitment to cutting greenhouse - gas emissions to 80 percent of 1990 levels by 2050 -- and the fact that the recession provides an opening for completely remaking the global energy economy .
" It should be easier because we have an economic crisis , " he said .
Labor is cheap , after all .
That will make it cheaper to hire the workers to , for instance , rebuild the electrical grid in both the U.S. and Europe .
Besides , he argued , the financial crisis offers a clear lesson .
With this financial catastrophe fresh in our minds , we should realize more than ever that if we wait to address a looming crisis , it will bite us that much harder in the end .
The announcement last week that Trader Monthly magazine was ceasing publication was one of those moments when a chance arrow of history scores a perfect bull 's eye on a deserving target .
The current recession , brought on at least in part by Wall Street 's bonus lust , has claimed countless innocent victims .
But in this case it has finally delivered a comeuppance to our era's loudest , gaudiest , cockiest champion of Wall Street excess .

The Sheikh family signs papers to close on their first home .

Islamic law does make exceptions to the ban on interest , if one 's family is at stake .
But the exceptions are open to interpretation and for many observant Muslims , conventional mortgages are strictly taboo .
Nawawi
Sheikh is one of them .
The Somali -American says he and his wife just could n't go against their beliefs , even if it meant giving up their dream of owning a home .
Still , he grew tired of moving from one rented apartment to another .
" One thing I hated was moving .
I do n't like to move all the time , " he says .
He has no plans to move again anytime soon .
Sheikh is the first home buyer to get a loan through the state 's New Markets Mortgage Program .
That 's because , program manager Nimo Farah says , he has all the makings of a successful homeowner .
" I had lots of applications , but he 's the first one , because really , he was ready .
He has been working at the same job for quite a while ; he took care of his credit ; he had the right size family , and he had all his documents together , " she said .
" He was basically ready to go . "
Real estate broker Tunde Shonoiki ( left ) helped Nawawi Sheikh close on his first home in Minneapolis .
Sheikh 's monthly mortgage payment will be lower than what he 's been paying to rent in Hopkins , even with taxes and insurance included .

The program is targeted at low - to - moderate income families .
Qualified applicants have to complete first - time home buyer education classes .
The goal is to help Muslim home buyers build wealth and reap the benefits of home ownership .
Here 's how the mortgage , known as Murabaha financing or " cost plus sale , " works :
The state buys a home and resells it to the buyer at a higher price .
The down payment and monthly installments are agreed to up front at current mortgage rates .
The deal is identical to a thirty - year fixed - rate loan , except there 's no additional interest , because the higher up front price factors in payments that would have been made over the life of a traditional mortgage .
A handful of private banks and lending institutions offer Islamic mortgages in the U.S. , but Minnesota Housing is the first state agency to offer such a product .
The program is the brainchild of Hussein Samatar , director of the African Development Center in Minneapolis .
" The process is different , but the outcome will look the same , " Samatar says .
" We wanted to be as conventional as possible , while respecting the tenets of Islam . "
The African Development Center of Minnesota has been working for more than five years to launch the Islamic lending program .

Samatar , who used to work for Wells Fargo , tried for years to launch Islamic financing .
He says the fact that Minnesota Housing has agreed to participate is a nod to the Muslim community 's growing economic power .
Chicago - based Devon Bank is underwriting the loans for the New Markets program .
Devon is one of the largest Islamic lenders in the country .
Corporate Counsel David Loundy says he expects the demand for Islamic financing to grow as more Muslims make their home in the U.S. Loundy says Muslims tend to be good risks .
" If they worked so hard to get to this country , they do n't want to screw it up now that they are here , so they tend to pay their debts pretty promptly , " said Loundy .
" In addition , you have a population that is religiously and culturally predisposed against having debt , so they want to pay down their debts as quickly as they can . "
The numbers back this up .
In its five and a half years offering Islamic lending , Loundy says Devon Bank has n't lost a penny , though he admits the recession could make that record difficult to sustain as more borrowers face job loss .
But the bad economy is also offering opportunity .
With housing prices at rock bottom , officials say the timing could n't be better to match first time Muslim buyers with foreclosures that need new owners .
Nawawi Sheikh 's new three - bedroom South Minneapolis home is a former foreclosure .
The African Development Center 's Hussein Samatar says there are thousands more potential buyers like Sheikh out there .
He says the New Markets Mortgage Program will help the Minnesota Muslims community put down strong roots .
" It is great news for the country , and it really sends a great signal that the United States is our country , " he said , " and we would love to make it better . "
Samatar says he has 10 more qualified buyers already lined up .
He plans to close on two or three more homes with Islamic financing over the next few months .

As space junk crashing to Earth becomes more and more common , I can't help but wonder who will be liable for damages it causes .
If a chunk of a satellite or rocket crushes your car or injures you , who is responsible ?
The creator of the space vehicle ?
The launch facility ?
Somebody has to pay those damages .

On Jan. 29 , 1839 , in the little chapel in the English village of Maer , a religious , 30 - year - old woman named Emma Wedgwood put on a green silk dress and got married .
She believed firmly in a heaven and a hell .
And she believed you had to accept God to go to heaven .
She married Charles Darwin .
As we head into a new era for a country that has struggled for too long with the marriage of science and religion , we should take a look at the marriage of Charles and Emma Darwin .
When Charles came home in 1836 from his five - year voyage around the world , which included the visit to the Galapagos Islands , he was already seeing life and creation in a new way .
And as he courted Emma , he also was secretly scribbling notes about a new idea , his theory of evolution , in leather - bound notebooks marked “ private . ”
He knew that his view of creation would rock the faith of Emma and almost everyone in England , and as he prepared to propose to her , he agonized .
Charles ’ father advised him to keep his mouth shut .
“ Conceal your doubts , ” he warned .
But Charles could n’t do that .
He was too honest .
He told Emma of his doubts about the veracity of the Bible and of his growing skepticism about religion .
Emma said she would marry him anyway .
She prized his candor , and she knew he was a good and moral man .
But in a letter she sent him soon after their engagement , she told him that she was sad that “ our opinions on the most important subject should differ widely . ”
This was the first of several letters about religion that Emma wrote to Charles during their lives .
She urged him not to close the door on faith .
And she shared her fears that they would be separated for eternity .
Charles always listened to what she had to say , and they talked about the problem .
He kept each letter close .
He wrote on one of them , “ When I am dead , know that many times , I have kissed and cryed over this .
C.D. ” On another he wrote , simply , “ God bless you . ”
Charles and Emma had 10 children together .
Three of the children died ; the death of their beloved 10 - year - old daughter , Annie , broke their hearts .
That loss could have driven them apart forever .
It strengthened Emma ’s faith and all but closed the door on God for Charles .
But they fought for their marriage .
The day after Annie died , Emma wrote to Charles , “ You must remember that you are my prime treasure ( and always have been ) . ”
Darwin worked for decades on his theory .
He tried to make his argument as strong and solid as possible , and he also aimed not to offend .
He showed Emma drafts , and he worked harder on a passage when she wrote in the margin , “ a great assumption . ”
In 1859 , as he finally readied “ The Origin of Species ” for publication , he gave the manuscript to Emma .
She was always his best and most trusted editor .
As she read the argument that essentially took God out of creation , she did not ask Charles to soften it at all .
In fact , she helped him strengthen his book by making the language clearer .
( She also cleaned up his spelling and punctuation . )
Through the years , the two continued to talk and listen to each other about this “ most important subject , ” as Emma called it .
She encouraged him not to approach religion in the same way he approached science .
What leads to faith , she said , is “ feeling , not reasoning . ”
After he became famous , people often wrote to the sage of Down House and asked him what he believed about God. Usually Darwin demurred .
And he echoed Emma .
He said his views were of “ no consequence to anyone except myself ” and that the question of religion was for theologians , not for scientists .
Still , he often pointed to his friend , the American botanist Asa Gray , who was both an evolutionist and a theist .
Charles and Emma were married for 43 years .
In his last years , Charles renewed a fascination with worms and wrote “ The Formation of Vegetable Mold through the Action of Worms with Observations on Their Habits , ” a bestseller in its day .
Emma , never much interested in science , found herself joining him in his obsession .
They spent hours together watching the worms in the garden of Down House , side by side .
Although they never were able to see eye - to - eye on the question of religion and God , they were able to reach their hands across the gulf .
In the end , each of them accepted and , it seems , truly understood what the other believed .
If it is a sign of intelligence to be able to hold two opposite thoughts or opinions in your head , then it is a mark of a successful marriage to be able to truly see the other person ’s point of view .
This is also the mark of a successful society .
There is an apocryphal story that Darwin accepted God on his deathbed .
The true story is this :
When he suffered his last and fatal heart attack , Charles told Emma that he was “ not the least afraid of death . ”
And as he slipped away , he told her , “ Remember what a good wife you have been to me . ”
Emma held Charles in her arms as he died .

RENO , Nev. , Feb. 6 ( UPI ) -- Nevada state Sen .
Bob Coffin says his state should make brothels legal statewide and tax them to help wipe out a $ 2 billion budget shortfall .
Nevada is the only U.S. state with legalized prostitution , but brothels are only allowed in rural counties and pay county taxes only .
Coffin proposes that prostitution be decriminalized and that the state get a cut of their revenues , ABC reported Friday .

" People are licensed to gamble , " said Coffin , a Democrat .
" They are licensed to sell cigarettes .
They are licensed to sell alcohol .
Why not license everything we consider a vice ? "
Coffin said by allowing brothels to open up in Las Vegas , Reno and other cities , the state could reap up to $ 200 million a year in taxes to apply toward the budget shortfall .
Dennis Hof , owner of the Moonlite BunnyRanch licensed brothel , told ABC he is a big fan of the prostitution legalization and taxing proposal .
" I think they are right on the money .
I 'm glad they 're doing it , because prostitution is everywhere in Las Vegas under the guise of escort agencies , " Hof said .
GLOOMY days , these , for English cricket .
On February 7th the England Test ( international ) side was skittled out for 51 runs , its third - lowest total in 132 years and 880 matches , as it slid to ignominious defeat against the West Indies , one of the lowest - ranked Test sides in the world .
England may be useless , but they 're not worthless .
The previous day , some of the players were auctioned — that 's right , by a man with a gavel — for the second season of the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) , a six - week tournament of short matches ( lasting around three - and - a - half hours each ) which begins in April .
The services of England 's two great crowd - pleasers , Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen ( pictured above ) , fetched $ 1.55 m apiece .
A third member of the team scooped $ 275,000 .
For cricketers , these are huge sums — and the top price has gone up since last year .
There is little hint of global recession there .
You might conclude the same from other sports , even in shrinking economies .
The average price of television - advertising slots during this month 's Super Bowl , American football 's ultimate prize , was even higher than in 2008 .
And on February 6th the Premier League , the top tier of English football , said it had sold domestic live broadcasting rights for three seasons from August 2010 for nearly £ 1.8 billion ( $ 2.6 billion ) , 5 % more than the existing deal .
Deloitte , a consulting firm , paints a broadly positive picture of European football in a report this week ( see article ) .
Sport is not immune to economic woe .
As Deloitte notes , the shirts of Premier League teams offer a brief history of the credit crunch : Newcastle United 's sponsor is Northern Rock , a nationalised bank ; Manchester United sport the initials of American International Group , an insurance company now owned by the American government ; and West Ham went logoless for three months after XL , a travel company , went bust .
On February 4th the Detroit Pistons , an American basketball team , failed to sell out a home game for the first time in five seasons .
And although NBC , the Super Bowl 's broadcaster , increased average advertising revenues , says Jason Maltby of Mindshare , a marketing and media consultancy , it struggled with the last few slots .
Yet leading sports are , by and large , standing up to recession better than most .
They have two big advantages .
It helps , first , to be able to sell broadcasters and sponsors what they crave in a world of myriad channels : lots of dedicated viewers .
This advantage may even rise in a downturn .
As recession grips , fans may decide that season tickets are too great a luxury , but they will cling on to their television subscriptions .
The other advantage is timing , which is just as important in the business of sport as it is on the field of play .
Long - term broadcasting contracts help to lay a good base of revenue and some sports are in the early days of such deals .
The IPL , for instance , started out with a ten - year , $ 1 billion agreement .
In America the National Basketball Association is in the first season of eight - year contracts worth $ 7.5 billion .
With a sought - after event , it is possible to plan ahead — beyond , with luck , today 's troubles .
The International Olympic Committee is already negotiating for the 2014 winter and 2016 summer games .
So far it has struck separate deals for Italy and Turkey , rather than sell all European rights to the European Broadcasting Union as in the past , and has done rather better from them .
Not all sporting activities can rise above today 's troubles .
Away from the top table of sport , times look harder .
Stefan Szymanski , an economist at Cass Business School in London , notes that sport is like any other industry : “ All recessions are about consolidation , ” he says .
The IPL is “ pretty much recession - proof ” ; English county cricket looks much less robust .
Of course there are winners and losers .
Even at the top , not all is rosy .
Mr Maltby detects “ cracks ” in sponsorship as well as advertising .
For example , cars in the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing , or NASCAR , are no longer festooned with logos over every square inch .
Some NASCAR teams have merged and selling the right to be a sport 's official beer , say , may get harder .
This is not a good time to be looking for a sponsor to name a new stadium or for a lender to finance it .
But the world of sport can console itself .
In hard times people need escapism more than ever , it seems .
They like heroes to watch and cheer .
And still they are willing to pay .
On several occasions over the past several months , we ’ve seen Ron Paul in Congressional Committee hearings questioning men like Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke ( see here , here , here , here , and here , ) , Obama economic adviser Paul Volcker , and , most recently , Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner .
Without fail , those encounters take the form of Paul spending two - thirds or more of his alloted five minutes espousing his own views on the subject of the hearing , and then throwing a question , sometimes a question that has little to do with the subject of the hearing itself to the official , usually without sufficient time for a real answer , never mind a follow - up question .
It makes for fun YouTube viewing , no doubt , and I ’ve posted many of those encounters on my personal blog , but does it really accomplish anything ?
One libertarian blogger thinks not :
Another rambling , indirect , wasteful performance today by Ron Paul .
He gets 5 minutes to question Geithner , and should have asked him about his comments to the CFR regarding the dollar , or any of the hundred other pressing issues of the day , but instead he has another ad lib ramble about innocent until proven guilty , which Geithner easily evades without saying anything meaningful . ( … ) [ W ] hen he gets a few minutes to challenge those in power , he turns into an ideologue and a wallflower and it is immensely frustrating .
(…)
Ron is not speaking to a friendly audience where he can deliver the same lines and stories over and over , but he ’s there as an investigator and an interrogator .
I appreciate everything Ron Paul has exposed me to , and his personal sacrifices to further liberty , but it ’s not hard to see how a guy can be punchless in the Congress for so long , when he just ca n’t ask a few direct questions , and insists upon going on and on about abstract moral and ethical issues that do n’t even relate to the hearings .
What a wasted opportunity .
And opportunities are so few they ca n’t be squandered so carelessly .
The post goes on to compare Paul ’s questioning , unfavorably , to that of European Parliament Member Daniel Hannan , who became famous last week for delivering a devastating take - down of British Prime Minister Gordon Brown .
On some level , I think the comparison is unfair .
First , because Hannan was speaking speaking before the European Parliament during “ question time ” , not asking questions in a committee hearing ( it would be more fair , then , to compair Hannan ’s speech with one of Ron Paul ’s speeches before the full house ( see here , here , and here ) .
Second , because , well , everything sounds better with a British accent ; which is why you ’ll never see James Bond played by an American actor .
That said , I think the blogger at No Treason has a point .
These Congressional Committee hearings are one of the few opportunities that the American public , through their elected representatives , has to confront the Executive Branch about what it is doing .
Spending half , or more , of your allotted time on obscure philosophical arguments does n’t really seem to me to accomplish much of anything .
The libertarian movement is in desperate need of spokesman that can not only explain it ’s ideas to a wider public , but also to challenge those on the other side in a manner that actually gets the point across .
Ron Paul is n’t exactly the guy for the job .

Mr. Henriques is Professor of History , Emeritus , at George Mason University and author of Realistic Visionary : A Portrait of George Washington .
One of the most widely held myths about George Washington is that immediately after he took the prescribed oath to become the nation ’s first President , he solemnly added the words , “ So help me God ” and thus began a tradition that has been followed ever since .
Unfortunately , this myth , accepted by such fine historians as David McCullough and Kenneth C. Davis , is given further credence in a video released by The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies maintained by the Senate Rules Committee .
Entitled ' So Help Me God , ' it shows president after president uttering the words and authoritatively declares that George Washington first used the phrase .
In fact , an examination of the historical evidence demonstrates that such a claim is almost certainly false .
There is absolutely no extant contemporary evidence that President Washington altered the language of the oath as laid down in Article 2 , Section 1 of the Constitution : “ I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my Ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . ”
A long letter by the French foreign minister Comte de Moustier , who attended the ceremony , repeated the oath verbatim and did not include the additional words .
Apparently , it was not until 65 years after the event that the story that Washington added this phrase first appeared in a published volume .
In his book , The Republican Court , Rufus Griswold cited a childhood memory of Washington Irving as his source .
It took another 27 years before the first clearly documented case of a President adding the words , “ So help me God , ” was recorded — when Chester A. Arthur took the oath in 1881 .
Moreover , it would have been completely out of character for George Washington to have tampered with the constitutional text in this way .
He presided over the Constitutional Convention held in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787 , and he took the Constitution produced there very seriously .
He was , in many ways , a Constitutional literalist .
Would such a man , during the very act of becoming the nation ’s first President , alter an oath that had been decided upon and written into the nation ’s fundamental charter ?
It is far more likely that his political philosophy , and not his religious beliefs , shaped his actions in this incident .
Proponents of the myth contend that Washington had expressed no personal objection to saying “ So help me God ” and had routinely taken such oaths during the colonial era .
Perhaps , they contend , he simply added it as an afterthought or because he was caught up in the solemnity and reverence of the moment .
While at first glance this is plausible , it seems certain that any such modification of the oath would have created comment at the time that would have survived in the historical record .
The reason for this assertion is at exactly the same time as these inaugural events were unfolding , the first Congress was debating what oath the new members of the new federal government should take so as to comply with the Constitution .
Article Six called for an oath but specifically added , “ No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States . ”
Early arrivals to the House of Representatives had taken an oath that included the words , “ So help me God . ”
But , following the lead of a committee led by James Madison , legislators passed a new oath act on April 27 , 1789 — just three days before Washington ’s inauguration — that excluded the words “ So help me God . ”
The Senate , after adding unrelated amendments , passed the bill on May 5 , 1789 .
Would the Senate have passed an oath bill without the words , “ So help me God , ” only five days after the great hero of the American people “ solemnly ” and “ with fervor ” added them to his own oath ?
And do so without any contemporary comment surviving ?
Taken together , the complete lack of contemporary evidence , George Washington ’s political philosophy of strictly following the Constitution and the concurrent debate over the proper wording of oaths under the new Constitution make it virtually certain that George Washington did not add the words “ So help me God ” to his inaugural oath .
Does it make any difference whether he added the words or not ?
Beyond a historian ’s desire to reconstruct the past as accurately as possible , I think the story has pertinence to our current debate over the proper relationship between the national government and religion .
Joseph Story in his Commentaries on the Constitution , first published in 1833 , explained why the clause banning religious test oaths was included .
Its main object , he wrote , was “ to cut off forever every pretence of any alliance between church and state in the national government .
The framers of the constitution were fully sensible of the dangers from this source . ”
The issue in this case is not whether the founding fathers were religious .
Many were .
George Washington kissed the Bible on which he took his oath , and he and other government officials immediately attended religious services at Saint Paul ’s church following his inaugural address .
The issue that concerned them was what role the national government should play in religion .
James Madison made the view of most of the founders clear during the ratification debate in Virginia .
“ There is not a shadow of right in the general government to intermeddle with religion .
Its least interference with it would be a most flagrant violation . ”
It 's the end of the line for Citigroup .

Vikram Pandit is unraveling his empire to save his bank .
Citigroup Inc.’s chief executive officer said yesterday he would cede control of the Smith Barney brokerage to Morgan Stanley .
Pandit may also dump the CitiFinancial consumer - lending unit , tag Tokyo - based Nikko Asset Management Co. for eventual sale and rein in trading with the bank ’s own capital , people familiar with the matter said .
Some current and former Citigroup executives place the blame for the firm ’s troubles on Weill .
He refused to spend enough on technology and failed to integrate the new companies he acquired , say people familiar with the matter .
“ Each business has been operating with its own back office , ” Pandit told investors and analysts gathered in New York on May 9 .
“ We have 140,000 people in IT and operations .
We have 16 database standards .
We have 25,000 developers .
This results not only in waste but does n’t give us any opportunity to leverage our organization .
That ’s massively inefficient .
We ’re finally going to merge it all . ”
Goodbye Citigroup , Hello Citibank .
Kiss Citigroup goodbye , at least as you now know it .
Let 's see if Citigroup 's card unit is next on the block .
Let 's also watch how many heads roll in a sale of Smith Barney to Morgan Stanley .
Citigroup IT jobs At Risk
Capital Drought
Time and again , big banks such as Citigroup Inc. argued that irrational and seized - up markets , not the woeful state of their balance sheets , were to blame for convulsing share prices .
For more than 18 months , the government went along with that thinking .
Instead of demanding that banks recognize their losses , overhaul operations and quickly raise equity from private sources , regulators bet a flood of money would unclog credit markets .
When that did n’t work , the government doled out billions of dollars to more than 100 banks through the Troubled Assets Relief Program , or TARP , again with few demands that banks take harsh medicine .
That has n’t done the trick either .
The reason is pretty simple .
This has never been a liquidity crisis .
It ’s a capital crisis .
Namely , investors do n’t think banks have enough of it , especially when it comes to tangible common equity .
Citigroup is a dramatic example .
Its tangible common equity was 2.41 percent of tangible assets at the end of the third quarter .
That was too low for investors ’ liking and below peers such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co .
Citigroup 's Equity Is A Mirage

Dear Cecil :
We were having a heated argument the other day that it 's impossible to clap without using both hands .
But then someone piped up that the Chinese have found a way of clapping using one hand only .
Can they do it ?
Can anyone ?
Frank N. , Baltimore
Cecil replies :
I notice , Frank , that you hail from Baltimore , a city whose residents fall into one of two categories , in my observation : ( 1 ) persons of exceeding wit and ingenuity , and ( 2 ) complete idiots .
Your letter , quite honestly , lends itself equally well to either interpretation .
Let ’s start with the latter .
(1) You ’re an idiot .
There ’s this thing called a joke , Frank , that you should become acquainted with .
A joke is a display of cleverness intended to engender yux .
Some people , however , require advance warning if they ’re to recognize a joke when they see one , e.g. , a siren , large firecracker , or gong .
Clearly your so - called friends could stand a lesson in thoughtfulness .
For further insight , see ( 2 ) below .
(2) You ’re a person of exceeding wit and ingenuity , and your letter is actually a coy recasting of a famous Zen Buddhist koan , or riddle , such as Zen masters use to instruct their pupils .
The koan in question , devised by the Japanese Zen master Hakuin ( 1686 - 1769 ) , is as follows :
In clapping both hands , a sound is heard .
What is the sound of one hand ?
( In casual discussion this is usually corrupted to : What is the sound of one hand clapping ? )
Unsophisticated persons are generally inclined to answer with something like “ half a clap , ” which signifies that they have not yet achieved Buddha nature .
After several years of dedicated meditating , however , they learn the correct response , which is to face the questioner , assume an appropriate Buddhist posture , and without a word thrust one hand forward .
I learn this from The Sound of the One Hand : 281 Zen Koans With Answers by Hau Hoo , which is my idea of an admirably no-bullshit approach to cosmic enlightenment .
I realize the allegedly correct response in this case is on the enigmatic side , but that ’s Zen Buddhism for you .
It ’s by ruminating assiduously on such mysteries that we learn to free our minds from the strictures of linear thinking and grasp the essence of the void .
Other effective methods of combating linear thinking are Quaaludes and old Magnum P.I. reruns , two excellent examples of the way modern technology enriches ancient religious practice .
The other Zen koan you may want to take note of is said to have been composed by the Japanese Zen master Joshu ( 778-897 ) , and goes as follows : Does a dog have Buddha nature ?
The correct answer is Mooooo , uttered in a sort of plaintive bellow .
In the interest of technical accuracy I should mention that the conventional spelling is Mu , which is Zen Buddhist for “ a question too dumb to be worth answering . ”
However , Mooooo works better for us midwesterners .
Anyway , Frank , I ’m glad you brought up the subject .
We cannot learn about foreign cultures unless we ask .

From 8 a.m. to around 3:15 p.m. yesterday , an unidentified nude twentysomething man , reported to be suicidal , sat 50 feet in the air atop the cross at West Bethel Presbyterian Church on La Brea Ave. between Wilshire and Olympic .
He finally came down after a seven hour confrontation with the fire and police departments ( including SWAT ) , who had placed an air cushion on the ground in case he fell and a ladder for him to climb down on , which he used .
Photographer Jonathan Alcorn got some interesting , to say the least , photos and David Markland at LA MetBlogs found a video of it on Youtube ( watch it below the jump ) .
Last September in New York City , a naked man on a fire escape died after police tasered him .
He fell 10 feet to the ground with nothing to catch him below .
After it was announced that the taser use broke department rules , the officer who ordered the tasering killed himself and the officer who executed the action was promoted .
* Update : A witness told KTLA that the man told her he was " protesting against Christianity . "
He apparently climbed up clothed , but stripped and threw is clothes down .
His only request during the standoff was a towel to wipe his hands clean after wiping his waste on the cross .
An officer told the TV station that one of the crimes he would be arrested for was defacing a church , which is a felony .
Word has it that the Senate has a compromise stimulus plan ready , but the details are being held up while negotiations are still in progress .
We might not know what is in the package , but we ’ve seen plenty of trial balloons over the last couple of weeks .
Here are my thoughts on those ideas , both as stimulus and as good policy .
I ’ve provided a grade for both and these grades represent only my thoughts .
Critical infrastructure project spending ( Stimulus : A+ , Policy A + )
This one is a no- brainer for Congress and you could easily spend a trillion dollars on just this alone if Congress has sufficient desire .
Infrastructure spending results in the direct creation of jobs and the purchase of mostly local materials .
Infrastructure improvements directly benefit the economy by laying the groundwork for more efficient use of resources as in roads , electrical grid or data grid improvements or by minimizing loss with levy improvements and wildfire control .
Non-critical infrastructure project spending ( Stimulus A , Policy C )
Non-critical infrastructure is my friendly term for a certain type of pork .
But pork is bad , right ??
For most people , pork is only bad if it is not in their district .
Still , pork is stimulus for the same reasons that critical infrastructure spending is .
Almost by definition , the spending is very localized , it stays in the US economy and generates local jobs .
What makes it bad policy is that the future benefits of pork spending are secondary to the local , short term impact .
That new VA hospital might be useful , but not in a district with no veterans .
The center to study frisbee dynamics at the local university ?
Those research dollars might allow the college to keep a couple of professors on the payroll and maybe avoid a tuition increase next year .
Will it generate the type of sustaining , well paying industries that might have been spawned from putting that money in stem cell research ?
Probably not .
Still , that bridge to no where is valuable to the folks living in no where and some projects are too big for local governments even if they have great local value .
Pork does n’t always have to be bad .
Incentive payments for purchases ( Stimulus : C , Policy D )
There ’s talk of a $ 15,000 credit to new home buyers and possibly a credit for car purchases as well .
On the home owner front , this will certainly allow some renters who are close to moving into home ownership to make the leap .
It will also prop up home prices since sellers will know that buyers have this incentive and price their homes accordingly .
Buyers and sellers with a little more cash might go out and buy a little more , but peope are afraid to spend and this type of credit is a very indirect way to stimulate the economy .
It also does n’t increase sales , just moves them up .
Car and home buyers taking advantage of the credit are probably already in the market and would make a purchase in the next year or two .
By incenting them to buy now , you get a short term boost , but drain the pool of buyers for the next couple of years .
Increased “ safety net ” payments ( Stimulus D , Policy A )
With more people out of work , there is a lot of talk about extending unemployment benefits are making shifts in the tax code to help those at the bottom of the spectrum .
The children ’s health insurance program , SCHIP , has already been extended .
In terms of stimulus , this is not going to do much .
Many people in this situation have reduced their spending as far as they can and they are getting by on credit .
More government support will allow them to limit the debt spiral , but it wo n’t make them spend any more money .
But in terms of policy , this is a home run .
The rapid increase in the unemployed is the first pebble in an avalanche that could overwhelm our social systems .
The demands of high unemployment suck up all the available oxygen at the state level , killing other necessary programs and forcing cutbacks in other areas where we need more spending , not less .
Increasing government support in this area limits this disruption and provides enough time for the shocks to be absorbed by the states .
General tax breaks or credits ( Stimulus F , Policy F )
I love low taxes as much as the next guy , but in the situation we ’re in now , they have no stimulus effect .
I ’m sure my Republican friends would disagree , but the whole idea of the stimulus is for the government to make up for the lack of private sector spending .
The private sector is not spending because of fear .
Some of that fear is very reasonable ( “ will I have a job tomorrow ? ” ) and some is irrational ( “ things are bad ! ” ) .
In a mild recessionary situation , tax breaks add a little more to the banking account and provide a little “ wealth effect ” spending , but all the tax breaks in the world are not going to alleviate the fear running through the economy .
People are hoarding their dollars and if you give them a small tax break , they will just hoard it also .
Without spending , there is not stimulus .
From a policy point of view , tax breaks are also terrible .
Over the last couple of decades and especially under the Bush administration , Americans have come to believe that the federal government has tons of money and can do everything without any contribution from them .
You really do n’t see this on a local level .
Communities that lay out reasonable , transparent bond referendums for education or recreation generally are successful in getting the votes they need to move forward .
People understand that services must be paid for .
We ’ve lost that sense at the federal level .
Tax breaks at this point would further undermine the idea that we pay for what we receive .
Increased Higher Education Spending ( Stimulus : B , Policy A )
OK , no one is really talking about this … but they should .
Our economy is changing and our population has to change to meet the need .
The GI Bill after WWII was one of the most successful long term spending efforts ever implemented by the US government .
What was a huge spending program at the time reaped an entire generation of well educated , productive employees who went out and grew the US economy into the juggernut that it is today , even in recession .
If you consider human capital as part of our country ’s infrasturcture , this is a way to invest in that direction with proven long term results .
Create an opportunity for all of those unemployed workers to go back to school and get the training they need to really succeed .
It takes them off the unemployment lines immediately and pours money into their communities .
If you combine it with a living stipend , you can make it possible for displaced workers with families to pursue new opportunites .
When the economy needs them in a couple of years , they ’ll be ready .
Todd Palin held in contempt of Alaska state Senate Mike Sheehan

The husband of 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate Gov. Sarah Palin has been found guilty of contempt by the Alaskan Senate .
Last summer , Todd Palin and others had refused to comply with subpoenas issued by Alaska lawmakers seeking testimony in the " Troopergate " investigation launched in July , triggered by the allegedly forced resignation of a state official .
The official , Walt Monegan , had been reluctant to fire an Alaska state trooper who was Gov. Palin 's brother - in - law , embroiled in a bitter custody battle with Palin 's sister .
According to the Anchorage Daily News issue of 8 October 2008 , Todd Palin " talked with over a dozen state officials , many of them repeatedly , in his crusade to get a state trooper fired whom he considered to be a bad cop , a dishonest person and a threat to the Palin family , " per a sworn statement given to a legislative investigator .
At the time the investigation began , Gov. Palin " welcomed the chance to clear the air and had directed her staff to cooperate with the investigations , " writes Alaskan blogger Shannyn Moore .
But " everything changed " when just weeks later , GOP presidential nominee Sen.
John McCain chose Palin as his running mate .
Despite Todd Palin 's later refusal to comply with the subpoena , he was not subject to contempt charges until the full Alaska Senate reconvened in January 2009 -- weeks after Election Day .
This morning , the Alaska Senate resolution holding Palin et al. in contempt passed 16 to 1 , per Moore 's blog .
The resolution " did not address the actions of [ Palin appointee ] Attorney General Talis Colberg , " instead calling for " no penalties to the [ seven ] witnesses because they were being guided by the Attorney General " and did cooperate with lead " Troopergate " investigator Stephen Branchflower after Colberg 's challenge to the subpoenas was thrown out of court .
With the election over and losing candidate Palin largely out of the spotlight she dominated during the runup to November , the attention to " Troopergate " has similarly dissipated , as evidenced by today 's proceedings in the Alaska Senate .
" There was very little discussion on the floor , " Moore writes .
Gov. Palin probably prefers it that way , as she is often mentioned as a leading candidate for the GOP nomination in 2012 .
In our interview on Friday , one of the questions I asked Joe Stiglitz was : if it ’s so obvious that all this Tarp 2 / Bailout stuff is a bad idea and not going to work , why do we keep coming back to it ?
Here ’s his answer …
Russian teens have now new fun .
They dare trains .
This is needed to be done fast , because if one is appearing before the train too long before and machinist could see him and start breaking , so they run on the rails just before the train so he could n’t start breaking and fell down on the rails , then the train moves above the person at his maximum speed , just a few inches from his head and back .
Russian teen girls seem to go for this too .
( CNN ) -- Israeli soldiers routinely and intentionally put children in harm 's way during their 22 - day offensive against the Palestinians in Gaza , according to a United Nations report made public Monday .
On March 6 , a Palestinian boy sits on the rubble of a building destroyed during Israel 's 22 - day Gaza offensive .
The report said a working group had documented and verified reports of violations " too numerous to list . "
For example , on January 15 , in a town southwest of Gaza City , Israel Defense Forces soldiers ordered an 11 - year - old boy to open Palestinians ' packages , presumably so that the soldiers would not be hurt if they turned out to contain explosives , the 43 - page report said .
They then forced the boy to walk in front of them in the town , it said .
When the soldiers came under fire , " the boy remained in front of the group , " the report said .
It said the boy was later released .
Also cited were " credible reports " that accused Hamas , the militant Palestinian group that runs Gaza , of using human shields and placing civilians at risk .
But it singled out the Israelis for more sweeping criticism .
A spokesman for the Israeli prime minister called the report another example of the " one - sided and unfair " attitude of the U.N. Human Rights Council , which requested it .
The report cited two alleged incidents from January 3 .
In one , it said , after a tank round struck near a house , a father and his two sons -- both younger than 11 -- emerged to look at the damage .
" As they exited their home , IDF soldiers shot and killed them ( at the entrance to their house ) , with the daughter witnessing , " the report said .
In the second , it said , " Israeli soldiers entered a family house in the Zeitoun neighborhood of Gaza City .
Standing at the doorstep , they asked the male head of the household to come out and shot him dead , without warning , while he was holding his ID , hands raised up in the air , and then started to fire indiscriminately and without warning into the room where the rest of the family was huddled together .
" The eldest son was shouting in vain the word ' Children ' in Hebrew to warn the soldiers .
The shooting did not stop until everyone was lying on the floor .
The mother and four of the brothers , aged 2 - 12 years , had been wounded , one of them , aged 4 , fatally . "
The alleged instances occurred during Operation Cast Lead , which was launched December 27 to halt rocket attacks into southern Israel from Gaza and ended January 17 with a cease - fire .
The U.N. report called the response by Israel disproportionate .
Of the 1,453 people estimated killed in the conflict , 1,440 were Palestinian , including 431 children and 114 women , the report said .
The 13 Israelis killed included three civilians and six soldiers killed by Hamas , and four soldiers killed by friendly fire , it said .
The report said the Israeli operation resulted in " a dramatic deterioration of the living conditions of the civilian population . "
It cited " targeted and indiscriminate " attacks on hospitals and clinics , water and sewage treatment facilities , government buildings , utilities and farming and said the offensive " intensified the already catastrophic humanitarian situation of the Palestinian people . "
It said Israeli strikes damaged more than 200 schools and left more than 70,000 people homeless .
" There are strong and credible reports of war crimes and other violations of international norms , " it said , adding that many observers have said war crimes investigations should be undertaken .
" The alternative is de facto impunity , " it said .
It called for the end of Israel 's blockade of Gaza and the free passage into the territory of food , medicine , fuel and construction supplies .
Mark Regev , a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , called the report " another example of the one - sided and unfair attitude of the rapporteur of the Human Rights Council , a council that has been criticized by current and previous secretaries - general for its unbalanced attitudes toward Israel . "
He added , " The negative fixation on Israel by the council has done a disservice to the issue of human rights internationally as has been attested to by the leading NGO 's [ nongovernmental organizations ] on human rights . "
Another report issued Monday also was critical of the IDF .
The report from Physicians for Human Rights said the Gaza incursion violated IDF 's own code of ethics .
The report by the medical group , which shared the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize , cited instances where it said IDF forces did not evacuate injured civilians for days and prevented Palestinian teams from reaching the wounded , and said some of them died as a result .
It said 16 Palestinian medical personnel were killed by IDF fire and 25 were wounded during the IDF operation , and accused the IDF of attacking 34 medical centers in violation of the IDF 's own " ethical code for fighting terror . "
In response , the IDF accused Hamas of having used medical vehicles , facilities and uniforms to conceal its members ' activity .
" Hamas used ambulances to ' rescue ' terror activists from the battlefield and used hospitals and medical facilities as hiding places , " the Israelis said in a written statement .
" Despite this , throughout the fighting , IDF forces were instructed to avoid firing at ambulances , even if they were being used by armed fighters .
They were instructed only to shoot if there was fire towards our forces emanating from the direction of the ambulance . "
Regarding the reported delays in casualty evacuations , " there existed real difficulties in evacuating the injured , due to the roadblocks , booby - trapped roads and dirt mounds placed by the Hamas as well as the considerable damage to the infrastructure , " the statement said .
Nevertheless , it said , an IDF investigation is ongoing and its conclusions will be made public once it is complete .
But Dr. Dani Filc , PHR - Israel chairman , was skeptical that the investigation would prove useful .
" There are considerable doubts that the IDF is the correct institution to investigate suspicions of these violations , " he said .
" The IDF 's repeated promises to the High Court to look into attacks on medical teams and medical centers have gone unfulfilled , and there are suspicions concerning its seriousness and readiness to carry out the matter . "
The Israeli military did accept criticism Monday on another matter -- the practice of some Israeli soldiers of wearing T - shirts that appear to condone acts of violence against Palestinians .
The Israeli daily Haaretz newspaper reported that Israeli soldiers who had finished basic training ordered the shirts , one of which showed a pregnant Arab in the crosshairs of a gun sight with a caption reading " 1 Shot 2 Kills . "
Another showing a small child in a gun 's sight was captioned , " The smaller they are , the harder it is . "
" The examples presented by The Haaretz reporter are not in accordance with IDF values and are simply tasteless , " the Israeli military said in a written statement .
" This type of humor is unbecoming and should be condemned . "
Israeli soldiers said last week that Palestinian civilians were killed and Palestinian property intentionally destroyed during Israel 's military campaign in Gaza , according to Haaretz .
The IDF has said it is investigating the claims , but its top general expressed skepticism Monday .
" I do n't believe that soldiers serving in the IDF hurt civilians in cold blood , but we shall wait for the results of the investigation , " Lt. Gen .
Ashkenazi , the chief of staff , said in a speech .
" I tell you that this is a moral and ideological army . "
He blamed Hamas for choosing " to fight in heavily populated areas .
" It ( was ) a complex atmosphere that includes civilians and we took every measure possible to reduce harm of the innocent , " he said , according to an IDF statement .

It has become a beloved ritual at Dana - Farber : Every day , children who come to the clinic write their names on sheets of paper and tape them to the windows of the walkway for ironworkers to see .
And , every day , the ironworkers paint the names onto I - beams and hoist them into place as they add floors to the new 14 - story Yawkey Center for Cancer Care .
This week Sir David Omand , the former Whitehall security and intelligence co-ordinator , described how the state should analyse data about individuals in order to find terrorist suspects : travel information , tax , phone records , emails , and so on .
" Finding out other people 's secrets is going to involve breaking everyday moral rules , " he said , because we 'll need to screen everyone to find the small number of suspects .
There is one very significant issue that will always make data mining unworkable when used to search for terrorist suspects in a general population , and that is what we might call the " baseline problem " : even with the most brilliantly accurate test imaginable , your risk of false positives increases to unworkably high levels , as the outcome you are trying predict becomes rarer in the population you are examining .
This stuff is tricky but important .
If you pay attention you will understand it .
Let 's imagine you have an amazingly accurate test , and each time you use it on a true suspect , it will correctly identify them as such eight times out of 10 ( but miss them two times out of 10 ) ; and each time you use it on an innocent person , it will correctly identify them as innocent nine times out of 10 , but incorrectly identify them as a suspect one time out of 10 .
These numbers tell you about the chances of a test result being accurate , given the status of the individual , which you already know ( and the numbers are a stable property of the test ) .
But you stand at the other end of the telescope : you have the result of a test , and you want to use that to work out the status of the individual .
That depends entirely on how many suspects there are in the population being tested .
If you have 10 people , and you know that one is a suspect , and you assess them all with this test , then you will correctly get your one true positive and - on average - one false positive .
If you have 100 people , and you know that one is a suspect , you will get your one true positive and , on average , 10 false positives .
If you 're looking for one suspect among 1,000 people , you will get your suspect , and 100 false positives .
Once your false positives begin to dwarf your true positives , a positive result from the test becomes pretty unhelpful .
Remember this is a screening tool , for assessing dodgy behaviour in a general population .
We are invited to accept that everybody 's data will be surveyed and processed , because MI5 have clever algorithms to identify people who were never previously suspected .
There are 60 million people in the UK , with , let 's say , 10,000 true suspects .
Using your unrealistically accurate imaginary screening test , you get 6 million false positives .
At the same time , of your 10,000 true suspects , you miss 2,000 .
If you raise the bar on any test , to increase what statisticians call the " specificity " , and thus make it less prone to false positives , then you also make it much less sensitive , so you start missing even more of your true suspects .
Or do you just want an even more stupidly accurate imaginary test , without sacrificing true positives ?
It wo n't get you far .
Let 's say you incorrectly identify an innocent person as a suspect one time in 100 : you get 600,000 false positives .
One time in 1,000 ?
Come on .
Even with these unfeasibly accurate imaginary tests , when you screen a general population as proposed , it is hard to imagine a point where the false positives are usefully low , and the true positives are not missed .
And our imaginary test really was ridiculously good : it 's very difficult to identify suspects , just from slightly abnormal behavioural patterns .
Things get worse .
These suspects are undercover operatives , so they will go out of their way to produce trails which can confuse you .
And lastly , there is the problem of validating your algorithms , and calibrating your detection systems .
To do that , you need training data : 10,000 people where you know for sure if they are suspects , to compare your test results against .
It 's hard to picture how that can be done .
I 'm not saying you should n't spy on everyday people : I 'll leave the morality and politics to those less nerdy than me .
I 'm just giving you the maths on specificity , sensitivity , and false positives .
The one he was criticizing the monitoring of ?
Just erupted in the last day or so .
A friend writes :
Erupted 4 times overnight .
Nobody ’s dead .
The FAA and the National Weather Service know where the ash cloud is ( drifting away , not toward , Anchorage , thank God ) and planes are being diverted around it .
Gee , it ’s a good thing people were monitoring .
The eruption was accurately predicted when the number of earthquakes on the mountain suddenly jumped to 40 to 50 per hour Sunday morning .
So everybody had time to get ready .
Your tax dollars put to work by dedicated scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey who keep doing their jobs even when politicians decide to demean their work for a cheap sound bite .
If we were approaching this from a less scientific perspective , some might be tempted to appease the volcano gods by throwing somebody into the crater .
Since he does n’t like volcano monitoring , perhaps Bobby Jindal would volunteer ?
For the average Premier League footballer kicking around with nothing to do in the Cheshire stockbroker belt , a spot of light midweek window shopping might seem a natural and harmless enough way to while away the dead time between matches .
But for Everton 's Victor Anichebe , currently sporting a plaster - cast on his leg after a crunching on - field tackle forced him out of action for the rest of the season , a hobble along upmarket King Street in the gentle market town of Knutsford was to bring him to the unwanted attention of the local forces of law and order .
The Nigeria - born striker has received an apology from Cheshire police after he and a friend were stopped and questioned by officers investigating a gang responsible for a spate of violent break - ins at jewellers in the town and surrounding villages so favoured by Britain 's top footballers and their spouses .

Police swooped from a patrol car on Wednesday afternoon after the 20 - year - old and a friend were picked up on CCTV cameras allegedly acting suspiciously while outside Geralds of Knutsford , a boutique famous among the Bentley and Rolex brigade of the North - west for its bespoke jewellery .
Following a " heated dialogue " in which the men vigorously denied casing the joint in preparation for a later break - in , and claiming that perhaps white window shoppers might not expect to receive the same level of attention , Anichebe 's unnamed companion was handcuffed .
A Cheshire police spokesman said that , after looking at the details of the incident , the force was now prepared to apologise .
" Having now reviewed in detail what occurred between the officers and the two men who they believed to have been acting suspiciously , it is now apparent that , while the situation was heated , the actions of the police officer in applying handcuffs to one of the men was less than a proportionate reaction to the requirements of the situation .
The officer has been advised regarding this , and an offer of apology extended to the two men , " he said .
A spokeswoman at Geralds said the shop had been closed at the time of the incident and the windows empty of stock .
" It has nothing to do with our shop , " she added .
Anichebe , who won a silver medal at last summer 's Olympics while playing for his birth country in Beijing , was said to have been " deeply upset and very distressed " after his ordeal .
But an Everton spokesman , Ian Ross , said once he had received the apology " the player will consider the matter closed . "
It is the culmination of a frustrating period in the life of the young forward who grew up on Merseyside and went on to join Everton 's youth academy .
The former young player of the year was recently reported to have been involved in a training ground bust - up with the club 's manager , David Moyes .
His attempts to get a loan to rivals Hull FC fell through at the last moment and last month he was ruled out for the remainder of the season after being pole - axed in a tackle against Newcastle United , which required him to undergo surgery .
Few things in nature are more tragic than the sight of a pod of whales — some of the most magnificent and intelligent creatures on Earth — lying helpless and dying on the beach .
Mass whale strandings occur in many parts of the world , and we do n't know why .
Scientists are still searching for the answers that will unlock this mystery .
There are many theories about why whales and dolphins sometimes swim into shallow water and end up stranding themselves on beaches in various parts of the world .
Some scientists have theorized that a single whale or dolphin may strand itself due to illness or injury , swimming in close to shore to take refuge in shallow water and getting trapped by the changing tide .
Because whales are highly social creatures that travel in communities called pods , some mass strandings may occur when healthy whales refuse to abandon a sick or injured pod member and follow them into shallow water .
Mass strandings of dolphins are far less common than mass strandings of whales .
And among whales , deep - water species such as pilot whales and sperm whales are more likely to strand themselves on land than whale species such as orcas ( killer whales ) that live closer to shore .
In February 2017 , over 400 pilot whales were stranded on a New Zealand South Island beach .
Such events happen with some regularity in the area , suggesting that the depth and shape of the sea floor in that bay may be to blame .
Some observers have offered a similar theory about whales pursuing prey or foraging too close to shore and getting caught by the tide , but this seems unlikely as a general explanation given the number of stranded whales that have turned up with empty stomachs or in areas devoid of their usual prey .
Does Navy Sonar Cause Whale Strandings ?
One of the most persistent theories about the cause of whale stranding is that something disrupts the whales ’ navigation system , causing them to lose their bearings , stray into shallow water , and end up on the beach .
Scientists and government researchers have linked the low - frequency and mid-frequency sonar used by military ships , such as those operated by the U.S. Navy , to several mass strandings as well as other deaths and serious injuries among whales and dolphins .
Military sonar sends out intense underwater sonic waves , essentially a very loud sound , that can retain its power across hundreds of miles .
Evidence of how dangerous sonar might be for marine mammals emerged in 2000 when whales of four different species stranded themselves on beaches in the Bahamas after a U.S. Navy battle group used mid-frequency sonar in the area .
The Navy initially denied responsibility , but a government investigation concluded that Navy sonar caused the whale strandings .
Many beached whales in strandings associated with sonar also show evidence of physical injuries , including bleeding in their brains , ears and internal tissues .
In addition , many whales stranded in areas where sonar is being used have symptoms that in humans would be considered a severe case of decompression sickness , or “ the bends , ” a condition that afflicts SCUBA divers who resurface too quickly after a deep dive .
The implication is that sonar may be affecting the whales ’ dive patterns .
Other possible causes put forth for the disruption of whale and dolphin navigation include :
weather conditions ;
diseases ( such as viruses , brain lesions , parasites in the ears or sinuses ) ;
underwater seismic activity ( sometimes called seaquakes ) ;
magnetic field anomalies ; and
unfamiliar underwater topography .
Despite the many theories , and growing evidence of the danger that military sonar poses for whales and dolphins worldwide , scientists have not found an answer that explains all whale and dolphin strandings .
Perhaps there is no single answer .

It is another indication the Obama administration is a continuation of the Bush administration — neocon commentator Ann Coulter has come out in favor of Obama .
Coulter poses with fellow corporate media peddler of the false right - left paradigm , Bill O’Reilly .
“ On national security , we ought to be gloating because he seems to be continuing the policies of George Bush instead of MoveOn.org , Daily Kos and Code Pink and the New York Times and a lot of them are weeping , ” Coulter said during a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference .
“ Apparently Obama got into office , got national security briefings and thought , ‘ I ca n’t let the New York Times run national security . ’
So I think we do owe a big thank you to George Bush for keeping us so safe , ” she added , reports CNSNews .
The New York Times , of course , does not “ run national security , ” or does Obama for that matter .
Barack Obama is a front man for the bankers and the global elite .
The shadow government calls the shots on national security .
Obama is little more than a Charlie McCarthy , a ventriloquist puppet operated by the bankers .
National security policy under Obama is identical to national security under Bush because our rulers want it that way .
It has nothing to do with MoveOn.org , Daily Kos and Code Pink .
It has nothing to do with Coulter or Rush Limbaugh .
[ efoods ]
In fact , the “ liberal ” or “ progressive ” organizations mentioned by Coulter are run by the global elite .
MoveOn.org is a George Soros operation , the Daily Kos is likely a CIA front , and Code Pink is a creation of the Ford Foundation .
Both sides of the controlled opposition , including the “ conservative ” Ann Coulter , owe allegiance to the New World Order .
It is interesting to note that Coulter has stepped outside of the contrived left - right paradigm and its cognitive dissonance to praise Obama on national security .
So - called conservatives and liberals will be allowed to squabble over the budget and essentially meaningless social issues but when it comes to the national security state , the NSC , and foreign policy there will be no significant variation regardless of who occupies the White House .
Coulter told us as much .

Hsu reports on people who host Tupperware - style parties where cash strapped people bring their gold jewelry to a house and sell it to an assayer who rakes in a 35 % vigorish .
The party Geivet attended at the Aliso Viejo home of Mary - Margaret Fincher is a twist on the old suburban Tupperware party .
Here , however , it 's the guests who do the selling .
Erin Stevenson , who organized the party through her group My Gold Party CA , appraised the jewelry with assistant Richard Bartoletti as guests debated whether to wear heels or flats during pregnancy .
To test the gold , Stevenson shaved off small flecks with a whirring Dremel tool , blanketing the dark wood of the dining table with a luminous sheen .
Later , while Bartoletti peered through a magnifier attached to his eyeglasses , looking for karat stamps on the jewelry , Stevenson weeded out gold impostors with magnets and a special acidic gel .
Fincher , 34 , said the parties were popular in her hometown of Atlanta .
As the host she gets 10 % of what is paid out — which this night was $ 4,000 .
One woman walked away with a $ 1,836.88 check .
Stevenson pays about 65 % of the market value , which works out to $ 5.56 for a gram of 8 - karat gold , rising to $ 15.47 a gram for 22 k .
She then sells the gold to a refiner for a price just under the market trading price .
Earlier this year we reported that Ubisoft faced with problems with the DRM on Rainbox 6 : Vegas 2 , and released a fix - in the form of a no -CD crack actually created by warez group .
Following on from this bad experience , Ubisoft has just released the PC version of Prince of Persia without DRM , but expect piracy to be high .
Ubisoft have n’t had much luck with DRM ( Digital Rights Management ) in 2008 .
First off it was criticized for the copy protection it embedded in its title Assassins Creed .
Apparently the game tried to ‘ phone home ’ , continually trying to access a Ubisoft server while the host PC was connected to the Internet .
But the red faces did n’t stop there .
Faced with technical issues surrounding the DRM on the PC version of Rainbow Six Vegas 2 , developer Ubisoft made a ‘ fix ’ available .
Unfortunately , it became clear that far from being their own code , the patch was actually a ‘ No - CD crack ‘ created by warez group , Reloaded .
Getting caught pirating in an attempt fix broken anti-piracy measures was probably a step too far for Ubisoft , so it has taken the radical step of removing the DRM from the PC retail version of its latest ‘ Prince of Persia ‘ game .
Posting on the company ’s forum , Ubisoft community development manager Chris Easton announced the move .
“ You`re right when you say that when people want to pirate the game they will , but DRM is there to make it as difficult as possible for pirates to make copies of our games .
A lot of people complain that DRM is what forces people to pirate games but as PoP [ Prince of Persia ] PC has no DRM we`ll see how truthful people actually are . ”
But does Chris really expect that dropping the DRM will be a success ?
How ‘ truthful ’ will people be when it comes to not pirating the title ?
“ Not very , I imagine , ” he adds .
One user of the forum responds , “ Did anyone here mention how devs blame piracy for everything these days ?
If the game sucks to begin with , they blame piracy .
If they do n’t have money or are just lazy to make a decent PC port … they blame piracy . ”
He finishes up with a common statement – If you make a good game , people will buy it .
“ Well this time we ’ve got a good game with no DRM so there really is no reason to pirate it , right ?
We should expect good sales because there ’s no reason to not buy a copy , ” notes Chris , although he does n’t seem that confident overall .
“ I ’m fairly skeptical as it ’s an easy answer given by a lot of people why they pirate games but if you ’re going to buy this game instead of pirating purely because of no DRM in the store version , then if I ever meet you in real life I ’ll happily shake your hand and buy you a drink . ”
Just recently , developer 2D Boy released their ‘ World of Goo ’ without DRM .
It was heavily pirated , but sales were high enough to make the project worthwhile .
At the time , Torrent Freak spoke with Kyle Gabler from 2D Boy who told us that he believed that their customers realized that the company was trying to do “ the right thing ” which they hoped would translate into a certain amount of goodwill .
If the backlash linked to the terrible DRM included with Spore is anything to go by , Kyle might be on to something and time will tell if Ubisoft ’s experiment pays off too .
In the end , games always will be pirated , with or without DRM , and there is no reason to believe that piracy increases when there is no ‘ protection ’ .
In fact , it only annoys legitimate customers who bought the game .
TorrentFreak will count the downloads and report back in a little while …..
WASHINGTON , March 3 ( Reuters ) - A U.S. senator berated Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Tuesday for refusing to name banks that borrow from the central bank , and said he would introduce legislation requiring public disclosure .
In a testy exchange at a hearing before the Senate Budget Committee , Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , an independent who usually votes with the Democrats , said he found it “ unacceptable ” that the central bank risked taxpayer money without detailing where the funds went .
“ My question to you is , will you tell the American people to whom you lent $ 2.2 trillion of their dollars ? ”
Sanders asked , referring to the size of the Fed ’s balance sheet .
Bernanke responded that the Fed explains the various lending programs on its website , and details the terms and collateral requirements .
When Sanders pressed on whether he would name the firms that borrowed from the Fed , the central bank chairman replied , “ No , ” and started to say that doing so risked stigmatizing banks and discouraging them from borrowing from the central bank .
“ Is n’t that too bad , ” Sanders interrupted , cutting off Bernanke ’s answer .
“ They took the money but they do n’t want to be public about the fact that they received it . ”
He said businesses in his state were in trouble and needed loans , but were not permitted to borrow from the Fed .
“ Do you have to be a large , greedy , reckless financial institution to apply for this money ? ” he asked .
Bernanke said the Fed ’s lending programs were not gifts or subsidies but rather over - collateralized loans .
He said the law restricted the types of firms to which the central bank can lend .
“ We have never lost a penny doing it , ” he said .
Sanders responded : “ Let me just say this , Mr. Chairman .
I have a hard time understanding how you have put $ 2.2 trillion at risk without making those names available , those institutions public . ”
“ We are going to introduce legislation today , by the way , to demand that you do that .
It is unacceptable to me that that this goes on , ” he added .

Germany school shooting - 15 dead in Winnenden
Smiling , friendly and full of life - these photos reveal the full horror behind the tragic victims of teen gunman Tim Kretschmer 's school murder rampage .
Massacres Alabama shooting Michael McLendon kills 11 in massacre A gunman named as Michael McLendon has killed at least 11 people including a child in a shooting rampage massacre in the US state of Alabama .
School massacre Gunman fled manhunt with driver kidnap
The gunman who killed ten people at a school shooting massacre in Winnenden , Germany kidnapped a driver to flee the police manhunt set up to catch him .
The 17 - year - old Kretschmer started a killing spree at his former school in Winnenden near Stuttgart , Germany yesterday , murdering students and teachers .
The gunman appears to have specifically targeted girls and women as he went on the rampage at Albertville school , cruelly robbing them of their lives .
Among his 15 victims were eight schoolgirls aged 14 to 17 as well as three female teachers , who were all shot in cold blood .
The teen gunman killed a further three people as he fled the scene and went on a bloody rampage before shooting himself in the head in the parking lot of a car dealership in Wendlinger during an exchange of fire with police .
More pictures have also come to light of the gunman himself .
Just how he went from an angelic - faced young boy and a keen table tennis player to a teen killer has left many baffled .
Herbert Rech ( CDU ) , Interior Minister of the state of Baden - Württemberg , was visibly moved when he spoke to the press yesterday : “ The gunman killed eight schoolgirls and one boy and shot dead three female teachers in the school building .
He also injured a further seven schoolgirls .
The fact that the vast majority of female victims is notable . ”
Did Kretschmer hate girls because he was unpopular with them ?
Rech added : “ The killer shot most of his victims in the head , which shows that they were n’t random targets . ”
Shoolgirls Selina Dogan , Chantal Schill and Jana Schober ( † 14 ) were all killed in their classroom , a place they felt safe .
The young boy who died was Ibrahim Yeniay , who was of Albanian origin .
A neighbour told BILD : “ Sometimes I met Tim in the park .
He always complained about one of his teachers .
" He said that she bullied him and threatened him that if he continued as he was he would end up on the rubbish heap .
He completely hated her , as he did all women in general . ”
The injured were brought into hospitals where doctors were still working hard to save them on Wednesday evening .
At least two schoolgirls are in intensive care in the clinic in Backnang .
Dieter Schneider from the Baden - Würtemberg police said : “ The killing spree was planned .
The killer wanted to create a bloodbath . ”

Why did almost no - one question the financial activity that caused the credit crunch ?

With hindsight , the causes of the current global financial meltdown seem obvious , even predictable .
Now , brain imaging offers one explanation for why so few investors challenged foolhardy fiscal advice .
Our brains raise few objections when presented with seemingly expert guidance , new research suggests .
“ Most average people have this tendency to turn off their own capacity for making judgments when an expert comes into the picture , ” says Gregory Berns , a neuroeconomist at Emory University in Atlanta .

Risk circuits
Berns ’ team presented 24 young volunteers with a simple choice : accept a sure payment or bet on a riskier , yet higher - paying lottery .
When weighing this decision , volunteers activated brain circuits known to calculate risk and reward .
In line with previous research , the team noticed more brain activation in these dopamine - delivering areas when the expected reward was higher .
“ When advice is not there , when people are making these judgments on their own , you can make clear correlations with expected value in the lottery and areas associated with the dopamine system , ” he says .
To see how subjects respond to financial advice , the team told volunteers that Charles Noussair , an economics professor at Emory who advises the US Federal Reserve , would offer his opinion on whether they should accept the easy money or take a chance .
Acting blindly
In reality , a computer program told volunteers to accept the sure thing if it added up to about 20 % or more of the lottery sweepstake .
Volunteers usually took this advice blindly , brain scans suggest .
Correlations between increased potential reward and brain activity disappeared when volunteers received the advice .
“ That suggests that the normal mechanisms people use to evaluate risk and reward are not being used when you have an expert telling you what to do , ” Berns says .
“ I think this explains a lot , if not everything , about the current market situation , ” he adds , urging people to take expert advice – fiscal , medical or otherwise – more shrewdly .
“ In my opinion , decision - making should n’t be handed over to anyone , expert or otherwise . ”

The company claims its husky safari holidays are ' chav - free ' .
Directors of a tour company which sparked controversy with an e-mail offering ' chav - free ' vacations , have defended their marketing strategy .
Activities Abroad ran names it believed to be associated with ' chavs ' through its database , claiming that none had been on one of its activity holidays .
An e-mail advertising the company 's holidays on this basis was sent to 24,000 people , causing offence to some .
Director Alistair McLean said : " It was a tongue - in - cheek e-mail . " ' Nuff said ' Activities Abroad made use of research suggesting certain names are often associated with particular demographic segments of the UK population .
They googled names associated with the word ' chav ' , ran them through their database of past customers and discovered that no Britneys , Dazzas , Biancas , Chardonnays or Candices had ever been on one of their trips .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
They found that among common names of people who had were John , Sarah , James , Charlotte and Lucy .
The e-mail added a spin to these findings , claiming the company therefore offered ' chav - free activity holidays ' .
It was sent to previous customers and those signed up to the company 's mailing list with the sign - off line : " nuff said , innit ? " .
The e-mail triggered a wave of publicity and controversy after it was reported the email had offended some of the company 's customers .
Mr McLean speaking on Radio 5 Live 's breakfast programme said : " All this publicity has stemmed from one blog written by one person , " he said .
How dare you define and typecast people by their name
Candice " If you start going to various newspaper websites and the comment pages , we 're getting some absolutely fantastic feedback , an immense amount of support and it kind of looks like a lot of people agree with us as well . "
Mr McLean said he was standing up for the middle classes .
" Everybody else in our society seems to take from us whether it is incompetent bankers or the shell - suited urchins who haunt our street corners . "
According to the company , only 18 people from the 24,000 emailed have written to complain about the e-mail .
Typecast
In response to the blog referred to by Mr Mclean , one ' Candice ' wrote : " How dare you define and typecast people by their name .
" I own my own business , have a post graduate degree , an undergraduate degree , 4 A - Levels , an advanced diploma in Life Skills , a diploma in Performance Coaching , GCSEs , speak French and Italian and drive a Merc. Happy slap that " .

President Barack Obama came into office in January promising a new era of openness .
But now , like Bush before him , Obama is playing the national security card to hide details of the controversial Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement being negotiated across the globe .
The White House this week declared ( . pdf ) the text of the proposed treaty a " properly classified " national security secret , in rejecting a Freedom of Information Act request by Knowledge Ecology International .
" Please be advised the documents you seek are being withheld in full , " wrote Carmen Suro - Bredie , chief FOIA officer in the White House 's Office of the U.S. Trade Representative .
The national security claim is stunning , given that the treaty negotiations have included the 27 member states of the European Union , Japan , South
Korea , Canada , Mexico , Australia , Switzerland and New Zealand , all of whom presumably have access to the " classified " information .
In early January , the Bush administration made the same claim in rejecting (. pdf ) a similar FOIA request by the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
If ratified , leaked documents posted on WikiLeaks and other comments suggest the proposed trade accord would criminalize peer - to - peer file sharing , subject iPods to border searches and allow internet service providers to monitor their customers ' communications .
In his first days in office , Obama publicly committed himself to transparency , instructing government agencies to err on the side of public access and divulge information whenever possible under the Freedom of
Information Act. Obama recently released a trove of documents relating to the Bush administration 's rationale for torture of enemy combatants and other abuses .
At the same time , though , Justice Department lawyers have been arguing in court that the " state secrets privilege " should bar lawsuits over the NSA 's warrantless wiretapping program .

This is a follow - up to my 10 Science Fiction Films I Cannot Wait to Share With My Kids post .
It is by no means a " Top - 10 List " or comprehensive list of good genre television .
These shows are just a few that are favorites of mine that I wish to share with my Geeklets once they get a little bit older .
My 11 and 13 - year - old are already avid sci- fi watchers .
They in love Dr. Who ( even some of the older incarnations ! )
Stargate SG - 1 and Atlantis , Farscape , and everything with Star Trek in the title .
They are also fans of some earlier stuff like The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits .
The following are shows that I feel are a bit too adult for my kids at their present level of development , but are some of my favorites .
As it was in the Movies list , they are all pretty dark and include some adult situations or and / or extreme violence .
However , they all make for some great TV watching and I cannot wait to pass them along to my young 'ens when they are older !
Please include some shows you would like to share with your own offspring in the Comments section below .
1. Battlestar Galactica ( Current Series ) - IMHO simply the best written show on television .
I will mourn its passing when the series comes to an end in a few months .
I am only thankful that it was allowed conclude on its own terms .
2. Firefly - Unlike BSG , this series was killed way too early .
I still watch it regularly with my friends , though , and I have a feeling both of my children will become Browncoats some day .
3 . The X - Files - Conspiracy theories , UFOs and sexual tension ...
Who could ask for anything more ?
The through - line of the series could be a little convoluted at times but some many episodes were just frakkin ' brilliant .
4. Lost -
My kids are already asking if they can watch this one .
Pretty soon , I tell them .
Pretty soon .
Time travel ?
Smoke creatures ?
And what is up with that four toed statue ?
A J.J Abrams led roller coaster ride of monster proportions .
5. Ghost in the Shell : Stand Alone Complex - Good animation , complex story lines , and believable science content .
This great anime series has a bit too much blood for the younger set and the tendency to get talky at points .
However , I just love this show in all of its complexity .
6. Babylon 5 - Of all the shows on this list , this series will be the one the I introduce my kids to next .
It will have to be in DVD
or download form since it is not available in syndication at this time .
A little dark at times but definitely thought provoking and action - packed .
J. Michael Straczynski writes some great stuff !
7. Twin Peaks -
I am not sure whether you can categorize this show as science fiction or not , but it was definitely out - there .
And it certainly rated high on the disturbi-ness scale .
Unfortunately , this David Lynch series sort of sputtered once we found out who killed
Laura Palmer .
8. Ergo Proxy -
Another great anime series , depicting a post - apocalyptic far - future Earth .
Very violent and a little creepy at times , this is not an animated series with a happy ending .
It has only appeared on the Fuse network in the USA but is widely available on
DVD .
9. Lexx - Sexual innuendo , lust , nudity , adult situations ... in space !
Aww yeah !
( I am probably going to the hot place for including this one on the list of shows to eventually share with my offspring , but hey . )
It is a very twisted and often hilarious television show .
10 . Fringe - Another J.J. Abrams series which , at time of this posting , is in the middle of its first season .
However , I like what I have seen of the show so far .
I hope they can find an audience before they are cancelled too early or get " lost " in their own mythology .
We shall see ...
Anger is building against the police department in the wake of an increase in arrests of gay men for prostitution at Manhattan adult video stores .
Last week , City Council Speaker Christine Quinn joined in the outcry .
She said she is working with the mayor 's office and commanders of the police department to set up a meeting that will include gay community groups " to get to the bottom of this . "
The arrests have been documented by Duncan Osborne of the Gay City News over the last several months .
Police are allegedly using handsome young undercover cops to cruise middle - aged gay men , offering to go home with them for consensual sex .
As they leave the store together , the cop offers to pay the man for the sex , confusing the victims who can't imagine why the younger man would make such a proposal .
Then , as they walk out of the store , the victim , despite never having agreed to any exchange of money , is surrounded by undercover cops , handcuffed and charged with prostitution .
Gay activists and civil libertarians see the arrests as part of a continuing effort to shut down porn operations in the city and a tendency by the police department to criminalize gay sexual behavior .
We need to see [ the arrest policy ] stopped and to figure out how it started , " Quinn told Gotham Gazette , calling the arrests of gay men " the most egregious I have heard of " going back to her days as executive director of the Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project , which is part of a coalition to stop these arrests .
" It 's not even entrapment , " she said .
" These are false arrests . "
Recounting the Arrests
Anger over the arrests also brought more than 200 people to a town hall meeting at the Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual and Transgender Community Center in January .
Robert Pinter , a 52 - year - old gay man who was arrested for prostitution at the Blue Door in the East Village on Oct. 10 , spoke at the town hall meeting .
He said a young man — a 29 - year old undercover cop who , Pinter said , looked even younger — cruised him in the store .
He was " charming and persistent , and we agreed to go home for consensual sex , but as we were leaving he said , ' I want to pay you $ 50 [ to have sex ] . '
I did n't respond , but I thought it was strange , " Pinter recounted .
As the men left the store , Pinter said , a group of men who did not show police identification pushed him against the wall
" I thought I 'd been set up by a gang , " he said .
" I asked them why they were doing this to me .
I was totally clueless .
They handcuffed me and said , ' Why the f --- do you think we 're arresting you — loitering for the purpose of prostitution . ' "
Pinter spent several hours in a police van , more time at the Seventh Precinct , and " 16 or 17 hours in the Tombs , " the city jail downtown .
His Legal Aid attorney " strongly suggested I plead guilty to disorderly conduct , " which he did , although he now regrets it .
He was also ordered to go to city - sponsored classes on how to engage in prostitution more safely .
Most of the victims , some of whom are foreign tourists and almost all of whom have never been arrested before , have been encouraged by their lawyers to plead guilty to " disorderly conduct " and end their ordeal , rather than risk trial on the much more serious charge of prostitution .
But as the arrests have piled up , civil rights and Legal Aid lawyers have convinced some of the men to fight the charges .
Michael Spiegel , a veteran civil rights litigator , who won a landmark case in 2006 against the Port Authority police for targeting and falsely arresting gay men in Port Authority restrooms , is the process of identifying men caught up in the current sweep who are interested in fighting the charges .
" Their civil rights have been violated , " he said .
The arrests at the Blue Door , Osborne said , " are suspect and improbable .
While overall , 17 percent of men arrested for prostitution in New York City are over 40 years of age , 66 percent of the men arrested at this location targeted by police were over 42 .
The experience has radicalized Pinter , who founded a Coalition to Stop the Arrests that meets on an ongoing basis at the LGBT Center .
" We have to hold the NYPD accountable , " he said , " and keep the pressure on until it ends . "
Going After ' Nuisances '
At the town hall meeting and in his stories in Gay City News , Osborne has tied the arrests to the city 's aggressive enforcement of the 1977 " nuisance abatement law . "
Former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and now Mayor Michael Bloomberg have used the law to sue and close businesses where alleged " criminal activity is demonstrated . "
According to Osborne , such nuisance abatement cases increased from 110 in 1994 to 709 in 1996 to 899 last year , closing everything from chop shops to unlicensed massage parlors .
" The commander of Midtown South said that civil enforcement is a police commander 's best friend , " Osborne said , who noted the city has had an ongoing effort to shut porn stores .
Following a spate of arrests at another porn shop , the Unicorn in Chelsea , the city sued to close it , citing the arrests by undercover officers .
The Police Department did not respond to Gotham Gazette 's e-mailed query after the town hall meeting .
Previously , Paul Browne , the department 's deputy commissioner for public information , told Gay City News , " The fact remains that the locations had become notorious for solicitation of sex acts , with complaints from the public resulting in police attention . "
Bloomberg 's press office refused comment , referring questions to the police department .
District Attorney Robert Morgenthau 's spokesperson , Alicia Maxey Greene , also " declined to comment " on the arrests or his office 's prosecution of these cases .
State Sen . Thomas
Duane said he has been in contact with the district attorney 's office and placed a call to Morgenthau himself , but almost a week later had not received a call back from the district attorney .
Duane , who spoke at the town hall meeting , called for the arrests to stop immediately .
" People 's lives are being ruined , " he said .
He was noncommittal about whether there should be a criminal investigation into the police conduct .
" We have to take things one step at a time , " he said .
City Councilmember Rosie Mendez of the Lower East Side issued a statement criticizing the police for " targeting and criminalizing behavior that is legal . "
" In this instance , they are targeting the sexual conduct of gay men .
This type of targeting is simply the harassment of certain type of commercial ventures and of potential customers of legitimate businesses .
This type of harassment infringes upon an individual 's civil liberties , " she wrote .
At the town hall meeting , some speakers said police use of false prostitution charges has gone beyond the video stores .
Jennifer Ramirez of the Anti-Violence Project said that police go on the " casual encounters " section of Craig 's List to trawl for potential arrestees .
" The cops go on the assumption that everyone 's a sex worker , " she said .
" It 's not getting better , it is getting worse . "
As a transgendered outreach worker , she said , " When I 'm out on the street doing education , I 'm perceived [ by the police ] as a sex worker and I 'm criminalized . "
Andrea Ritchie of the Urban Justice Center 's Sex Workers Project said police arrest gay and transgendered people for conduct " that would be ignored or winked at in heterosexual people . "
African American and Latino people are particularly at risk , she added .
There was a sense at the town hall meeting that the public outcry might prompt the police to end their arrests of middle - aged white gay men on false prostitution charges .
However , they said , the wider problem of police abuse of their arrest powers for gay , lesbian and transgendered people will continue unless the political leaders protesting the former look into the latter .

( CNN ) -- Former Sen. Tom Daschle has withdrawn his nomination to head the Department of Health and Human Services , according to a statement Tuesday from the White House .
Former Sen . Tom Daschle apologized for making mistakes on his tax records .
Daschle had been fighting to save his nomination after controversy over his tax records and questions over his work in a field that some consider lobbying .
In a statement announcing his withdrawal , Daschle said it was an honor to be chosen to lead the reform of America 's health care system .
" But if 30 years of exposure to the challenges inherent in our system has taught me anything , it has taught me that this work will require a leader who can operate with the full faith of Congress and the American people , and without distraction , " he said .
" Right now , I am not that leader , and will not be a distraction .
The focus of Congress should be on the urgent business of moving the president 's economic agenda forward , including affordable health care for every American . "
Watch what the administration loses with Daschle 's withdrawal »
The Obama administration had stood by his side , and fellow Democrats lined up behind him , but Daschle 's problems , coupled with other nominees ' issues , gave critics ammunition to question President Obama 's call for a " new era of responsibility . "
The president said Tuesday he accepts Daschle 's decision " with sadness and regret . "
" Tom made a mistake , which he has openly acknowledged .
He has not excused it , nor do I .
But that mistake , and this decision , cannot diminish the many contributions
Tom has made to this country , from his years in the military to his decades of public service .
Now we must move forward , with our plan to lift this economy and put people back to work , " Obama said in a statement .
However , in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper later Tuesday , Obama said he made a mistake in handling the nomination of Daschle .
" I think I screwed up .
And , I take responsibility for it and we 're going to make sure we fix it so it does n't happen again .
" Ultimately , I campaigned on changing Washington and bottom - up politics , " Obama said .
" And I do n't want to send a message to the American people that there are two sets of standards -- one for powerful people and one for ordinary folks who are working every day and paying their taxes . "
Daschle 's resignation came hours after Nancy Killefer 's withdrawal as Obama 's chief performance officer , a new post in the administration .

Officials said privately the reason for Killefer 's withdrawal was unspecified tax issues .
The much - touted post was designed to scrub the federal budget .

Daschle , the former Senate majority leader , apologized Monday for failing to pay his taxes in full .
He said earlier he was " deeply embarrassed " for a series of errors that included failing to report $ 15,000 in charitable donations , unreported car service and more than $ 80,000 in unreported income from consulting .
Daschle recently filed amended tax returns and paid more than $ 140,000 in back taxes and interest for 2005 - 2007 .
A New York Times editorial on Tuesday called for Daschle to withdraw .
The paper 's editorial board particularly took issue with Daschle saying he identified the unpaid taxes in June but did not pay them until his nomination for the top post at the Department of Health and Human Services .
The editorial also criticized Daschle for generating a sizable income from health - related industries while working in the private sector .
Watch how Daschle 's consulting work also caused some concern »
" Mr. Daschle is another in a long line of politicians who move cozily between government and industry .
We do n't know that his industry ties would influence his judgments on health issues , but they could potentially throw a cloud over health care reform , " the editorial said .
Shortly after news of the tax quandary broke , a number of Democratic senators released statements expressing their support for Daschle , including Sens .
John Kerry of Massachusetts , Charles Schumer of New York , Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts .
In their opinions , Daschle identified the problem and corrected it .
Daschle 's supporters said that given his record of three decades of public service , he was still the right man for the job .
" One can not underestimate how widely admired Tom Daschle is in Washington for his integrity , for his public service .
And many , many Democrats look to him as one of the favorite people .
He 's got a lot of support in this White House , starting with the president , " said David Gergen , a senior political analyst for CNN .
Obama and Daschle have a longstanding relationship .
Daschle endorsed Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination in February 2007 -- nearly 11 months before the first contest .
Daschle was also considered to be a contender for Obama 's No. 2 spot .
Daschle also has a history with members of Congress .
He represented South Dakota in the House of Representatives for four terms , and he served in the Senate for three terms .
He was the Senate majority leader from June 2001 to January 2003 , and was the minority leader before losing his re-election bid in 2004 .
Daschle 's work in his post - Senate years was also a point of contention on his path to confirmation .
After leaving the Senate , Daschle went on to serve as a special public policy adviser at the law firm Alston & Bird .
According to the firm 's Web site , Daschle advised clients on " issues related to financial services , health care , energy , telecommunications and taxes . "
His work , for which he reportedly made millions , seemed to contradict Obama 's strict rules on lobbyists working in his administration .
Promising " a new era of openness in our country , " Obama signed executive orders relating to ethics guidelines for staff members as one of his first acts in office .
" If you are a lobbyist entering my administration , you will not be able to work on matters you lobbied on , or in the agencies you lobbied during the previous two years , " the president said .
The administration had defended its choice of Daschle , pointing out that he was not technically a lobbyist .
" If you 're not registered to lobby , you can't be a lobbyist , " said White House press secretary Robert Gibbs , according to Time.com .
Time.com :
When is a lobbyist not a lobbyist ?
Daschle and Kellifer were not the first of Obama 's nominees to come under scrutiny .
Before Tim Geithner was confirmed as treasury secretary , he was questioned over concerns involving his personal taxes and the immigration status of a former housekeeper .
New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson also withdrew his nomination to be commerce secretary , citing the distraction of a federal investigation into ties to a company that has done business with his state .
Given Obama 's pledge for " unprecedented transparency , rigorous oversight and clear accountability , " some said the controversy surrounding Obama 's appointments are calling into question the president 's vetting process .
" Mr. President , your picks to help run the federal government do n't have to be perfect , but is it too much to ask that they pay like everyone else , to keep that same government functioning ?
And more importantly , that they do n't wait until everyone , including you , is watching ? " CNN 's Campbell Brown wrote in a commentary .
Read the commentary
Asked if the president is embarrassed by the slew of appointment problems , Gibbs was quick to negate that idea .
" No , I do n't think that -- that we believe there 's any problem in the vetting , " Gibbs said Monday .

MOSCOW / WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States signaled a willingness on Friday to slow plans for a missile defense shield in eastern Europe if Russia agreed to help stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons .

REUTERS / Defense Department / Handout
Plans for the shield have contributed to a deterioration in U.S. - Russian ties over the past few years , but the new administration of President Barack Obama has said it wants to press the “ reset button ” and build good relations with Moscow .
“ If we are able to work together to dissuade Iran from pursuing a nuclear weapons capability , we would be able to moderate the pace of development of missile defenses in Europe , ” a senior U.S. administration official told Reuters .
It was the most explicit statement yet by an administration official linking the missile shield to Russia ’s willingness to help resolve the international stand - off over Iran ’s nuclear program .
He spoke as Undersecretary of State William Burns held talks in Moscow , the most senior U.S. official to do so since U.S. President Barack Obama took office last month .
Burns signaled the United States was ready to look at remodeling its missile defense plans to include Moscow .
“ ( Washington is ) open to the possibility of cooperation , both with Russia and NATO partners , in relation to a new configuration for missile defense which would use the resources that each of us have , ” Interfax news agency quoted him as saying .
Burns gave no details .
In another sign that strained relations may be thawing , European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana said U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would meet Russia ’s foreign minister in Geneva next month .
The more flexible U.S. position on its missile shield addressed one of Russia ’s chief complaints against Washington .
Moscow viewed the plan to site missiles in Poland and a radar tracking station in the Czech Republic as a threat to its security in its traditional backyard .
U.S. Vice President Joe Biden told a security conference in Munich , Germany , last week that the United States would press ahead with the missile defense shield , but only if it was proven to work and was cost - effective .
TACKLING IRAN
The Kremlin has been pressing Washington to give ground on the missile shield in exchange for Russia helping supply the U.S. - led military campaign in Afghanistan .
But the U.S. official in Washington focused on Iran .
“ The impetus for the deployment of the missile defense systems is the threat from Iran .
If it is possible to address that , then that needs to be taken into consideration as you look at the deployment of the system , ” the U.S. official said on condition of anonymity .
The United States has led a drive to isolate Iran over its nuclear program , which the West fears is a cover to develop atomic weapons and Tehran insists is for the peaceful generation of electricity .
Russia and the United States agree that world security would be threatened if Iran acquired nuclear weapons but they disagree over whether Tehran is actively pursuing a weapons program .
Moscow , which plans to start up a nuclear reactor at Iran ’s Bushehr plant by the end of the year , has used its veto in the United Nations Security Council on a number of occasions to water down or defeat U.S. - led efforts to impose tougher sanctions on Iran .
Obama has said he is prepared to talk to Iran ’s leaders and offered economic incentives if Tehran “ unclenches its fist . ”
But he has also warned of tougher economic sanctions if Tehran does not halt its nuclear program .
For people who are trying to lose weight , it does not matter if they are counting carbohydrates , protein or fat .
All that matters is that they are counting something .
That is the finding of the largest - ever controlled study of weight - loss methods published on Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine .
More than 800 overweight adults in Boston and Baton Rouge , La. , were assigned to one of four diets that reduced calories through different combinations of fat , carbohydrates and protein .
Each plan cut about 750 calories from a participant ’s normal diet , but no one ate fewer than 1,200 calories a day .
While the diets were not named , the eating plans were all loosely based on the principles of popular diets like Atkins , which emphasizes low carbohydrates ; Dean Ornish , which is low - fat ; or the Mediterranean diet , with less animal protein .
All participants also received group or individual counseling .
After two years , every diet group had lost  and regained  about the same amount of weight regardless of what diet had been assigned .
Participants lost an average of 13 pounds at six months and had maintained about 9 pounds of weight loss and a two - inch drop in waist size after two years .
While the average weight loss was modest , about 15 percent of dieters lost more than 10 percent of their weight by the end of the study .
Still , after about a year many returned to at least some of their usual eating habits .
General Electric , a major manufacturer and lender , continued its decline as the stock , once a stalwart for even the most conservative of portfolios , sold off to levels associated with distressed " fallen angels . "
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 299.64 points , or 4.24 % percent , to 6763.29 , its lowest close since April 25 , 1997 , and the first close below 7,000 since May 1 , 1997 .
We feel this warrants another look at the DJIA chart .
The most dangerous chart pattern in a bear market is the down sloping triangle triangle .
This pattern is seen in the Dow Jones Index and it sets a downside target near 5,600 .
The rapid fall below 7,000 confirms this target objective .
This chart pattern includes a well defined support level near 7,800 .
Over the last five months the rally rebounds from support near 7,800 have developed a pattern of declining highs .
The failure of the early 2009 January rally near 9,000 established a second calculation point for a new down sloping trend line .
The first calculation point for the trend line was set by the rally peak near 9,600 in 2008 November .
A new downtrend line is drawn and this creates a down sloping triangle .
In a bear market the strength of the pattern is increased .
The first feature to measure with this pattern is the height of the triangle .
The four day triangle base starts on 2008 , October 7 , with the drop from near 10,000 to 7,800 .
The triangle height is around 2,200 points .
Chart pattern analysis provides the most reliable analysis method in this type of market situation .
Technical oscillators which measure sentiment in the market are stuck on extreme readings and provide little guidance about trend continuation .

Using chart pattern analysis , the downside target for the Dow Jones Index is near 5,600 .
This target is verified against historical support levels for the Dow .
Historically there is a support level near 7,500 but this has been decisively broken .
The long term historical support level is a narrow trading band between 5,500 and 5,600 .
In a bear market it is the bottom of the trading band that is tested for support .
This combination of factors suggests there is a high probability the market will quickly fall towards support between 5,500 and 5,600 .
This is a fall of more than 50 percent from the peak of the Index in 2007 , October at 14,198 .
This degree of fall is similar to the degree of fall in 1929 when the America market collapsed and developed the world depression .
The end of this triangle pattern develops near the end of 2009 , April .
There is a high probability the America market will develop a continuation of the downtrend with a slow move towards support near 5,600 .
The key feature will be the nature of any consolidation pattern that develops near 5,500 to 5,600 .
Slideshow : Surprising Stock Market Indicators
Failure of genuine support , consolidation and rebound behavior near 5,500 to 5,600 will focus attention in the next support level between 3,700 and 4,000 .
These remain theoretical targets until the nature of consolidation activity near 5,500 and 5,600 is confirmed .
After falls of this degree markets do not develop V - shaped recoveries .
They lay down and rest in L - shaped trading consolidation band patterns .
Typically these patterns prevail for between four to eight months and offer limited trading opportunities .
They are accumulation patterns and investors watch the volume behavior associated with the rallies .

A new Duke University study on child well - being says one thing , but the university ’s press release and subsequent news articles say quite another .
Because the study has the potential to shape the way things are done in classrooms — and , ultimately , affect hiring and workplace policies — knowing what it actually says seems rather important .
The researchers open the study ’s abstract by noting “ the question of whether boys or girls have been doing better has been a point of sometimes rancorous debate among feminist and other scholars in recent decades .
But surprisingly little systematic empirical inquiry has been devoted to this question . ”
The researchers conducted their inquiry , followed through on their stated objectives , and did their jobs competently .
The university ’s Office of News and Communications and reporters covering the issue did not .
According to Sarah Meadows , one of the authors , the study clearly contradicts the popular notion that there is a “ girl crisis ” — that modern girls are disadvantaged .
But the Duke press release added a twist of its own , announcing that “ American boys and girls today are faring almost equally well across key indicators of education , health , safety and risky behavior . ”
News reports have followed suit , with headlines such as “ Boys , girls fare equally in U.S. : Study debunks both sides in long debate ” and “ Boy - girl gender gap ?
Not so fast . ”
Yet the study shows nothing of the sort .
Boys and girls fared equally in six of the 28 categories studied by the researchers — and girls fared better than boys in 17 of the remaining 22 .
The male advantages were modest .
For instance , males had a small advantage in math , a slightly lower propensity to smoke , and less likelihood to have been relocated in the last year .
In contrast , many of the girls ’ advantages are huge .
Their death rate in the 15 - to - 19 age group is half that of boys , and boys have higher death rates at all ages than girls .
Although girls attempt suicide more frequently , boys age 15 to 19 commit suicide at four times the rate of girls .
Boys age 12 to 19 are 40 % more likely to be the victims of violent crime than girls , and are significantly more likely to suffer from drug or alcohol addictions .
The greatest controversy over boys and girls has been in education , beginning in the early ‘ 90s , when misguided feminists declared a highly publicized “ girl crisis . ”
The girl crisis was largely based on the work of then - Harvard professor Carol Gilligan , and was subsequently challenged by American Enterprise Institute scholar Christina Hoff Sommers , author of “ The War Against Boys . ”
Accordingly , the Duke University study , which was supported by the Foundation for Child Development and published in the journal Social Indicators Research , is titled “ Assessing Gilligan vs. Sommers : Gender - Specific Trends in Child and Youth Well - Being in the United States , 1985 to 2001 . ”
The study showed that the boy crisis in education described by Sommers is far more real than the girl crisis posited by Gilligan .
The percentage of boys graduating from high school has dropped back below 1985 levels .
Girls get better grades than boys and are much more likely than boys to graduate from high school , enter college and graduate from college .
Although more girls than boys enroll in high - level math and science classes , boys did score a couple of points better on the most recent national math test considered by the study .
But girls ’ advantage on the most recent reading test is five times as large .
The vast majority of learning - disabled students are boys , and boys are four times as likely to receive a diagnosis of attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder as girls .
Boys are far more likely than girls to be disciplined , suspended , held back or expelled .
Recess time , which research shows is more critical for boys than for girls , has been cut back nationally .
According to the U.S. Department of Education , vocational education , also of greater importance to boys than to girls , suffered a sharp decline from 1982 to 1992 and has never recovered .
Since the early ‘ 90s the public discourse on gender , youth and education has largely been set by feminist academics and advocates .
The events surrounding this new study show that this is still true , as Duke is apparently unwilling to acknowledge and publicize what its research clearly shows — it is boys who are in crisis .
Twitter Presentations
This is a guest post from esteemed presentations and speaking expert Olivia Mitchell .
People used to whisper to each other or pass hand - scribbled notes during presentations .
Now these notes are going digital on Twitter or via conference - provided chat rooms .
Up until now , this back - channel has been mainly confined to the Internet industry and technology conferences .
However , a survey of leadership conferences from Weber Shandwick shows that there is a significant increase in blogging and twittering at conferences .
So the next time you present at a conference , instead of being confronted by a sea of faces looking at you , you may be phased by a sea of heads looking down at their laptops .
The challenge is how to adapt to presenting with the back - channel .
Benefits of the back channel to the audience
As a presenter , the idea of presenting while people are talking about you is disconcerting .
But to balance that , there are huge benefits to the individual members of the audience and to the overall output of a conference or meeting .
1 . It helps audience members focus
As a presenter , you might be worried that the back - channel will be distracting .
The opposite seems to be true .
Dean Shareski says :
The more I ’m allowed to interact and play with the content the more engaged and ultimately the more learning happens .
The more the presentation relies on the back channel , the more I focus .
Knowing that my comments are going to be seen by the presenter or live participants , seems to make me pay more attention .
Rachel Happe adds :
Twitter allows me to add my perspective to what is being presented and that keeps me more engaged than just sitting and listening – even if no one reads it .
2 . The audience gets more content
People tweeting during your presentation add explanations , elaborations , and useful links related to your content .
Liz Lawley comments :
My “ take - away content ” from the backchannel equalled or surpassed what I got from presentations directly .
3 . Audience members can get questions answered on the fly
In the past , you might have lent over to you neigbor and said “ What did she mean by that ? ” or you remained confused .
Now , audience members do n’t have to wait to clarify things they do n’t understand .
They can tweet their question and another audience member will tweet back with the answer .
Audience members who tuned out because they did n’t understand now stay engaged .
4 . The audience can participate
The back - channel blurs the line between the presenter and the audience .
Now everyone can be an active participant .
Here ’s an account from Gary Koelling of a twitter - fueled participative meeting :
And what struck me was the dynamic of this meeting .
It was participatory .
No one was talking out loud except the guy presenting the ppt .
But the conversation was roaring through the room via twitter .
It was exploding .
People were asking questions .
Pointing out problems .
Replying to each other all while the ppt was progressing along it ’s unwaveringly linear path .
5 . The audience can innovate
As your presentation sparks ideas , audience members can tweet them and build on each others ’ thoughts .
6 . You do n’t have to be physically present to participate
Not only can you watch a live videostream of the presentation , but you can also tweet or chat with the physically - present participants .
7 . You can connect with people
Being at a conference where you know no - one or only a few people can be intimidating .
People who know each other cluster together and you can feel out of the action .
But if you participate in the back channel , you ’ll get to know people virtually , and can then introduce yourself physically at the next break .
Liz Lawley states :
But the backchannel does n’t have a limited number of chairs .
Anyone can join — and as the two - day event wore on , more and more people did .
It allowed conversations to occur between people who would n’t have known to seek each other out otherwise .
8 . You can do something else
And lastly , if the speaker is tedious , you can get on and do something productive and no one will know .
What about the speaker ?
Yes , presenting with the back - channel is challenging .
Prepare yourself for what it will be like .
We ’re used to having eye contact with our audience and using that eye contact and audience reaction to measure how well we ’re engaging the audience .
Now when you say something brilliant , instead of nods of appreciation , there will be a flurry of tapping .
Here ’s the positive spin :
The typing means you ’re provoking interest
Martin Weller : I want people to be backchanneling during a talk I give because it shows what I am saying is provoking some interest .
Your colleagues can answer questions for you
David Harrison : I knew some of my colleagues who ’d helped with the presentation were following the event but what I could n’t imagine was how powerful a force having your co-workers liveblogging whilst you were talking could be .
You ’ll get immediate feedback
Paul Gillin : Having recently waited six months to get audience evaluations from one presentation , I can tell you that the immediacy of the tweeted feedback was wonderful .
I was able to use it to get a read quickly on the tech - savviness of the audience and adjust accordingly for the rest of the day .
They wo n’t fall asleep
Martin Weller :
And , if by some freak chance what I ’m saying is n’t interesting , then I ’d rather people were doing their email or reading blogs than sitting in my session feeling resentful because they are trapped .
Hey , I ’ve had people sleeping during a talk before – I ’d rather they were tapping away on their keyboards .
Managing the back channel
We used to suffer in silence through bad presentations .
Today , the audience is now connected .
They get to know that others are suffering too – and that changes the way they react .
The most notorious impact of the back channel was at the SXSW ’08 conference during the Keynote Interview .
Sarah Lacy was interviewing Mark Zuckerberg , the CEO of Facebook .
Audience unhappiness with the direction of the interview spread through the back channel and ended up with the audience taking over the interview .
Check out Jeremiah Owyang ’s account at A groundswell at SXSW 08 : How the audience revolted and asserted control .
But if you monitor the back channel , the results can be very different .
This is an account by Jeffrey Veen of moderating a panel at a conference .
He monitored the back channel through his phone :
As the conversation on stage continued , the stream of questions and comments from the audience intensified .
I changed my tactics based on what I saw .
I asked questions the audience was asking , and I immediately felt the tenor of the room shift towards my favor .
It felt a bit like cheating on an exam .
What this means is that when you ’re presenting with the back channel – you need to monitor that channel and be prepared to change course and adapt .
Robert Scoble says :
I hate being captive in an audience when the people on stage do n’t have a feedback loop going with the audience .
We ’re used to living a two - way life online and expect it when in an audience too .
Our expectations of speakers and people on stage have changed , for better or for worse .
How to monitor the presentation back channel
Set up a system to enable you to keep in touch with your audience through the back channel .
1 . Ask a friend or colleague , or a volunteer from the audience to monitor the back channel and interrupt you if there are any questions or comments that need to be addressed .
Jeffrey Veen calls this person an ombudsman for the audience .
2 . If you ca n’t find someone to take on this role take breaks – say every 10 mins – to check Twitter .
Robert Scoble calls this taking a twitter break .
You can combine this with asking the audience for “ out - loud ” questions as well .
It ’s good practice to stop for questions throughout your presentation – rather than leaving questions till the end .
3 . If you ’re courageous and know your content backwards , display the back channel on a screen that everyone ( including you ) can see .
This is potentially distracting for you and has the downside in that the visibility it provides can provoke silly tweets from some ( eg : “ Hi Mom ” ) .
But it does mean that you can react immediately to any issues .
Spend some time at the beginning of your presentation explaining to your audience how you will respond to the twitter following stream and audience members are more likely to use it responsibly .
Presenting while people are twittering is challenging .
But is n’t it better to get that feedback in real - time when you can do something to retrieve the situation – than wait till you read the evaluation sheets a few days after the conference – and find that you bombed ?
How have you monitored the presentation back channel ?
Do you have any other advice ?
Just as President Obama is promising major health reform , huge cutbacks in the news business are creating new challenges for health journalists who are trying to report on those policy issues , according to the survey and report written by Gary Schwitzer , associate professor in the University of Minnesota School of Journalism & Mass Communication .
The report was released today by the Kaiser Family Foundation at a Washington , D.C. briefing .
A video interview with Schwitzer about the report can be viewed on the University News Service Web site here : http://www1.umn.edu/urelate/newsservice/Multimedia_Videos/kaiser_report.htm
" The news media is one of the most important sources of information the general public has about health policy , " said Drew Altman , president of the Kaiser Family Foundation , " so it 's critical that our country continues to produce the best possible health journalism during this important period . "
A survey of members of the Association of Health Care Journalists ( AHCJ ) , conducted in partnership with AHCJ , and the report , The State of Health Journalism in the United States , written by Schwitzer , detail how the financial pressures on the media industry and the fierce competition to break news on new and expanding platforms on the Internet are affecting the quality of health reporting .
The difficulties cited in the reports have caused many in the industry to worry about the loss of in - depth , detailed reporting and the influence of public relations and advertising that could color news content .
The turmoil in the news business is affecting all beats in journalism , not just health .
Indeed , although AHCJ members report facing many difficulties in the current climate , they are more optimistic about the future of health journalism in particular than they are about journalism in general .
The full survey and report can be viewed online at http://kff.org/entmedia/mh031109pkg.cfm
Key findings from the survey of AHCJ members include :
Ninety - four percent of survey respondents say the bottom line pressure in media organizations is seriously hurting the quality of news coverage of health care issues .
Forty percent of staff reporters in the survey say the number of health reporters at their organization has gone down since they 've been there , and 11 percent say they personally have been laid off over the past few years due to downsizing .
Thirty - nine percent of respondents who are still in the business believe it is at least somewhat likely that their position will be eliminated in the next few years .
Nearly nine in ten ( 88 percent ) survey respondents think health care coverage leans too much toward short " quick hit " stories , and two - thirds ( 64 percent ) say the trend toward shorter stories has gotten worse in the past few years .
A majority of respondents ( 52 percent ) say there is too much coverage of consumer or lifestyle health , and too little of health policy ( 70 percent ) , health care quality ( 70 percent ) and health disparities ( 69 percent ) .

Charles Darwin's theory of evolution may have been shaped by his abhorrence of slavery as much as by his keen observations of Galapagos finches , a new book argues .
Darwin's Sacred Cause , by Adrian Desmond and James Moore , notes that slavery propaganda of the time often claimed that different races belonged to different species , a notion that Darwin 's work obliterated .
The book
suggests that Darwin 's unique approach to evolution - relating all races and species by " common descent " - could have been fostered by his anti-slavery beliefs [ BBC News ] .
Published to coincide with Darwin 's 200th birthday and the 150th anniversary of his publication of On the Origin of Species this year , the book is likely to stir up a new debate over Darwin 's motives .
Many members of Darwin 's extended family were deeply devoted to the abolitionist cause , including his grandfather , Josiah Wedgwood , who founded a chinaware company and produced cameos distributed by anti-slavery campaigners ; the medallions bore the legend " Am I Not a Man and a Brother ? "
Darwin's mother and wife were Wedgwoods and anti-slavery was what Darwin called a “ sacred cause ” .
He was taught to see the oppressed black as a “ brother ” .
This explains why , when he went to Edinburgh University at 16 , he could apprentice himself to a freed Guyanese slave to learn the art of bird preservation without thinking it [ beneath his dignity ] [ Times Online ] .
Darwin later described that former slave as one of his intimate friends .
During the voyage of the Beagle , Darwin saw scenes of slavery in South America that horrified him .
He
saw the aftermath of slave revolts and the instruments of torture , and heard of a planter who threatened to sell the children of recalcitrant slaves .
“ It makes one 's blood boil , yet heart tremble , ” he wrote [ Times Online ] .
Of course , that was also the voyage when Darwin tromped over the Galapagos Islands noting the differences between the beaks of finches and shells of tortoises that lived on different islands .
After returning from his journey , he began working on his theory that all animals evolve from common ancestors through the process of natural selection .
The authors of the new book say they are n't disputing that the scientific observations he made in the Galapagos were crucial to Darwin 's thinking , but they argue that his political views must have shaped the way he saw the world , and allowed him to put the pieces together .
" There 's got to be reasons why he came to common descent images of evolution when there was no precedent for that in the zoological science of his day , " Desmond [ said ] .
" It comes out of anti-slavery " [ Reuters ] .

Here is what it is about ...
All you politicians get to work DO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN !!!
Ok , lets get out there and let our state Legislature know that we do not want this bill passed , and petition them to vote no on this bill .
We should keep after thim untill the bill is closed .
By bombarding them with e-mails , phone calls , and letters .
Remember how Obama said that he was n't going to take your guns ?
Well , it seems that his minions and allies in the anti-gun world have no problem with taking your ammo !
The bill that is being pushed in 18 states ( including Illinois and Indiana ) requires all ammunition to be encoded by the manufacture a data base of all ammunition sales .
So they will know how much you buy and what calibers .
Nobody can sell any ammunition after June 30 , 2009 unless the ammunition is coded .
Any privately held uncoded ammunition must be destroyed by July 1 , 2011 .
( Including hand loaded ammo . )
They will also charge a .05 cent tax on every round so every box of ammo you buy will go up at least $ 2.50 or more !
If they can deprive you of ammo they do not need to take your gun !
This legislation is currently pending in 18 states : Alabama , Arizona , California , Connecticut , Hawaii , Illinois , Indiana , Kentucky , Maryland , Mississippi , Missouri , New Jersey , New York , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , South Carolina , Tennessee , and Washington .
To find more about the anti-gun group that is sponsoring this legislation and the specific legislation for each state , go to :
Ammunition Accountability Act
SAMPLE LEGISLATION
An ACT relating to firearms and ammunition ; requiring [ AGENCY ] to establish a statewide database to track coded ammunition manufactured and sold for handguns and assault rifles .
Section 1 . Legislative Findings .
The State Legislature hereby finds the following : Each year in the United States , more than 30 % of all homicides that involve a gun go unsolved .
Handgun ammunition accounts for 80 % of all ammunition sold in the United States .
Current technology for matching a bullet used in a crime to the gun that fired it has worked moderately well for years , but presupposes that the weapon was recovered by law enforcement .
Bullet coding is a new and effective way for law enforcement to quickly identify persons of interest in gun crime investigations .
( 30 % go unsolved .. what percentage of homicides will be solved with this technology ?
How will marking ammo improve solve rates when it can simply be altered before use , and unmarked ammo is currently available . )
Section 2 . Definitions .
For purposes of this chapter , " coded ammunition " means a bullet carrying a unique identifier that has been applied by etching onto the base of the bullet projectile .
( Most ammo is made of lead , simply pulling the bullet and removing the marks on it will render this law null and void .
There are plenty of reloaders currently on the market .
Criminals will know how to do it and those who do not would have been caught any way . )
Section 3 . Prohibition on possession or sale of non-coded ammunition .
1 . All handgun and assault weapon ammunition manufactured or sold in the state after January 1 , 2009 , shall be coded by the manufacturer .
( Impossible to achieve by January 1 of 2009 .
Current supplies are too large and would have to be destroyed at the cost of Millions to the Ammunition Industry . )

a . The calibers covered by the coding requirement shall include : .
2 . No later than January 1 , 2011 , all non-coded ammunition for the calibers listed in this
chapter , whether owned by private citizens or retail outlets , must be disposed .
Section 4 . Authority to establish an Ammunition Coding Database .
1. [ AGENCY ] shall be responsible for establishing and maintaining an Ammunition Coding Database ( ACD ) containing the following information :
a. Manufacturer registry - Manufacturers shall :
i. Register with [ AGENCY ] in a manner prescribed by the department through rule ; and
ii .
Maintain records on the business premises for a period of seven years concerning all sales , loans , and transfers of ammunition , to , from , or within the state .
b. Vendor registry - Vendors shall
i. Register with [ AGENCY ] in a manner prescribed by the department through rule ; and
ii .
Record the following information in a format prescribed by the [ AGENCY ] :
a . The date of the transaction .
b. The name of the transferee .
c. The purchaser 's driver 's license number or other government issued identification card number
d . The date of birth of the purchaser .
e . The unique identifier of all handgun ammunition or bullets transferred .
f. All other information prescribed by [ AGENCY ] .
iii .
Maintain records on the business premises for a period of three years from the date of the recorded purchase .
2 . To the greatest extent possible or practical , the ACD shall be built within the framework of existing firearms databases .
The ACD shall be operational no later than January 1 , 2009 .
3. Privacy of individuals is of the utmost importance .
Access to information in the ACSD is reserved for key law enforcement personnel and to be released only in connection with a criminal investigation .
NEW SECTION : Section 5 . Penalties
1 . Any vendor that willfully fails to comply with , or falsifies the records required to be kept by this bill is guilty of a public offense punishable by imprisonment not to exceed one year , and a fine of $ 1,000 .
2 . Any manufacturer that fails to comply with the provisions of this section shall be liable for a civil fine of not more than one $ 1,000 for a first violation , not more than five $ 5,000 for a second violation , and not more $ 10,000 for a third and subsequent violation .
3 . Any person who willfully destroys , obliterates , or otherwise renders unreadable , the serialization required pursuant to this bill , on any bullet or assembled ammunition is punishable by imprisonment not to exceed one year , and a fine of $ 1,000 .
( So if you fire a bullet is it a criminal offense ?
Bullets tumbling into a target or body can be damaged .
Some break apart .
If a bullet breaks into pieces the markings will be damaged . )
NEW SECTION : Section 6 . Funding .
1. Establishing and maintaining the ACD shall be funded by an end - user fee not to exceed [ COST NUMBER , ESTIMATED AT $ 0.005 PER BULLET OR ROUND OF AMMUNITION ] .
( This is the initial cost , what is the down line cost , and sets a precedent of taxation on ammunition at higher rates later .
Higher costs means fewer sales .
Fewer sales result in layoffs in an economy that can ill afford more layoffs . )
2 . There is hereby established the Coded Ammunition Fund for deposit of the end user fees described in this section .
Moneys in the fund , upon appropriation , shall be available to the [ AGENCY ] for infrastructure , implementation , operational , enforcement , and future development costs of this chapter .
( Creating another Government Agency and more records at what cost ?
Another punishment for law abiding gun owners .
Criminals will be able to get around this by theft , and by simply obliterating the ammunition , and using older ammunition that is not destroyed . )
3. Ammunition manufacturers based within this state may submit a one - time tax credit application for cost of purchasing ammunition coding equipment .
All applications must be submitted by January 1 , 2009 . ( One time tax credit ?
Ammunition technology changes , as it does will business be allowed to take legitimate machine costs ? )
I believe this is unworkable .
With the millions of rounds out there it would be years before the old ones were used , and the black market for shells without markings would be tremendous .
Are we going to do house to house searches ??
Here is what it is about ...
All you politicians get to work DO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN !!!
Ok , lets get out there and let our state Legislature know that we do not want this bill passed , and petition them to vote no on this bill .

14 " For the kingdom of heaven is like a man traveling to a far country , who called his own servants and delivered his goods to them .
15 " And to one he gave five talents , to another two , and to another one , to each according to his own ability ; and immediately he went on a journey .
16 " Then he who had received the five talents went and traded with them , and made another five talents .
17 " And likewise he who had received two gained two more also .
18 " But he who had received one went and dug in the ground , and hid his lord 's money .
19 " After a long time the lord of those servants came and settled accounts with them .
20 " So he who had received five talents came and brought five other talents , saying , ' Lord , you delivered to me five talents ; look , I have gained five more talents besides them . '
21 " His lord said to him , ' Well done , good and faithful servant ; you were faithful over a few things , I will make you ruler over many things .
Enter into the joy of your lord . '
22 " He also who had received two talents came and said , ' Lord , you delivered to me two talents ; look , I have gained two more talents besides them . '
23 " His lord said to him , ' Well done , good and faithful servant ; you have been faithful over a few things , I will make you ruler over many things .
Enter into the joy of your lord . '
24 " Then he who had received the one talent came and said , ' Lord , I knew you to be a hard man , reaping where you have not sown , and gathering where you have not scattered seed .
25 ' And I was afraid , and went and hid your talent in the ground .
Look , there you have what is yours . '
26 " But his lord answered and said to him , ' You wicked and lazy servant , you knew that I reap where I have not sown , and gather where I have not scattered seed .
27 ' So you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers , and at my coming I would have received back my own with interest .
28 ' Therefore take the talent from him , and give it to him who has ten talents .
29 ' For to everyone who has , more will be given , and he will have abundance ; but from him who does not have , even what he has will be taken away .

11 Now as they heard these things ,
He spoke another parable , because He was near Jerusalem and because they thought the kingdom of God would appear immediately .
12 Therefore
He said : " A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return .
13 " So he called ten of his servants , delivered to them ten minas , and said to them , ' Do business till I come . '
14 " But his citizens hated him , and sent a delegation after him , saying , ' We will not have this man to reign over us . '
15 " And so it was that when he returned , having received the kingdom , he then commanded these servants , to whom he had given the money , to be called to him , that he might know how much every man had gained by trading .
16 " Then came the first , saying , ' Master , your mina has earned ten minas . '
17 " And he said to him , ' Well done , good servant ; because you were faithful in a very little , have authority over ten cities . '
18 " And the second came , saying , ' Master , your mina has earned five minas . '
19 " Likewise he said to him , ' You also be over five cities . '
20 " Then another came , saying , ' Master , here is your mina , which I have kept put away in a handkerchief .
21 ' For I feared you , because you are an austere man .
You collect what you did not deposit , and reap what you did not sow . '
22 " And he said to him , ' Out of your own mouth I will judge you , you wicked servant .
You knew that I was an austere man , collecting what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow .
23 ' Why then did you not put my money in the bank , that at my coming I might have collected it with interest ? '
24 " And he said to those who stood by , ' Take the mina from him , and give it to him who has ten minas . '
25 ( " But they said to him , ' Master , he has ten minas . ')
26 ' For I say to you , that to everyone who has will be given ; and from him who does not have , even what he has will be taken away from him .
( Luke 19:11 - 26 )
***********************
It is important to note that most of the Scriptures are from the Mosaic Covenant , a specific Covenant Yahweh made with a specific people ( Israel ) in a specific land for a designated time which ended when the New Covenant was established .
The Mosaic Law was symbolic of higher truths and it is that which we must seek when looking at the Mosaic Law .
If we are not to return to slaughtering animals and stoning our rebellious children , we must be careful about applying rules for living in Israel under the Old Covenant in an agricultural kingdom .
We live in much different times .
Read Galatians , especially chapters 3 , 4 , and 5 to see that we are NOT to mix the two lest we fall from grace and get under condemnation .
2 Cor. Chapter 3 is another good chapter to become thoroughly acquainted with .
The key is to find out what these types and shadows point to .
Mixing wool and linen ( flax ) , for example , points to not mixing Mosaic Law ( causes sweat which speaks of works ) and Grace ( linen , absorbs sweat and speaks of ceasing from our labors and entering the rest of God under Grace . )
If we go back to the Mosaic Law , we fall from Grace .
( Galatians 5:4 )
Furthermore , we must be careful how we interpret New Testament parables .
Many assume this parable speaks of Jesus as the " Lord " in the parable .
This is NOT the case .
This " Lord " was " austere " or " hard . "
Jesus is not .
This Lord reaped where He did not sow .
Jesus does not .
It is vital we get the aid of the Holy Spirit on how to understand the types and shadows of the Old Covenant and apply them to ourselves in spiritual ways .
And it is vital we understand the parables by the Holy Spirit and not some Bible commentary or marginal note in a Study Bible .

The image of cities is often traffic - clogged , polluted and energy - guzzling , but a new study has shown that city dwellers have smaller carbon footprints than national averages .
The report by London - based International Institute for Environment and Development ( IIED ) looked at 11 major cities on four continents , including London , Tokyo , New York and Rio de Janeiro .
It found per capita greenhouse gas emissions for a Londoner in 2004 were the equivalent of 6.2 tonnes of CO2 , compared with 11.19 for the UK average .
The rural northeast of England , Yorkshire and the Humber , were singled out for having the highest footprints per capita in the UK .
In the US , New Yorkers register footprints of 7.1 tonnes each , less than a thrid of the US average of 23.92 tonnes .
The use of public transport and denser housing are two of the reasons for urbanites ' comparatively low carbon footprints , the authors said , adding that the design of cities significantly affects their residents ' emissions .
" Tokyo has considerably lower emissions per person than either Beijing or Shanghai and this shows clearly that prosperity does not lead inevitably to greater emissions , " said report author David Dodman .
" Well - designed and well - governed cities can combine high living standards with much lower greenhouse gas emissions . "
Greenhouse gas emissions per capita ( tonnes of CO2 equivalen ) .
Source : Guardian / IIED
The report coincides with a study published today by the UK's Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment , which called for more spending on parks and trees in cities to create jobs and cut climate change emissions .
The IIED is not the first organisation to suggest city living is greener than living in the countryside : last summer the Brookings Institute said residents in US cities had 14 % lower footprints than the US average .
The authors of this new report , however , admit that assessing emissions is not an exact science because different countries and cities employ different methodologies for counting CO2 emissions , making a precise like - for - like comparison difficult .
Most city dwellers ' emissions are also still too high to curb climate change , despite being low compared with national averages .
" With the exceptions of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro , all of the cities surveyed already exceed the per capita ﬁgure " needed to keep CO2 levels below 450 parts per million , warned Dodman .

No wonder Senator Christopher Dodd ( D - Conn ) went wobbly last week when asked about his February amendment ratifying hundreds of millions of dollars in bonuses to executives at insurance giant AIG .
Dodd has been one of the company 's favorite recipients of campaign contributions .
But it turns out that Senator Dodd 's wife has also benefited from past connections to AIG as well .
From 2001 - 2004 , Jackie Clegg Dodd served as an " outside " director of IPC Holdings , Ltd. , a Bermuda - based company controlled by AIG .
IPC , which provides property casualty catastrophe insurance coverage , was formed in 1993 and currently has a market cap of $ 1.4 billion and trades on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol IPCR .
In 2001 , in addition to a public offering of 15 million shares of stock that raised $ 380 million , IPC raised more than $ 109 million through a simultaneous private placement sale of 5.6 million shares of stock to AIG - giving AIG a 20 % stake in IPC .
( AIG sold its 13.397 million shares in IPC in August , 2006 . )
Clegg was compensated for her duties to the company , which was managed by a subsidiary of AIG .
In 2003 , according to a proxy statement , Clegg received $ 12,000 per year and an additional $ 1,000 for each Directors ' and committee meeting she attended .
Clegg served on the Audit and Investment committees during her final year on the board .
IPC paid millions each year to other AIG - related companies for administrative and other services .
Clegg was a diligent director .
In 2003 , the proxy statement report , she attended more than 75 % of board and committee meetings .
This while she served as the managing partner of Clegg International Consultants , LLC , which she created in 2001 , the year she joined the board of IPC .
( See Dodd 's public financial disclosure reports with the Senate from 2001 - 2004 here . )
Dodd is likely more familiar with the complicated workings of AIG than he was letting on last week .
This week may provide him with another opportunity to refresh his recollections .
When travelling for the first time abroad , or in an independent sense , as opposed to having been on a package holiday where you are looked after throughout , it is easy to take some basic steps that will help ensure both your safety and your enjoyment of your trip .
Travelling on your own schedule , and choosing the things you see and do , is an absolutely wonderful experience !
Nothing compares with the thrill of arriving in a new city , finding somewhere to say , and experiencing a new place , or going to a railway station and seeing what trains are listed , and just picking a destination .
I 've backpacked in India , Russia , Turkey , Mongolia , China , and much of Eastern Europe , and it's an experience I would recommend strongly to anyone .
A bit of basic research and preparation will make your journey a lot better .
So make the most of it , and stay healthy , fit , and safe during your adventures .
WASHINGTON  When Dennis C. Blair , the director of national intelligence , announced that he would install Charles W. Freeman Jr. in a top intelligence post , the decision surprised some in the White House who worried that the selection could be controversial and an unnecessary distraction , according to administration officials .
Just how controversial the choice would be became clear on Tuesday , when Mr. Freeman , a former ambassador to Saudi Arabia under the first President Bush , angrily withdrew his name from consideration and charged that he had been the victim of a concerted campaign by what he called “ the Israel lobby . ”
Mr. Freeman had long been critical of Israel , with a bluntness that American officials rarely voice in public about a staunch American ally .
In 2006 , he warned that , “ left to its own devices , the Israeli establishment will make decisions that harm Israelis , threaten all associated with them and enrage those who are not . ”
He did not soften his tone even on Wednesday , saying in an interview that “ Israel is driving itself toward a cliff , and it is irresponsible not to question Israeli policy and to decide what is best for the American people . ”

I 've known for a while , and even mentioned on Ars , that Intel has a team that 's actively courting the Sony PlayStation 4 contract , and Intel VP Pat Gelsinger affirmed to me in an interview that the company would love to be in a next - generation console .
But The Inquirer 's Charlie Demerjian has published a whale of a post - CES rumor claiming that Intel 's forthcoming Larrabee GPU did indeed score the GPU spot on Sony 's next - gen console .
There will be a ton of skepticism over this , and for good reason — I myself have actually had informal , off - the - record conversations that indicate to me that there may not be a lot of love for Intel on the technical front inside of Sony .
But this rumor has a lot going for it .
I 'll enumerate the plusses and minuses below , but before jumping in let 's hand the mic over to official Sony PR for their take .
" We do not comment on rumors and speculations .
Our utmost priority is to further increase the installed base for PS3 and PSP , with more new and exciting entertainment and services ( game / non - game and package / network ) , " a Sony spokesperson told Ars.
" PS3 is still in its third year from launch and it is too premature to talk about the next - generation home platform .
At this time , nothing concrete has been decided . "
I actually believe that nothing concrete has been decided .
But Sony may be leaning one way or the other .
Let 's look at the forces at work .
It 's all about the ( rapidly shrinking ) bottom line
The number one , overriding factor in any decision that Sony makes right now is money — and I do n't mean , " how will we grow our console marketshare and conquer the living room , " but " how will we stop hemorrhaging money and ensure that , whatever happens with the next generation of consoles , we attain profitability with the PS4 as quickly as possible . "
Given this new reality , I find Charlie 's claim that Intel essentially bought its way into the PS4 — technical considerations be damned — very convincing .
This " ten- year console " stuff , where Sony looks at a console 's overall profitability over the course of a decade ?
That 's the kind of thing you can afford to do when you 're not staring into the abyss .
Intel has deep enough pockets and enough fab capacity to take a real hit to its margins on Larrabee and offer Sony a cheap GPU with guaranteed availability .
If any semi maker is going to survive this recession and come out the other side still fully invested in the success of a discrete graphics product , it will be Intel .
As for the Kuturagi - style grand visions of Pixar - quality graphics in the living room , and networked consoles all changing the way we entertain ourselves , that , too , is bull - market bull .
With the PS4 , Sony will just want to stay in the game , and have a very quick path to profitability .
One might even go so far as to say that , at this point , Sony execs probably wish they had gone the Wii route .
Note that these same financial pressures also drastically change the cross- platform development equation from the console vendor 's perspective .
In the distant , more profit - friendly past past of early 2008 , console makers still courted exclusive titles , and Sony in particular counted it as a major plus that games optimized to take full advantage of PS3 would n't be easily portable to Xbox or the PC .
But in today 's world of shrinking margins , Sony 's incentives have shifted 180 degrees , and with Larrabee ( especially if it 's paired with a Nehalem - derived CPU ) , Sony can actually boast , " write it once , run it on the PlayStation 4 and the PC , " to developers .
To sum up , Sony has paid a heavy price for its efforts to attract exclusive titles to the PS3 by promising developers superior visuals , and that 's a price that the company cannot afford to pay with its next console .
What about Cell ?
My guess is that if Sony were free to fantasize about the console that it would ideally like to produce with PS4 , it would probably just double down on Cell .
And why not ?
The same things that make Cell hard to program will also plague Larrabee .
The programming problems that come with the many - core paradigm — a paradigm that both Cell and Larrabee fit under — are fundamental , algorithm - level design problems that are essentially ISA - indifferent .
( Yes , this is a shift from my previous " x86 will own the GPU stance . " )
So Sony could safely just do more of Cell with PS4 by just increasing the number of dedicated vector units and general - purpose cores .
This would also give the company free backwards compatibility with existing PS3 titles , and , of course , enable it to leverage existing investments in the PS3 developer toolchain and in Cell itself .
Ultimately , the question of which horse Sony bets on next hinges on the numbers , and specifically on whether Intel is able to paint Larrabee as the cheaper option going forward , even when the cost of ditching the hardware and software investment in Cell is factored in .
Here 's the world 's shortest , fairest , and simplest licence agreement : " Do n't violate copyright law . "
If I had my way , every digital download from the music in the iTunes and Amazon MP3 store , to the ebooks for the Kindle and Sony Reader , to the games for your Xbox , would bear this – and only this – as its licence agreement .
" Do n't violate copyright law " has a lot going for it , but the best thing about it is what it signals to the purchaser , namely : " You are not about to get screwed . "
The copyright wars have produced some odd and funny outcomes , but I think the oddest was when the record industry began to campaign for more copyright education on the grounds that young people were growing up without the moral sensibility that they need to become functional members of society .
The same companies that spent decades telling lawmakers that they were explicitly not the guardians of the morality of the young – that they could n't be held accountable for sex , drugs and rock 'n'roll , for gangsta rap , for drug - fuelled dance - parties – did a complete reversal and began to beat their chests about the corrupting influence of downloading on the poor kiddies .
Well , they got it half - right : the fact that kids – and lots of adults – do n't see anything wrong with destroying the record labels is certainly bad news for the record companies .
Back when Napster started , the general feeling was that the record companies deserved to die for all the packaged boy bands , for discontinuing the single , for killing the backlist , for price - fixing CDs , and for notoriously miserable contracts for artists .
Then came the digital rights management , the lawsuits ( first against toolmakers like Napster , then against tens of thousands of music fans ) , then the use of malicious software to fight copying , the procurement of one - sided laws , the destruction of internet radio .
Brick by brick , the record companies built the moral case for ripping them off ( and the movie companies , broadcasters , ebook publishers , and game companies were n't far behind ) .
As the copyfight wore on , wrecking the entertainment industry became an ever - more attractive proposition .
A decade later and the record industry has finally brought back the single , and there seems to be some semblance of price - competition ( contracts for artists and the existence of boy bands still go in the minus column of course ) .
They 've even got rid of digital rights management for the majority of music sales , and the backlist is much bigger than it was in the record - store days .
So now the pitch goes : " We gave you what you asked for , you 've brought us to our knees .
Now , please stop ripping us off and start buying music again – we 're offering a fair deal . "
But anyone who examines the pitch closely can see it for what it really is : just more bait for yet another trap .
It 's that pesky user - agreement .
When you go into one of the few remaining record stores , there 's no clerk beside the till chanting , " By buying this music , you agree to the following terms and conditions , " rattling off an inexhaustible set of rights that you 're surrendering for having the temerity to buy your music instead of ripping it off .
If the sales - pitch for a download is , " a fair deal " , then it has to be a fair deal .
The activities that these licence agreements restrict range from the ridiculous to the dubious , though I suppose reasonable people might disagree about the fairness of selling or loaning out your digital music collection .
But it 's not the entertainment industry 's job to tell me what are and are not fair terms of sale for my downloads .
If loaning an MP3 should be illegal , let them get a law passed ( they 're apparently good at that – the fact that they have n't managed it to date should tell you something about the reasonableness of the proposition ) .
The one - sided , un- negotiated licence agreement lurking behind the " Check here to affirm that you have read and agreed to our terms of service " represents a wishful ( even delusional ) version of how a purchase works .
If the pitch is , " this is a fair deal " , then the EULA should be : " You can
do anything with this , so long as you do n't break the law . "
Not " Abandon hope , all ye who purchase here . "
March 24 , 2009 ( PARIS ) —
The leader a Darfur rebel movement appealed today for an international humanitarian intervention in western Sudan to relief the war affected population after the expulsion of 13 aid group early this month .
Displaced Darfurians arrive by truck at the Zamzam refugee camp in northern Darfur , Sudan , Thursday , Feb. 26 , 2009 .
( AP )
The leader of the rebel Sudan Liberation Movement ( SLM ) Abdel Wahid Al - Nur called on the international community to operate a humanitarian intervention in order to protect civilian in Darfur .
He said receiving alarming reports from the ground about the situation there .
He pointed out that the Internally Displaced Persons ( IDPs ) in the different camps refuse to deal with the Sudanese government workers who replace the 13 foreign non-governmental organizations that Khartoum expelled on 4 and 5 March accusing them of cooperation with the ICC , legal and administrative reasons .
" The IDPs can not trust or deal with people sent by the same government that orchestratedstheir killing and suffering on daily basis and since 2003 , he said .
The presence of the foreign aid groups " reassured them and provided them some security " he added .
After huge international pressures Sudan allowed the NGOs to operate in Darfur in 2004 , after barring the UN staff in the country from providing any help to the millions of displaced during one year where many atrocities and crimes had been committed .
Nur said that Sudanese government with the absence of international aid worker can now " apply the final solution to erase the traces of their cause or expel them from their lands once for all . "
The expulsion of the 13 foreign groups who distribute the humanitarian aid provided by the WFP and manage it in various sectors ( food aid , health and nutrition , non -food items and shelter , and water , sanitation , and hygiene ) created a gab that Sudan has pledged to meet through the sudanization of the humanitarian activities .
Darfur IDPs also say that pro-government militia are now deployed many camps and they fear to be attacked by them .
Since the ICC arrest warrant for President Al - Bashir many attacks have been reported against aid workers and the peacekeepers .
Also Hussein Abu Sharati the spokesperson of Darfur IDPs told Sudan Tribune today that Darfur camps are facing now three major problems , the lack of security , gap of food distribution and lack of health and medical services .
He said armed militiamen killed yesterday one of child from the camp of Hassa Hissa , in western Darfur .
He added that the absence of a " neutral body " would encourage the janjaweed to resume their deadly attacks on the civilians .
He also added there are now more than 400 cases of Cholera and Meningitis in the different camps .
Ahmed Hussein Adam , the spokesperson of the rebel Justice and Equality Movement told Sudan Tribune yesterday that four children had died at the Shangil Tobaya camp in North Darfur over the last couple of days due to the malnutrition .
Abu Sharati also confirmed the death and added that within one week " you could hear a lot of such news " because the situation is very bad in the camps .
The Sudanese government and the UN said today they agreed on a two moths plan to bridge the gaps created by the forced departure of 13 NGOs from Darfur .
Some 4.7 million people rely on humanitarian aid in Darfur , where the United Nations runs its largest aid operation in the world with the help of aid groups .
The joint Sudan UN assessment published today said four of the expelled non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) served some 1.1 million people .

Wednesday , February 11 , 2009 WASHINGTON — A U.S. Army report warns that Iraq could collapse in wake of a rapid American withdrawal .
" A rapid withdrawal while on the verge of irreversible victory could cause a collapse in Iraq surmounting to secular conflict or civil war and would be a monumental setback to U.S. foreign policy , " the report , titled " The Serpent in Our Garden : Al Qaida and the Long War , " said .
" Not to mention this setback would have a serious impact on the price of oil , negatively affecting world economies . "
Authored by Col. Brian Drinkwine , the report said U.S. stabilization efforts in Iraq have been hampered by a lack of expertise .
The report said Washington must double or triple reconstruction personnel to " ultimately speed up a full transition over to Iraqi control . "
Also In This Edition New , by Bill Gertz : ' Failure Factory ' " Currently , Coalition COIN [ counter - insurgency ] efforts continue to struggle because of the limited availability of civil reconstruction and governance expertise , primarily a State Department role or mission , " the report said .
The report was released in February 2009 amid plans by the new administration of President Barack Obama to accelerate a U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq .
Officials said several leading commanders , including Central Command chief Gen. David Petraeus , have warned Obama that a rapid withdrawal could destabilize Iraq .
" A stable Iraq with a capable and legitimate government , able to self - rule and defend its borders and interior , is of mutual interest to many Middle Eastern countries as well as the world 's major powers , " the report said .
" This mutual interest can be leveraged to assure commitments by other nations to support continued stability in Iraq until the country can emerge as a stabilizer in the Middle East , capable of offsetting a rogue state such as Iran or capable of dealing with newly emerging non-state threats . "
The report said the United States should reduce its " overt military presence " in the Middle East .
But Drinkwine , regarded as a leading counter - insurgency expert , said Washington must " stay very connected . "
" We must drop the democracy dialogue and then gain better footing to communicate strategically with multiple target audiences , " the report said .

White House spokesman mocks CNBC after Stewart skewering David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Friday March 13 , 2009
Print This Email This
The public skewering of CNBC's Jim Cramer on Thursday night 's Daily Show with Jon Stewart quickly became the talk of the nation .
Even the White House had something to say about it .
Asked if he'd seen the interview , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said he thoroughly enjoyed it , then mocked the embattled financial news network with the aside , " I 'm not surprised that the video of Mr. Cramer 's appearance does n't appear on CNBC 's website today . "
" Cramer was assured an opportunity for public humiliation on television , with the guarantee that it will subsequently go viral , " opined blogger Sharon Waxman .
" And that s what he got . "
At the time of this writing , CNBC.com appeared to be having server load difficulties .
" I do n't know if you or the President saw the Jon Stewart piece last night , but was serious journalism .
Does the White House believe this is the obligation of journalists , to call out lies and warn of dangers ahead ? "
Gibbs was asked .
" The president and I talked earlier in the day about watching it , " he replied .
" I forgot to e-mail to remind him it was on , so I do n't know if he 's seen it . "
Gibbs hesitated .
" I ... enjoyed it thoroughly , " he said with a grin and chuckle , drawing laughs from the press corps .
" Despite , even as Mr. Stewart said , it may have been uncomfortable to conduct and uncomfortable to watch .
I thought it was , um -- I thought somebody asked a lot of tough questions .
" I am not surprised that the video of Mr. Cramer 's appearance does n't appear on CNBC website today , " he concluded .
The jab , while a humorus insight , is at least slightly unfair .
Shortly before Cramer appeared on Stewart 's show he made an appearance with Martha Stewart , which is also absent the network 's Web site .
CNBC.com does not host outside content or links .
Friday morning , Cramer was strangely absent at a planned exclusive sit - down with MSNBC host Joe Scarborough .
" Perhaps another example of oversleeping , " said Scarborough .
" Guess he had a late night .
That is too bad .
Producers told he was only talking to us . "

Americans Ecstatic About $ 10 a Week Stimulus
Hold onto your horses America , the downward spiral of economic decline is about to end this March as $ 10 makes its way into our weekly paychecks .
As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act , $ 400 will be split up as tax breaks throughout the remainder of 2009 .
Not surprisingly , most Americans are giddy with glee about the extra fattening of their wallets .
" I think I might try out that new burger joint on Fourth Street , " said Cleveland Ohio native Paul Anderson .
After losing his job late in 2008 , Anderson also lost his home to foreclosure .
" It 's not steady work , which is really what I would like , but sometimes a burger really hits the spot . "
Thousands of others who experienced similar hardships are equally excited and optimistic , putting aside the fact that many have lost everything they have worked their entire lives to attain .
" Instead of bowling two games , I can bowl three again , " said one man .
" I 'll use this money to take my wife out to eat at a fancy fast food restaurant ... you know , the ones with the cardboard crowns and maybe even some balloons , " said another .
Analysts are already predicting the increased consumer spending on fast food , bowling , alcohol , and various other impulse buys , which were previously reserved for only the upper-class of American society , will quickly jolt the economy back to life and usher in an era of unbridled growth and prosperity .
As for me , I 'll be doing my part to help the economy by purchasing pepperoni pizzas , six - packs of Bud Light , and that shiny new coffee mug I 've had my eye on. isplay : none " >

A gunman burst into a North Carolina nursing home Sunday and opened fire on terrified people in their rooms , killing seven elderly residents and a nurse caring for them .
Authorities said Robert Stewart also wounded three others , including Carthage police officer Justin Garner , who traded gunfire with Stewart and wounded him in a hallway of Pinelake Health and Rehab .
Stewart was subsequently arrested .
Garner , 25 , was shot in the leg .
" He acted in nothing short of a heroic way today , and but for his actions , we certainly could have had a worse tragedy , " said Moore County District Attorney Maureen Krueger .
" We had an officer — a well - trained officer — who performed his job the way he was supposed to and prevented this from getting even worse than it is now . "
Krueger said Stewart , 45 , of Moore County , has been charged with eight counts of first - degree murder and a single charge of felony assault of a law enforcement officer .
Authorities offered few other details , except to say that Stewart was not a patient or an employee at the nursing home , and is n't believed to be related to any of the victims .
While authorities declined to comment on a possible motive , Stewart 's ex-wife .
Sue Griffin , said he had recently been calling family members , telling them he had cancer and was preparing to " go away . "
" He did have some violent tendencies from time to time , " Griffin said .
" I would n't put it past him .
I hate to say it , but it is true . "
Shattered windows
Carthage police , Moore County sheriff 's deputies and the State Bureau of Investigation conducted a search Sunday afternoon of the nursing home and its parking lot , where the windows of at least two cars were shattered .
Among the items they found was a camouflage - coloured rifle or shotgun , which was leaning against the side of a Jeep Cherokee .
" I do n't know if the emotion entirely has set in , " said Carthage police Chief Chris McKenzie .
" It 's a small community built on faith , and faith will get us through . "
Carthage is a town of about 1,800 people in the North Carolina Sandhills , an area popular among retirees and home to several noted golf courses , including the famed Pinehurst resort that regularly hosts the U.S. Open .
The " Bag " and " Totem " radiators are actually more like contemporary showpieces .
Both models are composed of a warm wooden body that is heated with aluminum detailing .

( CNN ) --
A city official in the remote Brazilian Amazon village of Envira told CNN that five members of the Kulina tribe are on the run after being accused of murdering , butchering and eating a farmer in a ritual act of cannibalism .
The village 's chief of staff , Maronilton da Silva Clementino , said Kulina tribesmen took the life of Ocelio Alves de Carvalho , 19 , last week on the outskirts of Envira , which is in the far western part of Brazil that bumps up against Peru .
Portal Amazonia newspaper reported that the Indians escaped after being held for a few hours in the city 's police station .
No arrest warrants were issued .
Brazilian law does not allow the military or civil police to enter Indian lands , Portal Amazonia reported .
It is still unknown how many people took part in the alleged cannibalistic ritual , although several Indians have fled into the jungle fearing prosecution , the newspaper Diario do Amazonas reported .
Clementino said the victim was herding cattle when he met with a group of Indians who invited him back to their village .
" They knew each other and they sometimes helped one another .
They invited him to their reservation three days ago and he was never seen again , " Clementino said .
" The family decided to go into the reservation and that 's when they saw his body quartered and his skull hanging on a tree .
It was very tragic for the family , " he said .
The news of the incident came from the Indians themselves , who apparently bragged about eating the man 's organs , Clementino said .
Members of the tribe told residents of Envira -- where 190 Kulina families brush shoulders with non-tribal Brazilians -- that they held a cannibalistic ritual in which they cooked the victim 's organs , Clementino said .
He said Kulina Indians began surrounding the police station where the suspects were briefly interrogated .
Villagers told authorities they are incensed by the lack of response from FUNAI , Brazil 's National Indian Foundation .
" The family is very frustrated with the law here , which protects the Indians and does n't help protect us , " he said .
" They start drinking and local farmers here are afraid who could be next . "
Clementino said groups Indians -- often outnumbering police -- pose a security threat to locals .
He said the man 's family are upset that authorities did not arrive until three days later .
But a FUNAI official told the newspaper Voz do Acre that access to Envira is very difficult , requiring long boat or helicopter rides .
According to FUNAI , about 2,500 Kulina live in Brazil 's Acre state , which borders with Peru , where 450 Kulina live .
This remote jungle corridor is known for its isolated tribes .
The Kulina are classified as an " isolated " tribe but some have contact with the non-indian population .
The Kulina are also known for their complex language .
FUNAI studies show that Kulina women speak a completely different language from the men .
According to FUNAI , there are 460,000 Indians in Brazil and 1,300 indian languages .
There are 55 groups considered to live in isolation .

Sony 's somewhat perplexingly lagged behind Microsoft in its online web - portal / console integration , advancing tentatively rather than roaring forward like a vanguard .
Logging into the company 's nascent - seeming PlayStation Network through a web browser 's been like using one of those functionally stark ISP webmail portals you get free with your cable or DSL subscription , but probably do n't even realize exists .
Trophies —
Sony's PS3 - based answer to Microsoft's Xbox 360 achievements — came along years after Microsoft popularized the concept .
Even then , keeping track of how many bronze or golds you 've unlocked and whether you 're a " wallrunner " in Prince of Persia or a " flyswatter " in Resistance 2 was impossible the moment you put down your gamepad and stepped away from Sony 's whirring black obelisk .
Good news for trophy wonks , then , per Sony 's PlayStation .
Blog .
Starting today , trophies are available online to peruse with your PSN ID , viewable in all their bronze , silver , gold ( and for you insanely skilled freaks of nature , platinum ) glory .
The bad news ?
That 's about all you can do with the feature .
No comparing trophies with friends , no option to pull a trophy - laden gamer card into your PSN forum ID , no interlink with a virtual trophy room in PlayStation Home .
In short , Sony 's simply made it possible for those of you with kakorrhaphiophobia ( and who thus need to keep their accomplishment cards close at hand ) to function a trifle more normatively .
The update in fact seems to highlight more of what 's missing than what 's not .
Where 's the option to send quick messages to friends through PSN 's web interface ?
A PSN to PC messaging connector ?
The option to see and interact with this stuff on a PSP ?
More granular gamercards ?
A bunch of really cool new features no one else has implemented or even thought of yet ?
One thing at a time , okay , fair enough .
I 'm patient , and I would n't personally use a lot of that stuff .
But I 'd like to see Sony back up a bit and pull together a really full - featured update along the lines of Microsoft 's so - called " New Xbox Experience " instead of simply dribbling nominal tweaks .
Matt Peckham applauds
Sony for its ongoing attempts to get the PSN up to snuff , but can't ( yet ) see any reason to tinker with his trophy list online .

2011 Grammy Award Winners
2010 Grammy Award Winners
Well , the 2009 Grammys are officially over , and a surprising duo cleaned - up this year –Alison Krauss and Robert Plant , who took home five awards , including Album of the Year for their album , Raising Sand , Record Of The Year ( for “ Please Read The Letter ” ) , Best Pop Collaboration With Vocals ( for “ Rich Woman ” ) , and Best Country Collaboration With Vocals ( for “ Killing The Blues ” ) .
If you ’re wondering how two songs from the same album could win country and pop awards , I ’m as confused as you are .
Coldplay also faired quite nicely , nabbing the award for Best Rock Album ( for Viva La Vida , which they should n’t be too proud of , since they beat that totally terrible Kings of Leon album ) , and Best Pop Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocals and Song Of The Year for “ Viva La Vida . ”
Radiohead walked with Best Alternative Album ( can someone explain the difference between “ alternative ” and “ rock ? ”

If you ’ve been listening to The Alex Jones Show lately , you may have heard of the Illuminati plan to unleash biological warfare on the world .
Well , the operation is apparently about to go live in the near future .
It ’s important that you are prepared for this time , because millions , perhaps billions of people will die in ignorance .
So before they come for you under Martial Law , get ready .
Thankfully , some researchers have been ahead of the game looking for ways to counteract bio-warfare .
I ’ll give you a few tips , and then a specific application against a common bio - weapon , bird flu .
Rather than using dangerous vaccines , you may want to try at it with more natural preventative / curative methods .
Basic Shopping List
1. Masks :
You can buy hygienic masks hopefully in your pharmacy , otherwise head to a supply store or larger department store , like Wal - Mart ( preferably not them , though ) .
You ’ll need a mask both to protect yourself from germs and coughing , as well as to protect others in case you get infected .
While you ’re at it , you may want to invest in a more advanced gas mask , to protect yourself from chemical weapons as well ( and more virulent biological attacks ) .
2. Immune System Boosters :
There are a ton of items you can pick up at a health food store , pharmacy or grocery store .
A handful of the top items ( some of which show efficacy against the worst diseases ) are oil of oregano , olive leaf extract , other oil extracts , grapefruit seed extract , apple cider vinegar , wasabi , raw garlic / onions or garlic extract , ginger tea and kimchi ( useful against SARS ) .
Scientists at Seoul National University found that when they fed an extract of kimchi to 13 chickens infected with the bird flu , 11 of them recovered within a week .
These same scientists previously proved that the lactic acid bacteria found in kimchi also has an anti-bacterial effect .
Oil of oregano is probably the most researched and effective preventative and curative treatment .
The more virulent the disease , the more you must take .
Please note , children and babies are sensitive to some of these herbal treatments , and an alternate method is suggested for them .
To treat them , rub oil of oregano mixed with unrefined coconut oil or extra virgin olive oil directly into their feet .
3. Vitamin C : normal and mega - doses as necessary .
For information on Vitamin C megadosing , please consult the Vitamin C Foundation for medical studies , and instructions .
Vitamin A and Zinc at regular dose work in tandem with Vitamin C to assist the immune system .
4. Natural vitamins :
You ’ll want your multivitamins , as well as individual supplements , including minerals , antioxidants , bioflavanoids , vegetable / fruit extracts , super - foods and amino acids , especially N - Acetycysteine .
5. Electromedical devices :
Buy yourself a zapper , preferably The Ultimate Zapper , a top- rated device that is approved in Canada for medical use against virii , bacteria , parasites , prions , and fungi .
Use it every day for maintenance , and in longer doses when infected .
Also look into getting a < a title= ” Colloidal Silver Generator ( Korean brand ) ” href = ” http://gsbcskcompany.en.ec21.com/Colloidal_Silver_Solution_Maker–2931130_3509626.html
( make sure to not add salt as some do , it can cause unwanted side effects like bluish toning of the melanin ) , or even some higher - tech equipment like a RIFE device .
6. Herbal treatments : consult your Chinese or local herbalist for information on any concoctions that can be used to fight the flu or boost your immune system .
Also consult earthclinic.com and curezone.com for home remedies using spices and herbs .
7 . Stop eating questionable meat , especially chicken .
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure .
Below is a recipe for those who are experiencing bird flu - like symptoms .
It ’s been proven effective for many who ’ve tried it .
All Natural Spices and Ingredients :
4 heaping tablespoons tumeric
2 heaping tablespoons cayenne pepper
2 heaping tablespoons dried / powdered garlic
2 heaping tablespoons powdered ginger
2 heaping tablespoons powdered cloves
1 cup lemon juice ( or cider vinegar )
1 cup honey
1 cup dark rum
4 cinnamon sticks
2 heaping tablespoons black pepper
2 heaping tablespoon horseradish
1 heaping tablespoon each of marjoram , thyme and oregano .
Bring all ingredients to a boil , then simmer for 2 hours in a large saucepan .
Stir regularly ( Do n’t worry , all of the alcohol in rum will boil off ) .
FYI : Dark rum minus the alcohol has molasses and brown sugar .
Then sweeten mixture with as much honey a necessary to make draught tolerable .
Mixture will be full of lumps … keep them …just add them in …cool and store in well - sealed jars , like mayonnaise or peanut butter jars .
Keep at room temperature .
Adults : 2
Tbsp in a cup of tea every 4 - 6 hours , daily … until well .
12 –16 : 1 Tbsp in a cup of tea every 4 - 6 hours , daily … until well .
Under 12 : take 1 tsp mix in a cup of tea as hot as can stand every 6 - 8 hours until well .
Be prepared , and have some ingredients on hand .
Print this recipe so that you have it available ( especially in the event of a cyber - attack or prolonged power outage ) .

HIV / AIDS statistics for women and girls are startling .
Nationwide , the percentage of new AIDS cases diagnosed among women more than doubled between 1990 and 2005 ( the most recent year for which data is available ) , increasing from 11 percent to more than 26 percent .
Women of color continue to be disproportionately affected .
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , of the 126,964 women living in 2005 with HIV / AIDS , 64 percent were black , 15 percent were Hispanic , and one percent were Asian or Pacific Islander .
The CDC also notes that AIDS is the leading cause of death for black women ages 25 to 34 .
New Jersey has the highest proportion of women among those living with AIDS in the United States and ranks third among the states in cumulative pediatric AIDS cases , according to a report by the state Department of Health and Senior Services .
“ The statistics are ominous but we wo n’t give up the fight against HIV , ” said Andrea Norberg , M.S. , R.N. , interim executive director of the François - Xavier Bagnoud Center ( FXBC ) at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey ( UMDNJ ) .
An initiative of the UMDNJ - School of Nursing , the center provides HIV education , prevention , research and treatment services in the U.S. and internationally .
“ We ’ve seen great progress , especially in preventing mother - to - child transmission and improving quality of life for those infected by HIV , ” said Norberg .
“ However , as the numbers show , we still have a very long way to go in stopping women from getting HIV .
Women should take steps to protect themselves , know their status , and seek early treatment if they do become infected . ”
Peter Oates , R.N. , M.S.N. , manager of the center ’s health services , works closely with patients at the FXBC clinic at UMDNJ - The University Hospital .
In 2008 alone , the clinic served nearly 300 females infected or affected by HIV in the Newark area .
That figure includes 27 girls ages two to 12 years ; 74 adolescents and young women between the ages of 13 and 24 years ; more than 100 women between the ages of 25 and 44 years ; and 40 women between the ages of 40 and 64 years .
In addition , 45 HIV - exposed infant girls were born to infected mothers and followed by the FXBC last year .
Community outreach is a critical component in the battle against HIV / AIDS .
Will an online forum be an effective tool for HIV - infected women to promote healthy living ?
Pamela Rothpletz - Puglia , Ed.D. , R.D. , director of nutrition and wellness at the FXBC , and her research team have set out to answer this question through their study comparing the benefits of a custom - built social networking site versus a traditional in - person meeting group for Newark - area women .
Results of this study will be used to develop action plans for mobilizing communities to improve women ’s health .
Study funding is provided by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , Health Resources and Services Administration ( HRSA ) .
Carolyn K. Burr , Ed.D. , R.N. , senior education specialist at the FXBC , leads efforts to prevent mother - to - child transmission of HIV .
Burr is working with hospitals across the U.S. to help them incorporate rapid HIV testing as a routine part of care .
The CDC - funded effort , which first focused on patients in labor and delivery and then patients in emergency departments , now seeks to implement HIV testing for all hospital inpatients .

Stella awards – Most bizarre lawsuits in US
Most bizzare lawsuits were presented at the annual award Stella Awards .
Name “ Stella ” was inspired by 81 year old lady , from New Mexico , who spilled coffee on herself and sued McDonalds .
They had to pay her 2.86 million $ .
This year winner is Mr. Merv Grazinski of Oklahoma City .
In November 2000 Mr. Grazinski purchased a brand new 32 foot Winnebago motor home .
On his first trip home , having joined the freeway , he set the cruise control at 70 mph and calmly left the drivers seat to go into the back and make himself a cup of coffee .
Not surprisingly the Winnie left the freeway , crashed and overturned .
Mr. Grazinski sued Winnebago for not advising him in the handbook that he could n’t actually do this .
He was awarded $ 1,750,000 plus a new Winnie .
Some of other candidates :
Kara Walton of Claymont , Delaware successfully sued the owner of a night club in a neighboring city when she fell from the bathroom window to the floor and knocked out her two front teeth .
This occurred while Ms. Walton was trying to sneak through the window in the ladies room to avoid paying the $ 3.50 cover charge .
She was awarded $ 12,000.00 and dental expenses .
Jerry Williams of Little Rock Arkansas was awarded $ 14,500.00 and medical expenses after being bitten on the buttocks by his next door neighbor ’s beagle .
The beagle was on a chain in it ’s owner ’s fenced - in yard , as was Mr. Williams .
The award was less than sought after because the jury felt the dog may have been provoked by Mr. Williams who , at the time , was shooting it repeatedly with a pellet gun .
Kathleen Robertson of Austin Texas was awarded $ 780,000.00 by a jury of her peers after breaking her ankle tripping over a toddler who was running amuck inside a furniture store .
The owners of the store were understandably surprised at the verdict , considering the misbehaving tyke was Ms. Robertson ’s son .
A 19 year old Carl Truman of Los Angeles won $ 74,000.00 and medical expenses when his neighbor ran his hand over with a Honda Accord .
Mr. Truman apparently did n’t notice someone was at the wheel of the car whose hubcap he was trying to steal .
With a promised price tag of less than $ 50,000 ( after a $ 7,500 federal tax credit ) , the new Tesla Model S sedan is certainly a good deal cheaper than Tesla 's pricey roadster , not to mention its competitors , but according to Tesla CEO Elon Musk , it 's actually quite a bargain compared to your run -of - the - mill sedan as well .
As Musk tells it , " the ownership cost of Model S , if you were to lease and then account for the much lower cost of electricity versus gasoline at a likely future cost of $ 4 per gallon , is similar to a gasoline car with a sticker price of about $ 35,000 . "
Musk further adds that the Model S would still be a bargain " even if gasoline were $ 1 per gallon , " saying that it costs just $ 5 to drive 230 miles .
Of course , all of that assumes that you 'll actually be able to get your hands on the car one of these days , but Musk seems confident that 'll happen as well , saying that the company is " close " to receiving $ 350 million in loans from the U.S. Department of Energy , which would be used to build the plant in California that would manufacture the Model S.
Anti-Palin bloggers : Fox News threatening to ' ambush ' us Muriel Kane
Published : Friday March 27 , 2009
Print This Email This Alaskan blogger Linda Kellen Biegel , who blogs as Celtic Diva , charged on Friday that " Faux News is in Alaska and stalking complaint - filers ! "
Biegel is one of a number of progressive bloggers who have recently filed a series of ethics complaints against Governor Sarah Palin .
She says that she has been receiving " vitriolic " emails from Palin supporters ever since .
When a Fox News crew showed up in Alaska to do a story on the complaints , Biegel and several of the other bloggers were suspicious of their intentions and declined to be interviewed .
The result , says Biegel , was that " the news crew decided that since several of us refused to be on camera , they were going to ' ambush ' us . "
She adds , " Good luck finding me after my recent move !!!!! "
Biegel 's ethics complaint -- the eleventh to be filed against Palin since last year 's " Troopergate " scandal -- alleges that Palin was guilty of a conflict of interest when she publicly wore clothing promoting a snowmobile manufacturer , Arctic Cat , that sponsors her husband , Todd Palin .
As another Alaska blog , the Mudflats , explains , " It all began when Governor Sarah Palin lowered the start flag at this years Iron Dog Snowmachine race ...
Last years champions ?
None other than Alaskas ' first dude ' Todd Palin and his teammate Scott Davis as the famous Team # 22 .
... Palins sponsor ?
Arctic Cat . "
" If the governors family benefits directly from a private sponsor , " the Mudflats continues , " ( like getting a $ 5000 check from them ) and the governor shows up to take an official role at an official event , representing all Alaskans , its a big fat no - no to show up plastered like a billboard with the official ' gear ' and giant flaming logo of the company that s been paying you money . "
Fox News ran a reasonably balanced story on Wednesday describing Biegel 's complaint and Palin 's response .
Palin , who has already run up more than a half million dollars in legal bills , has slammed the complaint as " asinine political grandstanding " and insists that " I wore Arctic Cat snow gear at an outdoor event , because it was cold outside . "
However , Biegel 's suspicions of Fox News appear to be based primarily on Fox TV host Greta Van Susteren 's well - known sympathy for Palin .
In fact , one of the earlier ethics complaints alleged that Palin 's use of her governor 's office for an interview with Van Susteren last November amounted to using state resources to aid her political career .
Van Susteren has been extremely solicitous of Palin 's reputation , and in January , she blasted CNN for including Palin on a list of scandal - plagued politicians .
According to blogger Andrew Halcro , " Van Susteren landed Palin 's first interview after she returned home from her Vice Presidential run in November and this past week Van Susteren landed the first public media appearance by the governor 's daughter and grandson .
From snowmobiling and cooking moose hot dogs in Wasilla , to greeting racers at the end of the Iron Dog in Fairbanks , Van Susteren has had more one on one face time with Palin than most State commissioners . "
In addition , Van Susteren 's husband , John Coale -- who was previously a Clinton supporter -- has served as an unpaid adviser to Palin .
According to the Washington Post , " Others familiar with Palin 's political team insist that Coale has far more power than he is letting on -- essentially helping to run Sarah PAC .
Coale demurred on that front , noting only that he talks to Palin regularly . "
" Is it just a coincidence that one of Palin 's close advisors is Sarah ( or Todd ? ) fan , Greta Van Sustern 's hubby ? "
Biegel asks .
" Did a cry go out from the wilderness for aid and comfort ? "

The US government has said it will provide $ 17.4bn ( £ 11.6 bn ) in loans to help troubled carmakers General Motors and Chrysler survive .
President George W Bush said allowing the US car industry to fail would not be " a responsible course of action " .
Ford has said it hopes to get by without government help .
The government will use part of the $ 700 bn originally pledged to rescue US banks .
It has set a deadline of 31 March for the firms to become viable .
General Motors will get $ 9.4bn and Chrysler $ 4bn before the end of the year .
A further $ 4bn will be provided later .
GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner said his company would focus on " fully and rapidly implementing the restructuring plan that we reviewed with Congress earlier this month " .
Allowing the US auto industry to collapse is not a responsible course of action
US President George W Bush " It 's really the blueprint for a new General Motors , one for our second 100 years , " he said .
US President - elect Barack Obama urged the carmakers not to " squander this chance to reform bad management practices " in the industry .
" The auto companies must bring all their stakeholders together , including labour , dealers , creditors and suppliers , to make the hard choices necessary to achieve long - term viability . "
Extraordinary times
Mr Bush 's unveiling of the rescue package was a candid announcement from a grim - faced president , says the BBC's Justin Webb , in Washington .
Mr Bush has made it clear he believes the free market should normally be allowed to take its course , but he has listened as well to the voices telling him that this could be catastrophe , our correspondent says .

The car makers have argued that even an orderly bankruptcy would send them out of business forever , with the loss of millions of American jobs .
" Under ordinary economic circumstances , I would say this is the price that failed companies must pay , " Mr Bush said .
" But these are not ordinary circumstances .
In the midst of a financial crisis and a recession , allowing the US auto industry to collapse is not a responsible course of action . "
Carmakers would have to make hard decisions to reform the industry , he said , with restructuring requiring " meaningful concessions from all involved in the auto industry " .
The package announced by Mr Bush does not need Congressional approval , as it is part of the existing $ 700 bn financial bail - out programme .
An attempt to secure a $ 14bn ( £ 9.4 bn ) rescue fund for the carmakers was rejected by the US Senate last week .
' Critical situation '
Car dealers , some of whom have been waiting for payments from the manufacturers , welcomed the bail - out .
" The question now is how to excite consumers to buy cars from January to March .
We 're all sitting on millions of dollars of unmoving cars , " said Raymond Ciccolo , a GM dealer in Boston .
These loans were desperately needed before the end of December , because the situation for the automakers is so critical

Three carmakers , Chrysler , Ford and GM , have repeatedly warned that millions of jobs could be lost if the government does not agree to a package of loans to support the industry .
" These loans were desperately needed before the end of December , because the situation for the automakers is so critical , " said Dennis Virag at Automotive Consulting Group .
Meanwhile , US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson urged Congress to authorise the use of the second half of the $ 700 bn Wall Street bail - out , as the first $ 350 bn had already been committed .

( CNN ) --
The company that brought the world Beanie Babies is now selling dolls named Sweet Sasha and Marvelous Malia , but a spokeswoman insists that the dolls have nothing to do with President Obama 's young daughters .
Ty , the maker of Beanie Babies , is introducing two new Ty Girlz dolls named Marvelous Malia and Sweet Sasha .
Although it would be a stretch to say the 12 - inch - tall dolls bear a resemblance to the first family 's Sasha , 7 , and Malia , 10 , they appear to be the only African - American dolls in the 30 - doll Ty Girlz collection .
" We feel it is inappropriate to use young private citizens for marketing purposes , " said first lady Michelle Obama 's press secretary , Katie McCormick Lelyveld .
When CNN asked a Ty executive whether the Obama girls were the inspiration for the dolls , she hesitated several seconds before answering .
" Information concerning the development of our products and how we come up with names , how we select them , how we trademark -- that 's considered as proprietary , " Ty Senior Vice President of Sales Tania Lundeen said .
" I ca n't go any further with that question . "
Lundeen said " Sasha and Malia are beautiful names " that " worked very well with the dolls we were making . "
" There 's really nothing on either doll that refers to anything else that you may have read in the media today , " she said .
The dolls follow " the exact patterns " used for the other Ty Girlz dolls , " so we did not make the dolls to physically resemble either of the Obama girls , " Lundeen said .
Sweet Sasha features long dark - brown hair in two ponytails , and Marvelous Malia has just one ponytail .
" Malia and Sasha are two adorable dolls , or Sweet Sasha and Marvelous Malia , forgive me , " Lundeen said when describing them .
She said her company avoids naming dolls for " any particular living individual " because it might interfere with how kids use their imaginations to play with them .
" When children play , they play with the dolls how they wish , and we do n't want to impose any preconceived ideas upon them by implying any further connection , " she said .
Coincidence or not , the controversy has brought welcome traffic to Ty's Web site for children , Lundeen said .
" Since this release of news , we 've had a lot of attention , " she said .
The dolls sell for $ 9.99 each .

I 've been a member of Labour Friends of Israel for a long time , for a reason unconnected with any religious , ethnic or constituency factors .
My mother worked for UNRRA , the wartime organisation which helped the victims of Nazism find homes .
Appalled by the horrors , she was convinced that Jews needed a safe haven , and when I went into politics I promised to do my best to see that Britain did n't do anything that harmed Israelis .
I 'm now a member of the LFI executive .
Nonetheless , sometimes friends need to tell you when you 've gone too far .
This is one of those times .
Israeli policy towards Gaza is wrong in principle , erratic in practice and now damaging to longer - term peace prospects .
We should accept that the position is hellishly difficult .
Gaza is ruled by Hamas , an organisation that is in rebellion against the elected , internationally - recognised Palestinian leadership , denies Israel 's right to exist and sponsors armed attacks on civilians .
Moreover , the current fighting follows an explicit termination of the ceasefire by Hamas .
If you end a ceasefire , should n't you expect to be attacked ?
Up to a point , yes .
If Israel launched air strikes against groups preparing to fire missiles , it would be entirely covered by international law on self - defence .
If , during the Troubles , Ireland had tolerated missiles being launched from its territory against Belfast , we would have certainly felt entitled to hit back .
The problem is that Israel 's response consistently reaches beyond Hamas 's leadership and terrorist groups and affects the entire civilian population .
The current offensive is targeting Hamas , but entirely inevitably it is killing significant numbers of civilians as well – clearly more than the 14 killed by all the missiles fired at Israel over the last two years – and must be terrorising everyone living in the area .
It is a wholly disproportionate response , as if we 'd launched air raids on Dublin in response to outrages by IRA groups .
Nor is this the first example of the civilian population being made hostage to the sins of the leadership .
The stranglehold imposed by the blockade of the territory turns the whole area into a quasi- prison camp , dependent for quite basic provisions on the goodwill of the Israeli government from week to week .
But perhaps this is realpolitik and it will make the region safer ?
Is there any sign of that ?
At some point the military operation will end .
Failing a complete reoccupation of Gaza , Israel will still be sitting next to a neighbour with more reason than ever to be hostile , and it will join the Lebanon and earlier operations in the list of tactical successes that led exactly nowhere .
It is hard to avoid the impression that the operation is designed to strengthen the governing parties before the imminent Israeli election , and to weaken Hamas before Obama takes over .
But what kind of impression is President Obama going to have as he weighs up American policy options ?
We owe it to our Israeli friends to be frank .
They are going too far , and forfeiting support from quarters that they need , including Britain's .
It is time to stop and think .

Microsoft , for its part , said that Apple gave the attack ads a short rest late last year after Microsoft unveiled its counterattack .
Microsoft ’s campaign , devised by the agency Crispin , Porter & Bogusky , initially featured the comedian Jerry Seinfeld and Microsoft ’s co-founder , Bill Gates , and then a diverse collection of normal people proudly proclaiming , “ I am a PC . ”

“ I think we confused them a little bit by embracing the stigma they put on our brand and then taking it in a different direction , ” said David Webster , a general manager at Microsoft .
An Apple spokesman declined to comment about either company ’s advertising .

So far , Apple seems to be winning the fight .
The Macintosh gained more than 2 percentage points of market share in the last year and now controls nearly 10 percent of the overall market for personal computers , according to the research firm Net Applications .
Apple ’s ads have also fared better than Microsoft ’s in the war for consumers ’ hearts .
In the last two months , Brand Keys , a market research company based in New York , queried 400 Apple and Microsoft users and measured their perceptions of Apple ’s and Microsoft ’s brand equity before and after seeing examples of the companies ’ advertising .
Among the ads the firm showed were “ Bean Counter , ” an Apple spot that poked fun at Microsoft ’s spending money on advertising instead of fixing product flaws .
Brand Keys also surveyed responses to Microsoft ’s first Seinfeld commercial , “ Shoe Circus , ” and the first “ I am a PC ” spot .
“ Off the Air , ” an ad that promised Apple stores would help customers switch from Windows to Apple ’s Mac platform , was highly successful in lifting the brand equity that Apple users felt around the concept of “ innovation , design and added value ”  a factor that drives loyalty .
The spot also improved PC users ’ perception of Macs for their “ trouble - free performance , service and support . ”
On the other hand , Microsoft ’s “ Shoe Circus , ” in which Mr. Seinfeld helped Mr. Gates buy shoes , failed miserably with consumers .
After seeing the ad , both Apple and Microsoft users had a more negative perception of Microsoft in the areas of innovation , technology , trouble - free design , and warranty and pricing .
“ When you see an ad perform this poorly , ” said Amy Shea , the executive vice president at Brand Keys who conducted the research , “ you ’ve got a real problem . ”

It 's high noon in July .
At 90 - plus degrees outside , the masses are jonesing for AC .
But it 's seriously expensive to keep the juice flowing when demand crests .
Firing up turbines that sit idle 360 days a year can multiply electricity costs by a factor of 10 .
How to keep cool without stressing the grid ?
Solution Pay big users to cut consumption when the need arises .
Many utilities already do an ad - hoc version of this , an emergency practice known as demand response that has lately been promoted by Jon Wellinghoff , acting chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission .
Now there 's an alternative : Call EnerNOC , a Boston - based company that gangs commercial users who are willing , for a quarterly payment , to trim back operations on 30 minutes ' notice .
EnerNOC micromanages consumption at 3,400 - plus locations from Maine to California .
Between dimming lights , adjusting thermostats , and suspending industrial activities , the potential cuts top the output of a large nuclear reactor .
And the savings can be huge .
EnerNOC 's cofounder , Tim Healy , points out that 10 percent of all US generating capacity exists to meet the last 1 percent of demand .
Utilities paid EnerNOC $ 100 million last year simply to stand at the ready — insurance , in effect , against the inevitable days when every AC unit is humming .

It is a computer exercise only : On Wednesday , the US government will take the worst - case scenario for the economy and try to figure out what that might mean for each of the nation ’s major banks .
Would banks from JPMorgan Chase in New York to Bank of America in Charlotte , N.C. , have enough capital to survive ?
Or should the government be planning to inject more public money into the banking institutions considered critical to the nation ?
Despite the Obama administration ’s interest in greater transparency in government , economists doubt that the results of what is being termed “ stress testing ” of each of the major banks will be made public .
After all , there ’s no sense causing more angst to a financial system that is already under a high degree of stress by revealing which banks might not survive without more public aid .
But , the results might help Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and other federal regulators have some kind of plan in place if the recently enacted fiscal stimulus package falls short , the recession drags on for another year , and the unemployment rate spirals to double - digit levels .
“ Basically , what they are doing is planning for the worst and hoping for the best , ” says Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland , Pa .
“ That does not mean the worst will actually occur . ”
Bank stress already
The government exercise comes at a time when the stocks of many bank companies are under severe pressure on Wall Street .
According to press reports , Citigroup , one of the nation ’s largest banks , has asked the government to take a larger equity stake in the company – perhaps as much as 45 percent of the bank .
So far , the US government has invested $ 45 billion in Citi , which is based in New York .
The Citigroup move follows a terrible week when the price of its stock dipped as low as $ 1.61 a share , indicating the entire company was worth $ 9.7 billion .
By mid-afternoon Monday , the price had bounced back some , to above $ 2.20 a share .
“ This is not a reflection of what the bank is worth , ” says Sung Won Sohn , a professor of finance at California State University , Channel Islands and the former president of a bank .
“ If I had $ 10 billion , I ’d like to buy Citigroup . ”
Not spreading fear
In announcing the banking stress test , the nation ’s financial regulators were quick to try to keep the public from jumping to conclusions about the current state of the banking industry .
“ Currently , the major U.S. banking institutions have capital in excess of the amounts required to be considered well capitalized , ” the regulators said in a joint statement Monday .
The bank regulators include the US Department of the Treasury , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , the Office of Thrift Supervision , and the Federal Reserve Board .
However , the regulators added , any new capital provided by government will be to provide a cushion “ against larger than expected future losses , should they occur due to a more severe economic environment , and to support lending to creditworthy borrowers . ”
A worst case
What would the worst economic scenario look like ?
It is “ conceivable ” the economy could degenerate “ into a cycle worse than what we have seen since ... World War II , ” says economist Brian Bethune of IHS Global Insight in Lexington , Mass .
“ But it is not a Great Depression . ”
Under the Global Insight worst - case scenario for the economy , the current recession continues into 2010 without much boost from the $ 789 billion fiscal stimulus package signed into law last week by President Obama .
In the computer model , the stimulative monetary policy and the attempts to rescue the banks do n’t work .
“ We would have a one year delay in the recovery , ” says Mr. Bethune .
By this model , while the economy sputtered , the unemployment rate would spike to 10.5 percent , up from 7.6 percent in February .
The federal budget deficit would be over $ 1 trillion for a second year in a row .
And auto sales for Detroit would be at today ’s depressed levels .
“ When you put all this together , my sense is that only half the banks could survive that , ” says Bethune .
“ But it ’s a redundant exercise because the system is already under maximum stress . ”
Losses at $ 1 trillion
Even without the economy getting worse , the banks may have as much as $ 1 trillion in losses , he estimates .
They have raised additional capital to cover about half of those losses .
“ There is still a gap of $ 500 billion , so if you stress test it beyond [ that ] , the whole banking system is insolvent . ”
Bethune argues that the regulators should be doing a “ due diligence ” review for banks with assets over $ 100 billion .
He would like regulators to assess the capability of each financial institution in terms of how dominant it is in its main markets , the strength of its brand , and the ability of the bank to manage risk .
“ Then , they put 10 people in a room and ask is this entity worth saving from the point of view of putting in public capital ? ” says Bethune .
If nationalization happens
James Barth , a fellow at the Milken Institute in Santa Monica , Calif. , worries about what might happen if the government decides it has to take over many of the banks .
“ Will the management of the bank be replaced with some delegate or government official ? ” asks Mr. Barth , a former banking official in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations .
He also wonders if a better test for the regulators to use is whether the bank management is capable of running the bank despite the losses embedded in its books .
However , Mr. Naroff says the regulators are doing the prudent thing .
If the unemployment rate jumps to between 10 to 12 percent , he says , regulators need to know what will happen to the banks .
“ Will some of the large banks not make it ? ” he asks .
“ It ’s hard to believe that would not be the case . ”

A third studio has emerged from the ashes of Ensemble Studios -- the newly - founded Windstorm Studios is already at work on its first online game .
Windstorm has been founded by ex-Ensemble staffer Dusty Monk and will be " utilizing licensed and proven technologies , and contracting with industry veterans " .
The company 's website indicates that the studio is already working on building technology , art and environments for its first project - although no further details are offered .
It is unclear whether the studio already has a publishing deal , but it is looking for funding partners , not yet hiring new staff .
"
In 2008 , when Microsoft closed my then employer Ensemble Studios , I saw an opportunity for something new - not just for myself , but for the genre which I love so much " , commented Monk in apparent reference to the real - time strategy genre .
" Windstorm Studios is the realization of that opportunity .
I bring with me close to fifteen years of professional game development experience , and have contributed to some of the best triple - A titles in the business , " he added .
The announcement fulfills Ensemble Studios co-founder Bruce Shelley 's prediction of " at least two new studios " being formed by ex-Ensemble employees .
These include co-founder Tony Goodman 's Robot Entertainment and Bonfire Studios - founded by David Rippy and " former management team members " from Ensemble .
The three independent studios come in addition to a new internal Microsoft studio led by the " Ensemble leadership team " .
Microsoft announced the closure of Ensemble Studios last September , before the release of the developer 's final game .
The move was described as a " fiscally - rooted decision " .

EVEN before the economy tanked , discount stores , or dollar stores as Americans call them , were looking healthy .
Now their profits are rising like helium - filled balloons .
Dollar Tree , a Virginia - based chain of dollar stores , had sales of more than $ 1.39 billion in the fourth quarter of last year , a 6.8 % increase over the year before .
For the whole of 2008 , Dollar Tree , which has been in business since 1953 , notched up record sales of $ 4.64 billion .
Family Dollar is prospering , too .
The market value of this company , based in North Carolina and with more than 6,600 stores in 44 states , rose 36 % last year .
Other dollar - store companies have also reported big profits .
Dollar stores sell everything from sweets and toys to linens and household cleaning products .
Contrary to popular belief , not every item in the stores costs a dollar .
But all the items , most of which are generic , are still cheaper than they would be in grocery or drug stores .
Companies achieve this by buying in bulk , by keeping costs low and by avoiding expensive national advertising , especially on radio and television , and instead send out circulars every month to local customers .
But dollar stores are changing , in line with shifts in the economy as a whole .
For decades they were to be found only in rural areas , but now — with recession gripping all parts of the country — they are just as common in Chicago or Los Angeles .
Once , too , they were a particular feature of southern states .
But now 99 ¢
Only Stores , a company that is based in aptly named Commerce , California , has stores in Arizona , California , Nevada and Texas .
In fiscal 2008 , total sales were more than $ 1.2 billion .
Clearly , as the recession persists , dollar stores will continue to thrive .
“ Thrift is in .
Saving money is in , ” boasts Josh Braverman , a spokesman for Family Dollar .
“ And it still will be even after the economy recovers . ”

If the Las Vegas housing market did n’t have enough bad news , the picture has gotten even gloomier when it comes to falling prices and the frightening prospect of people walking away from their homes .
More than 234,000 or 58.2 percent of Las Vegas homes with a mortgage are underwater , according to a report by First American CoreLogic .
An additional 14,088 mortgages , or 3.5 percent , are near that point , bringing the total to 61.7 percent of all outstanding mortgages .
Nevada was ranked No. 1 in the nation with 55 percent of homes underwater or upside down , meaning borrowers owe more on their mortgage than the home is worth .
That contrasts with 20 percent nationwide .
After Nevada , Michigan was ranked second in the nation with a negative equity share of 40 percent .
Following these two states are Arizona at 32 percent , and Florida and California at 30 percent .
“ It is amazing , stunning and a catastrophe , ” says Richard Plaster , founder of Signature Homes who has been warning about the foreclosure problem in Las Vegas growing worse .
“ At every breakfast or dinner table , there is a discussion going on about ‘ what are we going to do . ’
It is going to be hard - pressed on why people should stay in their house .
People have no choice if they are rational . ”
Plaster says the government ’s plan to help reduce foreclosures does n’t go far enough because it wo n’t aid those who are so far underwater and will walk away even though they can afford their mortgage payment .
“ It is simply not going to help those way underwater , which is what most of Las Vegas is , ” Plaster says .
People who can afford to pay but start going the foreclosure route further depress prices , which are down nearly 50 percent from the market ’s high , Plaster says .
“ Banks are getting more and more back and what they are doing in effect is auctioning them off , ” Plaster says .
The housing market has been helped by investors purchasing homes , but there are only so many of them out there and the supply will far outpace demand , Plaster says .
And given the slowdown in the economy and many buyers who are frightened about their job prospects , that does n’t bode well for prices stabilizing , he says .
The average loan - to - value ratio for properties with a mortgage in Nevada was 97 percent , or less than $ 8,000 in equity , leaving the typical mortgaged homeowner with virtually no cushion for the rapidly declining home values , the firm reports .
Steve Bottfeld , executive vice president of Marketing Solutions , a Las Vegas housing consultant , says anyone who bought a home from 2004 to 2007 is underwater and many are n’t going to get government assistance .
Bottfeld says Las Vegas will be one of the first markets out of the housing slump , but until prices hit bottom , there is not going to be a recovery .
He says he remains concerned about a backlog of foreclosure inventory at prices so low that it forces other prices downward .
Bottfeld takes the opposite approach to Plaster that people should n’t walk away from their homes if they are underwater .
People should be educated that homeownership is important to wealth and that the housing market goes in cycles , Bottfeld says .
“ It is important that people stay in their homes and not walk away , ” Bottfeld says .
“ They would be walking away from their investment .
If they hang onto it , it will come back . ”
Dennis Smith , president of Home Builders Research , says it ’s the homeowners who used their homes as a bank account and took out equity are the most likely to walk away .
“ It should n’t be a revelation that there are going to be more foreclosures , ” Smith says .
“ The government is trying to put a Band - Aid on the situation , but I do n’t see how foreclosures are going to go away in the near term . ”
Smith says he does n’t expect people to walk away en masse today for being underwater , but instead suggests it may happen over several months or years .
Many people may not know now that they are underwater , but once they come to that realization , they will take time to make that decision to leave , he says .
Hanley Wood report
New - home sales may be down these days , but D.R. Horton is leading the way among homebuilders , according to Hanley Wood .
The 306 sales of single - family homes in January was 68 percent more than December , but 56 percent down from January 2008 .
Sales of D.R Horton ’s communities contributed nearly 50 percent of the 310 sales , says Shane Whitmore , regional manager with Hanley Wood Market Intelligence .
Of the top 10 selling communities , D.R. Horton held nine of the 10 spots .
Sales of single - family homes accounted for a majority of new - homes sales at 69 percent , Whitmore says .
About 25 percent were town homes and duplexes and 5 percent were condos .
The median minimum sales price for single - family homes sold in January was $ 219,990 , a drop of 12 percent from December and 19 percent from January 2008 , Whitmore says .
In January 33 percent of the new homes sold were priced under $ 150,000 and 42 percent were priced under $ 200,000 .
The median square footage across all product types in January was 1,750 square feet with a median price per square foot of $ 108 , Whitmore says .
The cancellation rate — the number of sales contracts previously written by builders that were canceled — fell to 29.7 percent in January for single - family homes .
It was 39 percent in December .

Linda Coulimore — a former Longmont police officer who was injured twice in the line of duty before becoming dependent on painkillers — was arrested Friday night on suspicion of stealing a pain - medication pump from the hospital room of an Iraq war veteran .
The story of Coulimore as told by her son and former husband is of a woman who for decades has wrestled with pain and painkillers .
Coulimore , 59 , also had been an emergency medical technician and recently took nursing classes at Regis University .
That is consistent with the police theory that the person who deftly detached the pump had medical training .
Weld County deputies arrested Coulimore at 10:40 p.m. Friday in her Mead home after she saw her picture in a newspaper and called police to give herself up , said Sonny Jackson , Denver police spokesman .
Coulimore was released from the Weld County Jail after her $ 25,000 bond was posted , said Weld County Undersheriff Margie Martinez .
The U.S. Marine at Presbyterian / St. Luke ’s Medical Center was unconscious when the woman detached the device filled with powerful narcotics Tuesday evening , Jackson said .
The Marine , a police source said , had lost a limb in a war - related accident in Iraq .
In a statement released through the hospital , the serviceman , who wishes to remain anonymous , thanked the police for their quick work .
Surveillance photos of a woman in a hallway of Presbyterian / St. Luke ’s were distributed through the media to assist the investigation .
Family members said Coulimore had been regularly using strong painkillers since 1966 , when she was thrown out of a car during an accident in Longmont .
Her knee was blown out during the crash , and doctors used a metal implant to repair the injury , said Scotty Coulimore , Coulimore ’s ex-husband and a retired Colorado State Patrol trooper .
She became an emergency medical technician for Flight for Life and once saved the life of a 3 - year - old drowning victim , said her son , Lance Coulimore .
In the early 1980s , Coulimore joined the Longmont Police Department .
Longmont Cmdr. Timothy Lewis confirmed Coulimore had been on the force .
History of injuries
Coulimore suffered additional injuries on a police call when a leopard , held in a home basement , attacked her .
She received a rabies shot and took more pain medications , Scotty Coulimore said .
She also received care from a police psychologist following the attack , he said .
In early ’90s , three people were killed in a double murder - suicide in Longmont .
As Coulimore was helping to put one of the victims in an ambulance , she slipped on ice and hurt her lower back .
Not wanting male police officers to think she was weak , she kept working the scene despite excruciating pain , Scotty Coulimore said .
But she was seriously injured .
Doctors performed hip replacement surgery and fused four vertebrae in Coulimore ’s lower back , her former husband said .
Coulimore returned to limited duty after the injury and , Scotty Coulimore said , he remembers her taking powerful prescription pain pills on a daily basis .
Doctors eventually inserted a permanent pump into her abdomen and regularly injected painkillers into her spine , he said .
Hobbled by the injuries and suffering from constant pain , she was let go by the Longmont department about 1998 , family members say .
Coulimore received a $ 220,000 workers ’ compensation settlement from the city , her former husband said .
Son : Photos are n’t mom
Lance Coulimore said his mother was a police officer for 16 years and had hoped to remain on the force in some capacity at least another four years so she could retire and get full medical and retirement benefits .
Coulimore got Social Security benefits and received slightly less than $ 600 a month for medical treatment and medications , Lance Coulimore said .
Her son said she currently has five drug prescriptions .
After leaving the police force , she applied 26 times for other police , probation , dispatcher and Longmont city jobs but was never hired , Lance Coulimore said .
The past four years she has graded standardized college entrance examinations part time and was set to start grading more tests Monday , he said .
Shortly after Coulimore left the Longmont police force , Lance Coulimore said he was driving with her when their car was rear - ended and his mother suffered more painful injuries .
Lance Coulimore said he has seen the surveillance pictures of the woman at the hospital , and he thinks it is n’t his mother .
“ She walks with a hunched back and sort of waddles because both of her hips were replaced , ” he said .
“ She never wears her hair in a bundle . ”

I was circumcised at birth .
Now , as an educated , sexually active , 27 - year - old adult , I wish it had not happened .
I wo n't say anything about the pain and suffering of the physical event , because it 's true that I do n't remember it ( though anyone who has witnessed one can tell you the baby is in horrific pain throughout the process ) .
What I am going to talk about is how I feel now .
I feel a sense of loss for the fact that a physical part of me is permanently missing without my ever having known it .
More painful than that is a sense of violation .
Something was unnecessarily done to me as a baby that I would not have chosen to have had done if I had been given the choice as an informed , consenting adult .
( And yes , I do know it to have been unnecessary because I have been able to discuss the issue with my father .
He confirms that he and my mother were undecided about it and asked the doctor for advice .
The doctor said that everything appeared healthy , but that he recommended it anyway for the cosmetic and societal reasons .
It was this preferential , non-medical recommendation that led to my mutilation at birth , and many other baby boys in the 1980's and other decades . )
The only thing I can do about it is to undergo foreskin restoration , either a surgical or mechanical process .
I am choosing to do that , but I also know from my research on the subject that it is not a reversal of my circumcision , but only a physical simulation which may or may not be successful in fully amending the altered appearance and function of my penis .
I have heard it said that many women prefer circumcised men .
I have been with many women and found through my own sexual experience that I prefer women with natural pubic hairstyles and small nipples on medium - large breasts of a certain shape .
I have respect for my sexual partners and feel that I can either accept a woman 's body or find someone else who better fits my preferences .
I would never ask a woman to change the way she grooms her pubic hair or expect her to surgically amend her breast shape or nipple - to - breast ratio .
And I hope a woman would have more respect for herself than to change her body to please a man who felt his preferences outweighed her body 's natural form .
I was appalled to see a woman 's contribution on Circlist where she proudly recounted consistently nagging her boyfriend to be circumcised , and his subsequent compliance despite initial strong refusal to do so .
I wish I had been his friend so I could influence him to see that he deserved better than a woman who would criticize his body , and I wonder whether she would have been willing to change herself if he had imposed a preference on her that did n't match who she was physically .
So I do n't think the old " women prefer circumcised men " argument holds up .
Every individual in the world is different and has different preferences about the appearance of sexual partners .
Imagine how we would look if , when we were infants , our parents had surgically altered everything about us that they suspected our future sexual partners might not " prefer . "
Another concern I 've heard is that circumcised fathers want their sons to look like them .
My father is uncircumcised , and when I occasionally saw him undressed as a child , I did n't think anything of the fact that his penis looked different from mine .
And I imagine that if I had thought anything of it , the presence of a foreskin would n't have even made the Top 10 list of differences between a 34 - year - old 's penis and a pre-schooler's .
Now that we are both fully - grown men , we have not seen much , if any , of one another 's penises in many , many years .
As someone whose penis did not ( and still probably does n't ) look much like his dad's , I have the experience to say with full knowledge and authority that that particular question is a complete non-issue .
Then there 's the hygiene argument .
I just ran my theory by my uncircumcised roommate , and he confirmed that an uncircumcised penis does not develop odors , accumlated smegma , or an inability to be retracted healthily if its owner invests a few seconds a day in quickly cleaning it in the shower .
Unless
I 'm the only circumcised guy in the world who washes his penis in the shower , that does n't sound like an added burden in any way .
This is the perspective of one circumcised man who wishes he were not .
I know that a lot of guys who have been circumcised do n't mind that they are ( some report a sense that they " got it over with " without having to remember it , but of course circumcision is n't an inevitable event that you must submit to sooner or later , so I do n't know where that frame of mind comes from ) .
Anyway , I 'm glad that many them do n't mind , because I know from my own experience that it's a very painful thing if you do mind .
I 'm glad they do n't have to face those feelings .
But the fact that many men are fortunate in that respect does n't mean that it should continue - what if the next baby boy who undergoes routine infant circumcision grows up to feel the way I do instead ?
I would rather not take the risk of letting that happen .
If a man reaches adulthood with his foreskin intact and decides he does n't want it , let him choose to have it removed .
Options are far more limited for men who reach adulthood without it and wish it had n't been taken away .
( Question : are there any health insurance plans that treat infant circumcision , or even adult voluntary circumcision , and adult foreskin restoration the same way ? )
If I 'm fortunate enough to become a father , no son of mine will be circumcised .
That 's for him to decide , and I will not rob him forever of the opportunity to make that choice for himself as an informed adult capable of making it .

Harper has made Canada the laughing stock of the world [ video ]
In behaving more like a would be third - world dictator rather than like the leader of an industrialized nation , Stephen Harper has made Canada ( rightly ) the laughing stock of the world .
American TV political commentator Rachel Maddow shares her thoughts on Harper ’s political machinations this week .
Watch as she almost steals the words right from my mouth .
I wonder if Rachel Maddow is secretly a fan of Paulitics ?
An Ontario court has ordered the owners of the FreeDominion .ca to disclose all personal information on eight anonymous posters to the chat site .
The required information includes email and IP addresses .
The case arises from a lawsuit launched by Richard Warman , the anti-hate fighter , against the site and the posters .
The court focused heavily on the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure , which contain a strong duty of disclosure on litigants .
The discussion includes a review of many key Internet privacy cases , including the CRIA file sharing litigation ( which the court distinguishes on the basis of different court rules ) and the Irwin Toy case ( which emphasized the importance of protecting anonymity , but which the court tries to distinguish on the basis of the newness of the issue at the time ) .
The court also looks at the string of recent cases involving child pornography cases and ISP disclosure of customer information , concluding that " the court 's most recent pronouncement on this is that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy . "
According to the defendants in the case , they are unsure if they have the resources to appeal .
This particular decision feels like a judge anxious to order to disclosure , despite the weight of authority that provides some measure of privacy protection for anonymous posters .
Indeed , the public policy issue is characterized as " we are dealing with an anti-hate speech advocate and Defendants whose website is so controversial that it is blocked to employees of the Ontario Public Service . "
Leaving aside the fact that sites blocked to employees of the Ontario Public Service is not much of a threshold ( Facebook is blocked to the OPS ) , the public policy issue is not the merits of the particular website .
Rather , it is the privacy and free speech rights of the posters to that site .
Protection for anonymous postings is certainly not an absolute , but a high threshold that requires prima facie evidence supporting the plaintiff 's claim is critical to ensuring that a proper balance is struck between the rights of a plaintiff ( whether in a defamation or copyright case ) and the privacy and free speech rights of the poster .
I cannot comment on the postings themselves ( and I recognize that Warman has been a frequent target online ) but I fear that the high threshold seems to have been abandoned here , with the court all - too - eager to dismiss the privacy considerations associated with mandated disclosure by not engaging in an analysis as to whether the evidentiary standard was met .
“ We ’re the last comedy team .
Comedy teams are n’t a part of comedy anymore . ”
Tommy Smothers prefaces our phone interview with this very accurate declamation on the state of standup performance today that sounds anything but humorous .
Where have all the great musical comedy duos gone ?
Aside from the likes of a newly reunited Cheech and Chong , or the more recent mock - rock stylings of the Jack Black - fronted Tenacious D , the witty repartee synonymous with the traditional straight man / funny man stage act is conspicuously absent from modern day comedy , with one exception : The Smothers Brothers .
When Tommy and Dick Smothers got the chance at hosting their first variety show in 1967 , they ’d cut their network TV teeth on a short - lived situational comedy .
Musically gifted , they ’d also been one of the lynchpins of the early 1960s folk scene .
All these elements deftly blended by the duo produced a unique concoction of comedy , music and political commentary .
The latter , of course , was what got the brothers in hot water with parent network CBS , and wry commentary on the worsening Vietnam conflict , President Nixon and the generation gap made the Smothers popular with counterculture audiences but reviled by the censors , resulting in their firing from the network in 1969 ( Tom stresses they were fired , not cancelled ) .
Pop performers of the time , relegated to lyrical and professional compromise — or utter rejection altogether — on shows like Ed Sullivan , were welcomed with open arms by Tom and Dick in all their unabashed controversy .
Everyone remembers Harry Belafonte singing against a backlit projection of footage from the 1968 Democratic Convention .
The Smothers allowed Jim Morrison and company to take the reins following the Doors ’ “ Light My Fire ” debacle on Sullivan ’s program .
Then there was Pete Seeger ’s performance of “ Waist Deep in the Muddy ” which caused him to return a second time to the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour when the network killed his first attempt at the anti-war paean .
The brothers remained true to their artistic standards .
That these guys were actually real - life brothers made their rival sibling banter ( especially Tommy ’s “ Mom liked you best ! ” routine ) all the more endearing , the sort of genuine familial affection one can imagine continuing off stage between the two .
What ’s more is that Tom and Dick have n’t missed a beat , and if anything , today ’s social and political climes have made for better fodder on their current anniversary tour , dovetailing with the release of a retrospective Smothers DVD .
Tom Smothers took the time to talk to us in advance of the brothers ’ performance in Agoura Hills this week .
VCR : Anything special for 50 years on the new tour ?
Tom Smothers :
Well , we say we ’ve been in the business 100 years now , 50 years a piece .
We do n’t make a big deal about it , but it ’s a pretty good accomplishment .
And the show , it ’s a family show .
It ’s pretty good .
We do “ The Impossible Dream , ” we do a vaudeville piece .
It ’s very eclectic , and people leave very happy .
Sometimes people stand up and give us applause when we walk on stage .
Now you know that we ’re close to death .
( Laughs ) .
You know , back in the days of vaudeville , the straight man used to get paid more than the comic .
The straight man could emcee the whole show and they could bring people up from the audience if he had to .
So if they put a comic with them , he was the one who kind of controlled it .
That ’s why the straight man was so good back then .
VCR : Do you and Dick ever say , who ’s the straight man and who ’s not ?
No , there ’s no question ( Laughs ) .
Although Dickie , in concert , the audience roars , and he says , “ I ’m not supposed to get a laugh there . ”
VCR : When you were first coming up in the ’60s , you had a blend of folk song , comedy , social commentary .
Did you go to work on evolving that deliberately , or did it just come about ?
It just came about .
We started as singers and the comedy evolved into it .
Then we had the sitcom that was bland ( The Smothers Brothers Show , 1965 - 66 ) , we did 32 of those , and then they gave us this variety show , and I remember I said , we ’re going to have creative control .
But I did n’t know what I wanted to be creative about , but when the Vietnam War heated up , and all the riots and stuff were happening , we started taking a position .
We ’re the only show at that time that was anti-war and aggressively pro-integration and all that kind of stuff .
VCR : When the show first aired , did you know it would be as controversial as it was ?
No .
The first season , we had a few problems , but in the second season … whenever they tell you , “ You ca n’t say that , ” you say why ?
“ Because you just ca n’t say that . ”
Well , do n’t ever tell a comic you ca n’t say anything .
I did n’t know
I was saying anything important until they said , “ You ca n’t say that . ”
So I said , this must be important to be said .
It was not premeditated at all , just a lot of us get caught up in the things that are happening around us and start reacting to them .
There ’s no premeditation or ideology around it at all .
VCR : And you and your brother never backed down from taking risks when other performers might have .
We were young , and just been 10 years in the business .
It was in ’69 when we were fired .
I kind of had a premonition things are getting tight here .
And then Nixon got elected and then we were fired .
For false reasons , but one that put us out of business for about 10 years , as far as the Smothers Brothers .
So it was a hard one .
I tell you , 40 years later it might have been a gift .
I was n’t getting serious about things until the last season ; my humor was n’t full blown ( Laughs ) .
So about three years later , I started getting everything in perspective , starting doing plays and stuff like that .
So when we got back together and started working again , it was so much better .
People had n’t seen us ; we had n’t worn out our welcome .
It was kind of a nice thing .
And I get a lot of residual respect about it : “ Hey man , thanks for standing up , that was really cool . ”
But it took 10 years before that started coming back .
They thought , Tommy ’s too stubborn , he ’s this , he ’s that , he ’s screwed up .
Now they ’re saying , hey , thanks for standing up .
It was n’t a screw - up , we stood up .
So that was pretty neat .
VCR : So regarding censorship , do you think it ’s just as hard today as it was in the ’60s to get something said ?
Oh yeah , it ’s harder .
It ’s an illusion that the language has changed so much you can say anything you want .
You can say fuck and everything .
But there ’s no real content .
And look at what happened to the Dixie Chicks , for their one comment .
Government did n’t stop them , all the corporations that own the government said , “ We ’re not gonna play the record . ”
VCR : Do you think the corporate ownership makes it harder ?
You still have stuff like The Daily Show or The Colbert Report .
But they ’re all on cable .
Look at the numbers they have as opposed to broadcast .
They allow it because they can put it on those fringes .
But Daily
Show ’s gotten a lot softer , if you ’ve noticed .
My heroes are Michael Moore and the guy from Politically Incorrect [ Bill Maher ] and George Carlin and Pete Seeger .
VCR : And today you ’ve been campaigning to get Seeger a Nobel Prize , too .
Why has it been so overdue for him ?
Well if you get over the political funky things : he ’s a liberal , he ’s a socialist .
Now they ’re recognizing what character and ethic he had .
He went through all those things and stuck true to his beliefs .
And his beliefs were all in fairness , someone who spends their life making music for people and worrying about workers , people who work for a living , and he ’s never stopped .
I get so angry when people say , “ Well , he ’s just an ego trip . ”
VCR : What ’s your opinion on modern television in general ?
I do n’t watch it that much .
It ’s gotta be so much harder to break through nowadays .
Back then there were three networks , but you got in .
You could be a star if you did The Tonight Show .
Two days later you ’re a star !
Now , there ’re so many shows out there , it does n’t make any difference .
But there ’s a lot of good stuff out there .
VCR : And the variety show format : we really do n’t see too much of that anymore .
It ’s the award shows that turn into variety .
I do n’t think variety show ’s gonna happen .
I just miss Ed Sullivan ( Laughs ) .
I want to see the plate spinners and the jugglers , all that stuff .
A lot of people who come to see us have never seen us live .
And maybe for 40 years , 50 years in the business people want to go back to a better time .
So we ’ve got a little heat going for some reason , and I guess the Emmy helped , and the DVD that ’s out there , it has five hours of extra stuff that ’s really cool .
Pat Paulsen for President and all that stuff is in there .
VCR : In the late ’ 80s , the Bush / Dukakis race , he tried again .
( Laughs ) The ’68 election was the best .
It was the best run .
Life ’s been good .
VCR : When you look back at the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour , how well do you think it holds up today ?
I ask because then you had Nixon and Vietnam and most recently we ’ve had Bush and Iraq , and you watch some of those episodes and the performers and it ’s just as relevant today as it was then .
It is .
Pete Seeger singing “ Waist Deep in the Big Muddy , ” and my God , it sounds like today .
What a quagmire .
To me , it ’s like we ’ve got a country of warlords , Democrats and Republicans , and they ’re both basically owned by the industrial military complex .
If you question anything , “ You do n’t support our troops ! ”
It ’s bullshit .
If Obama makes it through here , maybe we ’ll get a change .
It ’s a hard thing .
You gotta stay real hopeful because at least we ’ve got him .
I thought the blackness and darkness was gonna go on forever !

Eight years is a long time .
VCR : The Emmy you received last year .
Why was now the right time for that ?
I do n’t know .
I was so surprised when they called me and said , “ You know , we ’d like to give you this Emmy , ” because I took my name off the thing .
I was very mixed about it .
And then I realized , it ’s a real compliment to the show and the history of the show , and what it stood for .
So it was pretty neat , especially Steve Martin giving it to me .
VCR : He started as a writer on your show .
Yeah , we started him out , he was 21 years old .
Bob Einstein was 22 .
We had a lot of young people .
Rob Reiner was 22 .
We all came towards a sense of equity and fairness .
Why ca n’t this country be more like that : we support underdogs .
But we only go out there and overthrow governments if they vote for somebody we do n’t like .
The DVD , the Emmy , a couple of other little things , and public television is playing the Smothers .
It ’s a nice little heat at the end of our career .
And we ’re also doing some of our best work right now .
The Smothers Brothers will appear at the Canyon Club in Agoura Hills on Friday , Feb. 27 , at 9 p.m .

Here ’s a handy chart of the C Standard Library functions in time.h :
The ovals are data types and the rectangles are functions .
The three basic types are :
time_t : number of seconds since the start of the UNIX epoch .
This is always UTC !
: number of seconds since the start of the UNIX epoch .
This is always UTC !
struct tm :
A broken - down date , split into years , months , seconds , etc .
In Python , it ’s a tuple .
: A broken - down date , split into years , months , seconds , etc .
In Python , it ’s a tuple .
string :
Any string representation of a time , e.g. “ Wed Jun 30 21:49:08 1993 ″ .
Generally you either want a time_t ( because it ’s easy to do arithmetic with ) or a string ( because it ’s pretty to look at ) .
So to get from a time_t to a string , you should use something like strftime ( " % Y - %m- %d " , localtime ( time ( ) ) ) .
To go the other way , you ’d use mktime ( strptime ( str , " % Y - %m - % d " ) ) .
This library has been around since at least 1982 .
It ’s been replicated in many other languages ( Python , Perl , Ruby ) .
We seem to be stuck with it .
Read on for my rant about why this is all idiotic .
Let me just say that I think this is a horrible system .
You almost never want to use struct tm .
Most of the time , you want to go between strings and time_t .
But lonely ctime is the only function that makes this jump , and it does n’t let you set the output format or time zone .
The names are not exactly descriptive , either .
They all end in “ time ” , which makes some sense .
strptime and strftime are even OK , if a bit cryptic .
The p stands for “ parse ” and the f stands for “ format ” , ala printf .
The parameter order is hard to remember , though .
Do n’t use gmtime unless you have a good reason .
ctime and asctime are non-sensical , but I do n’t use them much , either .
My greatest loathing is reserved for localtime and mktime .
I can never remember which of these does which .
Only mnemonic I can think of : mktime makes a time_t from a struct tm .
For another exercise in head - scratching , follow the role of time zones through this chart .
time_t knows no time zones — it ’s always UTC .
To get to struct tm , you need to specify a time zone .
This is not made explicit in the struct , however , so you need to do your own bookkeeping .
The time zone for conversion is n’t a parameter or anything sensible like that , either .
You just get two choices : GM ( UTC ) time or local time .
And if you choose gmtime , you ’ll never be able to get back to time_t because that function does n’t exist .
( Some systems supply a mkgmtime or timegm function . )
How would I design it ?
struct tm would lose its place at the center of everything .
There would be sensibly - named functions to go between time_t and string :
time_t parsetime ( format , string [ , timezone ] )
string formattime ( format , time_t [ , timezone ] )
And if you really need them :
splittime ( time_t , struct tm * )
time_t packtime ( struct tm * )
Was that really so hard ?

Tequila may be just another drink to those out in the town , but to a team of scientists in Mexico their country 's native alcohol turned out to be a gem ; a diamond , to be precise .
Javier Morales , Luis Apátiga and Victor Castaño at the National Autonomous University of Mexico made the alchemist - worthy discovery while experimenting turning various organic solutions , such as acetone and ethanol , into diamonds .
The scientists noted that 80 - proof tequila ( 40 percent alcohol ) had the ideal proportion of ethanol to water to create diamond films .
In order to make the diamonds , they evaporated the tequila into a vapor , and then heated the vapor above 1400 degrees Fahrenheit before depositing it on silicon or stainless steel trays .
The resulting diamond films were between 100 to 400 nm in diameter and free of impurities .
‘ Ice that burns ’ – gas hydrates
In the future , natural gas derived from chunks of ice that workers collect from beneath the ocean floor and beneath the arctic permafrost may fuel cars , heat homes , and power factories .
Government researchers are reporting that these so - called “ gas hydrates , ” a frozen form of natural gas that bursts into flames at the touch of a match , show increasing promise as an abundant , untapped source of clean , sustainable energy .
The icy chunks could supplement traditional energy sources that are in short supply and which produce large amounts of carbon dioxide linked to global warming , the scientists say .
“ These gas hydrates could serve as a bridge to our energy future until cleaner fuel sources , such as hydrogen and solar energy , are more fully realized , ” says study co-leader Tim Collett , Ph.D. , a research geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) in Denver , Colo .
Gas hydrates , known as “ ice that burns , ” hold special promise for helping to combat global warming by leaving a smaller carbon dioxide footprint than other fossil fuels , Collett and colleagues note .
They will present research on gas hydrates today at the American Chemical Society ’s 237th National Meeting .
It is among two dozen papers on the topic scheduled for a two - day symposium , “ Gas Hydrates and Clathrates , ” March 23 - 24 , held at the Hilton Salt Lake City .
Last November , a team of USGS researchers that included Collett announced a giant step toward that bridge to the future .
In a landmark study , the USGS scientists estimated that 85.4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas could potentially be extracted from gas hydrates in Alaska ’s North Slope region , enough to heat more than 100 million average homes for more than a decade .
“ It ’s definitely a vast storehouse of energy , ” Collett says .
“ But it is still unknown how much of this volume can actually be produced on an industrial scale . ”
That volume , he says , depends on the ability of scientists to extract useful methane , the main ingredient in natural gas , from gas hydrate formations in an efficient and cost - effective manner .
Scientists worldwide are now doing research on gas hydrates in order to understand how this strange material forms and how it might be used to supplement coal , oil , and traditional natural gas .
Although scientists have known about gas hydrates for decades , they ’ve only recently begun to try to use them as an alternative energy source .
Gas hydrates , also known as “ clathrates , ” form when methane gas from the decomposition of organic material comes into contact with water at low temperatures and high pressures .
Those cold , high - pressure conditions exist deep below the oceans and underground on land in certain parts of the world , including the ocean floor and permafrost areas of the Arctic .
Today , researchers are finding tremendous stores of gas hydrates throughout the world , including United States , India , and Japan .
In addition to Alaska , the United States has vast gas hydrate deposits in the Gulf of Mexico and off its eastern coast .
Interest in and support of hydrate research is now growing worldwide .
Japan and India currently have among the largest , most well - funded hydrate research programs in the world .
“ Once we have learned better how to find the most promising gas hydrate deposits , we will need to know how to produce it in a safe and commercially - viable way , ” says study co-author Ray Boswell , Ph.D .
He manages the National Methane Hydrate R&D Program of the U.S. Department of Energy ’s National Energy Technology Laboratory in Morgantown , W. Va .
“ Chemistry will be a big part of understanding just how the hydrates will respond to various production methods . ”
One of the more promising techniques for extracting methane from hydrates involves simply depressurizing the deposits , Boswell says .
Another method involves exchanging the methane molecules in the “ clathrate ” structure with carbon dioxide .
Workers can , in theory , collect the gas using the same drilling technology used for conventional oil and gas drilling .
Under the Methane Hydrate Research and Development Act of 2000 , the U.S. government has already spent several million dollars , in collaboration with universities and private companies , to investigate gas hydrates as an alternative energy source .
Scientists are particularly optimistic about the vast stores of gas hydrates located in Alaska and in the Gulf of Mexico .
Research is also accelerating under the U.S. Department of Energy and USGS to better understand gas hydrate ’s role in the natural environment and in climate change .
“ Gas hydrates are totally doable , ” Collett says .
“ But when and where we will see them depends on need , motivation , and our supply of other energy resources .
In the next five to ten years , the research potential of gas hydrates will be more fully realized . ”

A Multnomah County judge has cleared a Northeast Portland nude bicyclist of criminal indecent exposure charges , saying cycling naked has become a " well - established tradition " in Portland and understood as a form of " symbolic protest . "
Judge Jerome LaBarre said the city 's annual World Naked Bike Ride -- in which as many as 1,200 people cycled through Northwest and downtown Portland on June 14 -- has helped cement riding in the buff as a form of protest against cars and possibly even the nation 's dependence on fossil fuels .
LaBarre then cleared Michael " Bobby " Hammond , 21 , of any wrongdoing after two days of hearings that concluded Wednesday .
Hammond 's legal troubles began June 26 , when he stripped off all his clothes and hopped on his vintage 1970s 10 - speed -- in an effort , he says , to make clear that nothing was powering his mode of transportation but his own unadulterated body .
Portland police , however , saw Hammond 's two - minute ride through the Alberta Arts District as a stunt , not free speech .
They arrested Hammond , citing city code that states it 's illegal to expose genitalia in a public place in view of members of the opposite sex .
A bystander recorded the episode , which unfolded at 10:30 p.m. in front of Hammond 's home at Northeast 15th Avenue and Alberta Street .
The video was posted on the Web .
As Hammond pulls to a stop , police begin to question him .
" Who , me ? " responds an apparently startled Hammond , adding that he does n't think he 's doing anything wrong .
A woman can be heard yelling in the background that Oregon law allows nudity -- as long as it is n't done to sexually arouse oneself or others .
" Dude , look , " says one of three officers who approach Hammond .
" Go put on pants , or we 're going to take you to jail .
There 's a city code that says you can't be naked in public .
There are kids out here .
You can't be riding around with your penis hanging out , OK ? ... "
" I just want to ride my bike , " Hammond says .
" I 'm wearing a helmet . "
" That 's fine , " responds another officer .
" You want to go to jail tonight ?
Either you get your pants on right now ( and ) you get off your bike ... or you 're going to jail . "
Hammond gets off his bike .
He stands still , almost frozen for several seconds as an officer can be heard counting down from five .
When the officer gets to one , the trio bring Hammond to the ground during a 10 - second struggle , because Hammond continues to hang onto his bike .
The officers handcuff him , laying him naked on the street .
Hammond said later that a bystander offered to get him some clothes but that there was n't time before police pulled him to the ground .
Lesser charges
Police originally charged Hammond with felony assault of a public safety officer , among other charges .
The district attorney 's office , however , decided not to pursue that charge and instead sought misdemeanor convictions for resisting arrest , fourth - degree assault and indecent exposure .
Hammond , who works at the Black Cat Cafe and as a caregiver for people with developmental disabilities , testified that he moved here more than a year ago from New Mexico .
He said he thought nudity was legal in Portland because he 'd participated in his first World Naked Bike Ride without incident .
" If anyone here has n't been , you have to go , " Hammond testified .
" It 's one of the reasons I live in Portland .
As far as you can see -- as far in front of you and behind -- it 's naked people . "
Twelve days after the event , Hammond , housemates and friends sat on the lawn of his home , passing out origami , selling art and playing music during the art district 's Last Thursday event .
They bemoaned the car traffic congesting Alberta Street , and Hammond and a friend , Walter Geis , decided to strip down and ride their bikes up and down the boulevard .
Hammond testified that he was expressing a message in support of bikes and against cars , foreign oil , the Iraq war and air pollution .
Deputy District Attorney Ryan Lufkin argued that Hammond did n't carry any signs , pass out fliers or otherwise attempt to communicate his message to bystanders .
" He may have well thought he was doing this for a noble purpose , but there was no way to express that to a rational person , " Lufkin said .
" This was , by every definition of the word , streaking . "
Lufkin told the judge that if he dismissed the charges against Hammond on free - speech grounds , he was in essence invalidating city code .
Lufkin said anyone who'd been arrested for indecent exposure could argue they were exempt from the law because they were expressing speech .
A case - by - case issue
In 1985 , the Oregon Court of Appeals ruled in City of Portland v. Gatewood that appearing nude in public can be a protected form of expression -- such as if it 's done in political protest -- and should be considered on a case - by - case basis .
LaBarre said Hammond 's case qualified as protected expression .
" It 's been well - known since Lady Godiva that the shock value of nudity can be a very important protest , " LaBarre said , referring to the legend of a noblewoman who rode naked on a horse through the streets of Coventry in England to protest her husband 's oppressive taxation of the people .
Hammond was all smiles as the judge issued his decision .
He hugged his attorney , public defender Tiffany Harris , and friends and neighbors who came to watch .
He expressed his relief that he would n't lose his job as a caregiver .
He said his employer , Westside Community Focus , had told him he would be fired for liability reasons if he were convicted .
He also made plans for the future : Would he ever ride naked again ?
" Oh , yeah , " he said .

And The Oscar For Best Editing Goes To ….. BJ Penn ???
Total Pro Sports -
It seems as though BJ Penn has had Oscar fever lately , and in light of it all he has decided to release a documentary regarding the vaseline incident in his last fight with Georges St. Pierre .
The video ( displayed below ) shows footage of several different incidents , including St. Pierre ’s trainer rubbing vaseline on him , Dana
White telling others after the fight that “ Georges is in trouble ” for having vaseline on him , and quotes from other fighters complaining about similar incidents .
One thing is for sure .
BJ sure can do some great editing .
So does BJ have a point ?
Well I may have been inclined to say yes had he not taken such a beating .
It is doubtful this would have changed the result of the fight that saw Georges win by stoppage after four rounds , but maybe BJ would not have taken such a beating .
You just gotta love how these fighters always tip their hat to GSP and what a wonderful fighter he is , and then you get quotes ( like those of Matt Hughes ) that seem to put all the blame for their defeats on the vaseline .
The only reason he realized it was such a problem was because he had no choice but to try and hold on to GSP for dear life while taking such punishment .
Face it !
GSP is the man in MMA right now .
He could have had stick ’em all over his body and would still have pounded the hell out of Penn , Hughes , and anyone else he has faced off against .
Do n’t let this change your opinion .
So is Penn looking for a rematch to avenge himself from GSP and the vasoline ?
Lets hope so , so that St. Pierre can shut him up once again .

WASHINGTON  Even as it pulls back from harsh interrogations and other sharply debated aspects of George W. Bush ’s “ war on terrorism , ” the Obama administration is quietly signaling continued support for other major elements of its predecessor ’s approach to fighting Al Qaeda .
In little - noticed confirmation testimony recently , Obama nominees endorsed continuing the C.I.A. ’s program of transferring prisoners to other countries without legal rights , and indefinitely detaining terrorism suspects without trials even if they were arrested far from a war zone .
The administration has also embraced the Bush legal team ’s arguments that a lawsuit by former C.I.A. detainees should be shut down based on the “ state secrets ” doctrine .
It has also left the door open to resuming military commission trials .
And earlier this month , after a British court cited pressure by the United States in declining to release information about the alleged torture of a detainee in American custody , the Obama administration issued a statement thanking the British government “ for its continued commitment to protect sensitive national security information . ”
I live in a modest three - bedroom , one - bath apartment in the Lower East Side of Manhattan .
In May 2008 , my two roommates and I tensely elbowed our way to a " bargain " lease of $ 2,650 a month .
We were ecstatic -- even though we did have a roach scare a few weeks later .
We were less ecstatic recently , when a renewal lease slid under our door ....
Have you ever had the experience of something that you once did for fun turning into work or a chore ?
Maybe you loved knitting in the past , but recent requests from friends for specific items have left you feeling that turning out a new hat or jumper has become something you dread .
Perhaps the website design skills which you were learning purely for enjoyment ’s sake became tedious to keep up with once you started charging for your talents .
I found that reading novels ( previously something I did purely for fun ) felt like work when I started studying English literature at university .
We all know what work feels like .
It ’s something that we :
Do out of a sense of duty or obligation
Sometimes ( not always ) get paid for
Often have deadlines for , or other people overseeing our progress
But if you think about it , it ’s hard to label any specific activities as being “ work ” .
Is writing blog articles work or play ?
Well , that depends whether you ’re a freelance , paid blogger or someone with a personal blog that you use for journaling about your life .
George Orwell , writing over half a decade ago , was keenly aware that “ work ” and “ play ” pretty much depend on your perspective :
“ But what is work and what is not work ?
Is it work to dig , to carpenter , to plant trees , to fell trees , to ride , to fish , to hunt , to feed chickens , to play the piano , to take photographs , to build a house , to cook , to sew , to trim hats , to mend motor bicycles ?
All of these things are work to somebody , and all of them are play to somebody .
There are in fact very few activities which cannot be classed either as work or play according as you choose to regard them . ”
- George Orwell , in The Road to Wigan Pier
Breaking the “ Work ” Mindset
So , how can you get out of the “ work ” mindset ?
How do you turn your work into something more enjoyable ?
Firstly , I want to admit upfront that I do n’t think this is totally possible for everyone .
If you work in a boring job purely for money , chances are it ’s never going to seem like play .
Here ’s a simple test :
Can you imagine doing what you currently do for “ work ” , if you were n’t paid ?
If the answer is “ no way ” , then you may need to give some serious thought to your career .
( A good starting point might be How to Design Your Own Life . )
But if you do something which you went into because you quite enjoyed it – perhaps as a writer , designer , computer programmer , coach – and you ’re starting to feel that it ’s becoming more and more of a chore , you could benefit from breaking the work mindset .
Here are a few things that might help you :
Plan a “ treat ” during each workday ; something related to your work which you really want to do .
It might be reading a chapter of a brilliant new book in your field , keeping in touch with your network via social media , writing a post for your company blog … anything that you do n’t usually do because it feels too much like “ fun ” to count as part of your workday !
It might be reading a chapter of a brilliant new book in your field , keeping in touch with your network via social media , writing a post for your company blog … anything that you do n’t usually do because it feels too much like “ fun ” to count as part of your workday !
Take a day off ( easier if you ’re self - employed ) .
Only do things which you want to do rather than things which you feel you should do .
Ironically , I often find I make good progress on significant projects or tasks that I ’ve been stalled on when I give myself permission to have the day off “ real ” work !
Only do things which you want to do rather than things which you feel you should do .
Ironically , I often find I make good progress on significant projects or tasks that I ’ve been stalled on when I give myself permission to have the day off “ real ” work !
Start divorcing your actual income from your daily work .
By that , I mean generating some passive income that comes into your bank account regardless of whether or not you ’re sitting at your desk .
( For example , book royalties , affiliate sales on your website , running advertising on your blog . )
It does n’t have to be a huge amount of money – I make about $ 150 / month from one of my websites – but you ’ll be surprised how liberating this can feel .
Think about what else would make your work seem more like play .
Perhaps you get energized and enthused by collaborating with others – can you incorporate more of this into your day ?
Maybe you love working from Starbucks or a deckchair in your garden – are you resisting doing this because it feels too much like “ fun ” and you think work should be a struggle ?
Turning Routine Work Into Play
If you ’ve set an arbitrary goal which bores you or stresses you , consider whether it needs to be in your life .
When you can ditch something that ’s never going to be fun , do !
Of course , some tasks pretty much need to be done , regardless of how dull or work - like they are .
A good way to make these closer to play is to impose some sort of external structure on them .
For example , if your daily work can be a bit of a grind ( but you need to stick with it until you find a new job ) , try Mark Forster ’s time management method for giving yourself “ points ” for what you accomplish each day :
“ This exercise consists of a daily challenge in which you compete against yourself to score as many points as possible each day .
To score points , you have to decide the previous day how many points you are going to attempt to score the following day .
Then you write down a list comprising that number of tasks .
So , for example , if you decide you want to try to score three points the following day , you write down a list of three tasks . …
The tasks should be simple and specific so that by the end of the day , you have either done them or you have n’t .
Then you score one point for each completed task .
That sounds easy enough , does n’t it ?
But there ’s a catch .
You score the points only if you complete every item on the list that day .
If you have n’t completed every item , then you score no points at all for that day – no excuses accepted ! ” – Do It Tomorrow , pg 40 - 41 , Mark Forster
If you work with colleagues , an element of competition can help to make your day more fun and challenging .
Many of us have a strong competitive streak : racing to see who can get the most data entry items completed in a day , or who can put together mail - outs fastest , could turn really boring jobs into something more interesting .
If you work alone , compete against yourself , or find ways to make routine tasks fun – perhaps you challenge yourself to incorporate a random word into all your emails for the day , for example .
At home , chores are another great area for competition ( this works well with kids , too ; seeing who can tidy up the most toys fastest can have their bedroom floor cleared in minutes ! )
How about :
Drawing chores out of a hat to see who does what ( you might allow swaps )
Signing up for Chores Wars – could be a great way to get a household of computer game fans to clean and hoover …
How do you make sure that you do n’t turn your projects and goals into something that feels like hard work ?
How do you cope with the inevitably “ worky ” elements of life to make them more fun and interesting ?

I want to make a prediction : the ironic hipster reign in pop-culture will die soon .
I 've been feeling this way for a while , but the other day when I passed a hipster clothing store in Hollywood that had a humongous replica of a urinal eating up half its floor , what once might 've intrigued me or made me laugh just seemed stupid and boring .
It also reeked of the kind of bland un-creativeness that portends a dying trend .
I 'd say a crude but nonetheless accurate way to define a " trendsetter " is a person who looks around , sees what no one else is doing , does that , and then it catches on .
So trends , big and small , tend to follow a pretty logical ebb and flow .
High waists are in , so next short waists are in .
Big hair , then flat hair .
Upbeat party music , then introspective serious music .
Etc .
And right before there 's a shift , the trend inevitably becomes stale and lame .
I see the omnipresent Snorgtees / Bustedtees ads pervading seemingly every website I read as a death knell .
Wearing a shirt to be funny just is n’t that funny anymore .
Target and Hot Topic have overtaken what started in thrift stores .
It ’s gone corporate and turned into something else .
I expect my dad to be wearing a “ Vote Pedro ” shirt next I see him .
Irony and sarcasm are simply getting tiresome .
I used to find Meta - comedy exciting , I loved anything that ironically deconstructed the formats of storytelling .
But everything gets old given time .
Anchorman gave way to Step - Brothers .
“ The Simpsons ” stopped being good years ago .
Even Adult Swim is starting to feel repetitive .
None of it feels outside the box anymore .
I mean , hell , " ironic " mustaches are now just your run -of - the - mill cop mustaches .
I ’m bored by retro bands and self - referential movies and people wearing shirts for bands they do n’t like “ as a joke . ”
If you have a Hanson poster in your apartment I ’d frankly be more interested if you copped to loving the group .
The whole too - cool - for - school attitude that has pervaded the hipster trend is played out .
But I sense change .
No more winking .
It 's time to get genuine .
Sincerity is now punk .
Oil prices have fallen 70 % since hitting a record $ 147.27 a barrel in July , which means in just five months , crude has given up all the price gains it made in the past four years .
After such a wrenching plunge , many analysts believe the outlook for the " black gold " remains bleak – and in the short term it certainly is .
In the long run , however , dwindling supplies , resurgent demand , and a lack of investment will cause crude oil to double , triple , or even quintuple in price over the next few years .
" Socialism ! " : the rallying cry of Republicans opposing the " stimulus " bill just signed by President Barack Obama .
It was also , late in the game , the rallying cry of John McCain and his supporters last fall , especially after the Joe the Plumber incident .
They are undoubtedly correct that this law , and Obama ’s plans in general , are leading us ever further down the road to serfdom , although from an economic standpoint it ’s at least as much fascist as socialist — not that the distinction matters greatly for the two are the same in principle .
While it ’s good to see some actual GOP opposition to government growth again , it ’s very difficult to take it seriously .
Here , for example , is just a sampling of the socialist programs and policies instituted and / or supported by a significant number of Republicans , with Ron Paul frequently being the lone exception :
Social Security .
Republicans may not have started this program , and occasionally they will speak of its insolvency , but they seem to have no real problem with its continuation .
The best we get out of them is Bush ’s stillborn plan to give those of us forced into Social Security the option of diverting a small portion of the loot stolen from us into various government - approved investments .
Given the current state of the stock market , we should be grateful that this plan never got off the ground .
Imagine the bailouts to all the individual Social Security " investors " who expected to get ever - increasing returns on their investments !
Name the last Republican who spoke of abolishing , rather than " shoring up " or " reforming " Social Security .
Medicare .
Not only does the GOP not suggest ridding us of this blatantly socialist takeover of the health care system ; but George W. Bush , with the support of many members of his own party , pushed through Medicare prescription drug coverage , the largest new entitlement program in four decades .
Again there is talk of " fixing " or " saving " Medicare but none of ending it — all while Republicans try to convince us that they , and they alone , are standing between us and the Democrats ’ plans to nationalize health care .
Welfare .
Yes , we have welfare " reform , " but where is welfare repeal ?
Add a few mild work requirements to the program , and the GOP is on board .
Faith - Based Initiatives .
Getting religious charities on the government dole was another Bush policy that seemed to please much of his base as long as their preferred charities were the ones robbing the rest of us .
Sure , it meant that those charities had to water down their messages , but it was worth it to see that " liberal " charities did n’t get their hands in the till .
Proof of the socialist nature of these programs is that Obama intends to retain and expand them , in the process forcing charities to distance themselves even further from their religious underpinnings .
Public Education .
In 1994 the GOP promised to rid us of the Department of Education .
Instead we got Bush ’s No Child Left Behind Act , greatly increasing control of the education system from Washington .
Every once in a while some Republican will timidly suggest school vouchers or tuition tax credits to allow parents to send their children to the schools of their choice , but in these programs ( especially vouchers ) lie the same dangers for private elementary and secondary schools that private colleges and universities whose students accept federal money already have experienced .
( See my alma mater , Grove City College , for a prime example . )
In any event , Republicans seem uninterested in reducing federal control over the education system .
For that matter , when was the last time you heard a Republican suggest curtailing or eliminating state control of any level of schooling ?
Infrastructure .
Where are the Republicans demanding that Uncle Sam get out of the road - and bridge - building business ?
Where are those demanding even a cutback in such spending ?
Republican President Dwight Eisenhower gave us the Interstate Highway System , a fact to which most GOP stalwarts point with pride .
Even scarcer is the Republican at the state or local level voicing the opinion that perhaps the government of which he is a part is doing us all a disservice by continuing to maintain socialist infrastructure to the exclusion of all competitors .
Law Enforcement .
Republicans are always the first to defend the police , the FBI , and other government agencies whenever any allegations of abuse or wrongdoing are lodged against them .
They have shown great eagerness to increase local , state , and federal cops ’ powers and immunities , especially if they can use the excuse of fighting wars on drugs or terrorism .
They passed the PATRIOT Act with alacrity when the opportunity presented itself ; and Bush aggrandized , with his fellow Republicans ’ approval , much unconstitutional power to the executive branch , including the ability to imprison people indefinitely on the president ’s say - so .
They even granted retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies that had assisted the Bush administration in violating the Constitution by eavesdropping on Americans ’ telephone calls — with the assistance of noted socialist Obama .
Give even the slightest hint that you think law enforcement agencies should be curtailed or certain criminal statutes repealed , and Republicans will be the first to denounce you as " soft on crime " or " with the terrorists . "
And do n’t even suggest that private security could do a better job than government " security . "
Financial Bailouts .
Republicans maintained that the abuses at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could have been prevented by better oversight , which the Democrats opposed .
They did not say that these abuses could have been prevented by abolishing Fannie and Freddie and various other government loan programs .
Bush had , in fact , exacerbated the problem with his now laughably named American Dream Downpayment
Act of 2003 , which allowed people to obtain mortgages with no down payment and even without mortgage payments for the first two years .
Bush , of course , also stumped for and signed into law the Troubled Asset Relief Program , which gave the Secretary of the Treasury $ 700 billion to hand out at will .
Even Obama ’s latest outrage on this front , yet another mortgage bailout , " originated with a Republican , " writes Ilana Mercer .
" Only a week or two back , " she explains , " minority whip Sen .
Mitch McConnell proposed a similar scheme whereby the government would lower home - loan interest rates and guarantee the loans . "
One doubts that Republicans would be crying " Socialism ! " had McConnell ’s plan come up for a vote .
The Military .
This undoubtedly is the socialist program most beloved of Republicans .
They may be willing to admit that in all other instances government is wasteful , inefficient , and bungling and that it usually fails to solve the problems it sets out to solve while simultaneously creating new ones ; but when it comes to the armed forces , suddenly all that skepticism melts away into an infatuation worthy of Romeo and Juliet .
Maybe the Pentagon does spend a wee bit too much on screwdrivers and toilet seats , and perhaps even certain actions taken by the boys in uniform ( such as Abu Ghraib ) have negative effects , but those are aberrations in an otherwise stellar record .
Every good Republican knows that the U.S. military always acts in the best interest not just of America but of the entire world .
As far as the GOP is concerned , " defense " spending must never be cut , no matter how out of proportion it is to the actual threats our country faces or to the spending of the rest of the world ; and one must never , ever criticize the military .
To cut the military ’s budget or suggest that it might be just as wasteful , inefficient , and bungling as the rest of the government is to " hate the troops " and to " blame America first . "
One would n’t expect private defense to enter these people ’s minds , but few Republicans are even willing to consider constraining either the Pentagon ’s spending or its adventurism .
All other government programs are fair game for cutting and criticism , but the military is sacrosanct .
One could probably make a list ten times as long of all the socialist institutions supported by the very same Republicans who now pose as defenders of capitalism .
They are correct that Obama ’s plans are socialist in nature , but they fail to see — or conveniently forget — that they , too , are guilty of giving America a huge push down the slope of socialism .
While their opposition to the " stimulus " is welcome , it ’s a bit like Bugs Moran ’s criticizing Al Capone for bumping off his enemies .
Unfortunately , we the taxpayers are the ones who were massacred on this St. Valentine ’s Day .

Civil rights group to Obama : Release secret Bush memos Mike Sheehan
Published : Wednesday January 28 , 2009
Print This Email This The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) is calling on the Justice Department to release Bush administration documentation pertaining to torture , surveillance and other controversial national security policies .
The civil rights watchdog sent a letter today to the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel , the same office that provided legal advice to the White House under George W. Bush .
The secret memos were essentially the legal foundation for many of the Bush adminstration 's questionable practices , says the ACLU in a news release received by Raw Story .
The Bush White House vigorously fought the release of such revealing ( some would say , damning ) documentation in the interests , it insisted , of protecting national security and other factors .
The ACLU 's filing of the Freedom of Information Act request follows President Obama 's recent directive to minimize federal secrecy and " usher in a new era of open government . "
The request is seen as a test of the freshly inaugurated president 's transparency policy .
" The ACLU now sees a new opening , " writes Marisa Taylor of McClatchy Newspapers .
The new policy is a promise by Obama that the rights group hopes he follows through with .
" President Obama should be commended " for his commitment to openness , said an ACLU director .
" We 're eager to see this commitment put into practice . "
The release of the secret documentation will help the nation -- and the world - - move on from the " lawless conduct " of the Bush administration , the ACLU argues .
More details on the ACLU 's pursuit of the information release is here .
Excerpts from their press release today follow ...
###
The Justice Department continues to withhold many legal opinions , including memos purporting to allow torture and warrantless surveillance .
The ACLU has previously sought the memos through the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) .
" Releasing the memos would allow the public to better understand the legal basis for the Bush administration 's national security policies ; to better understand the role that the OLC played in developing , justifying , and advocating those policies ; and to participate more meaningfully in the ongoing debate about national security , civil liberties , and human rights , " said the ACLU in the letter .
In its letter , the ACLU called on the OLC to release , at the earliest possible date , dozens of legal memos related to interrogation , detention , rendition , surveillance and other Bush administration policies .
Since 2003 , the ACLU has filed three lawsuits to enforce FOIA requests seeking the OLC legal opinions and other government records .
These lawsuits have resulted in the release of thousands of documents , but most of the key OLC memos are still being withheld .

Man , I used to love getting mail .
As a kid , if I saw the mailman I ’d throw on my dad ’s oversized loafers – no time for you Velcro sneakers !
– and hurriedly clomp down the driveway to our bird - shaped mailbox so that I alone had the mail - retrieving pleasure .
It never occurred to me that no one else cared and I was actually performing a useful service to my family , I just loved sifting through the papers , hoping , praying there might be something for lil’ me .
Even in college checking my mail was a pleasurable daily routine .
Of course when I was a kid all I ever got in the mail were comic books and Nintendo Power .
In college it was Maxim ( I was young and foolish - please do n’t judge ) and care packages from my parents .
Those were halcyon days .
Now the mailman is a harbinger of adult life ’s bullshit .
Insurance bills , power bills , gas bills , phone bills , credit card bills .
Bank statements .
Tax info .
Charities I now regret giving money to wanting even more ( they always want more ) .
And volumes upon volumes of junk mail !
I get a rush of pathetic glee if I can actually open my mailbox and find glorious , glorious nothing .
This maybe happens once a year .
The rest of the time it ’s so overstuffed with junk that half my mail falls onto the ground before I can grab it .
Should n't junk mail be illegal ?
How many rain forests has Ralph's and Albertson ’s annihilated sending me grocery ads ?
Seriously , does anyone know how I can get them to stop delivering this shit ?
I 've tried signing up for one of those " get me the fuck off your mailing list " lists but all it did was result in different junk mail .
Sometimes I wo n't check my mail for days .
What 's the point ?
I ’m a broken man .
Sure , I get some magazines , but that ’s once a month and even then I greet many of them with a groan , realizing I ’m still several issues behind in my reading .
Beloved Netflix is the only thing holding my sanity together .
At least I ’ve still got packages .
Even though FedEx has a ninja - like ability to appear at my door just when I ’ve stepped out for a moment , that ’s okay .
Life has yet to figure out how to send me crushing reminders of my grown - up obligations in package form .
They ’re still video games , books , beer - of - the - month , and stuff from my mommy .
God bless packages .
I was reading this very dispiriting article in the Times about how folks in the administration have known about the AIG bonuses for months , how the folks at AIG are now saying they ’d never have done any of it without the go - ahead from the Treasury and — best of all — how the plan to
get AIG to pay the bonus money back appears to involve giving AIG still more taxpayer money which they can then hand back to us as ‘ repayment ’ , while the new bonused execs ( bonees ? ) get to keep the money anyway .
But all was not lost .
Because I found out a little more about AIG Financial Products , my new obsession .
We ’ve already told you about Joseph Cassano , former head of AIGFP , the guy who ran the operation as they were busy making tons of money blowing up AIG and the global economy .
Inter alia , the Times article reports the division is now run by Gerry Pasciucco , a former vice chairman of Morgan Stanley .
On the left , you can see a recent photograph of Mr. Pasciucco from a party in Belle Haven , sporting a Che Guevara t- shirt , blue blazer and handkerchief , with some sort of sporting drink I ’m unable to identify ( possibly a mojito ? ) .
Given how AIGFP helped bring global capitalism to its knees , the choice of t- shirt might suggest a role for internal subversion few have yet considered .
But it is important to note that AIG CEO Edward Liddy brought Pascuicco in last November , after the collapse , “ with instructions to wind down the unit . ”
So it seems that Pascuicco ’s role has been to sort through the rubble rather than build the bomb .
But I digress .
There ’s an issue I ’ve been meaning to raise with AIGFP that may be relevant to various of the questions we ’ve been discussing today .
First , it ’s located in London .
What that means for what law governs the different questions about the bonuses ?
I ’m not sure .
Second , as the Times notes , this is a derivatives trading shop located in London .
How many of the people working there are US citizens ?
Not that there ’s anything wrong with that .
It ’s a global economy .
It ’s a company ( a division of AIG ) operating in the UK .
But I suspect it may play some role in the resistance to identifying who the bonees are .
DAKAR , Senegal , Jan. 12 , 2009  --
To see the effects of racism based on skin color most clearly , one should go to the developing world .
In richer countries people are increasingly comfortable , and successful , regardless of their natural skin color , but in many African countries like Senegal , trying to change one 's skin color is still seen as a way to get ahead .
" Some Senegalese women , " Emilie , a student at Dakar University , told ABC News , " are trying to look like the white girls they see on television . "
From ads on highway billboards , to little stands in marketplaces , skin bleaching products are almost everywhere .
They sell well , despite what public health officials say are grave risks of using them , including cancer .
The cheapest creams cost around $ 5 per tube , a small fortune in Senegal , and they are also among the most dangerous .
At a market in Dakar , a young hairdresser who was unwilling to reveal her name told ABC News she had used the creams .
" It 's more beautiful to have lighter skin .
A bit lighter , it 's a bit better , " she said .
Who says it is more beautiful to have light skin , ABC News asked .
" Well , women of course , yes .
Men prefer women with lighter skin . "
She said , however , that she knew the creams can be dangerous and that she tried " to use products , which are not too strong . "
Some of these creams contain chemicals that can wipe out the skin 's natural protections , doctors say .
" I can not tell you about the dangers of those creams , " said a man who identified himself as Buzz .
He sells the cream on the streets of Dakar .
" I am not an expert , I am just a salesman . "
According to experts , however , the effects can be devastating
.
" We have diagnosed the first cases of skin cancer , " Dakar dermatologist Fatimata Ly told ABC News , " with women who have been using those creams for a long time . "
Infection , acne and facial hair growth are other side effects women face , yet skin bleaching is still on the rise , despite campaigns to raise awareness of the dangers .
Women from all walks of life , from the low - income bracket to the wealthy , well - educated , bleach their skins , according to Ly .
" No one is spared , " she said ,
More Africans Use Products to Lighten Their Skin Color
Even a few men lighten their skins .
Buzz , the salesman , said he is aware that some men use bleaching creams , but he said he does not know anyone among his friends or relatives who does it .
Asked whether he ever tried the products he sells , Buzz said with a grin : " No , not at all , because I do n't need these products to be a gentleman .
I am already one . "
He said , however , that it is easy to spot someone who bleaches their skin .
" Imagine there is someone you know well , " said Buzz , " and then you do n't see that person for a while .
When you see them again , you find out their skin looks different .
Then you know they use products . "
It is somehow considered shameful for Senegalese men to lighten their skins , partly because it is often associated with homosexuality , a taboo in Senegal .
Last week nine men were imprisoned in Dakar for homosexuality ; they were given eight years for " unnatural acts . "
Skin bleaching is not only widespread in Senegal , but all across western Africa .
It is also very popular in Asia .
Commercials for a product in India called Fair and Lovely prompted outrage for linking skin color to success and beauty .
However , these products sell , precisely because buyers believe that having lighter skin leads to to success and happiness .
In Dakar and so many other places , even women who are aware of the dangers fall prey to the idea that if only their skin were lighter , their lives would be better .
" Some young men prefer women with fair skin , " Emilie said .
" This leads them [ the women ] to bleach their skins . "
Some men encourage their partners to use these creams , according to Ly .
Some even buy these expensive products on their behalf .
Many women are also influenced by their female friends and relatives .
" Women who lighten their skins are part of a group , " said Ly .
" Those who do n't , belong to another group . "
" Women bleach their skin to come across as modern women who can modify their skin tone as they wish . "
Dangers of Skin Bleaching
Even more worrying is the widespread habit of bleaching one 's skin during pregnancy , according to Ly , who says it is fashionable for women to look fairer at the baby 's presentation party .
During pregnancy , the woman 's skin is even more vulnerable and there are worries that the corticoids contained in some creams may increase the risks of diabetes for the baby .
According to Ly , some cosmetic companies act irresponsibly .
They do n't always clearly indicate on the tube that it contains dangerous chemicals , she said .
Sadly , many women who realize that these creams are harmful find it difficult to kick the habit .
" As soon as they stop , " said Ly , " their tone becomes darker , and people around them assume they have a problem .
So they resume .
It 's a vicious circle , an addiction . "
Additional reporting by Gallagher Fenwick and Idrissa Sane .
The London police have bested their own impressive record for insane and stupid anti-terrorism posters with a new range of signs advising Londoners to go through each others ' trash - bins looking for " suspicious " chemical bottles , and to report on one another for " studying CCTV cameras . "
It 's hard to imagine a worse , more socially corrosive campaign .
Telling people to rummage in one another 's trash and report on anything they do n't understand is a recipe for flooding the police with bad reports from ignorant people who end up bringing down anti-terror cops on their neighbors who keep tropical fish , paint in oils , are amateur chemists , or who just do something outside of the narrow experience of the least adventurous person on their street .
Essentially , this redefines " suspicious " as anything outside of the direct experience of the most frightened , ignorant and foolish people in any neighborhood .
Even worse , though , is the idea that you should report your neighbors to the police for looking at the creepy surveillance technology around them .
This is the first step in making it illegal to debate whether the surveillance state is a good or bad thing .
It 's the extension of the ridiculous airport rule that prohibits discussing the security measures ( " Exactly how does 101 ml of liquid endanger a plane ? " ) , conflating it with " making jokes about bombs . "
The British authorities are bent on driving fear into the hearts of Britons : fear of terrorists , immigrants , pedophiles , children , knives …
And once people are afraid enough , they 'll write government a blank check to expand its authority without sense or limit .
What an embarrassment from the country whose level - headed response to the Blitz was " Keep Calm and Carry On " — how has that sensible motto been replaced with " When in trouble or in doubt / Run in circles scream and shout " ?
New campaign to urge Londoners to report suspicious activity
Should we be upset about the buy - American provisions in the stimulus bill ?
Is there an economic case for such provisions ?
The answer is yes and yes .
And I do think it ’s important to be honest about the second yes .
The economic case against protectionism is that it distorts incentives : each country produces goods in which it has a comparative disadvantage , and consumes too little of imported goods .
And under normal conditions that ’s the end of the story .
But these are not normal conditions .
We ’re in the midst of a global slump , with governments everywhere having trouble coming up with an effective response .
And one part of the problem facing the world is that there are major policy externalities .
My fiscal stimulus helps your economy , by increasing your exports — but you do n’t share in my addition to government debt .
As I explained a while back , this means that the bang per buck on stimulus for any one country is less than it is for the world as a whole .
And this in turn means that if macro policy is n’t coordinated internationally — and it is n’t — we ’ll tend to end up with too little fiscal stimulus , everywhere .
Now ask , how would this change if each country adopted protectionist measures that “ contained ” the effects of fiscal expansion within its domestic economy ?
Then everyone would adopt a more expansionary policy — and the world would get closer to full employment than it would have otherwise .
Yes , trade would be more distorted , which is a cost ; but the distortion caused by a severely underemployed world economy would be reduced .
And as the late James Tobin liked to say , it takes a lot of Harberger triangles to fill an Okun gap .
Let ’s be clear : this is n’t an argument for beggaring thy neighbor , it ’s an argument that protectionism can make the world as a whole better off .
It ’s a second - best argument — coordinated policy is the first - best answer .
But it needs to be taken seriously .
What ’s the counter - argument ?
Do n’t say that any theory which has good things to say about protectionism must be wrong : that ’s theology , not economics .
The right argument , I think , is in terms of political economy .
Everything I ’ve just said applies only when the world is stuck in a liquidity trap ; that ’s where we are now , but it wo n’t be the normal situation .
And if we go all protectionist , that will shatter the hard - won achievements of 70 years of trade negotiations — and it might take decades to put Humpty - Dumpty back together again .
But there is a short - run case for protectionism — and that case will increase in force if we do n’t have an effective economic recovery program .

-- HAWAII HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 128 , 2009
For those of your readers who might sometimes be concerned about their own health and about Consumer Protection in general , the Hawaii House of Representatives has moved forward an extraordinary Resolution asking the FDA to rescind the approval for Aspartame .
This Resolution is particularly auspicious and significant because both the Chair and the Vice Chair of the House Health Committee , as well as the Vice Chair of the Consumer Protection and Commerce Committee , have signed on as cosponsors .
This means the measure will receive a scheduled hearing in the House Health Committee , something that was denied last year by Senate Health Chairman David Ige for the Senate Resolution , as well as the Senate Bill to ban aspartame outright .
It will go to House Finance Committee after the Health Committee referral .
The text of the Resolution follows , and although perhaps tedious and precise to some , clearly indicates the reasons that such a recinding of aspartame 's approval by the FDA is appropriate and long overdue , an approval which to its credit , the FDA rejected for many years before it was forced in 1981 by then President of G.D. Searle , Donald Rumsfeld .
[ You personally could write in support of this long overdue and obvious imperative to Margaret Hamburg , M.D. , FDA Commissioner , 5400 Fisher 's Lane , Rockville Md. , or to commissioner@fda.gov , and to her Deputy , Joshua Sharfstein , M.D. , as well as to the Health and Human Services Secretary , Kathleen Sebelius ; you should also ask your US Senators and Representatives to also do this ]

THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES TO REVIEW EXISTING REPORTS AND STUDIES RELATED TO ASPARTAME , AND REQUESTING THE UNITED STATES FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION TO RESCIND APPROVAL OF ASPARTAME FOR UNITED STATES MARKETS .
WHEREAS , aspartame was originally developed as a drug to treat peptic ulcers ; andWHEREAS , manufacturers state that aspartame is made up of forty per cent aspartic acid , fifty per cent phenylalanine , and ten per cent methanol ; andWHEREAS , aspartic acid is a nonessential amino acid that is used by the body to initiate apoptosis or cell death in aging cells , and that excess aspartic acid from aspartame consumption causes apoptosis in healthy cells that can destroy healthy tissue , especially in the brain ; andWHEREAS , phenylalanine is an essential amino acid found naturally in protein but when isolated becomes neurotoxic , lowers the seizure threshold , depletes serotonin triggering psychiatric and behavioral problems , and interacts with antidepressants and other drugs ; andWHEREAS , methanol is a severe metabolic poison classified as a narcotic that converts to formaldehyde and formic acid , and can embalm living tissue and damage DNA ; andWHEREAS , aspartame metabolites include formaldehyde , a " class A " carcinogen , diketopiperazine , a brain tumor agent , and formic acid ; andWHEREAS , in 1974 , the United States Food and Drug Administration approved aspartame as an artificial sweetener , but asked its manufacturer Searle to hold back from selling it on the market until further tests could be made with regards to its safety ; andWHEREAS , scientific data revealed that there was a problem with aspartame safety data and the United States Food and Drug Administration withdrew its approval ; andWHEREAS , in 1975 , the United States Food and Drug Administration initiated an investigation into Searle 's laboratory practices and discovered fraud in scientific experiments as well as manipulated data giving favorable results proving aspartame to be safe ; andWHEREAS , the results of this investigation are included in what is called " The Bressler Report " by Jerome Bressler ; andWHEREAS , in 1980 , Dr. John Olney submitted scientific data to a United States Food and Drug Administration Public Board of I nquiry showing that aspartic acid , the excitotoxic ingredient in aspartame , caused holes in the brains of mice ; andWHEREAS , Dr. John Olney stated that it warranted special emphasis that excitotoxins act by an acute but silent mechanism requiring only a single exposure to toxic concentrations for CVO neurons to be quietly destroyed , that clearly Searle failed to establish the safety of their product , aspartame , for use in children 's food , and that all age comparative data support the following conclusions : ( 1 ) orally administered excitotoxins destroy CVO neurons at any age ; ( 2 ) immature animals are most vulnerable ; and ( 3 ) the toxic threshold increases only gradually between birth and adulthood ; andWHEREAS , in 1980 , the Public Board of Inquiry unanimously voted against aspartame approval , but was overruled by a new United States Food and Drug Administration Commissioner , Dr. Arthur Hull Hays , against the advice of Food and Drug Administration scientific personnel and advisers ; andWHEREAS, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved aspartame use in sodas , despite the fact that the National Soft Drink Association argued vehemently against aspartame in these quotes from their protest : ( 1) " The present record does not contain data which demonstrate that the use of APM in soft drinks will not result in the adulteration of the beverages under section 402 ( a ) ( 3 ) of the FDC Act 21 U.S.C. 342( a ) ( 3 ) , which provides that a food is adulterated if it contains , in whole or in part , " a decomposed substance or if it is otherwise unfit for food ” ; details can be found at the Hawaii Legislature website : # # # Art Gallery , but primary purpose here is our consumer protection efforts , above all , getting aspartame banned
Sometimes a boring story can become a lot more interesting if you do some skilled number juggling .
This is what seems to have happened in an article in The Daily Telegraph , which claims that 90 % of us carry a gene which increases the risk of high blood pressure by 18 % .
And high blood pressure is of course linked to dreaded killers like stroke and heart disease .
In his Understanding Uncertainty blog David Spiegelhalter traces the story back to a paper in Nature Genetics .
The authors of the paper investigate three gene variants that can occur in the human genome .
Two of them are rare , only about 10 % of the population carry them , while the third is present in 90 % of the population .
The authors show that the gene variants are associated to proteins called natriuretic peptides , which are linked to blood pressure ( this is the main point of the paper , since such a genetic connection had never before been found ) .
The two rarer gene variants , according to the paper , reduce the risk of high blood pressure by 15 % .
The phrase " 18 % increased risk of high blood pressure " appears nowhere in the paper .
Rather it 's the result of some creative accounting on the part of someone operating in the media chain which links the actual paper to the final article in The Daily Telegraph .
Here 's how it 's done :
Say that the risk of high blood pressure for someone carrying the more common gene variant is x .
Now the 15 % decrease associated to the two less common variants takes this down to 0.85 x .
To get back to x , we need to add 0.15 x , and this is exactly 17.647 % of 0.85 x — hence the claim of an 18 % increase in risk .
The calculation is undoubtedly correct , but it puts a spin on the story .
Rather than taking the common case as a base line and talking about the risk reduction associated to the less common cases , it does things the other way around .
This is in stark contrast to the paper 's authors own turn of phrase , which links the rarer variants to risk reduction , but says that the common variant " was not significantly associated with either systolic or diastolic blood pressure . "
It 's a bit like noting that some people live to 110 and then complaining that most of us die prematurely .
" This is a masterful piece of re-framing of the evidence , " says Spiegelhalter on his blog .
" Not exactly wrong , but definitely changing the story .
Just like a change from 98 % to 96 % in a survival rate seems a lot more innocuous than a doubling of the mortality rate from 2 % to 4 % . "

In older procedural languages , the return values that came back from a function were restricted .
If you said you were going to return a number , you returned a number .
If you wanted to sometimes return a number , but other times return an indication of failure , you resorted to what is known as a “ sentinel value ” to return the failure .
A sentinel value is a number that does n’t represent the answer to the problem that the function was asked to solve , but instead flags the caller to the fact that something rather out - of - the - ordinary has happened .
For example , a value of - 1 can indicate the end of a file being read in .
The problem with a sentinel is that it means nothing special to the language .
The programmer has to keep in mind that the sentinel exists and that it has to be handled on every call that could possibly generate the sentinel value .
Programmers are notorious for paying attention to and handling sentinels only when they crash a program .
Also , the programmer has to be careful in choosing the value .
Is it 0 ? - 1 ? 99 ? 255 ? 999 ? - 999 ?
MAXINT ?
The choice can bite you if you ’ve misunderstood the possible values that can be generated in your function .
I regret to inform you that I once wrote a BASIC program that had three different sentinel values returned from three different subroutines !
Sentinel values sound old and busted , do n’t they ?
Their usage fell a bit once we could pass around pointers to data structures .
With a little more elbow room , we could put a “ success ” boolean right up front in the data structure and do away with a lot of sentinels .
They Live !
But sentinels are still around .
In JavaScript , the string method “ indexOf ” returns a - 1 if the needle ( substring ) ca n’t be found in the haystack ( the string to be searched ) .
Let ’s look at a few different ways we can deal with that awkward - 1 .
function wrappedIndexOf( needle , haystack ) { var res=haystack.indexOf( needle ) ; if ( res=== - 1 ) { res=false ; } return res ; }
And you call it like this :
res=wrappedIndexOf( needle , haystack ) ; if ( res!==false ) { location=res ; }
We have n’t done much here but replace the need to check explicitly for - 1 with a need to check explicitly for false .
Too weird to sometimes return a number and sometimes return a boolean ?
Yeah , probably .
I like it a bit better than the numeric sentinel because the calling code makes the exception check a bit more obvious .
Because JavaScript functions can return just about anything ( including wild things like anonymous functions ) , you always need to think about what can come out of a function , so what ’s important is a consistent convention .
Similarly , you could return null or undefined .
But let ’s move on to another solution –returning an object .
function wrappedIndexOf( needle , haystack ) { var res=haystack.indexOf( needle ) ; if ( res=== - 1 ) { res= {" success " : false , " value " : - 1} ; } else { res= {" success " : true , " value " : res} ; } return res ; }
And you call it like this :
obj=wrappedIndexOf(needle , haystack ) ; if ( obj.success ) { location=obj.value ; }
Note that I ’ve left the - 1 in obj.value , so you can still use that as a sentinel if you like .
What makes JavaScript really good for this task ?
Its object literals .
You do n’t need to have a structure or class around to hold the extra info .
You just build the object on the fly and return it .
DAVOS , Switzerland ( CNN ) -- Japan will hand out $ 17 billion in development aid to other Asian countries to help them face the global financial crisis , Prime Minister Taro Aso said Saturday at the World Economic Forum .
Aso said the U.S. needed to curb overconsumption .
Announcing the three - year aid package , Aso said Asian countries could lead the world out of recession through closer economic cooperation .
" We will support Asian countries by mobilising funds , " said Aso told delegates in Davos .
" I 'm convinced that deepening cooperation within the Asian region would lead to a recovery in the global economy . "
But Aso warned that stable economic growth could only be achieved if the U.S. curbed overconsumption and urged countries to reduce their dependency on overseas exports .
" To get the world economy on a stable growth path again , it is necessary to correct excessive consumption in the United States , as well as global imbalance coming from insufficient domestic demand of various countries , especially those with trade surpluses , " Aso said .
" In order to put the world economy back onto a stable growth trajectory , one imperative is correcting the global imbalance that has arisen from overconsumption in the United States and insufficient internal demand in other countries , " Aso said .
Aso also called on leaders to work together on agreeing urgent new measures to tackle global warming , warning that November 's environment summit in Copenhagen would be " make or break . "
" We are at a crossroads of a very , very historical nature , " Aso said .
" Let 's put strong pressure on each other for the completion of the Copenhagen process . "
Aso also pledged to announce details in the summer of how Japan planned to reach its target of cutting carbon emissions by up to 80 percent by 2050 and said the country could play a leading role in the development of greener technologies .
" We are in an age of pessimism .
Some will go on to say that with the economy going downhill , it will be difficult for the international community to tackle climate change as it will generate little money , " Aso said .
" Nothing could be further from the truth ...
I am a big believed that we can both grow and emit less with the help of the technologies new and still untapped . "
Sometimes in a web app , you 'll want to load a script externally .
The only problem is if you need to reference something within the external library , which you should only do once it 's definitely loaded .
Here 's a tip that works with all browsers to ensure the script is loaded before running your dependant code .
READER DISCOUNTSave $ 50 on terminal .

I 've published 38 videos for new developers , designers , UX , UI , product owners and anyone who needs to conquer the command line today .
$ 49 - only from this link
Here 's the JavaScript code to load the external library with a callback passed in :
function loadExtScript ( src , callback ) { var s = document.createElement (' script ' ) ; s.src = src ; document.body.appendChild(s ) ; // if loaded ... call the callback }
Firefox allows you to listen for the onload event on the script element :
s.onload = callback ;
With Internet Explorer you can wait for a state change on the script element :
s.onreadystatechange = function ( ) { if ( this.readyState != " loaded " ) return ; callback.call( ) ; }
The problem comes with Safari - there 's no event change for Safari , so we can't tell when the script has loaded .
This is the solution I came up with ( and this solution should also work with Opera ) :
function loadExtScript ( src , test , callback ) { var s = document.createElement (' script ' ) ; s.src = src ; document.body.appendChild(s ) ; var callbackTimer = setInterval ( function ( ) { var call = false ; try { call = test.call( ) ; } catch ( e ) {} if ( call ) { clearInterval ( callbackTimer ) ; callback.call( ) ; } } , 100 ) ; }
The function takes a test as a parameter .
Since you are the designer of the app , you 'll know what successful test is .
Once this test is true , it will execute the callback .
A simple test could be to check whether a function exists , for example :

Recently my local LUG ( LILUG ) invited Eric S. Raymond ( ESR ) to come and speak .
For those of you who are not familiar with ESR , he is one of the three largest icons of the Open Source / Free Software movement .
Needless to say , it was an honor so see him speak .
For the most part , his talk was quite tame but one of the points he raised seemed quite controversial .
According to him the GPL and other viral licenses are no longer needed as they do more harm than good to the community .
I do n't want to put words into his mouth so I 've transcribed what he said during the talk .
You can view the ESR Q/ A talk in its entirety , this specific excerpt is about 45 minutes into the video .
What is the point of being famous and respected if you can't speak heresy about your own movement .
What is the point ?
One of my heretical opinions is that we worry way too much about licensing .
And in particular ; I do n't think we really need reciprocal licensing .
I do n't think we need licenses like the GPL , that punish people for taking code closed - source .
Let me explain what I think .
And then I 'll explain [ why ] the fact we do n't actually need those [ licenses ] matters .
I do n't think we need them because .
There has been a fair amount of economic analysis done in the last 10 years , significant amount of it has been done by , well , me .
Which seems to demonstrate that open source is what the economist call a more efficient mode of production use , superior mode of production .
You get better investment , better return out of the resources you invested by doing open source development than closed source development .
In particular , there have been a number of occasions on which people have taken open source products that were reasonable successful , and just taken them closed .
Effectively putting them under proprietary control , proprietary licensing and then tried to make a business model out of that .
They generally fail .
And the reason they fail is pretty simple .
That is because when you take a product closed , you are now limited to what ever small number of developers that your corporation can afford to hire .
The open source community that you just turned your back on does not , they have more people than you .
They can put out releases more frequently , getting more user feedback .
So the suggestion is , simply because of the numerical dynamics of the process : taking open software closed is something that the market is going to punish .
You are going to lose .
The inefficiencies inherent in closed source development are eventually going to ambush you , going to [ inaudible ] you , and your are not going to have a business model or product anymore .
We 've seen this happened number of times .
But now , lets look at the implications of taking this seriously .
The question I found myself asking is : if the market punished people for taking open source closed , then why do our licenses need to punish people for taking open source closed ?
That is why I do n't think you really need GPL or a reciprocal licenses anymore .
It is attempting to prevent the behavior that the market punishes anyway .
That attempt has a downside , the downside is that people , especially lawyers , especially corporate bosses look at the GPL and experience fear .
Fear that all of their corporate secrets , business knowledge , and special sauce will suddenly be everted to the outside world by some inadvertent slip by some internal code .
I think that fear is now costing us more than the threat of [ inaudible ] .
And that is why I do n't we need the GPL anymore .
-- Eric S. Raymond
Eric then went on to say that the BSD license is a good alternative to the GPL .
This has sparked a heated discussion on the Free Software Round Table ( FSRT ) radio shows mailing list .
While one can admire of the simplicity and clarity of the license it seems far fetched to say that it should be replacing the GPL .
While yes there are economical incentive for corporations to keep code Open Source but the relative cost of closing the source depends largely on the size of company .
Yes some small companies will not be able to afford to keep a code base alive with internal / contracted developers for larger companies the costs are a lot easier to digest .
Prime example of such a large company is Apple .
In 2001 Apple came out with a completely new version of its operating system , MAC OS X .
Although a successor to MAC OS 9 , it was very different .
OS X borrowed a very large code base from the BSDs , and some ( pretty much everything but Darwin ) of the code was effectively closed .
This has not prevented Apple or OS X from thriving .
From the other end of the spectrum , are the companies such as MySQL AB which produce Free Software but also sell closed source licenses of the same code for a ' living . '
There is a market for this , it exists because of those scared lawyers and corporate bosses .
Killing the GPL would effectively kill this market , as a result development on some of these projects would slow down significantly .
The Open Source / Free Software movement is thriving , it does not mean its a good time to kill the GPL .
In fact I do n't think there will ever be a time when killing the GPL will do more good than harm .
Anyone who doubted the determination of South Africa to beat England to the prize of hosting this year 's Indian Premier League was left in little doubt yesterday as the country 's government joined its cricket community in enthusiastically welcoming the idea .
The feeling appeared mutual after the arrival of the IPL commissioner , Lalit Modi , in Johannesburg and his proclamation that South Africa was the " preferred venue " ahead of England .
The fact that rain is inevitable in England during April and May – and that South Africa 's weather is at its most predictable during that time – is an obvious consideration but there are two even more important factors which Modi and his cohorts must consider : cost and logistical " ease " .
The price of television and transport , not to mention accommodation and security , are less than half what they would be for the tournament to be held in England .
But it is the support of the South African government that may persuade Modi and his colleagues to relocate to the Republic .
The enormity of the operation would make it impossible to organise without ministerial support and when Cricket South Africa sent a representative to the department of Home Affairs to inquire about the possibility of getting about 1,000 visas issued rather more speedily than the usual 10 days the answer was " yes " .
" The opportunity to host the tournament has been put to us by [ CSA chief executive ] Gerald Majola and anybody would want to take this opportunity , " said Cassim Docrat , chief executive of KwaZulu Natal Dolphins based in Durban .
" We 're heading into winter now and our grounds are available , so there 's no awkward situation around timing .
It would be like anybody coming to me and saying they want to hire the ground .
Yes , of course we would like to have it , there are lots of positives and , from our point of view , no negatives .
" In terms of our preparation for the next season , it does n't affect us at all .
In fact , it 's perfect timing for us , it 's like an extension of the current season .
And I am absolutely convinced that getting big crowds wo n't be a problem either .
When we hosted the Twenty20 World Cup here , it was at the same time as the Currie Cup rugby semi-finals and finals , but we still had big crowds , " said Docrat .
Andre Odendaal , the Cape Cobras chief executive , was licking his lips at the prospect of matches at Newlands in Cape Town – and the money it would bring his struggling union .
" A franchise hosting the tournament would get seven games before the semi-finals and final and obviously there would be a pretty solid staging fee , " Odendaal told the Hindustan Times .
" But it also gives us the opportunity to develop relations with an Indian franchise and that could be important in these days .
There are absolutely no drawbacks for us .
In fact it 's a huge sign of confidence in South African administrators and infrastructure .
We know how to do these international events , we 've held several of them very successfully .
" April and May is also a perfect time in Cape Town , it 's probably when the weather is at its calmest .
It gives us an extra window to showcase our stadium and to give more cricket to our supporters . "
There is still good reason to speculate that Modi is calling the Indian government 's bluff in the belief that the potential loss of revenue and jobs would lead to them reviewing their assertion that security resources would be too stretched with federal elections and IPL running concurrently .
But when Johannesburg 's premier hotel for sporting teams , the Sandton Sun and Towers , confirmed last night that four IPL executives had reserved rooms for two months – starting today – it appeared clear that the " bluff " was one they were prepared to carry out .
Seven South African provincial chief executives were consulted last Friday on the feasibility of staging the tournament , 24 hours before the CSA chief executive Majola issued a statement denying all knowledge of the IPL 's approach , and they were unanimous in support for each other and confidence in their ability to get the job done .
Everybody from the SA players ' association to the national Tourism Board has also thrown their weight behind the tournament being staged in South Africa .
The only difficulty the country may face should Modi choose South Africa would be finding enough red carpet to roll out .

The pup was instantly hooked and has been having two feeds a day for the past week .
Ms Tumanako said she would probably wean the puppy off in six weeks time .
Her baby , Honey Pauline Philomina Flo , was born on August 29 and is now on bottled milk .
" I wanted to raise it ( the pup ) with my baby , " Ms Tumanako said today .
" I wanted to bring it up with a baby .
It will protect her as they grow up . "
The pup came from a litter of 10 .
" He drinks more than the baby .
It does n't hurt , but it 's a little bit ticklish , " she said .
Ms Tumanako who is two months pregnant , said she did not care what people thought about her breastfeeding the pup .
" It 's my life , my responsibility .
I make my own choices , " she said .
" I 'm going to look after me , my baby and my puppy . "
Hastings veterinarian Sharon Marshall said it was uncommon , but not unheard of , for one species to provide milk to another .
" But from a veterinarian viewpoint it 's always better for any species to have its own milk .
If a bitch was available that would have been better , " Ms Marshall said .
She knew of instances where a sow had given milk to puppies and dogs giving milk to cats , but had not heard of a human breastfeeding another species .
" It 's not going to hurt the puppy .
I would be more concerned for hygiene issues for any baby sharing the milk , " she said .
Victoria University associate professor of anthropology Jeff Sissons said he was familiar with a practice among women from Papua New Guinea hill tribes who breastfed pigs , but he had not heard of any other instance of a human breastfeeding another species .
The national president for the SPCA ( Society of Prevention of Cruelty ) , Peter Mason , said there was nothing in the Animal Welfare
Act that applied specifically to a case like this , but he had some concerns that the dog could develop long - term behavioural issues .
" It does n't sound like the animal is suffering .
It 's not a cruelty thing as such , " Mr Mason said .
The director of La Leche League , a support organisation for breastfeeding mothers , Rosemary Gordon , said she had heard of anecdotal cases involving mothers giving their milk to household pets or sick or elderly relatives , but she felt the matter was " beyond the league 's area of expertise " .

Introduction
We all know that Intel has a reputation for making stable motherboards .
We also know that the company is two years into a long - range effort to make itself a top player in the enthusiast board space .
Balancing stability with breakneck speed is no small task , and hardly anyone knows the lengths to which Intel goes in designing and redesigning components .
Here at the Hawthorn Farms campus in Hillsboro , Oregon , a fleet of Intel teams and engineers pore over practically every aspect of motherboard design .
When you check out a shiny new Smackover board , the number of man-hours devoted to making that board ’s engineering as close to perfection as possible is staggering .
Intel invited Tom ’s Hardware to take a rare look within the Hawthorn Farms facilites and show the world just what work goes into an Intel motherboard .
Only a few months ago , we and every other press outlet were forbidden from setting foot past the lobby metal detector with a camera .
So walk with us a bit and get a glimpse of the R&D fueling an Intel - based PC .
RF Testing Chamber
If you worry that your cell phone ’s emissions might be baking your brain , you ’ll love our first stop on Intel ’s tour .
This chamber is for testing PC radio wave emissions .
Tests are done with both open - and closed - chassis scenarios .
Such testing is required for FCC and CE mark approvals , required for electronic equipment in the U.S. and European Union , respectively .
Just to be safe , Intel expects its platforms to surpass FCC specs by 4 dB .
More Emissions Testing
With this bad boy in your back yard , over - the - air HD channel reception should be a snap , no ?
OK , maybe not .
This particular antenna tests emissions from 32 MHz to 2 GHz .
Intel also uses a horn antenna able to test up to 18 GHz .
The distance from antenna to system in this setup is three meters .
Peripheral Testing
What self - respecting enthusiast does n’t work or play without a barrage of peripherals ?
If you ’re going to assess real - world emissions , you ’ve got to bring on the phat 5.1 audio , a couple of gaming controllers , and a few dozen external hard drives .
Interestingly , this test system was running a beta version of a refreshed Smackover — one of the first motherboards ever manufactured with zero halogens .
Next Stop : Acoustic Testing
Next door , we have the acoustic testing room .
With the door shut , the background noise level in the room drops to only 20 dB , giving the space an otherworldly , claustrophobic feel .
An array of 10 microphones forms a sort of hemispheric dome around a test chamber positioned in the rooms exact center .
Each mic is exactly one meter from this center .
Intel engineer John Blair explained to us that up until about 10 years ago , most acoustic measurements were done for sound pressure , which measures a pressure disturbance in the air influenced by the strength of the source as well as environmental elements , including the distance from the source to the receiver .
One fan manufacturer might report a product having a sound pressure of 30 dB at one meter .
A competitor might report a sound pressure of 29 dB but conveniently neglect to mention that testing was done at a distance of two meters .
This is why much modern testing is done for sound power , which is an absolute value of acoustic energy emitted by a source independent of environmental factors .
However , measuring sound power requires a microphone array similar to the setup you see here .
A Little Acoustic R&D
The chamber shown here is used in measuring fan noise , as in a laptop or small PC .
The gear includes an automated slide able to put various back pressure levels on the fan .
This variable is then assessed with sound pressure measurements and airflow CFM ( cubic feet per minute ) .
With all of this analyzed together , engineers can work to optimize fan speeds for any given product .
They can also conduct R&D for helping to develop new acoustic techniques , such as putting sheet metal around a laptop fan to help dampen noise output .
Replicating Human Ears
Sound pressure and sound power will only get you so far .
They ’re physical measurements , like temperature or electrical voltage , in a field that is often subjective .
The human ear discerns some frequencies at louder levels than others .
“ Sound quality ” is a third measurement that adjusts for these louder levels while also looking at values like tonality , sharpness , and roughness .
Intel ’s acoustic head system measures sound quality in much the same way as your own ears would .
Not shown here is the plastic bracket used to position the head an exact distance from the notebook .
We should n’t convey that the acoustic room is all about fan noise .
The findings made here can affect even the fundamental construction of a motherboard .
On one case , designers had optimized a certain arrangement of resistors and capacitors on a motherboard for a given power situation .
However , the signals flowed through the motherboard in just such a way that they caused the mother board to audibly vibrate — and thus required engineers to rework the board .
A similar example is what Intel engineers sometimes call “ singing inductors . ”
As you overclock and apply more power to inductors , they have a tendency to vibrate , sometimes audibly .
Engineers such as John Blair spot these weaknesses during their tests and often work with parts vendors to find better insulating materials that wo n’t exhibit such flaws .
Extreme Environmental Testing
These Thermotron behemoths are environmental stress chambers for measuring performance under extreme temperature and humidity conditions .
Each chamber measures 1.7 cubic meters , or 4 ' x 4 ' x 4 ' .
Humidity can range from 20 % to a sopping 95 % while temperatures can span from - 73 ̊ C to +177 ̊ C.
As points of reference , the lowest natural temperature ever recorded on Earth was - 89 ̊ C , and at 177̊ C , you could cook a pot roast .
Speaking of which , considering bringing a lunch when you juice up the Thermotron , because its top temperature ramp rate is only 5 ̊ C per minute .
In any case , designing a motherboard to run in a balmy Oregon afternoon is easy compared to having one sure to not fail in the icy Arctic depths or the sweaty interior of Ecuador .
Punishing Computer Hardware
Welcome to the shock and vibe room , hosted by dynamics process engineer Mike Williams .
The point of this area is to test motherboards and see how much physical punishment they can take .
If you ’ve ever dropped a notebook from a table , accidentally kicked over a tower , or ( shudder ) shipped a system during the holidays , this is the room that helps to make sure your precious PC still works after the fact .
Believe it or not , this monster before you is about 25 years old .
It ’s essentially a giant , monophonic speaker .
The table head weighs 400 pounds , and the platform can push with about 6,000 pounds of thrust , yielding about 20 to 25 G. Williams recalls visiting a similar machine at a facility in China and watching six men muscle the head across the room .
This is why Intel installed a crane over the device .
The black tube visible on the right wends up to a three - horsepower blower on the roof that sucks air through the speaker coil to keep it cool .
There ’s a similar machine in an adjacent room with about twice the capacity , although both machines serve equally well for their task .
Surviving Shipping
This shock and vibe machine is designed to test unboxed motherboards and examine how well they would survive being shipped in a chassis down gravel roads or over speed bumps .
The victim mounts to a roughly one - inch thick plate dotted with ATX standoffs .
The plate , in turn , mounts to the table head via a grid of screw holes .
The motherboard vibrates for 60 minutes per axis of movement , and one hour of vibration is equivalent to about 1,000 miles in a truck .
After all , no amount of electrical analysis and acoustic testing will matter if the board is busted when it reaches you .
No industry standard exists for shock and vibe testing on motherboards , but research from this room at Intel often migrates into industry design guides .
Shock and vibe does n’t merely look to see if traces will crack .
You ’ve may have noticed how capacitors are the most weakly mounted component on a motherboard .
Wiggle one with your fingers a few dozen times and it will probably snap off .
Shock and vibe can exert similar pressures on these components — so much so that Williams admits to seeing a machine on another site that could n’t have its head removed because each hole in the table was filled with up to 10 capacitors .
Similarly , it ’s machines like this that exposed the weaknesses of the Z - clips that used to hold down heatsinks on components like northbridge chips .
If you pulled on those heatsinks , the Z - clip would give a bit , and you could actually pull the heatsink away from the chip surface .
Well , vibration could bounce the heatsink off the chip , and when the clip pulled the heatsink back , it would slam into the chip ’s packaging .
Getting Hit With Gs
Of course , a motherboard is n’t much use if the stuff attached to it fails .
Check out this test chassis , which also sits atop
Intel ’s massive shock and vibe machine .
The shell weighs over 75 pounds .
A motherboard mounts into the case on ATX standoff points , and cards mount onto the motherboard just as they would in a regular PC .
The extreme thickness of the case serves to eliminate the flexibility you ’d find in a normal sheet metal case , although Williams says , “ If anything , it ’s not thick enough . ”
In this test setup , the chassis gets hit with 25 G and the installed card with 50 G .
Make sure you take the poll at the end of this article
You do n't have to be a pothead to see that the writing is on the wall , that the end of pot prohibition is near .
Neither Barack Obama or Michael Phelps are out in the streets protesting for the legalization of Marijuana use , but let 's face it , when the most gold medal winning human and the most popular president in decades both have cannabis use in their history , it 's hard to argue that weed is bad for you and will f*ck you up .
To the contrary , when ultra-achievers have a record of inhaling , it turns the whole " evil marijuana " narrative upside down .
( Image by Unknown Owner ) Details DMCA
The massive coverage being given to Michael Phelps bong photo , the continued sponsorship by most of his sponsors , the election of confessed inhaler Barack Obama -- these add up to a change in the weather when it comes to the national conversation about marijuana criminalization .
and actually , Obama has advocated for the decriminalization of maryjane .
The mainstream media is totally ignoring it , but the buzz on twitter and in the blogosphere is growing .
The hypocrisy , the bigotry and racism , the insane societal costs of criminalization are all adding up to the time being ripe for a major change in the archaic laws that Harry Anslinger , the nutcase from the 30's through 50's who sold the story of the " evils of marijuana " scared American into passing .
Now , one can easily argue that making ganja illegal exposes USERS to pushers selling harder drugs .
One can argue that we are spending billions surveiling , arresting , prosecuting and incarcerating mostly minority users and small time dealers -- engaging in marijuana prohibition not unlike the alcohol prohibition that preceded the last great depression .
Some will argue that Phelps and Obama have set terrible examples by inhaling .
But the truth is , it is far more terrible to destroy the lives of millions of mostly black and latino and teen smokers .
Maybe it 's time .
No .
It is definitely time to re-visit marijuana laws .
If weed was legalized and sold like alcohol and tobacco , we'd go from spending tens of billions on criminalizing it to creating an industry that would create at least a million jobs .
Think about it .
At least 40 % of Americans have reported using marijuana .
If just 5 % of them were to use it legally on a regular to occasional basis , that would be 15 million users .
The jobs created would entail growing , processing , packaging branding , advertising , retailing and then there would be those luscious state and even federal and municipal taxes .
I can't imagine the industry being less than $ 3 billion a year , and probably , it would be a lot more , closer to $ 15 - $ 20 billion .
Sure , states could maintain laws against it , but they would probably , to enjoy the taxes , quickly get on the Bong Bandwagon .
And if federal legislation included taxes that would help pay for the bailout AND create a million or more jobs -- well , it 's hard to imagine Barack who inhaled Obama vetoing such a bill .
Frankly , it may start with opening up medical marijuana access , then decriminalization , like Massachusetts recently passed .
And Michael Phelps ?
Screw Kellogs .
I guarantee you the liquor , music and entertainment companies that will probably get into the business will jump to offer him hookah - tastic sponsorship offers .

Counterfeit Money , Payrolls , and Banks
by John Pasden in personal
I received this e-mail from a reader recently :
I just read your piece on counterfeit money .
I work for a school in a western province which paid me just before NY .
About one third was counterfeit money which I ’m having a tough time with , groceries to buy , transportation and so on ; nobody wants to take my money and school is n’t back in for another month .
My employer is out of the country and does n’t return my emails .
What to do with counterfeit money which he got from the bank himself ?
I was n’t sure how to answer this …
My first thought was that the employer was lying , and he did n’t really get it from the bank .
He might easily have bought a bunch of counterfeit bills himself , and cut all his employees ’ paychecks ( or maybe just certain ones ’ ) with them to save money on his payroll .
That said , I live in Shanghai , and I ’m not sure how things work in the “ western provinces . ”
The banks themselves could be mixed up in counterfeiting as well .
Does anyone have any experience ?

The impact of climate change on the Amazon rainforest could be much worse than previously predicted , new research suggests .
Even if emissions were reduced and governments managed to limit temperature rises to 2C – the current aim of international climate policy – between 20 and 40 per cent of the forest could die because of warming , a British scientist told a conference on climate change in Copenhagen yesterday .
Dr Chris Jones , of the Met Office 's Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research , said the Amazon may become " committed " to substantial change by rising temperatures long before any such change is apparent elsewhere .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The effect would be caused by the inertia of the Amazon 's ecosystem – a phenomenon by which changes take a long time to work through the system to their fullest .
This is already known to occur in the oceans , which is why sea level rise is expected to continue for centuries after any stabilisation of global warming .
The discovery that ecosystems can also be committed to large - scale changes means the danger to the natural world from the warming atmosphere may have been underestimated .
A 40 per cent loss of the Amazon rainforest , as well as being a disaster for wildlife and the people of the region , would make climate change worse because it would damage the region 's ability to act as a carbon " sink " , soaking up the main greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide .
The loss would be in addition to the losses presently caused by deforestation .
Dr Jones said : " Ecosystems do exhibit significant commitment to further change even after you 've stabilised the climate .
The Amazon forest will be committed to large - scale loss long before any is observable in the real world , so some kind of monitoring system to detect the first signs of Amazon dieback might actually be too late .
We need to understand the processes responsible before that . "
The computer model used to forecast forest losses showed that commitment to change came in at a temperature rise of about 1 C above the level existing before the industrial revolution in the 18th century .
Currently , global temperatures are about 0.75C above the pre-industrial level .
However , scientists believe that large amounts of carbon dioxide emitted in recent years have caused further warming of about 0.6C – meaning that the world is likely to warm at least 1.3C , even if all carbon emissions were stopped immediately .
Asked if this meant Amazon dieback had already started , Dr Jones responded that it probably had .
At 1.3C , the commitment to change is not great , but by C it rapidly leaps up to 20 and then 40 per cent loss of forest .
At 3C – where the computer simulation shows no dieback might yet be visible – the commitment is a 70 per cent loss of the forest .
Dr Jones said these changes could be reversible only over very long time scales – perhaps hundreds of years .
" On any kind of pragmatic time scale , I think we should see loss of the Amazon forest as irreversible , " he added .
Despite the long - term term threat of Amazon forest dieback , Vicky Pope , the Hadley Centre 's head of climate advice , said it was still important to try to continue to stop deforestation because it was leading to as much emissions being pumped into the atmosphere as the world 's transport sector .

Mr. McFarland , a third - generation cobbler , is riding a shoe - repair
boom .
Since mid-November , he has been juggling roughly 275 repair jobs
a week — about 50 % more than usual .
" I 'm so busy right now it 's
unbelievable , " he says .
Retail sales for shoes are down 3.2 % .
Loyal MR reader Michael Tofias suggests that perhaps The Snuggie is a countercyclical asset as well .
President Barack Obama promises health - care reform , but he has taken single - payer health care off the table .
Single - payer is the system that removes private insurance companies from the picture ; the government pays all the bills , but health - care delivery remains private .
People still get their choice of what doctor to go to and what hospital to use .
Single - payer reduces the administrative costs and removes the profit that insurance companies add to health - care delivery .
Single - payer solutions , however , get almost no space in the debate .
A study just released by Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting , a media watchdog group , found that in the week before Obama ’s health - care summit , of the hundreds of stories that appeared in major newspapers and on the networks , “ only five included the views of advocates of single - payer — none of which appeared on television . ”
Most opinion columns that mentioned single - payer were written by opponents .
Congress is considering H.R. 676 , “ Expanded and Improved Medicare for All , ” sponsored by John Conyers , D - Mich . , with 64 co-sponsors .
Yet even when Rep. Conyers directly asked Obama at a Congressional Black Caucus meeting if he could attend the White House health - care summit , he was not immediately invited .
Nor was any other advocate for single - payer health care .
Conyers had asked to bring Dr. Marcia Angell , the first woman editor in chief of The New England Journal of Medicine , the most prestigious medical journal in the country , and Dr. Quentin Young .
Young is perhaps the most well - known single - payer advocate in America .
He was Martin Luther King Jr. ’s doctor when King lived in Chicago .
“ My 15 - minute house calls would stretch into three hours , ” he told me .
But he came to know Barack Obama even better .
Though his medical partner was Obama ’s doctor , Young was his neighbor , friend and ally for decades .
“ Obama supported single - payer , gave speeches for it , ” he said .
This past weekend , hundreds turned out to honor the 85 - year - old Young , including the Illinois governor and three members of Congress , but the White House ’s response to Conyers ’ request that Young be included in the summit ?
A resounding no .
Perhaps because Obama personally knows how persuasive and committed Young is .
After much outcry , Conyers was invited .
Activist groups like Physicians for a National Health Program ( pnhp.org ) expressed outrage that no other single - payer advocate was to be among the 120 people at the summit .
Finally , the White House relented and invited Dr. Oliver Fein , president of PNHP .
Two people out of 120 .
Locked out of the debate , silenced by the media , single - payer advocates are taking action .
Russell Mokhiber , who writes and edits the Corporate Crime Reporter , has decided that the time has come to directly confront the problem of our broken health - care system .
He ’s going to the national meeting of the American Health Insurance Plans and is joining others in burning their health - insurance bills outside in protest .
Mokhiber told me , “ The insurance companies have no place in the health care of American people .
How are we going to beat these people ?
We have to start the direct confrontation . ”
Launching a new organization , Single Payer Action ( singlepayeraction.org ) , Mokhiber and others promise to take the issue to the insurance industry executives , the lobbyists and the members of Congress directly , in Washington , D.C. , and their home district offices .
Critical mass is building behind a single - payer system .
From Nobel Laureate in Economics Joseph Stiglitz , who told me , “ I ’ve reluctantly come to the view that it ’s the only alternative , ” to health - care providers themselves , who witness and endure the system ’s failure firsthand .
Geri Jenkins of the newly formed , 150,000 - nurses - strong United American Nurses - National Nurses Organizing Committee ( nnoc.net ) said : “ It is the only health - care - reform proposal that can work . …
We are currently pushing to have a genuine , honest policy debate , because we ’ll win … the health insurers will collapse under the weight of their own irrelevance . ”
Dr. Young has now been invited to a Senate meeting along with the “ usual suspects ” : health - insurance providers , Big Pharma and health - care - reform advocates .
I asked Young what he thought of the refrain coming from the White House , as well as from the leading senator on the issue , Max Baucus , that “ single - payer is off the table . ”
“ It ’s repulsive , ” sighed Young .
“ We are very angry . ”
But not discouraged .
I asked him what he thought about Burn Your Health Insurance Bill Day .
“ Things are heating up . ” he chuckled .
“ When things are happening that you have nothing to do with , you know it ’s a movement . ”

11:00 am - Dream : Blood from Sky
We should have watched the planet for a whole year before colonizing .
We could have stayed on the ship that much longer .
But everyone wanted to live on dirt again .
We needed it under our feet .
And the axial tilt was so minor , we did n't think there 'd be any seasonal differences through the year to worry about .
We did the basic tests .
Everything was plenty Earth - like , no new toxins , no unmanageable viruses , no dangerous ground fauna .
Most of the animal biosphere was in the high atmosphere , actually ; a wealth of high - altitude animal life .
We would have to hunt with ultralight aircraft if we wanted meat , but that would be fine , and we mostly intended to grow crops for sustenance .
So we de-orbited the ship .
What goes up must come down , but the reverse is not true : the ship , once landed , would never rise again .
Colony underway .
And it was great for a while - a nice , mild winter .
And then spring came , and we learned about the balloon flowers .
They were everywhere , big bulbous things that slowly inflated over the course of several weeks , whole fields of rubbery round colorful balls everywhere .
Millions of them .
And then , " spring " turned into " summer " - entirely imperceptible to us , but apparently not to the balloons .
Because suddenly , one morning , they all began to lift .
Their roots let go and they rose and rose and rose by their teeming millions , all on the same day , up and up and up in such great numbers that they blocked out the sun .
What were they doing ?
We caught a few to look at before they got away .
Curious , and a bit unnerving : the roots had changed .
Now they were writhing , razor - sharp things ... with a maw in the middle .
Almost took a few fingers off before we figured out how to handle them safely .
Strange .
What sort of life cycle was this ?
We found out the next morning , when the rain began : shortly after sunrise , dark red and surprisingly cold from its plummet from so high up .
Blood , enormous quantities , a mist at first and then sprinkling drops and then at last a true deluge .
Blood , uncountable gallons , tons of it .
The balloons , hyperactivated by the unfiltered sunlight at the top of the atmosphere , were attacking and killing all the billions of animals that lived up there .
Little gasbags with tentacles and teeth feeding , massacring , showering us with the offal of their feeding frenzy .
By afternoon , it had tapered off , and the night was sticky - dry .
But the next morning , a new shower .
And the third morning as well .
Each morning , reinvigorated , another hunt above the clouds .
Then , on the fourth morning , the balloons came back .
What goes up must come down .
Only now , they were no flowery little balls .
Swollen to many times their original size , their balloons torn asunder and reformed as chutes , they settled onto the ground ... and found us .
Their little grasping roots were meters long .
Mouth full of teeth .
They scuttled , they ran , they jumped .
It was morning , and they were very very active .
Millions of them .
I fled into the nosecone of the ship , trying not to hear the screaming behind me .
More blood .
Ours this time .
Perhaps elsewhere on the planet , where we were not , the balloons were feasting on each other , a final frenzy prior to mating or some other winner - take - all evolutionary function .
But we were new , easy prey .
I was lucky , I was already by the ship when they landed .
I ran into the nosecone and climbed up the ladder , hearing scrabbling tendrils right behind me .
I slammed the hatch shut : the observation lounge , the library .
On the trip out , you could sit in the nose of the ship looking at the rainbow color - shift of the stars ahead of us and read real books printed on paper - the one weight luxury that we had insisted on .
Now , I could look out and see ...
No . I would not look .
Pounding on the hatch , human hands and a human voice , but only for a moment : before I am forced to make a terrible choice between opening the hatch or remaining safe , there is a sudden shriek and thumping sound and they have been dragged away .
I sit on one of the soft chairs , unconcerned by how much blood is soaking into its fabric , ill to my core .
I will sit here and read .
I will read and read and read books until the sun goes down .
They 'll be calmer at night , right ?
Maybe I can get out and find some food at night .
Maybe they will be slow enough to outrun , at night .
Maybe they 'll be done with this part of their lifecycle before I die of thirst or hunger .
Maybe I can just sit here safely forever .
Maybe I will never move from this chair again .
Maybe I 'll just read this book for a bit .

[ See also [ AuthorName ] 's coda to this article : " More on the Expatriation Tax . " ]
In the past , the government was forced to show a modicum of restraint with respect to levying taxes for fear that citizens would simply leave the country and move to a more favorable location .
In fact , the threat of the citizenry emigrating en masse is arguably one of the most important checks on government power .
The American Jobs Creation Act , passed by a Republican House , Senate , and president , effectively removed this fear .
Republican politicians have adopted the role of loyal opposition and are feigning contempt for Obama 's proposed tax increases .
If they truly wanted to limit Obama 's power , they would restore the right of Americans to vote with their feet and their tax dollars .
The people 's mere ability to leave and take their tax dollars with them would be a major deterrent to tax increases , regardless of the number of people who actually elect to leave .
The American Jobs Creation act of 2004 , passed by the Republican - controlled government , amended section 877 of the Internal Revenue Code .
Under the new law , any individual who has a net worth of $ 2 million or an average income - tax liability of $ 127,000 who renounces his or her citizenship and leaves the country is automatically assumed to have done so for tax avoidance reasons and is subject to some rather unbelievable tax laws .
Any individual who is declared to have expatriated for tax reasons is forced to pay US income taxes on all US based income for 10 years following expatriation , regardless of the country in which the individual resides .
Additionally , in the 10 years following expatriation , if a qualifying individual spends 30 days in the United States during any year , he or she is taxed as a US citizen on all income derived from any place in the world .
To make matters worse , if an individual happens to die in a year in which he or she spent at least 30 days in the United States , the entire estate is subject to US income tax law .
Consider this scenario .
Mr. Smith 's net worth ( including his house ) is $ 2 million .
He decides that he is going to move to Naples , Italy because of an excellent job offer .
He officially expatriates on January 1 , 2009 .
During 2009 , Mr. Smith spends only 10 days in the United States .
He receives income from US sources totaling $ 80,000 in 2009 .
Mr. Smith must pay income taxes on that $ 80,000 but not on any money earned in Naples .
However , in 2010 , Mr. Smith 's mother is very sick and he visits her for a total of 30 days spread throughout the year .
Now Mr. Smith is forced to pay US taxes on all the money derived from the United States and from his job in Naples .
In 2019 , Mr. Smith returns to the United States for heart surgery after having already spent 30 days in the country .
Unfortunately , Mr. Smith dies during surgery .
Under the current law , Mr. Smith 's entire estate from both the United States and the rest of the world is subject to US tax law in 2019 .
Many of the people with whom I have discussed this rather dastardly legislation have not found it nearly as appalling as I do .
This utterly baffles me .
The actions taken by the government in this legislation are merely coercion , extortion , and theft writ large .
Consider if private companies were to begin to behave in a similar manner ; I doubt that the reaction would be as quiescent .
Consider if customers were to rent a car under the agreement that there would be a fixed charge per day .
Each day the individual uses the car , he or she incurs an agreed - upon daily rental fee .
Now suppose that the rental - car company is in a difficult financial position due to the CEO 's incompetence and excessive spending .
In order to stave off bankruptcy , the CEO decides to raise the daily rental rate for all of the luxury models .
After all , since customers who rent luxury models make more money , it is only fair that they pay more .
Additionally , the rental - car company decides to institute a new policy that requires all renters to continue to pay the daily rental fee for 10 days after they return their automobiles .
Since renters are effectively forced to continue to rent from the company , the CEO is now free to raise rates with impunity .
The fear of losing existing customers is destroyed .
The existing customer base is now essentially captive .
Word would soon spread that people who rent luxury cars from this company would be trapped indefinitely .
This would encourage new customers who desire to rent luxury cars to go to the company 's competitors .
With the rental - car company 's competitors getting all the new luxury - model customers , its revenues would grow far slower than its peers ' .
This would lead to an endless spiral of increasing rates on customers of different levels until all of the company 's renters are paying far more than customers of other companies and are receiving far less in return .
If Americans are unwilling to tolerate this type of behavior from corporations , why are we so willing to tolerate it from our government ?
Over the last eight years , the Republican Party has lost the public 's confidence and faith .
They now have an opportunity to regain a shred of credibility and attempt to restore their image as something more than a self - interested political machine , willing to do anything to obtain and maintain their power .
If Republicans truly have any genuine desire to limit the administration 's power in any way whatsoever , they will promptly demand the repeal of the American Jobs Creation Act .
The oft - used cliché in response to harsh criticisms of the country or its government is " If you do n't like it , you can leave . "
Republicans made it much more difficult for disgruntled citizens to follow this advice ; it is time to repeal this profligate legislation .

The following is based on a report by Cliff Kincaid , Accuracy in Media .
Elite members of the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) meeting in Davos , Switzerland , recently considered a proposal for a new global television network to usher in a state of “ global governance . ”
The concept strikes some as authoritarian , even totalitarian .
But the parent company of Fox News was one of the sponsors of this year 's gathering .
Is n’t it nice that we might have a TV network telling us “ who we are ? ”
And “ what we mean to each other ? ”
Perhaps we will learn that we are global citizens .
Perhaps a global leader of some sort will tell us that .
Who might that be ?
Also In This Edition
This proposal does n’t come from a fringe organization .
The WEF is an exclusive club of very rich and powerful people from around the world .
It describes itself as “ an independent international organization committed to improving the state of the world by engaging leaders in partnerships to shape global , regional and industry agendas . ”
This year ’s conference featured speeches by U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon and Chinese Premier We Jiabao .
Many U.S. corporations , including some getting Wall Street bailout money , were sponsors .
News Corporation , the parent of Fox News , was a “ strategic partner ” of the event .
Valerie Jarrett , Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Relations and Public Liaison , represented the Obama Administration at this year ’s event and called leaders from all nations to “ seize gladly ” the duties of collaborating and boldly embrace “ a new era of global financial responsibility . ”
But the WEF also envisions cooperation and collaboration in global media ventures .
It asks , “ How can we save journalism to help it save the world ? ”
Clearly , this is advocacy journalism on a global scale .
Indeed , the list of “ Recommendations ” says it is imperative to start “ Communicating a global agenda , and motivating and mobilizing people to support it … ”
Is this journalism ?
Or is it brainwashing and propaganda ?
It says that “ a genuine , global voice ” is needed that shares a “ fundamental commitment ” to being an international media voice , and makes mention of “ the media voices we think of as international ” coming from London ( the BBC ) , Qatar ( Al - Jazeera ) or Atlanta ( CNN ) .
BBC is known for its anti-American programming , Al - Jazeera for its pro-terrorist slant , and CNN for its left - wing and pro-Democratic bias .
It will take “ innovative public - private funding ” to bring this new network into being , apparently meaning that the taxpayers in the U.S. will have to be soaked in order to help bring this about .
But no price tag is put on the venture and no objection was apparently raised to government funding of such a network on a global basis .
An “ overview ” statement does , however , decry “ censorship and self - censorship . ”
Elsewhere in the report ( page 31 ) the idea of “ international taxation ” is proposed for “ global action ” of various kinds .
Perhaps this is a vehicle for raising revenue for the new “ global voice . ”
The media proposal was developed by one of several “ Global Agenda Councils ” under the auspices of the WEF .
The new TV network proposal was issued under the supervision of Pat Mitchell , the president of the Paley Center for Media and former President and Chief Executive Officer of the Public Broadcasting Service .
She was the chair of the Global Agenda Council on the Future of Media .
Other members of the Council on the Future of Media were Betsy Morgan of the left - wing Huffington Post ( former general manager of CBSNews.com ) ; Rui Chenggang of China Central Television , an official political propaganda arm of the communist regime ; and Zafar Siddiqi of CNBC Arabiya , a subsidiary of General Electric which is described as a 24 - hour Arabic language financial and business information channel .
There is no indication in the published report that the Huffington Post executive raised any objection to working hand - in - glove with the communist propaganda channel .
Is the Chinese media model a precedent for the new “ global network ? ”
The conference was covered by media organizations such as CNBC , CNN , Bloomberg , Forbes and Fox , but no coverage that we could find was devoted to the proposal for a government - financed global media network .
Talk about self - censorship !
John J. DeGioia , President of Georgetown University and the “ Rapporteur of the Global Agenda Councils focusing on Society and Values , ” summarized the work of Mitchell ’s panel .
He says ( page 46 ) that , “ We believe that this new moment also calls for a new media platform , across all media channels , a global non-profit ‘ CNN ’ providing a new form of independent journalism to inform , illuminate and deepen knowledge about issues that improve the state of the world . ”
According to DeGioia ’s biography , he walks the walk and is dedicated to helping “ prepare young people for leadership roles in the global community . ”
His bio adds , “ He is a member of the U.S. National Commission for UNESCO and Chair of its Education Committee and he represents Georgetown at the World Economic Forum and on the Council on Foreign Relations . ”
The media council took advantage of what a description of its work said was an “ enormous opportunity ” to “ redefine the media and its roles in a global , interconnected society . ”
Under the title of “ Recommendations ” ( page 182 ) , the Council on the Future of Media declares that “ The Council is championing a new global , independent news and information service whose role is to inform , educate and improve the state of the world ?
one that would take advantage of all platforms of content delivery from mobile to satellite and online to create a new global network . ”
It goes on , “ In a world where there are calls for global governance as a response to a global financial crisis , where scientific research , capital flows and production chains are globalized , the media and the communities in which we imagine ourselves remain fiercely localized . ”
Hence , a global network will work against “ localized ” or national - based systems and convince people to go “ global ” with their outlook and solutions .
In other words , the new network will help undermine old - fashioned notions of national sovereignty and patriotism .
There are 22 members ( page 183 ) of the Council on the Future of Media .
In addition to Mitchell and Morgan , American members include : Alex S. Jones , former media reporter for the New York Times and now Director , Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press , Politics and Public Policy , John F. Kennedy School of Government , Harvard University .
Susan King , former Washington correspondent for ABC News and now Director , Journalism Initiative , Special Initiatives and Strategy , Carnegie Corporation of New York .
John Lavine , Dean , Medill School of Journalism Northwestern University .
Nicholas Lemann , former Washington Post reporter and now Dean , School of Journalism , Columbia University .
David Nordfors , Director , Innovation Journalism and Senior Research Scholar , Stanford Center for Innovations in Learning , Stanford University .
Monroe Price , Director , Centre for Global Communications Studies , Annenberg School for Communication , the University of Pennsylvania .
Orville H. Schell , Director , Center on US - China Relations , Asia Society .
There does n’t appear to be one identifiable conservative member on the list .
Of course , everyone on the list is a certified objective media proessional , neither liberal nor conservative .
Just ask them .
COMMENT LETTER TO THE EDITOR
Comments Re DBB comment : " " .... What proof has the author provided that al - Jazeera is the ' terrorist ' network or that CNN has a ' pro- democratic bias ' or that the BBC is anti-American ? "
Yeah , that 's right .
And what proof does he have that the Earth revolves around the Sun ?
Douglas J. Bender 7:17 p.m. / Tuesday , February 17 , 2008
This is just more proof that were heading towards a " new world government " where the people have no rights and follow in a line right behind the brainwashed person in front .
People need to wake up and do just a little research .
Wake Up 10:00 a.m. / Sunday , February 15 , 2008
If you want to see an example of " brainwashing and propaganda " , you need look no further than this article .
Why is it comparing an internet blog , like Huffington 's to major TV news stations ?
What proof has the author provided that al Jazeera is the " terrorist " network or that CNN has a " pro-democratic bias " or that the BBC is anti-American ?
DBB 1:33 p.m. / Friday , February 13 , 2008 " BBC is known for its anti-American programming , Al - Jazeera for its pro-terrorist slant , and CNN for its left - wing and pro-Democratic bias . "
Propaganda coming from propaganda " questioners " .
I guess this means that alternative media has been right all along ... you ca n't trust corporate media .
That Guy 6:58 p.m. / Thursday , February 12 , 2008
Do n't forget your 're going to need a global police force to go with the global bank .
Then , will that be the " Ministry of Truth " network ?

All hail the New World Order !
Establishment , establishment , you always know what 's best !
Draconius 2:10 p.m. / Thursday , February 12 , 2008 The Globalist agenda is not ' liberal ' ; it is capitalist .
The Dem and Pub Parties both serve the globalist , elitist agenda .
If the globalists were truly ' Communist ' or ' Socialist ' they would n't be giving all our tax money to the gang bankers .
Gregory Fegel 11:43 a.m. / Thursday , February 12 , 2008
As if the globalists do n't have enough outlets , now they want directly into our living rooms ( at U.S. taxpayers ' expense ) .

Sent into a panic about space junk for the second time in as many weeks , the International Space Station has been forced to reposition to dodge a four - inch chunk of Chinese rocket .

Just before the Discovery docked , the ISS crew was forced to crawl into the Soyuz TMA - 13 in anticipation of a possible junk impact .
That threat passed , but just days later and with the crew of the Discovery present , another piece of space junk has threatened to punch a hole in NASA 's equipment and / or humans .
Advertisement
It bears repeating that this maneuver came in anticipation of possible junk impact .
That is to say the survival of the crew of the ISS depended on our ability to detect the position and velocity of a four - inch piece of metal ( or , as I suspect , a frozen , smiling Spacebat ) , which , by my calculations , makes the ISS about 5 % less fun .
Lasers are sounding more reasonable by the day .

The Lighter Side Of The Bombardment Of Gaza
The funny thing about the Israeli attack on Gaza following its long blockade is that Israel 's original justification for taking over Gaza in 1967 was that Israel was being subject to a blockade .
This is from the official Knesset history of the Six Day War :
Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser blockaded the Straits of Tiran on May 21st and 22nd to all shipping from and to Eilat ; the area was open to Israeli ships under UN supervision since 1957 , and Israel repeatedly stated that such a blockade will be considered as casus belli ( justification for acts of war ) .
Of course , there are many differences between the two situations .
Just for instance : ( 1 ) Israel could still receive shipments by water via the Mediterranean , and ( 2 ) Israelis are human beings , whereas Palestinians are wolves in human form .
In any case , I expect this provides Gaza residents with quite a chuckle as they ponder whether their wounded children will succumb first to their injuries or to their intestinal parasites caused by contaminated water .
THANK YOU , MEMORY HOLE :
As best as I can tell with Google News , no journalism has drawn this obvious parallel .

Well , due to popular demand , I 've now added autocompletion !
Autojump is a little tool I wrote that allows you to " jump " around your filesystem by maintaining a list of the directories you use the most .
To put it simply , if you wanted to go to a directory called " /home/john/documents/projects / DADVSI/legal " , you could type " j leg " or " j legal " or " j gal " or even " j VSI / leg " , and it would jump to the right directory .
Of course sometimes you might want to know where you 're jumping before you do the jump .
That 's why I added autocompletion , which makes the tool more convenient .
More details on the autojump on the wiki : http://wiki.github.com/joelthelion/autojump
And as always , installation is only a

Secret Chiefs 3 is an avant - garde group led by multi-instrumentalist / composer Trey Spruance ( formerly of Mr. Bungle and Faith No More ) .
Their studio recordings and tours have featured different line - ups , as the group performs a wide range of musical styles , mostly instrumental , including surf rock Persian , Arab , Indian electronic music , and various others .
The band 's name was inspired by the " Secret Chiefs " said to inspire and guide various esoteric and mystical groups , and is a reflection of Spruance 's interest in such philosophies .

IGF - I Also a Factor in Breast Cancer
The findings reinforce a sobering study published in May of 1998 in the medical journal Lancet .
This study , conducted by Susan Hankinson , Sc.D. , showed a strong relationship between IGF - I levels and breast cancer .
Thousands of women enrolled in the Harvard Nurses ' Health Study gave blood samples in 1989 and 1990 .
In 1998 , Dr. Hankinson�s team identified 397 of these women who had subsequently developed breast cancer .
Tests from the 1989 blood samples then revealed that those women with high IGF - I levels in their blood had up to 5 times the risk of developing breast cancer than those with low IGF - I concentrations .
If consumption of meat and dairy is associated with increased levels of free IGF - I in the bloodstream , as the new Oxford study appears to show , the public now has valuable information for combatting and helping prevent breast and prostate cancer -- eat a vegan diet .
Biotechnology and IGF - I During the late 20th Century , Monsanto Corporation introduced a substance which can be regularly injected into dairy cows in order to increase milk production .
Called Recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone ( rBGH ) , it also increases the amount of free IGF - I in milk from treated cows .
There is disagreement about whether the consumption by people of IGF - I found in cows ' milk , identical to human IGF - I , increases IGF - I levels in people , or whether protein found in cows ' milk is responsible .
But dairy product consumption has been shown to increase serum concentrations of insulin - like growth factor ( IGF - I ) .
Take Home Message Additional research should be conducted immediately using vegans in the US to compare against meat and dairy consumers .
It may be that the differences in IGF - I levels are even higher in the US than the UK , since Europe and Canda and other parts of the world have rejected the rBGH technology widely used in the US and deemed " safe " by FDA regulators using conclusions from Monsanto studies .
Meanwhile , there would appear ample evidence , for those concerned about breast and prostate cancer , to greatly reduce and elmininate meat and dairy products -- no matter what part of the world you live in .
After all , we can hear those ravenous cancer cells begging now to be fed so they can grow and spread , and here 's what they 're saying : " Got milk ? ! "

You simply cannot make this up .
I found a section of this priceless commentary from the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe via Marc Faber ’s latest newsletter ( hat tip reader Dean ) , and had to verify it .
The original provides an even richer mine of material .
From the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe ( boldface theirs ) :
As Monetary Authorities , we have been humbled and have taken heart in the realization that some leading Central Banks , including those in the USA and the UK , are now not just talking of , but also actually implementing flexible and pragmatic central bank support programmes where these are deemed necessary in their National interests .
That is precisely the path that we began over 4 years ago in pursuit of our own national interest and we have not wavered on that critical path despite the untold misunderstanding , vilification and demonization we have endured from across the political divide .
Yet there are telling examples of the path we have …
For instance , when the USA economy was recently confronted by the devastating effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita , as well as the Iraq war , their Central Bank stepped in and injected life - boat schemes in the form of billions of dollars that were printed and pumped into the American economy .
Yves here .
The authorities here would counter that the Katrina - related stimulus was appropriate in light of the macro shock , while Zimbabwe has taken a good construct beyond the breaking point .
Billions , after all , are not a big deal in a $ 14 trillion economy .
A difference in degree is a difference in kind .
Back to the Reserve Bank :
…. the USA economy confronted a severe mortgage crisis …
The USA Central Bank again responded by injecting over US $ 160 billion between December , 2007 and March , 2008 ….
leading central banks in the global economy are bailing out troubled economic sectors to achieve macroeconomic and financial stability …. the Bank of England … providing a £ 50 billion lifeline to the UK ’s banking sector .
Here in Zimbabwe we had our near - bank failures a few years ago and we responded by providing the affected Banks with the Troubled Bank Fund ( TBF ) for which we were heavily criticized even by some multi-lateral institutions who today are silent when the Central Banks of UK and USA are going the same way and doing the same thing under very similar circumstances thereby continuing the unfortunate hypocrisy that what ’s good for goose is not good for the gander … .
As Monetary Authorities , we commend those of our peers , the world over , who have now seen the light on the need for the adoption of flexible and practical interventions and support to key sectors of the economy when faced with unusual circumstances .
The operating assumption behind US policy now is seeing the US situation as parallel to that of the US in the Depression , and taking the view , based on the fact that the US seemed to finally shake off the slump with the demands of wartime production and the unprecedented budget deficits that accompanied them .
But there were considerable worries in 1946 that the US would fall back into Depression .
The conventional view is that pent - up demand carried the US through , after a sharp but very short downturn in 1946 .
However , would this strategy have worked in a peacetime setting ?
The US also emerged from its slump to a world with a tremendous amount of industrial production destroyed by the war .
Thus , the US , whose problem in the late 1920s ( which did n’t look like a problem at the time ) was that it was a huge exporter , to the point where it sucked up so much gold as to be destabilizing to the financial system , could with 50 % of world GDP , revert to its preferred old role with less damaging side effects .
Had the rest of the world gone into wartime levels of stimulus along with the US , without the loss of productive capacity , would there ever have been an end of the beggar - thy - neighbor trade policies of the 1930s ?
International trade did n’t just fall , “ collapsed ” is not an uncommon characterization of the degree of contraction .
I am not saying my line of thinking is right , but the US remedy worked ( or appeared to work ) in a particular set of circumstances very different from the ones on offer ( we hope , at least , I do n’t think anyone outside the Rapture crowd would advocate another world war as a remedy to the slowdown ) .
Similarly , as we have said before , the US was a world - dominating exporter , as China is now , and had the biggest gold reserves , as China now had the largest FX reserves .
Thus it is China that needs to undergo a huge - scale stimulus program to make up for the loss of demand from the US .
Keynes , in the 1930s , advocated that the US make up for the demand loss rather than expecting the US ’s overindebted European trade partners to continue overconsuming .
( Note that China ’s recently announced $ 500 billion plus stimulus package is less than meets the eye .
Analysts have estimated that 1/3 , some say as little as 1/6 , is spending not already planned , and most of that occurs in the second year of this two - year program ) .
Yet what is being advocated as a Keynesian remedy is in fact the opposite of what Keynes called for in his day .
Keynes ’ prescription then would lead to a global rebalancing , with the US depending more on internally generated demand and less on its foreign partners ( who were defaulting on their government debt ) .
But if it were successfully deployed in the US now , it wold lead to a continuation , of our excessive consumption and China ’s underdevelopment of its internal demand .
So why do n’t we lean on China harder ?
A few quick thoughts :
1. China does not take well to being told what to do , particularly when we their biggest borrower is looking a tad wobbly and not a particularly good model of fiscal and economic management 2 . China becoming a consumer - led economy will not come about via a big stimulus program , no matter how much money is thrown at it .
This is a twenty - year transformation .
First , China ’s leaders are afraid of giving up its wage differential advantage , Workers would need to be paid a lot more to be able to consume more ( recall this was Henry Ford ’s great insight ” by paying factor workers well , he was creating buyers for his products ) .
I do n’t have a ready citation , but the wage share of China ’s economic expansion is very low .
Second , China needs much more extensive social safety nets for workers to be willing to save less .
With a one - child policy , no health care insurance , no unemployment or welfare , savings are the old good fallback .
Third , because of the great wage differential , China ’s present manufacturing capacity in many cases cannot easily be repurposed to make goods that would appeal to domestic workers ( even with China ’s low by Western standards capital intensity of manufacturing , production today in general is more specialized than in the 1930s .
Think of the long supply chains , for instance ) .
So having the US engage in stimulus instead is arguably a best - available option , but it looks perilously like a desperate attempt to create status quo ante , but with more debt and credit risk sitting on government balance sheets .
And those who would dispute the claims of Dr. G. Gono , chairman of the Zimbabwe Reserve Banks ’ claims of comradeship can also point to this factoid :
…. the monetary base … increased by 72 percent from September 10 to November 19 of this year .
We should also note that the money supply – whether measured by M1 or by MZM – has increased by less than 1 percent .
One can characterize this pattern as either that the Fed has done the right thing by combatting deleveraging or that the Fed is pushing on a string .
But either way , the assumption is that all of the central bank ’s efforts to pump prime will finally take hold and we ’ll get some good old fashioned reflation , and the Fed can mop up the excess liquidity .
But will it be able to move fast enough ?
How bad might the overshoot be ?
The Fed is presumably going to be reluctant to put the brakes on too quickly for fear of putting the economy back into a contraction , so the worry about inflation when the upswing kicks in , particularly with more countries on the stimulus program than in the 1930s , is not nuts .
Dr. Gono is glad to have company .
We can only hope that his comparison is erroneous .
There is a gaping hole – pun intended – in the English lexicon , and it has to do with that thing most commonly called a “ vagina . ”
While a penis is the male equivalent to a vagina , there is no female equivalent for dick .
Cock goes with pussy and purple headed yogurt slinger ( while nobody actually says this ) can hold it ’s own with the " c word . "
But there is no female match for dick .
This is a problem because you sound like an idiot talking about a vagina in casual conversation , since it ’s too formal .
But it ’s considered overkill to call it a pussy .
And just forget about using the dreaded " c word . "
And as for other words that people use ( i.e. beaver , twat , Palin ) let ’s be real .
If you ’re not saying these words in the halls of some fraternity , you just sound like a moron .
And if you are saying these words in the halls of some fraternity , then you 're totally awesome , brosef .
So , what is one to do ?
The only viable option is to create a new word .
A word that is not as sterile as vagina and not as sleazy as pussy , a word that flies off the tip of your tongue , like dick .
But the task of coming up with the word is not as easy as you might think .
I mean , just try to come up with some right now .
What did you think up ?
I just came up with dank hole , her madam , and thwackbox .
Truth be told , I am not particularly thrilled with any of these .
Maybe a name is the way to go ?
Dick is a name , so what about calling it a Charlene , or a Debbie Reynolds , or an Olga ?
Maybe a Thatcher .
That sounds good .
A Thatcher ?
Any takers ?
Okay .
So I have no idea what the word should be .
But I know there is someone out there who does .
So , if you have any suggestions , for the love of God , please post them below .
Seriously .
The sooner , the better , ‘ cause there ’s something I really want to tell my girlfriend about her thwackbox , and I only get one chance .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Abundant water from the Red Sea could replenish the shrinking Dead Sea if Jordan , Israel and the Palestinians decide to commission a tunnel north through the Jordanian desert from the Gulf of Aqaba .
Land formations near the Dead Sea are seen from the 2,000 - year - old fortress of Massada November 15 , 2008 .
Warnings continue that the Dead Sea is slowly but surely drying up , and could be gone completely in 50 years if no action is taken .
The water level is dropping at close to one metre ( three feet ) per year due to a sharp decrease in inflow from the Jordan and other rivers whose waters now irrigate fields .
Picture taken November 15 , 2008 .

The Red Sea - Dead Sea Water Conveyance project would supply the biggest desalination plant in the world , running on its own hydro-electric power and providing Jordan with enough water for the next 40 - 50 years .
Israel and the Palestinian West Bank would also benefit .
A decision on whether to go ahead could come by the end of next year and the likely cost would be in the region of 7 billion dollars .
“ The idea of linking the Red Sea and the Dead Sea was first suggested by a British military engineer in the 1880s .
That was for hydro - power .
But the drivers today are water supply and saving the Dead Sea , ” said engineer David Meehan , who leads the study team for French consultants Coyne et Bellier .
“ Technically and engineering - wise it was always going to be feasible , ” he told Reuters .
“ But there are some major issues that could determine its feasibility ultimately . ”
Three potential systems are being examined : a buried pipeline , a low - level tunnel all the way , and a higher - level tunnel - and - canal system .
Two new feasibility studies are being commissioned by the World Bank this month , acting for the “ beneficiary parties , ” Israel , Jordan and the Palestinian Authority .
If a tunnel is chosen , it would be about 7 - 8 meters in diameter .
Red Sea water would take about 3 - 4 days to flow 168 km ( 105 miles ) , relying entirely on gravity and dropping some 400 meters below sea level , to the lowest point on earth , where the Dead Sea is rapidly retreating .
Some estimates say it could more or less dry up in 50 years if no action is taken .
Its level is falling by about one meter ( three feet ) per year due to a sharp decrease in inflow from the Jordan and other rivers whose waters now irrigate fields and to Dead Sea chemical industry use by Israel and Jordan .
“ The level has fallen from 394 meters below sea level in the 1960s to 420 meters below sea level as of mid-2007 , ” said the World Bank .
The water surface area is down by a third , from 950 square kilometers to 637 -- about the size of Lake Geneva .

DIFFERENT PRIORITIES
The World Bank said arresting the decline to avert an environmental calamity , and slowly topping up the sea , is the main priority .
“ For Jordan it is a water - supply project , ” said Meehan .
“ While for Israel it has perhaps as much to do with regional politics .
For them , desalinating Mediterranean water is much more practical . ”
Nearly half of the 2 billion cubic meters of water flowing north each year through the system would be desalinated and made potable .
The brine would go into the Dead Sea , whose waters are 10 times more saline than the ocean .
The tunnel would be on Jordanian territory , following the line of the border with Israel .
Jordan and Egypt , Israel ’s next - door neighbor in the Gulf of Aqaba , are the only two Arab countries which have full relations with the Jewish state , and the project in an earlier incarnation was quickly dubbed the “ peace canal . ”
Meehan , who played an important role in the construction of Libya ’s “ great , man - made river project ” and other major infrastructure developments , said he “ ca n’t see the project being commissioned before 2020 . ”
But its feasibility could be established in a year to 18 months .
The main concerns are the effects on marine life in the Gulf of Aqaba of the extraction of such large volumes of water , the effects of that water mixing with the Dead Sea , and the funding of the project , said Meehan .
In addition , Israel has concerns about potential leakage polluting valuable freshwater aquifers in a desert region where it has developed world - leading techniques for cultivation , and “ environmentalists do n’t like the idea of canals which cut off wildlife migration . ”
The Palestinians have not even asked formally for a share of the desalinated water , he said , possibly because they do not want to prejudice their existing claims to mountain aquifers ” supplying the Israeli - occupied West Bank and the Jordan Valley .
“ None of these issues can be separated from politics , ” he said , although both Jordan and Israel say they could go it alone .
But that could involve a dispute in international law and funding would become scarce .
TURNING WHITE , THEN GREEN ?
The World Bank this month called for tenders on two additional studies to assess the main environmental , and oceanographic issues .
“ The outcome of mixing of these two water bodies over a time scale of decades is unknown and is difficult to model and predict , ” noted the bank ’s March 13 draft study preamble .
“ Clearly , the Dead Sea will change its composition and characteristics as they are known today or were in the past if it receives large volumes of water from the Red Sea . ”
Some environmentalist critics warn that tampering with nature on such an unprecedented scale could bring disaster : the Dead Sea mighty turn white as gypsum sediment precipitates , then green as microbial blooms flourish .
The studies should determine if these fears are justified .
They will also assess the “ do nothing ” option , modeling the Dead Sea of 2060 .
At a March 5 meeting in the sleepy Israeli Dead Sea resort of Ein Gedi , the beneficiary countries stated their continued support for the project “ and urged that it continue to be implemented on an accelerated basis . ”
Meehan said he had encountered a number of amusing suspicions in his meetings with locals along the projected routes , including a Jordanian who wondered if it was an Israeli plot to realize a Talmudic prophecy that “ one day fish will swim in the Dead Sea . ”
At present , there are only microbial forms of life in the famously buoyant waters , where visitors taking a dip can keep their newspapers intact as they read in the sun and float , high and dry .
The Scottish - born engineer said screening and filtration would remove marine life at the Gulf of Aqaba entry to the system , and treatment would remove tiny microbes at the desalination end , so the water entering the Dead Sea would be sterile .

Celebrities in the spotlight !
The full extent of state powers to detain people without charge , cover up Government errors , hold the DNA of the innocent and share personal data between public bodies has been revealed in a devastating analysis of the erosion of civil liberties in Britain over the past decade .
Almost 60 new powers contained in more than 25 Acts of Parliament have whittled away at freedoms and broken pledges set out in the Human Rights Act and Magna Carta , according to a new audit of laws introduced since Labour came to power in 1997 .
The dossier , compiled by the Convention on Modern Liberty , criticises police powers to detain terror suspects for 28 days without charge , new stop - and - search powers handed to police ( allowing them to stop people without reason at airports and other designated areas ) , and restrictions on the right of peaceful protest .
It is the first time such a picture of the erosion of rights under Labour has been published .
The rise in surveillance in Britain is also documented , including new laws allowing individuals to be electronically tagged , and the legal interception of letters , emails and phone calls .

Control orders , designed to confine terrorist suspects who have not been found guilty , are also cited .
The orders , created under the Prevention of Terrorism Act in 2005 , can include the power of house arrest and electronic tagging .
" The right to privacy has been eroded , perhaps permanently , by broad powers to intercept , collect , store and share our private information , " the dossier states .
The Coroners and Justice Bill , currently going through Parliament , is accused of seeking to hand the state the power to prevent embarrassing revelations of Government failure becoming public .
Coroners are currently able to criticise the Government and any of its agencies that cause a death .
But the Bill would hand the state new powers to suspend inquests , or force them into secret .
It would also allow Government agencies to share personal data .
David Davis , the Conservative MP who resigned as shadow home secretary and called a by - election to campaign against what he described as the Government 's growing attack on British liberties , said the measures cited in the report give hundreds of bodies the power to " snoop , spy and bug " on the public .
" It is a real , serious , systemic problem , " Mr Davis said .
" I can not believe it is happening .
It 's up to us to make sure it is stopped . "
Mr Davis said that he did not regret leaving his post as shadow Home Secretary to fight the cause " for a second " .
" We had to put a check on this process , dribbling away , salami slice by slice , " he said .
" And if I 'd found a cheaper way of doing it , I would have done it more cheaply . "
Henry Porter , one of the organisers of the Convention on Modern Liberty , said that there was " little doubt that there is a crisis of liberty in Britain " .

" We needed an account to show the legislative programme that swept away many centuries - old rights and transferred so much power from the individual to the state actually existed , " he said .
" We now have that evidence [ and can ] oppose what is happening to one of the world 's oldest democracies . "
A spokesman for the Home Office said that CCTV surveillance and the use of a DNA database were " essential crime - fighting tools " .
" The Government has been clear that where surveillance or data collection will impact on privacy they should only be used where it is necessary and proportionate , " he said .
" The key is to strike the right balance between privacy , protection and sharing of personal data . "

Calif . lawmaker sees potential $ 1.5 billion in marijuana taxes David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday March 19 , 2009
Print This Email This
It 's been said that many American trends , from fashion to music to governance , begin in California and move east .
If Tom Ammiano , a California state assemblyman from San Francisco , is correct in his assessment of potential tax revenues stemming from legalized marijuana , expect the debate to spread like a grassfire , so to speak .
Ammiano , who proposed legislation to legalize marijuana on Feb. 24 , told CNBC 's Melissa Francis on Thursday that the plant is the state 's " leading cash crop " and could easily generate $ 1.5 billion in tax revenue the first year , if not more .
The state 's assembly recently had to tackle a $ 40 billion budget shortfall , taking drastic measures under a declared state of " fiscal emergency . "
Ammiano said that advocacy agencies have credibly placed the annual value of marijuana sales in California at or above $ 14 billion .
" How exactly would it work ? " asked Francis .
" What percentage tax would you put on it and how would you regulate it ?
Who would you sell it to ? "
" ... It would probably be a retail situation on the order of how we do alcohol , " he said .
" Or , the state could have the outlets .
It looks like , with an excise tax of about five percent , and a sales tax , we would garner about $ 1.5 billion in taxes .
" The regulation would be on the order of nobody under 21 , you could n't drive under the influence .
We would also save a lot of money , according to the economists , on cost - effective law enforcement .
Right now , a lot of our law enforcement resources are spent on minor offenses , yet we have these terrible cartels that have infiltrated California , very violent . "
" This legislation would generate much needed revenue for the state , restrict access to only those over 21 , end the environmental damage to our public lands from illicit crops , and improve public safety by redirecting law enforcement efforts to more serious crimes , " said Ammiano in a statement after he introduced Assembly Bill 390 , the Marijuana Control , Regulation and Education Act .
" California has the opportunity to be the first state in the nation to enact a smart , responsible public policy for the control and regulation of marijuana . "
Ammiano described the bill as " a simple matter of fiscal common sense , " according to the San Francisco Weekly .
The bill would remove " all penalties under California law for the cultivation , transportation , sale , purchase , possession , and use of marijuana , natural THC and paraphernalia by persons over the age of 21 " ; would " prohibit local and state law enforcement officials from enforcing federal marijuana laws " ; and would create a $ 50 state fee for each ounce of marijuana sold , beyond whatever pot will cost once it becomes legal , the newspaper reported .
The leading legalization advocacy group behind Ammiano 's bill , Washington - based National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ( NORML ) , says recession is prompting otherwise skeptical state houses to revisit the ban on marijuana .
Over the last few months NORML has been drafted to work with state lawmakers -- even in conservative locales like Texas -- on budgetary analysis and review how legalization may enable governments fill yawning deficits .
" Cannabis for adult recreation , cannabis for medical use , cannabis as an industrial crop , and ( the drug 's ) related paraphernalia are extremely popular and should be taxed and properly regulated , " NORML executive director Allen St. Pierre told AFP .
" It 's just that simple . "
Ammiano's bill used the most conservative estimates from NORML 's analysis , and could realistically create a tax base of " up to 20 billion dollars per annum , " he said .
" What do you think are the odds , seriously , that something like this could go through ? " asked Francis .
" It looks good , in terms of the initial response , " said Ammiano .
" I 'm gonna stick with this issue for as long as it takes .
The lifespan of a bill coming to the floor , being voted on , is usually about a year .
I 'm gonna be here for at least six years .
" I think we 're gonna see something that 's very , very beneficial to California , not only in the idea of reforming drug policy , but also economically for us . "

Deployment That Just Works
Listen to this article
Last week I talked a bit about why instant deployment matters .
A few people have since commented that it ’s not instant deployment that matters to them , but rather deployment that just works every time .
Of course , what we ’re really talking about is both .
Part of achieving deployment that just works is decreasing complexity and removing steps – each a point of possible failure .
We are working toward deployment that ’s both instant and completely reliable , because we think those things are tightly linked .
We ’ve rolled out some new content today explaining more about how our platform works , including some more detailed architectural information .
We ’re hoping it will continue to build a better picture of the vision we ’re striving for .
I want to take some time here to explain some of the background behind this architecture .
Instant deployment that just works is , of course , a tall order .
In order to achieve it , there are several requisites :
1. A Sharp Focus on Web Apps
Provisioning is different for different types of apps – a video transcoding farm is very different from a web app .
The only way to make the process instant is to know what type of thing you ’re dealing with ahead of time .
This is achieved by only handling one type of thing ( Heroku , for example , only handles web apps , and even then , only those written in the ruby language ) .
2. Standardization of App Structure
Any time you want to plug and play , most of the work is centered around standardization .
Because all lamps have the same power plug and voltage requirements , you can move them around freely and plug them in anywhere .
Similarly , all apps need to be self - contained and have the same structure and environmental requirements .
A software framework like Ruby on Rails ( or even just Rack ) gets us most of the structure we need , but a lot of work remains in self - containment and standardization of environmental requirements .
3. A Dynamic Platform
Aside from standardized plugs and voltage , the reason you can plug a lamp in anywhere is that hidden behind the walls , there ’s a complex system of wiring , circuits , breakers , and transformers , which distribute power to the lamps evenly and only when needed , and prevent short circuits and other safety hazards .
If one lamp has a short , it wo n’t destroy the other lamps or your home .
Similarly , we need a platform architecture that can move apps around independently , start and stop them instantly , provide the standardized environment ( library dependencies , databases , caching , etc. ) , distribute compute power evenly , and prevent one greedy or malfunctioning app from damaging others .
4. On - Demand Provisioning of Underlying Infrastructure Resources
Lastly , no matter how many lamps you plug in ( within reason ) , you wo n’t run out of power .
The enormous capacity of electricity producers combined with a sophisticated grid of distribution and storage technologies ensure that power is available right when you need it .
This whole system works because you do n’t have to plug in a lamp and then wait for someone to turn on another generator somewhere .
This last requirement is non-trivial , and has historically been a major barrier to instant provisioning / deployment .
Thankfully it ’s available now , in the form of utility computing from services like Amazon ’s EC2 .
When compute power is needed , you can get it within seconds or minutes .
It ’s still not instant , but it ’s close enough that an efficient dynamic platform can hide this delay by maintaining standby capacity ( the same way batteries and capacitors hide the delay of a generator starting up on the electrical grid ) .
This is the real value of utility computing : it has the power to enable truly instant provisioning and deployment , by providing one of the four requisites .
Heroku ’s Architecture
We discovered the 4 requisites above as we built our platform , so our current architecture is designed specifically to address these issues .
Item 1 is embodied by our decision to specialize on Ruby - based web apps , and item 4 is simply available to us today for the first time .
Items 2 and 3 , however , deserve some explanation :
2. Standardization of App Structure
The overall structure of our platform is designed to standardize the web stack , vastly simplifying the deployment process and removing a lot of decisions you might have to make when designing and deploying an app .
Should we use memcached ?
It ’s already included .
What about static content ?
Do n’t worry about it – our high - performance HTTP cache will handle it automatically .
How many app servers should we run , and how many machines do we need for them ?
Just start with a few and change it instantly at any time , and never even think about how many servers they ’re running on .
We ’ve also settled on a standard app stack we call a dyno .
The way an app retrieves its configuration from the environment has also been standardized .
3. A Dynamic Platform
We ’ve done a huge amount of work on this over the last year , and our efforts have been focussed by the 25,000 apps now running on Heroku .
The routing mesh gives us the ability to easily move apps around , and to scale our resources independently of scaling an individual app .
The dyno grid lets us scale an app up , as well as distribute power evenly and route around problems .
This architecture let ’s you deploy via
Git by simply pushing your code to your app ’s Heroku repository .
We ’re actually “ compiling ” your app now as it ’s pushed ; performing integrity checks and verifying that it can start .
So did we get there ?
Have we achieved instant deployment ?
Well , we think we ’re getting pretty damn close .
Problem statement
Part of your team is hard at work developing a new feature in another branch .
They ’ve been working on the branch for several days now , and they ’ve been committing changes every hour or so .
Something comes up , and you need to add some of the code from that branch back into your mainline development branch .
( For this example , we ’ll assume mainline development occurs in the master branch . )
You ’re not ready to merge the entire feature branch into master just yet .
The code you need to grab is isolated to a handful of files , and those files do n’t yet exist in the master branch .
Buckets o’ fail
This seems like it should be a simple enough task , so we start rummaging through our Git toolbox looking for just the right instrument .
Idea , the first .
Is n’t this exactly what git cherry - pick is made for ?
Not so fast .
The team has made numerous commits to the files in question .
git cherry - pick wants to merge a commit - not a file - from one branch into another branch .
We do n’t want to have to track down all the commits related to these files .
We just want to grab these files in their current state in the feature branch and drop them into the master branch .
We could hunt down the last commit to each of these files and feed that information to git cherry - pick , but that still seems like more work than ought to be necessary .
Idea , the second .
How ‘ bout git merge -- interactive ?
Sorry .
That ’s not actually a thing .
You ’re thinking of git add -- interactive ( which wo n’t work for our purposes either ) .
Nice try though .
Idea , the third .
Maybe we can just merge the whole branch using -- squash , keep the files we want , and throw away the rest .
Um , yeah , that would work .
Eventually .
But we want to be done with this task in ten seconds , not ten minutes .
Idea , the fourth .
When in doubt , pull out the brute force approach ?
Surely we can just check out the feature branch , copy the files we need to a directory outside the repo , checkout the master branch , and then paste the files back in place .
Ouch !
Yeah .
Maybe , but I think we might have our Git license revoked if we resort to such a hack .
The simplest thing that could possibly work
As it turns out , we ’re trying too hard .
Our good friend git checkout is the right tool for the job .
git checkout source_branch < paths >...
We can simply give git checkout the name of the feature branch and the paths to the specific files that we want to add to our master branch .
$ git branch * master twitter_integration $ git checkout twitter_integration app / models / avatar.rb db/ migrate/20090223104419_create_avatars.rb test/unit/models/avatar_test.rb test/functional/models/avatar_test.rb

Notes
This story is part bug hunt , part open - source love - story .
The bug was a particularly gnarly , beautiful little bug and I 'm going to try to convey some of that to you .
But the other half of the story is really the thing here ;
The Guardian is serious about engaging with the wider technology community - while we work hard to open out our data to the world at large , we also participate by speaking at conferences , sponsoring events , and sometimes in the simplest way of all ; contributing code and fixes for the Open Source software that we use .
To tell you this story I 'll need to give you some background into the problem we were trying to solve - a problem of caching .
A computer uses a cache ( a chunk of memory ) to locally store information ( like a Guardian article , or a set of headlines ) that it would otherwise have to request from another system .
We use caches on our servers to speed up the Guardian website .
Our caches are much smaller than the set of data we 're attempting to serve to the public , and so spend all their time 100 % full - the least recently used data gets chucked out as new data from uncached articles gets chucked in .
Those uncached articles have to be loaded from the database , and on average every time someone hits a page on the Guardian site , we have to make about half a dozen requests to load data that is n't in the cache .
Given the popularity of the Guardian site , this means we 're making over a thousand database requests a second of our single database machine , which - if it were not for the fact that it's a massive box administered by a crack squad of elite Ninja DBAs - should have melted into an ill - smelling puddle a long time ago .
This precarious situation is only going to get worse as the Guardian continues to grow more popular and so we 've been working on making our caching much more effective - a first step on this road was to use a more flexible caching engine , namely JBoss Cache , which is a powerful caching solution released under the LGPL ( an Open Source licence that aims to encourage use of the software by as large an audience as possible - you can read the code , change the code , and redistribute it as you please ) .
After several weeks of development work , we had sown JBoss Cache into our development version of the Guardian website , and found that it performed well under quick 1 - hour stress tests .
Then we performed a long running soak test , starting on Friday afternoon .
We went home , came back on Monday morning , and found a graph like this :
Our cache fills up - and then mysteriously starts to empty ...
Oh dear .
Verrrrrry Bad .
The cache was , for some reason , getting smaller and smaller over time .
In our case , It Really Should n't Do That .
The cache - the cache we so desperately depend on to take load off the database - should stay 100 % full all the time .
If our cache starts to evaporate without explanation , well , that 's just not going to do anyone any good .
We investigated .
This part should be fun , but there are a lot of unknowns .
Are we doing something wrong ?
Is there something wrong with JBoss Cache ?
If so , why does n't everyone else see it ?
Yet in the face of these unknowns , we can do this .
JBoss Cache is Open Source - we can read the code .
The questions start :
The Cache is getting smaller .
Why ?
It thinks it 's full when it is n't , so it chucks stuff out of the cache when it does n't have to .
Why ?
Ah , interesting .
JBoss Cache decides to evict stuff based on the length of it's ' Eviction Queue ' , which is basically a list of every single thing that 's currently in the Cache .
If the list is longer than the maximum number of things we 've said we want in the Cache , JBoss Cache will chuck old items ( the oldest items are the ones at the front of the queue ...! ) until the list is back down to size .
But something 's gone wrong .
JBoss Cache is getting rid of stuff before the cache is full because the Eviction Queue list is a different length than the number of items in the cache :
It 's longer .
Why ?
There are items in the Eviction Queue which are not in the Cache .
Why ?
in the Cache .
Why ?
Ah .
Now you 're asking .
and so on
At this point , it really does look like there must be something wrong with JBoss Cache , so the temptation is to just raise a bug report with them and wait for them to fix it .
However , we do n't pay them any money , and they 're busy people - plus the bug report would be so vague as to be ignorable .
We made a simplified example of the problem to make investigating it easier , stripping out everything that was ' Guardian ' , and retaining the simplest possible code that still reproduced the issue .
This let us progress much more rapidly in our pursuit of the bug - and provided a simple demonstration that we could later show to JBoss .
Ultimately , the problem turned out to be a misunderstanding within the JBoss Cache code itself , and it was a pretty rare misunderstanding - it could only happen if we decided to remove an item from the cache at exactly the same time that JBoss Cache itself decided to evict it .
But provided that happened , in just the right order , you would get a situation where JBoss Cache would try to evict item X from the Cache - when in fact X was n't even in the cache any more , and had been removed an instant earlier .
The code would get confused , and think to itself :
" I was n't able to remove X from the Cache - it 's still there - keep it in the Eviction Queue ! "
That difference - the difference between not doing something and not being able to do it , was at the root of our problems .
The Eviction Queue list filled up with phantom items it thought were still there because it could n't get rid of them , and the number of items actually allowed to live in the Cache ended up far less .
The thing that made the bug so hard to find , and the reason no - one else
had noticed it , was that it only occurred when two things happened
simultaneously .
To see the bug you have to be evicting and removing
items all the time .
Our caches are so full that we are evicting things
out of them pretty much constantly - and we 're a news organization , so
we 're also explicitly removing out - of - date content with almost equal
frequency .
For the Guardian , it was certain we'd hit this bug like a
brick wall , but for other users of JBoss Cache the problem might not be
as immediately evident .
In a commercial closed - source product , a bug
that affected a minority of users in this way might never gain
attention , and could remain unfixed for months or even years .
With JBoss Cache , we had everything we needed to fix the bug ourselves .
We quickly wrote a patch for the code that straightened out the misunderstanding , and re-ran our soak test .
We saw a beautiful horizontal line - our caches stayed a hundred percent full , just the way they 're meant to .
HUZZAH !
The story does n't end there - though we had rid ourselves of the phantoms that haunted our cache , we still needed to get our fix accepted by JBoss so that they could incorporate it into later versions of JBoss Cache and pass the benefit of the fix on to other users .
We had no idea how soon JBoss would respond - would they even take the time to read the bug report ?
As it turns out , JBoss were outstanding .
No sooner had we filed the bug report than the issue was promptly elevated to ' Critical ' by JBoss , who thanked us for " excellent report and analysis " - and within 24 hours Manik Surtani , the Lead R&D Engineer on JBoss Cache , had released a new snapshot version of JBoss Cache containing our fix .
So there it is - the fairy tale really did come true .
Open Source did everything it 's meant to for us - let us understand our problems , and accepted our solutions - and we got to give back to the community .
Warren Buffett 's investment company has lost its top credit rating , in part because of its reliance on its 78 - year - old founder .
Fitch , the credit - rating agency , stripped Berkshire Hathaway of its AAA grade last night , citing risks stemming from derivatives holdings and Buffett 's role as chief investment officer .
The other two major credit - rating agencies , Standard & Poor 's and Moody 's , still rate Berkshire triple - A .
Buffett , the legendary US investor dubbed the Sage of Omaha , was knocked off top spot in the Forbes rich list this week by a resurgent Bill Gates .
He recently had to tell investors in his company that 2008 had been the worst year since he took the helm 44 years ago .
Fitch said that Buffett 's role as chief investment officer puts the company at risk if he becomes unable to do the job .
The agency cut the issuer default rating on Berkshire to AA + and senior unsecured debt to AA .
The insurance and reinsurance units kept their AAA status , but Fitch talked of a negative outlook for all divisions .
" Fitch views this risk as unrelated to Mr Buffett 's age , but rather Fitch 's belief that Berkshire 's record of outstanding long - term investment results and the company 's ability to identify and purchase attractive operating companies is intimately tied to Mr Buffett , " the agency said .
General Electric also suffered the indignity of seeing its credit rating downgraded yesterday .
It was relegated to AA + by Standard & Poor 's , after holding the top AAA rating for more than 60 years .
S&P said that GE was under " increasing earnings pressure , due to the recent sharp deterioration in general economic conditions around the globe " .
It has been a long , mostly disastrous road for Governor Schwarzenegger 's 2005 bill that sought to make selling games to minors a crime , as well as to require certain games to carry warning labels .
The bill was passed , but Judge Ronald Whyte issued a preliminary injunction against its enforcement before it impacted retail sales in California .
In 2007 the law was struck down as being unconstitutional , with Schwarzenegger promising to continue to appeal the decision .
Today that appeal was rejected , likely killing the law for good .
While this latest ruling could be appealed to the Supreme Court , the continued effort after these losses would seem almost Sisyphean ; the courts have never been kind to bills that seek to put special legislation on video games .
" Is there anything out of limits for the Legislature to prohibit to minors ?
What about games where people eat unhealthy foods and get fat ? " Judge Alex Kozinski asked when hearing the appeal .
" Why not a law targeting games that teach children bad living habits , such as eating unhealthy food or using plastic bags ? "
The studies used as evidence that games were dangerous — above and beyond other forms of media — were found to be unconvincing by the court .
Without any causal links , and with no such laws prohibiting minors from purchasing R- rated movies or even reading violent books , singling out video games creates Constitutional problems no lawyer has been able to argue through .
" We could n’t be happier .
Federal courts have found all nine legislative attempts to curtail the sale of violent video games invalid under the First Amendment , definitively showing that video games are protected speech , just like other content such as books , comic books , movies , and music , " Jennifer Mercurio , Director of Government Affairs for the Entertainment Consumers Association said .
This is just the latest in a long string of wins for the video game industry in the courts , as attacks on games have turned out to be long and expensive for the states .
The lesson still has n't been learned however , as Leland Yee , the author of the bill , has pledged to keep fighting .
" While I am deeply disappointed in today ’s ruling , we should not stop our efforts to assist parents in keeping these harmful video games out of the hands of children , " he said .
" I believe this law will inevitably be upheld as Constitutional by the US Supreme Court .
In fact , the high court recently agreed , in Roper v. Simmons ( 2005 ) , that we need to treat children differently in the eyes of the law due to brain development . "
It 's unclear what , if anything , the Supreme Court will find that the courts before it failed to notice .
AdaCore has released GNAT Pro 6.2 , the latest addition to its GNAT Pro Ada development environment .
The new release is now available on 18 native and 28 cross platforms .
It offers over 130 new features , including increased support for code coverage and source - to - object traceability , which are important for safety - critical and high - reliability application development .
As a general upgrade to the underlying technology , the GNAT Pro compiler back end is now based on GCC 4.3 , which brings improved code generation , and the debug engine is now based on GDB 6.8 , which provides better debugger performance .
Complementing these enhancements are specific features including a more efficient implementation of stack checks , overflow checks , and validity checks , and new attributes and pragmas for use with generics .
GNAT Pro 6.2 also includes features for associating pre- and post - conditions with subprograms and for selectively enabling or disabling groups of assertions .
Several existing tools have been enhanced .
As an example GNATcheck , a coding standard checker , now supports additional verification rules that are especially useful to teams developing high - reliability software .
GNAT Pro 6.2 has added two new tools -" the GNAT Ada Java Interfacing Suite ( GNAT AJIS ) and GNAT Components Collection ( GNATcoll ) .
GNAT AJIS allows users to combine natively compiled Ada code with Java applications that run on a Java Virtual Machine ( JVM ) , through the Java Native Interface ( JNI ) .
Using GNAT AJIS , Java code can call natively - compiled Ada , and Ada programs can call Java , in a type - safe manner and without the need for users to write low - level JNI - based " glue " code .
GNATcoll is a suite of reusable software components comprising packages that AdaCore developed for the implementation of the GNAT compiler and toolset but which are of general utility .
Also available with GNAT Pro 6.2 is GPS 4.3 , the latest version of AdaCore 's extensible GNAT Programming Studio Integrated Development Environment ( IDE ) .
Among other new features , GPS 4.3 allows use of multiple versions of the same toolchain , for example an older baselined version of the GNAT Pro compiler for code generation , and a newer version of the GNAT Pro technology for code browsing .
The redesigned builder module enables full customization , aiding development flexibility , and the improved documentation generator includes support for predefined and user - defined tags .
AdaCore is a provider of commercial software solutions for Ada , a modern programming language designed for large , long - lived applications where safety , security , and reliability are critical .
Anti-gun Land Bill On The Move — House Vote Expected This Week
Washington , DC – -( AmmoLand.com ) - Lost in all the news of the massive bailout bill that just passed the Senate is another enormous bill , one that increases federal control of public and private land .
Of particular concern to gun owners is that the bill , S. 22 , will greatly expand the amount of land controlled by the National Park Service .
NPS land is currently subject to a gun ban .
While President Bush took steps in the waning days of his presidency to reverse the ban , the new regulations apply to persons who carry a concealed firearm with a permit .
Non-permit holders and open carry are not explicitly addressed .
Another eyebrow - raising aspect of this bill is that it is actually a compilation of over 150 separate pieces of legislation that never passed out of Congress on their own merits .
Senator Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) successfully held up over 100 of these bills , until anti-gun Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid rolled all of the bills into one so - called Coburn Omnibus and forced it through the Senate in January on a vote of 73 - 21 .
As the House prepares to take up the bill , the Democrat leadership has taken procedural steps to ensure that the measure cannot be amended or altered in any way .
That means that if it passes the House , it goes right to President Obama 's desk , where it will be signed into law .
Here are a few of the more troubling aspects of the bill :
* It authorizes the federal government to buy private land adjacent to national parks and trails .
Such land would be controlled by the NPS , and thus be subject to the gun ban .
* The bill federalizes the Washington - Rochambeau Route , a 650 mile trail that stretches from Rhode Island to Virginia and includes sections of major thoroughfares such as Interstate 95 and U.S. Route 1 , and passes through cities like Boston and Philadelphia .
The entire trail would fall under the NPS and the gun ban .
* The National Landscape Conservation System groups together millions of acres of federal land and places it under one new umbrella agency .
The NLCS was created during the Clinton administration and run administratively since then .
S. 22 will codify the system , which raises concerns for hunters and sportsmen .
Much of this land is consolidated from the BLM and the Forest Service , which have always allowed hunting and recreational shooting .
It is unclear what rules will be promulgated by the new agency and if gun owners ' rights will be protected .
* S. 22 strips out small concessions won by pro-gunners in the House last year that would allow state and local law to govern firearms possession and hunting on certain land .
* S.22 allows for NO amendments .
Pro-gun members who want to offer an amendment to fully repeal the NPS gun ban are prevented from doing so by the anti-gun leadership .
The full House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on the bill this Wednesday or Thursday .
Unless the NPS gun ban is repealed and the rights of gun owners are protected , Gun Owners of America opposes the bill in its entirety .
ACTION : Please urge your Representative to repeal the NPS gun ban in S. 22 , or to vote against the entire bill .
You can go to the Gun Owners Legislative Action Center at http://capwiz.com/gunowners/home/ to send your Representative the pre-written e-mail message below .
— – Prewritten Letter — – Dear Representative : I urge you to oppose S. 22 , a bill that will greatly expand the amount of land controlled by the National Park Service ( NPS ) .
NPS land is currently subject to a gun ban .
While President Bush took steps in the waning days of his presidency to reverse the ban , the new regulations apply to persons who carry a concealed firearm with a permit .
Non-permit holders and open carry are not explicitly addressed .
Which is why S. 22 raises so many concerns : * It authorizes the federal government to buy private land adjacent to national parks and trails .
Such land would be controlled by the NPS , and thus be subject to the gun ban .
*
The bill federalizes the Washington - Rochambeau Route , a 650 mile trail , and places it under the NPS gun ban .
* S. 22 will codify the National Landscape Conservation System , which raises concerns for hunters and sportsmen .
Much of this land is consolidated from the BLM and the Forest Service , which have always allowed hunting and recreational shooting .
It is unclear what rules will be promulgated by the new agency and if gun owners ' rights will be protected .
* S. 22 also strips out small concessions which were won in the House last year that would allow state and local law to govern firearms possession and hunting on certain land .
But the anti-gun House leadership is preventing any amendments to fully repeal the NPS gun ban .
If these concerns are not corrected in S. 22 , I would strongly urge you to vote against it .
Thank you .

Started by arsonists , fires have swept through Kenya ’s Great Rift valley , home to some of the world ’s most treasured parks and millions of Kenyans already suffering from long - term drought .
According to the BBC , Kenya has mobilized 3,500 security personnel , including the national youth service , police , and forestry workers , to fight the fires .
So far the government has announced that 11,370 acres of bush and forests have gone up in flames .
The fires have already had negative impacts on parks such as Masai Mara , Lake Nakuru , and even Serengetti National Park in Tanzania , expanding fears that the fires will greatly affect wildlife and endangered species .
BBC reports that several marshbuck , or sitatunga antelope , have died due to the disaster .
Rangers have told media outlets that larger animals , like zebras , elephants , gazelles , giraffes , and buffaloes have been seen to outrun the fires , though they now face starvation .
Furthermore , rangers fear that smaller species like rabbits , mongoose , baboons , and snakes will not be able to outrun the flames .
Recent reports from Reuters have focused on animals supposedly trapped in an extinct volcano crater by the fire on Mount Longmont .
The fire is n’t just affecting Kenyan wildlife : it has destroyed an estimated $ 800,000 US of crops like maize at a time when ten million Kenyan are at risk of hunger due to a prolonged drought .
Ten people have been arrested in connection with the arson .
Though nothing is confirmed , it is thought that the fire may have been started by settlers upset with being removed from the Mau forest by the Kenyan government .

Drug gangs winning the war for Mexico Violence poses a security threat to United States
While U.S. leaders focus on Afghanistan , Iran and other problems in distant regions , there is an alarming security problem brewing right next door .
Violence in Mexico , mostly related to the trade in illegal drugs , is spiraling out of control .
Even worse , it is increasingly apparent that the drug - traffickers are winning their fight against the Mexican government .
An incident in Nuevo Laredo illustrates just how brazen the traffickers have become and how contemptuous they are of government authorities .
Los Zetas , the enforcement arm of the powerful and especially ruthless Gulf Cartel , openly sought recruits to their ranks , posting help - wanted signs and hanging a large banner across a major thoroughfare with the message : " The Zetas want you , soldier or ex-soldier .
We offer a good salary , food and benefits for your family . "
The cartels have also thoroughly penetrated Mexico 's government institutions even the agencies that are supposed to be dedicated to battling traffickers .
In recent weeks , prosecutors charged top officials in the Attorney General 's office with being informers for the drug organizations .
They allegedly received payments of $ 150,000 to $ 450,000 per month for information regarding surveillance targets and potential raids .
Those sums are more than even high - level law enforcement personnel can make in several years and lower - level personnel can make in several decades .
With such resources at their disposal , and with the U.S. and global demand for illegal drugs remaining robust , it is no wonder that the cartels are winning .
Indeed , given Mexico 's increasingly precarious economic situation , their power is likely to grow especially in the next year or two .
Mexico is suffering badly from the economic recession .
For the first time ever , financial remittances sent home from Mexicans working in the United States declined in 2008 .
As the already meager job prospects in Mexico shrink further , the drug cartels will be one employer willing and able to pay for new hires .
Washington , alarmed at the growing power of the cartels , is backing President Felipe Calderon 's government with the Merida Initiative , a multibillion dollar measure to aid anti-trafficking initiatives .
But that measure shows few positive results .
Indeed , the death toll in Mexico is growing , not declining .
More than 5,300 people perished in the fighting in 2008 , and 2009 is off to an ugly start .
In just one two - day period ( Jan. 26 - 27 ) 18 people were found shot dead in the northern Mexican state of Chihuahua , and another four in a neighboring state on the property of the state - run oil company , Pemex .
Those casualties were simply the latest in a series of bloody incidents during the new year that has already put 2009 on pace for another record number of killings .
The carnage is now so bad that the U.S. State Department has issued travel alerts for Americans traveling in Mexico .
One such alert warned that the battles in portions of northern Mexico are " the equivalent of military small - unit combat and have included the use of machine guns and fragmentation grenades . "
U.S. tourism to cities on Mexico's border with the United States , where the bloodshed has been the worst , has dropped sharply .
Even the Marines at Camp Pendleton are now prohibited from spending leave time in neighboring Tijuana because it has become too dangerous .
Even more troubling , Mexico 's violence is spilling across the border into communities in the southwestern United States .
Indeed , Mexican drug gangs now operate in numerous cities throughout our country .
Cartel enforcers have published lists of Americans , including police officers , who are targeted for assassination .
President Barack Obama must put the drug violence in Mexico at the top of his national security agenda .
While it is premature to describe Mexico as a full - blown failed state , as some experts have done , the situation has reached alarming proportions .
The campaign against drug trafficking in Mexico is the latest failed front in the international war on drugs .
The brutal truth is that the illegality of the drug trade creates a multibillion - dollar black - market premium that attracts the greediest , most violence - prone elements .
Neither the Merida Initiative nor any other program will change that fundamental economic reality .
President Obama needs to order a comprehensive reassessment of America 's drug strategy before the security environment along our southern border gets even worse .

Physicist Professor Brian
Cox has looked at the different strategies now being pursued to make nuclear fusion a reality .
His personal assessment is presented on the BBC's Horizon programme .
If a steady stream of mini-stars can be created , then a power station could be constructed
Prof Brian Cox Nuclear fusion is nature 's power source .
From the Sun to the most distant stars , the energy that lights up the Universe is released by sticking hydrogen nuclei together to make helium .
Since hydrogen is the most abundant element in the Universe , it seems sensible to ask whether we might endeavour to do the same and power ourselves out of our serious energy crisis by building stars on Earth .
The problem of course is that stars are big and hot ; the Sun is the size of a million Earths , and burns six hundred million tonnes of hydrogen fuel every second .
The temperature at its core is 15 million degrees , and this is barely enough to allow fusion to take place at anything other than a snail 's pace .
Despite the obvious difficulties , however , the UK has hosted a working nuclear fusion reactor in Oxfordshire for the last three decades .
Jet , the Joint European Torus , routinely heats a cocktail of different forms of hydrogen known as deuterium and tritium to well over one hundred million degrees and initiates nuclear fusion at a rate far in excess of that in the centre of the Sun. FIND OUT MORE ...
Horizon : Can We Build a Star on Earth ? is on BBC Two on Tuesday , 17 February , at 2100 GMT Catch it later on the BBC iPlayer Jet is too small to produce meaningful amounts of electricity , but it is a prototype for a much bigger and potentially commercial design called Iter , now under construction in southern France .
The Jet / Iter approach to fusion is to heat and contain a gas so hot that the electrons are stripped away from the atomic nuclei to form a lively and difficult to control sub-atomic soup known as a plasma .
The plasma is held in an intense magnetic bottle so it never touches the walls of the reactor .
If enough deuterium - tritium plasma can be held for long enough at a high enough temperature and pressure , Nature will do the rest .
The result is helium and clean , abundant energy .
JET has already " bottled " a plasma in its tokomak container
In the US , a different approach known as inertial fusion is being perused at the National Ignition Facility ( NIF ) in California and the Z - Machine in New Mexico .
If Iter is like a conventional power station burning fuel for days or weeks at a time , the inertial projects share more in common with the combustion engine .
NIF blasts tiny pellets of deuterium - tritium fuel with a single 500 - trillion - watt laser beam .
This is a big number ; about 1,000 times the power consumption of the United States .
This gargantuan short - lived laser pulse causes the fuel pellet to collapse and detonate , producing a mini-star for a fraction of a second .
The Z - machine takes a different approach , channelling half a trillion watts through a spider 's web of hair - thin wires surrounding the fuel pellet .
The result is much the same : a big crunch known as a Z - pinch and the birth of a star .
If a steady stream of mini-stars can be created , then a power station could be constructed .
The Z - machine has already achieved fusion in a test run , and NIF hopes to follow in its footsteps in 2010 .
The challenge will then be to smooth the rough edges of the technology in order to mass - produce economically viable , reliable power stations .
This is no mean feat , but there seems to be no fundamental reason to doubt that it is possible .
When fusion is mentioned , a common reaction in some circles is to say , " It 's always 30 years away , so let 's not invest too heavily " .
In fact , the fusion engineers of 2009 are speaking of building the final generation of experimental reactors now .
NIF is very close to starting up its main scientific work
If they succeed , Iter and her sisters should be capable of putting electricity on to the grid some time in the early 2030s .
This long - term and final solution to the energy crisis depends of course on sustained public investment at current or preferably significantly increased levels .
This is a challenge that I believe we must confront now , and not tomorrow .
At some point in the future , we will generate our power by nuclear fusion ; there is simply no other way to deliver the trillions of watts needed to make life comfortable for all the citizens of our planet .
To this statement nobody objects .
The question is therefore not " if " but " when " , and it is my view that the " 30 years away " argument simply does n't wash .
John F Kennedy used to tell a story about a French general who asked his gardener to plant a tree .
" What 's the rush ? " replied the gardener .
" It will take 30 years to grow . "
The general looked him in the eye , and said in an urgent tone : " Thirty years ?
Then you had better plant it immediately . "
Z-machine : " ... half a trillion Watts through a spider 's web of hair - thin wires ... "

Raph Koster wrote an interesting post on the connection between games and the ludic fallacy as discussed in Nassim Nicholas Taleb 's bestselling book The Black Swan .
For those unfamiliar with the book , a black swan is an unpredictable but highly impactful event .
Raph ends his post with a question : " Rather than just bemoan this , I 'll instead issue the challenge : what is the fun game that features black swans , phase transitions , and the catastrophic 100 - year flood ?
How do you sculpt a system that does this without chasing away the newbies ?
" This is an interesting question , and one which has a simple answer if not constrained to electronic games : pen and paper roleplaying games .
The presence of a human game master lends unpredictability , surprises , and ad hoc creativity that electronic games can't hope to match .
However , even ignoring the human element , the mechanics of electronic RPGs have been straying ever further away from unpredictability in a misguided pursuit of balance .
Since long before I had the Black Swan framework to hang it upon , I have been thinking about the role of randomness in roleplaying games .
Roleplaying games typically draw on randomness for two different major functions .
The first is in their action resolution mechanics .
The second is in their content generation systems .
Both of these got their start in the earliest pen and paper roleplaying games .
The earliest electronic RPGs , existing primarily to recreate the tabletop experience , inherited both of these random elements .
As electronic RPGs have diverged from their pen and paper roots , the role of randomness has steadily diminished .
The results of this process are manifested most clearly in today 's MMORPGs and JRPGs .
But let 's not get ahead of ourselves , even within the early pen and paper tradition , randomness has been afforded varying degrees of importance .
Let us begin by comparing the combat resolution systems of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons and Rolemaster .
In AD&D a typical orc has 1d8 hit points and an armor class of 6 .
A first level fighter with no bonuses will hit an armor class of 6 with a roll of 14 or higher on 1d20 ( the standard die used for attack rolls in AD&D ) .
At tenth level , the same fighter only needs to roll a 5 or higher to hit the orc .
With a standard longsword , the fighter will do 1d8 hit points of damage to the orc if his attack succeeds .
So , the first level fighter will hit the orc 35 % of the time and it will take anywhere from one to eight successful blows to kill the orc .
According to my calculations , the chance the fighter will kill the orc with his first swing is just under twenty percent ( 0.35 * 0.5625 ) .
However , if the fighter had a strength of 18/00 ( the max a human fighter can have naturally ) , he would receive a +3 bonus to hit and a +6 bonus to his damage roll .
In this case , the fighter would have almost a fifty percent chance to kill the orc on his first attack .
Clearly , there is a large random element to combat in AD&D .
Bonuses from high ability scores and special abilities and equipment do reduce the relative importance of the random rolls , but these bonuses are usually fairly small .
The main constraint to AD&D randomness is that the range of results is clearly defined .
If a player 's character has 10 hit points and an enemy is attacking him with a longsword , the player knows that his character can't be killed in one blow unless the opponent has some damage bonuses from strength , magic , etc .
In Rolemaster , however , things are n't quite so simple .
The attack roll in Rolemaster is an open - ended d100 .
Normally , results range from 1 - 100 , but on a natural / unmodified roll of 96-100 another d100 roll is made and added to the result of the first roll .
This second roll is open - ended as well , so a natural 96-100 will result in a third roll , and so on , ad infinitum .
The upper bound of an attack roll in Rolemaster is infinity .
Unlike AD&D , the attack roll determines both whether a hit occurred and how much damage was inflicted , with one exception .
The final attack roll result , plus the attacker 's offensive bonus and minus the defender 's defensive bonus , is indexed on a chart for the weapon being used and cross - referenced against the defender 's armor type .
The result is a number indicating the amount of damage inflicted and possibly a letter indicating a critical hit .
Most combat deaths in Rolemaster are either direct or indirect results of critical hits ; combatants tend to die in sudden and dramatic fashion and not as much through attrition .
There are five degrees of critical hits , A through E , with E being the deadliest .
When a critical is indicated , a separate d100 roll is made on the appropriate critical chart .
Crticals can result in broken bones , bleeding , blindness , loss of consciousness , and even gruesome death .
Even an A critical can kill on a natural roll of 100 .
Combine the lethality of critical hits with the fact that even the best armor usually can't reduce the probability of a critical hit to zero , and you have a system where any blow can kill .
The genius of Rolemaster is that it allows players to manage risk by using any portion of their offensive bonus as a defensive bonus instead .
It is rare for players to take a purely offensive stance unless their opponent is stunned .
Now let us draw a comparison between these older pen and paper mechanics and a modern console RPG , Final Fantasy 12 .
The damage equation for wielding a spear is : DMG = [ ATK x RANDOM ( 1~1.125 ) - DEF ] x [ 1 + STR x ( Lv+STR ) /256 ]
Notice that the random element ranges from 1.0 to 1.125 .
Vaan at 50th level , wielding the best weapon in the game ( ATK 150 ) against an enemy with a DEF of 50 yields : DMG = [ 150 x RANDOM ( 1~1.125 ) - 50 ] x [ 1 + 50 x ( 50+50 ) /256 ]
The end result is damage ranging from 2053 to 2438 , a fairly narrow range compared to the pen and paper systems .
Also notice that successful attacks are the default .
Instead , certain equipment like shields provide a chance block an enemy 's attack .
There is also a small chance to score a critical hit , which results in double damage .
As you can clearly see , combat resolution in Final Fantasy 12 is much less random than even AD&D .
To see for yourself how much things have changed since the early days of roleplaying , just compare the combat of a grind heavy MMORPG with the commercial MUD Gemstone IV .
Gemstone IV 's game mechanics are derived from Rolemaster ( in fact , earlier versions of the game licensed the Rolemaster rules and the Shadow World setting ) .
You will not hear Gemstone players using terms like DPS ( damage per second ) when discussing combat strategy .
You often hear complaints from MMORPG players concerning the grind necessary to gain levels , but in fact every MMORPG battle is a microcosm of the level grind .
This is especially true of the large raid bosses .
You can find a very brief excerpt of a Gemstone IV battle here .
I was caught in an invasion of high level plant creatures into my low - level hunting ground and killed .
Another player who attempted to rescue me was killed as well .
The point of this comparison is that predictability is n't necessarily more fun because it is " balanced " , sometimes it is just boring .
And if it would be boring in a pen and paper game , then fundamentally , it is probably still boring electronically .
It is just dressed up in a such a way that people put up with it .
But even the relatively unpredictable and complex combat mechanics of Rolemaster fall short of the conditions needed for Taleb 's black swans .
Even without knowing all the bonuses involved , the player can roughly estimate the risks .
Looking at the attack charts , the player can see what results are needed to generate critical hits .
With transparent mechanics , black swans are by definition impossible because the possibilities are known beforehand .
With regard to task resolution mechanics , this is n't necessarily a bad thing .
It is the generation of game content which can really benefit from black swans -- like the plant invasion which killed my character in Gemstone IV -- and this shall be the topic of my next post in the series .

LONDON , England -- Scientists in the U.S. are developing a laser gun that could kill millions of mosquitoes in minutes .
The WHO has reported that around half of the world 's population is at risk of malaria .
The laser , which has been dubbed a " weapon of mosquito destruction " fires at mosquitoes once it detects the audio frequency created by the beating of its wings .
The laser beam then destroys the mosquito , burning it on the spot .
Developed by some of the astrophysicists involved in what was known as the " Star Wars " anti-missile programs during the Cold War , the project is meant to prevent the spread of malaria .
Lead scientist on the project , Dr. Jordin Kare , told CNN that the laser would be able to sweep an area and " toast millions of mosquitoes in a few minutes . "
Malaria is a life - threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people from the bites of female mosquitoes .
Vital Signs Each month CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta brings viewers health stories from around the world .

It is particularly prevalent in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world and kills an African child every 30 seconds , according to the World Health Organization .
There are an estimated 300 million acute cases of malaria each year globally , resulting in more than one million deaths , the WHO reports .
Responding to questions about any potential harm the laser could pose to the eco-system , Kare said : " There is no such thing as a good mosquito , there 's nothing that feeds exclusively on them .
No one would miss mosquitoes , " he said .
" In any case , " he added .
" The laser is able to distinguish between mosquitoes that go after people and those that are n't dangerous .
What remains to be seen is how precise we can get . "
He added that other insects would not be affected by the laser 's beam .
Kare said the lasers could be mounted on lamp post - type poles and put around the circumference of villages , to create a kind of " fence " against mosquitoes .
The research was commissioned by Intellectual Ventures , a Washington , U.S. - based company that was founded by Nathan Myhrvold , a former Microsoft Corporation executive .
His previous boss , Bill Gates , who funded the research , asked Myhrvold to look into new ways of combating malaria .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - California ’s octuplets mum , already jobless and receiving food stamps , has gone into hiding with her six older children because of death threats , her spokesman said on Wednesday .
A combination picture shows ( clockwise from top L ) Josiah , Makai , Jeremiah , Nariyah , Jonah , Noah , Maliyah and Isaiah - the octuplets born January 26 , 2009 in Bellflower , California in this undated handout photo released by NBC News .

News / Handout
Nadya Suleman , 33 , has come under mounting public ridicule for expanding her already large family via fertility treatments that led to the January 26 birth of six boys and two girls at a Los Angeles - area hospital .
That criticism has mushroomed as it was reported that she was divorced , living with her parents , unemployed for several years , receiving disability checks for three of her children -- one of whom is autistic -- and collecting nearly $ 500 ( 347.75 pounds ) a month in food stamps .
She acknowledged those circumstances in a series of NBC television interviews but insisted in a segment aired on Tuesday on “ Dateline NBC ” that she was “ not living off any taxpayer money ” and that assistance she now receives is temporary .
The broadcast drew the highest “ Dateline ” ratings since a 2007 interview with Prince William and Prince Harry .
Suleman , who was working towards an advanced degree in counselling , said she owes close to $ 50,000 in student loans , which also are her sole source of non-government income .
According to the Los Angeles Times , the Kaiser Permanente hospital where the newborns remain is seeking reimbursement for the cost of their care from Medi-Cal , the sate ’s health care program for the poor .
Those costs are expected to reach into the hundreds of thousands of dollars , the newspaper said .
‘ UNDISCLOSED LOCATION ’
For the past few days , Suleman and her six older children , ages 2 to 7 , have moved into “ what we are referring to as an undisclosed location , ” said Michael Furtney , a public relations consultant working for the family .
The Web site RadarOnline.com reported the family was staying at a hotel .
Furtney said Suleman and the PR firm have been deluged with hostile telephone and email messages in recent days , some of them containing threats of violence and death .
“ The bulk of them just rail against her being , as they would refer to her , as a person who ’s taking advantage of the system , and they just go from there , ” Furtney said .
He also acknowledged that the hostile messages have so far outnumbered the well - wishes , but added , “ the positive notes are beginning to catch up with the not so positive ones . ”
Some have been directed to a new Suleman family Web site that solicits private donations to help support them .
The site is adorned with photos of the mother and her eight newborns , along with images of a baby bottle , a pacifier , a rainbow and alphabet blocks spelling out the word “ love . ”
Below the greeting , “ We thank you from the bottom of our hearts -- Nadya Suleman and children , ” are heart - shaped links that invite visitors to comment and to make a contribution .
Furtney said people have primarily been offering furniture , clothing , food and other essentials , and someone even promised to donate breast milk .
He said one Indiana farmer has offered to have the whole family live with him and his family .
He said “ volunteers ” were paying for her temporary living arrangements .
Suleman might temporarily move back into her mother ’s three - bedroom house in a Los Angeles suburb , but that house will likely prove too small for all 14 children , Furtney said .
Suleman ’s mother , Angela , has called her daughter ’s decision to keep expanding her family “ unconscionable ” and she said she had pleaded with her daughter ’s fertility doctor not to implant her with more embryos .
At Denny's , free food , long lines THE ECONOMY IN TURMOIL

Times being what they are , a free plate of bacon and eggs is a thing to behold .
On Tuesday , it was worth more than $ 5.99 .
It was worth standing on a sidewalk for nearly two hours .
When you 're laid off , said a lot of people who were laid off , there are worse ways to spend the day than waiting in line for a free $ 5.99 plate of bacon and eggs .
So it was that thousands of people showed up around the Bay Area and elsewhere to claim their share of the largesse from Denny 's restaurants , which was giving away its Grand Slam breakfast to all comers .
The promotion was promulgated the way many monumental events are decreed these days , via a Super Bowl commercial .
By Tuesday morning , the word had spread like hotcakes .
In downtown San Francisco , the line stretched from the front door on Mission Street , between Fourth and Fifth streets , to the corner of Fourth and up the block .
Nearby merchants complained .
Three cops stood by .
The restaurant manager ordered that a new line should be formed in the Jessie Street alley , and people in the second line thought they were in the first line , and a lot of frustrated people got more scrambled than their eggs .
Looked like a soup line
Paris Winslow of San Francisco said he was standing in line because he could n't find work anymore .
His last job , he said , was holding signs on street corners advertising going - out - of - business sales , but all those businesses have gone out of business , and now a free plate of bacon and eggs looks pretty good .
" The economy is getting kind of scary , " Winslow said .
" This line looks like those pictures of soup kitchen lines during the Depression . "
All around him stood hungry people with dogs , hungry people pushing supermarket carts , hungry people with blankets and hungry people with open - toed shoes that had n't originally come that way .
Store manager Javier Martinez stood at the end of the first line and directed people to the second line .
He conferred with his waiters and clerks by cell phone , he tried to make nice with his ticked - off neighbors , and he sought to mollify the three cops who were telling him to keep the sidewalk clear .
" Denny 's should have planned this better , " one officer told Martinez .
" You tell people that something 's free these days , and they 're going to show up .
It was predictable . "
Time with a book
Customer Doug Kirschhoch spent his time in line reading a science fiction novel about an alien battle on the planet Leeshore .
He got through three chapters .
" Pretty good book , " he said .
" I knew I 'd be waiting in line , and so I 'm trying to spend the time usefully . "
Inside the restaurant , the servers ' hands were full , and their pockets were empty .
Tips were almost nonexistent , as 15 percent of nothing is nothing .
" Nobody 's leaving anything , " said one waiter , who identified himself as Raymundo .
" And some people are not so nice . "
The trouble , Raymundo said , was that only the Grand Slam breakfast - bacon , eggs , pancakes , sausage - was free .
Not the coffee or the orange juice and certainly not the steak .
" One man ordered the T - bone , and I told him it was n't included , and he said , ' F - you , ' " Raymundo said .
" That 's the kind of day it 's been . "
Water was free , and most people had that .
Also free was ketchup , and the ketchup was flowing on many plates like blood on the battlefields of Leeshore .
The over - easy eggs were going down easy at other Denny 's , too .
At the one outside Serramonte mall in Daly City , the manager was taking names at the front door , and three security guards were trying to keep order .
Waiting diners paced the parking lot and threw footballs .
Sharing an iPod
Would - be breakfasters Arias Davis and Tia Hill , both students at San Francisco State University , sat on a low brick wall by the parking lot and read their political science textbooks while they waited .
They shared an iPod , listening with one earbud apiece .
Stephen Weller waited with his dog , Emmett .
Weller , a contractor , said he has been out of work for six months .
" I came all the way from San Francisco for a free $ 6 meal , " he said .
" Is n't that pathetic ?
A year ago , I never would have done this .
These days I 'm willing to put my ego on the back burner . "
At 1:15 p.m. , the manager said she would , regretfully , be able to pencil no more names onto the waiting list , which was already running three pages .
" The promotion only goes until 2 o'clock , " she said .
" I have at least two hours worth of people waiting right now . "
Chilled diners
The South Carolina - based restaurant chain said it figured it might wind up giving away as many as 2 million meals at its 1,541 restaurants nationwide .
There were lines reported in the snow in Pennsylvania and in early morning hours in Buffalo , N.Y. , where the low temperature was 23 degrees .
" We 've had waits up to three hours but no problems , " said spokeswoman Cori Rice .
To ward off sidewalk mutinies , restaurant managers were giving out rain checks for free meals to anyone who did n't get in by the 2 p.m. deadline .
With the cash - strapped state of California issuing IOUs to its creditors these days , at least a Denny 's rain check was a security backed by actual bacon .
Oh Noes , Billo !
In response to our Stop Supporting The O’Reilly Harassment Machine campaign , UPS told us yesterday that it was investigating whether to continue supporting O’Reilly ’s show .
“ We are sensitive to the type of television programming where our messages and presence are associated and continually review choices to affect future decisions , ” spokeswoman Susan Rosenberg told us .
Today UPS announced it will stop advertising on O’Reilly ’s show .
Here is the statement UPS emailed out just moments ago :
The Obama administration said Tuesday it is speeding hundreds of federal agents and intelligence analysts to the Mexican border , along with specialized technology , as part of an ambitious new plan to attack the powerful drug cartels and prevent violence from spilling into the United States .
The initiative represents the most determined U.S. effort in years to counter the powerful and dangerous cartels and assist Mexican President Felipe Calderon in a battle that has already claimed more than 7,000 lives in Mexico over the last 15 months .
The administration will spend $ 700 million this year and more in the future on a wide variety of bilateral security programs , including improving cross - border interdiction efforts , upgrading intelligence - gathering methods and establishing corruption - resistant police agencies and courts .
The White House also pledged to redouble its efforts to diminish the demand for illegal drugs in the United States and staunch the flow of weapons and laundered money into Mexico , two issues that have prompted criticism that Washington was n’t doing its part in the fight .

To lend urgency to the plan , the administration is requiring that an array of federal agencies work together as well as with state and local counterparts and with agencies in Mexico .
“ This issue requires immediate action , ” said Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano .
“ We are guided by two very clear objectives .
First , we are going to do everything we can to prevent the violence in Mexico from spilling over across the border .
And second , we will do all in our power to help President Calderon crack down on these drug cartels in Mexico . ”
Despite its scale , the Obama administration plan was seen by many in Mexico and by state officials in California and Texas as inadequate to the scope of the crisis .
The administration is relying heavily on existing funds and personnel redeployments where critics say new money and manpower are needed .
“ We believe it is a positive move in the right direction and it demonstrates that President Obama is seized with how important the bilateral relationship is with Mexico and in ensuring that security prevails at the border , ” said Ricardo Alday , spokesman for the Mexican Embassy in Washington .
However , the Calderon government does not believe the plan provides enough resources , especially to combat U.S. - based weapons trafficking and money laundering , according to one Mexican official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter .

But the official said the White House has assured Mexico that the plan announced Tuesday is only the first step .
“ We really think that there is more coming up in the near future , ” the official said .
“ If the steps we ’ve taken do not get the job done , we will do more , ” President Obama said at a news conference on Tuesday .
Many , if not most , of the programs unveiled Tuesday will be financed through existing funds , much of it under the multiyear , $ 1.4 - billion Merida Initiative established by the Bush administration .
Even so , some border security experts said the plan was impressive in what it sets out to accomplish .

Demetrious Papademetriou , president of the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute in Washington , praised the emphasis on collaboration between federal , state and local authorities .
He said it was an encouraging sign that Napolitano , a former Arizona governor and federal prosecutor , was bringing both her expertise and her frustrations to the Washington policy debate .
“ What you always heard at the border was that the administration in Washington was going it alone , ” said Papademetriou , a frequent participant in U.S. - Mexico security study groups .
“ This appears to be a carefully calibrated response that certainly has enough in the mix for people to think that the government is paying attention to this issue and is on top of it . ”
Some top officials in border states , however , said the plan stops short of meeting their requests for more “ boots on the ground . ” .
Texas Gov. Rick Perry , for instance , recently asked Obama to send 1,000 National Guard troops to the border , as well as five technologically advanced helicopters to help identify and track cartel operatives as they cross the vast border under cover of darkness .
Napolitano said she plans to discuss the issue with Perry during a visit to Texas on Thursday .

But even if the National Guard is deployed , more resources will be needed to help overwhelmed local , state and federal authorities already working at the border , said Texas Homeland Security Director Steven McCraw .
“ Make no mistake about it , if you want to secure the border you have to put sufficient patrol resources on the ground , ” McCraw said in an interview .
“ Investigations and prosecutions are important , but we ’d rather have them not penetrate the U.S. - Mexican border in the first place . ”
California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger hailed the plan as “ a great first step . ”
But he added : “ I will continue to fight for more federal resources at our border . ”
The National Guard already has been deployed at least three times to the border , mostly to provide logistical support to law enforcement .

The border plan will draw about $ 40 million from federal economic stimulus money and will be used to send 360 Homeland Security officers and agents , 100 of the Treasury Department ’s Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives agents , and officers from the Drug Enforcement Administration and FBI .
The FBI will establish a Southwest Intelligence Group , a clearinghouse of FBI activities involving Mexico .
Because the effort will have so many facets , it will be coordinated at the White House through the National Security and Homeland Security councils as part of the broader U.S. - Mexico portfolio , administration officials said .
Obama ’s plan has been in the works since before he took office , and reflects growing U.S. concern -- and even alarm -- over the increasingly powerful cartels .
In a sign of its importance , the plan was announced at the White House by Napolitano , Deputy Atty .
Gen. David Ogden and Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg .

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton leaves today on a trip to Mexico .
Napolitano and Atty . Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. , along with Obama , are scheduled to travel there soon .
Rep. Lamar Smith ( R- Texas ) , the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee , said he supports the administration ’s efforts to address border violence , but expressed concern about the specifics of the plan .
“ I am concerned that the redeployment may come at the expense of other critical law enforcement activities , ” Smith said .
“ With hundreds of federal law enforcement officers being relocated to the border , we must ensure that we do not undercut our national security and immigration enforcement responsibilities . ”
Officials said that in many cases , the plan will entail moving small teams of people while using other ways of beefing up numbers , including delaying transfers .

“ We are not pulling people off of critical missions such as the northern border .
We are suspending other small - scale stuff , ” said one Homeland Security official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly .
“ We are focusing our priorities . ”

OLDHAM , England , March 19 ( UPI ) -- A British woman whose daughters tried to have her evicted in the 1990s cut her offspring out of her will , leaving her entire $ 30,000 to a local hospice .
Megan Swanston , who died in December at the age of 85 , became embroiled in a family conflict when her three daughters attempted to have her evicted from her Oldham , England , home in 1994 , The Daily Mail reported Thursday .

The house had been bequeathed to Swanston 's daughters by their paternal grandfather when he died in 1973 but Swanston claimed her children had promised to let her live out her days in the home .
After a two - year legal battle , the matter was settled out of court with the house sold to a property company with the stipulation that Swanston be allowed to remain the sitting tenant the newspaper said .
However , Swanston and her daughters never mended their relationship and it was revealed after her Dec. 4 death that she had cut her daughters out of her will , The Daily Mail said .
The document stated that she did n't want any of her money going to the trio because of the way they had treated her .
Swanston 's money instead went to Dr. Kershaw 's Hospice in Oldham .
A ruling by Judge Stephen Reinhardt of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals says the Defense of Marriage Act is discriminatory and unconstitutional because it denies partner benefits to spouses of gay federal employees .
" The denial of federal benefits to same - sex spouses cannot be justified simply by a distaste for or disapproval of same - sex marriage or a desire to deprive same - sex spouses benefits available to other spouses in order to discourage exercising a legal right afforded them by the state , " Reinhardt wrote in his Feb. 2 order ....
Both orders are internal employee grievance decisions .
Both found in favor of the gay employees , directing court administrators to give health insurance benefits to their spouses .
The orders also represent direct challenges to DOMA , the 1996 act that forbids the federal government from treating same - sex relationships as marriages for any purpose .
A lawyer for the staff attorney said this is believed to be the first time federal employees will get benefits covering a same - sex spouse ( Pam's House Blend ) .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Exxon Mobil is sitting on a massive pile of money .
Thanks to record oil prices over the last few years and a cautious investment strategy that drew fire from critics , the company has nearly $ 40 billion in cash reserves .
It has another $ 225 billion in repurchased stock tucked away for a rainy day .
That 's enough money to pay a nearly 60 % premium , in cash , for every share of its next largest competitor - Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSA ) .
Some analysts think it may do something just like that .
" It 's not if , it 's when and which [ company ] , " said Fadel Gheit , a senior energy analyst at the investment bank Oppenheimer .
Gheit is in the minority of oil analysts , but he 's still convinced Exxon 's target will be one of the big oil firms .
" When Exxon came calling last time , they did n't dial the little guys , " he said , referring to the 1999 takeover of Mobil , then the country 's second - largest oil company .
" It has to be a big one in order to move the needle . "
Exxon management : Tough as nails
Shrewd management has put Exxon ( XOM , Fortune 500 ) in this position to buy .
Over the last five years oil companies worldwide have scrambled to develop new projects to take advantage of oil 's rising price - often paying exorbitant sums for leases , drilling rigs and other assets needed to bring crude to market .
But not Exxon .
Although criticized for not doing enough to pump more crude , the company has maintained the price spike was temporary , and that it would n't overpay for projects .
The position has paid off .
With crude prices crashing , many oil firms are now deep in debt and stuck with expensive projects .
Share prices of the majors have fallen in line with the broader stock market .
Shell is down 35 % in the last 6 months .
Chevron ( CVX , Fortune 500 ) and BP ( BP ) are off about 30 % .
Shares in many other oil firms that rushed to expand over the last few years are down even more .
But Exxon has lost just 10 % .
" It 's hard to question their management style and expertise , " said Ken Carol , an oil company analyst at the investment bank Johnson Rice & Co . " They 've been proven absolutely correct . "
For Exxon , taking over another big firm would give it much - needed oil reserves in a time when the multinational oil companies find themselves increasingly locked out of the best new oil plays by national firms like Russian 's Gazprom , Saudi Arabia 's Aramco or Venezuela 's PDVSA .
It would also give it more financial muscle when negotiating with these governments .
Is Shell in Exxon 's sights ?
A deal with Shell might be particularly sweet for Exxon 's ego .
The two firms have been archrivals since the early days of the oil barons , with the Anglo - Dutch Shell and John D. Rockefeller 's Standard Oil , which spawned Exxon , going head to head in markets around the globe .
Competition and price wars were fierce , and several times during the late 1800s and early 1900s men in gray suits crossed the Atlantic looking to strike a deal between the world 's two giant firms - to no avail .
But Carol , like most other oil analysts , does n't think Exxon will go for one of the big players .
" Never say never , but that 's not their history , " he said .
" They tend to be very conservative . "
A more cautious approach would be to buy one of the smaller independent companies .
Gheit said if Exxon does n't go for a major company , firms with lots of debt could make good targets .
Those include XTO ( XTO , Fortune 500 ) , Chesapeake ( CHK , Fortune 500 ) , Anadarko ( APC , Fortune 500 ) and Pioneer ( PXD ) , according to their balance sheets .
A smaller firm would give Exxon more of a specialty in a particular area - like oil production in the case of Anadarko or natural gas in the case of XTO - rather than mimic the capabilities , and liabilities , they already have as an integrated firm .
" Ultimately , Exxon will do something with this money , " said Blake Fernandez , an integrated oil analyst at the New Orleans - based investment bank Howard Weil .
" But why would they buy someone with the same growth problems they 've got ? "
An even safer option would be to buy leases from distressed companies looking to raise cash , or to develop leases it already has .
The company may also find some bargains overseas , as declining oil prices may spur foreign governments to make more leases available .
Exxon itself has certainly left the door wide open to doing any or all of the above .
" We 're watching the valuations of a broad range of companies , just as we 've done all the time , " Exxon boss Rex Tillerson told reporters at a recent industry gathering .
" Just have to wait and see . "

This weekend in Queensland , Australia the government held the first ‘ Toad Day Out ’ where hundreds of locals went hunting for the invasive cane toad , catching an estimated 10,000 toads to be euthanized .
At the same time , researchers announced in the journal Functional Ecology that they may have discovered a native Australian species that will finally rout the cane toad — and it ’s not man .
The meat ant is a notoriously aggressive and abundant insect which is known to consume anything edible , including the scientists argue , cane toads .
Comparing habitat use and activity patterns of meat ants , cane toads , and seven native Australian frog species , the researchers found that the cane toad was by far the most susceptible to predation by meat ants .

“ The spread of cane toads through tropical Australia has created major ecological problems .
The ideal way to control toad numbers would be to find a predator that kills and eats toads but leaves native frogs alone .
However , bringing in a predator from overseas might have catastrophic consequences , like those that occurred when cane toads themselves were brought in .
So we ’ve explored an alternative approach – to see if we could use a native predator , ” explains Dr. Rick Shine , one of the study ’s authors .
“ Meat ants are abundant around tropical waterbodies , and we often see them eating small toads , so we suspected that there might be some kind of mismatch between the invader and its newly invaded range , for example something about the toads ’ behaviour that makes them vulnerable to a predator that poses little danger to native frogs . ”
Through laboratory experiments
Shine ’s team , known as Team Bufo ( after the Latin name of the cane toad ) , found that both cane toads and meat ants live largely in open microhabitats and are diurnal , or active during the day .
Native frogs , however , are active at night and spend their days hidden in vegetation , away from the path of the voracious meat ants .
In addition , cane toads are slower than native frogs and appear to be less vigilant against meat ants : while native frogs would flee the ants , cane toads would only move a few short hops away or even bound closer .
Perhaps , even more important , the meat ants were not affected by the cane toad ’s poison .
The next step according to researchers is to work to bring these two species together more frequently and see if results in the lab can be recreated in the field .
The story of the cane toad in Australia is a warning to anyone who thinks it wise to import species to non-native habits .
A warning that has yet to be fully heeded : consider the recent difficulties in Florida with non-native burmese pythons .
Cane toads were introduced into Eastern Australia in 1935 from Hawaii , where they had been introduced from their native habitats in Central and South America .
They were brought to Australia because it was believed they would help control the native cane beetle , a pest for sugarcane farmers .
However , it turned out that the cane toads were not able to jump high enough to eat the cane beetles .
Instead of saving farmers , the cane toad began to devastate native wildlife .
As large and slow - moving the cane toad proved an easy target for Australian predators , only the cane toad is poisonous and therefore would often kill anything that ate it , greatly affecting populations of quolls , birds , snakes , monitor lizards , and crocodiles .
Researchers have tried for decades to come up with a solution to Eastern Australia ’s cane toad plague , so far there has been no silver bullet .

Advertisement Nasa 's first dedicated mission to measure carbon dioxide from space has failed following a rocket malfunction .
Officials said the fairing - the part of the rocket which covers the satellite on top of the launcher - did not separate properly .
Data indicates the spacecraft crashed into the ocean near Antarctica .
The Orbiting Carbon Observatory ( OCO ) was intended to help pinpoint the key locations on our planet 's surface where CO2 is being emitted and absorbed .
Nasa officials confirmed the loss of the satellite at a press conference held at 1300 GMT .
I am bitterly disappointed about the loss of OCO
Dr Paul Palmer , University of Edinburgh John Brunschwyler , from Orbital Sciences Corporation , the rocket 's manufacturer , told journalists : " Our whole team , at a very personal level , is very disappointed in the events of this morning . "
He added : " The fairing has considerable weight relative to the portion of the vehicle that 's flying .
So when it separates off , you get a jump in acceleration .
We did not have that jump in acceleration .
" As a direct result of carrying that extra weight , we could not make orbit . "
' Mishap ' board The $ 270 m ( £ 190 m ) mission was launched on a Taurus XL - the smallest ground - launched rocket currently in use by the US space agency .
The mission was to have been Nasa 's first dedicated CO2 mapper Since its debut in 1994 , this type of rocket has flown eight times , with six successes and two failures including this launch .
But this is the first time Nasa has used the Taurus XL .
The US space agency will now put together a " Mishap Investigation Board " to determine the root cause of the nose cone 's failure to come off three minutes into the launch .
Onlookers watched the launcher soar into the sky from the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California at 0955 GMT on Tuesday .
The first indication of a problem came in an announcement made by the Nasa launch commentator , George Diller .
" This is Taurus launch control .
We have declared a launch contingency , meaning that we did not have a successful launch tonight , " he said .
HOW SATELLITE SHOULD HAVE LAUNCHED
Separation of the fairing was one of the last technical hurdles faced by the satellite as it flew into orbit .
Orbital said there had been no changes to the design of the fairing since previous launches .
Mr Brunschwyler , programme manager for the Taurus rockets , cast doubt on any suggestion of a link between the failure and a power glitch which occurred to the vehicle just prior to launch .
" That was on a separate system , so I do not believe there was any connection , " Mr Brunschwyler told journalists at the Nasa press conference .
Our goal will be to find a root cause for the problem .
And we wo n't fly Glory until we have that data known to us
Chuck Dovale , Nasa launch director Dr Paul Palmer , a scientist from the University of Edinburgh , UK , who was collaborating on the mission , told BBC News : " I am bitterly disappointed about the loss of OCO .
My thoughts go out to the science team that have dedicated the past seven years to building and testing the instrument . "
Professor John Burrows , from the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology , who is also collaborating on the mission , commented : " The UK and European science community is a major partner in OCO and the loss of this instrument is a serious setback . "
Scientists had hoped OCO would improve models of the Earth 's climate and help researchers determine where the greenhouse gas is coming from and how much is being absorbed by forests and oceans .
This would have helped scientists make more accurate predictions of future climate change .
Rebuild question
Only about 50 % of the carbon emitted from human sources - principally , from fossil fuel combustion - stays there .
The remainder is mopped up by the land and oceans , which act as " sinks " .
However , scientists are unsure of the precise detail , with perhaps 20 % of our CO2 going into a hitherto unrecognised sink .
" All eyes are now on the Japanese Gosat instrument to search for the missing carbon sink , " said Dr Palmer .
Fortunately , Japan 's Gosat mission is up and working Gosat was launched in January from Tanegashima in Japan .
It is also designed to monitor atmospheric greenhouse gases .
Nasa 's
Glory satellite , which is designed to measure carbon soot and other aerosols in the Earth 's atmosphere , is due to launch on a Taurus XL from California in June .
" Our goal will be to find a root cause for the problem .
And we wo n't fly Glory until we have that data known to us , " said Nasa 's launch director Chuck Dovale .
Taurus is based on Orbital 's air - launched Pegasus rockets which have a long , proud history .
The fairing is essentially the same as is used on that rocket .
Mr Brunschwyler said : " We have not had any issues with this fairing design in the past . "
When the European Space Agency 's Cryosat spacecraft was destroyed on launch in 2005 , officials decided to re-build it ; the launch is scheduled for later in the year .
However , the future of the OCO mission remains unclear at this stage .
Responding to a question about spare parts for the US satellite , Michael Freilich , director of Nasa 's Earth science division , said : " At this time , we do n't have a complete inventory of flight spares , or what we should need , should we make a decision to re-build an OCO . "
The only other failure to hit the Taurus rocket occurred in September 2001 , when the rocket dropped off its payload of two satellites at a lower altitude than had been intended .
CO2 in the atmosphere has seen a steady rise in recent years

I 've found a way to register the G1 in the initial registration screen that comes up the first time you boot the phone ( or after you wipe the phone ) .
It will allow you to register if you do n't have a sim card at all , or if you have a sim card but no data plan .
First ,
You must have either RC29 or earlier , or modded RC30 .
It wo n't work with official RC30 , sorry .
If you do n't know for sure what version you have , but you know you have n't installed a modified RC30 build , then the easiest way to check is to reboot the phone , and once it starts up and is showing the " click the android to begin " screen , or the " no sim card " screen , then type the following on the phone keyboard reboot
If it reboots , then you have RC29 or ealier .
Otherwise you have RC30 .
Second , you must have adb installed on your computer , and have the USB drivers installed , or at least ready to install when it asks for the driver when you connect the G1 .
See this page for details on how to get adb working : http://code.google.com/android/intro...devicehardware
Third , you must have a wifi network that you can connect to .
There are too many possibilities to write specific step - by - step instructions for every case .
So I will give an overview of the process instead .
If someone else wants to write some specific instructions , that would be welcome ----------- When you start up the phone without a sim card , it goes into a locked screen that says " no sim card found " , and you can't even get into the registration app .
So the first step is to get around that screen .
You have to connect to your phone with adb shell and get root access , and then type the following command : sqlite3 / data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases/settings.db
" INSERT INTO system ( name , value ) VALUES ( ' device_provisioned ' , 1 ) ; " And then reboot the phone .
When it starts up again it will go into the registration screen instead of the locked " no sim card " screen .
This assumes that you have the sqlite3 binary on your phone .
This binary is provided in RC30 v1.2 .
Alternatively , you could manually copy the binary to your phone with adb push , or put it on the sdcard and copy it to your phone .
I can post a copy of just the sqlite3 binary if needed .-----------
The second step is to enable and configure wifi , so that the registration process can connect to the google servers .
In an adb shell session , type the following command : am start - a android.intent.action .MAIN -n com.android.settings /.SettingsThis does n't have to have root access to work .
It works fine with the " shell " user that adb on non-modded phones runs as .
That command will bring up the settings page on your phone .
From there , you can enable wifi and connect to your wifi network , and then proceed with registration as per normal ------------A few tips and tricks :-
If you have an official RC29 or lower phone , type the following command on the phone keyboard to enable adb : setprop persist .
service .
adb.enable 1 - If you need to get root access on an official RC29 or lower phone , while it's at the registration screen , or the " no sim card " screen , enable adb ( see first tip ) , and then type the following command on the phone keyboard : telnetd Now , copy a busybox binary to / data / local / busybox with adb push , and then connect to your phone with adb shell , and give the busybox binary execute permissions ( i.e. chmod 755 / data / local / busybox ) busybox has a telnet applet , so you can do : busybox telnet 127.0.0.1to get a telnet session with root access .-
If you do n't want to register the phone at all , you can set the app.setupwizard .
disable property to 0 to prevent registration .
Once you have an adb shell session open , type the following : setprop app.setupwizard.disable
1 and then reboot .
once it loads back up , it should bypass the registration screen all - together .
But beware , the phone seems a bit glitchy if you do n't have it registered .
For example , the home button does n't seem to work .
And you can't access the market or any of the google apps of course .
( Note : the following was the previous way to skip registration .
I 'll keep it here for informational purposes , but its easier to use the app.setupwizard.disable method instead of this ) -
If you do n't want to register the phone at all , you can edit / data / system / packages.xml and disable the registration screen .
Add the following to the end of the section for com.android .
setupwizard , and then reboot : so the full would look something like below after the modification :
John Bellamy Foster interviewed by Links International Journal of Socialist Renewal / Green Left Weekly 's Ruth Ratcliffe
A 20 - minute interview recorded with a handheld cam in Oregon , USA , in February 2009 .
John Bellamy Foster is editor of Monthy Review and professor of sociology at the University of Oregon .
He is co-author , with Fred Magdoff , of The Great Financial Crisis : Causes and Consequences ( Monthly Review Press , January 2009 ) among numerous other works .
Foster discusses the global economic crisis , its implications for the world and particularly the Australian economy .
He also discusses the ecological crisis and the potential for revolutionary change .
It ’s not surprising that with eight arms and inquisitive nature , the two - spotted octopus is pretty handy around its tank at the Santa Monica Pier Aquarium .
Still , those reporting for work Thursday at the popular beachfront attraction were caught by surprise when they were greeted by water lapping around the kelp forest display , the shark and ray tank and the rocky reef exhibit .
The guest of honor in the aquarium ’s Kids ’ Corner octopus tank had swum to the top of the enclosure and disassembled the recycling system ’s valve , flooding the place with some 200 gallons of seawater .
“ It had grabbed the tube that pulls out the water and caused it to spray outside the tank , ” said aquarium education specialist Nick Fash .
Judging by the size of the flood , Fash estimated that the water flowed for about 10 hours before the first staff member , Aaron Kind , showed up for work .

Kind issued an all - hands - on - deck call to summon co-workers to the pier with mops , water vacuums and fans .
Even though the aquarium is built over the beach , it has no floor drain .
The tiny octopus , which is about the size of a human forearm when its appendages are extended , floated lazily in the water that remained in its tank .
It watched intently through glass walls and portholes as workers struggled to dry the place out in time for the day ’s first busload of schoolchildren to arrive on a 9:30 a.m. field trip .
Randi Parent , the aquarium ’s community outreach coordinator , said the only significant damage was to newly installed ecologically sensitive flooring in several offices .
It consists of linseed - and - cork tiles that soaked up the seawater and squished beneath workers ’ feet the rest of the day .

The incident was reminiscent of a 1994 incident at San Pedro ’s Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in which an octopus named Octavia pulled a plastic pipe loose .
That giant Pacific octopus died when all of the water in her tank drained out .
Since octopuses are considered by many to be the most intelligent invertebrate -- and to have good memories --
Fash said he jury - rigged his octopus tank piping with clamps and tape in hopes of thwarting any further mischief by its occupant .
“ She would need tools , ” he said of his octopus , which until now had no name .
“ Some people are suggesting we call her ‘ Flo , ’ ” he said .

CIA prisons emptied , but rendition remains WAR ON TERROR
The CIA 's secret prisons are being shuttered .
Harsh interrogation techniques are off - limits .
And Guantanamo
Bay will eventually go back to being a wind - swept naval base in southeastern Cuba .
But even while dismantling these discredited programs , President Obama left an equally controversial counterterrorism tool intact .
Under executive orders issued by Obama last week , the CIA still has authority to carry out what are known as renditions , or the secret abductions and transfers of prisoners to countries that cooperate with the United States .
Current and former U.S. intelligence officials said the rendition program may be poised to play an expanded role because it is the main remaining mechanism - aside from Predator missile strikes - for taking suspected terrorists off the street .
The rendition program became a source of embarrassment for the CIA and a target of international scorn as details emerged in recent years of botched captures , mistaken identities and allegations that prisoners were turned over to countries where they were tortured .
The European Parliament condemned renditions as " an illegal instrument used by the United States . "
Prisoners swept up in the program have sued the CIA as well as a subsidiary of the Boeing Corp. , accused of working with the agency on dozens of rendition flights .
But the Obama administration appears to have determined that the rendition program was one component of the Bush administration 's war on terrorism that it could not afford to discard .
The decision underscores the fact that the battle with al Qaeda and other terrorist groups is far from over and that even if the United States is shutting down the prisons , it is not done taking prisoners .
' Some tools ' needed
" Obviously you need to preserve some tools , " said an Obama administration official , speaking on condition of anonymity when discussing the legal reasoning .
" It is controversial in some circles and kicked up a big storm in Europe .
But if done within certain parameters , it is an acceptable practice . "
One provision in one of Obama 's orders appears to preserve the CIA 's ability to detain and interrogate terrorism suspects as long as they are not held long - term .
The little - noticed provision states that the instructions to close the CIA 's secret prison sites " do not refer to facilities used only to hold people on a short - term , transitory basis . "
Despite concern about rendition , Obama 's prohibition against the use of most other counterterrorism tools could prompt intelligence officers to resort more frequently to the " transitory " technique .
The decision to preserve the program did not draw major protests , even among human rights groups .
Leaders of such organizations said that reflects a sense that the United States and other nations need certain tools to combat terrorism .
" Under limited circumstances , there is a legitimate place " for renditions , said Tom Malinowski , the Washington advocacy director for Human Rights Watch .
" What I heard loud and clear from the president 's order was that they want to design a system that does n't result in people being sent to foreign dungeons to be tortured , but that designing that system is going to take some time . "
Malinowski said he has urged the Obama administration to require that prisoners be transferred to other countries only when there is a guarantee they will get a public hearing in an official court .
" Producing a prisoner before a real court is a key safeguard against torture , abuse and disappearance , " Malinowski said .
Intelligence value limited
CIA veterans involved in the rendition program said that it was an important capability but used mainly for terrorism suspects not valuable enough for the agency itself to keep , and that the program was of limited use in gathering intelligence .
" The reason we did interrogations ( ourselves ) is because renditions for the most part were n't very productive , " said a former senior CIA official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the subject .
The most valuable intelligence on al Qaeda came from prisoners who were in CIA custody and questioned by agency experts , the official said .
Once prisoners were turned over to other countries , such as Egypt or Jordan , the agency had limited ability to influence how much intelligence was shared , how prisoners were treated and whether they were later released .
" In some ways , ( rendition ) is the worst option , " the former official said .
" If they are in U.S. hands , you have a lot of checks and balances , medics and lawyers .
Once you turn them over to another service , you lose control . "
In his executive order on lawful interrogations , Obama created a task force to re-examine renditions to make sure that they " do not result in the transfer of individuals to other nations to face torture " or otherwise circumvent human rights laws and treaties .
What happened to the stock market ?
There ’s much ado about the stock market – here ’s a look at what is really going on .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Obama administration ’s candidate for a top U.S. intelligence post withdrew on Tuesday amid congressional objections over his past criticism of Israel and ties to China and Saudi Arabia .
The withdrawal of Charles Freeman , named to head the National Intelligence Council which produces formal U.S. intelligence assessments of security issues , is the latest personnel embarrassment for President Barack Obama as he struggles to staff his administration .
“ Charles Freeman was the wrong guy for this position .
His statements against Israel were way over the top and severely out of step with the administration , ” New York Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said in a statement .
Pete Hoekstra , the top Republican on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee , said : “ This is yet another breakdown in the Obama administration vetting process -- one more in a long series of missteps . ”
Freeman is a former ambassador to Saudi Arabia , who has also served as an assistant secretary of defense and a senior diplomat in China .
National Intelligence Director Admiral Dennis Blair , who chose Freeman for the council position , had defended him in Congress earlier on Tuesday as a man of “ strong views , of an inventive mind and the analytical point of view . ”
Blair said he preferred that to “ precooked pablum judgments . ”
But Freeman ’s criticisms of Israel and a comment seen as condoning China ’s Tiananmen Square crackdown had stirred controversy .
He was quoted as saying in 2007 , “ The brutal oppression of the Palestinians by Israeli occupation shows no sign of ending , ” and “ American identification with Israel has become total . ”
Blair said the remarks were taken out of context .
After Freeman ’s withdrawal , Blair ’s office said he accepted his decision “ with regret . ”
But officials declined to discuss reasons for the withdrawal .
In a note to friends and supporters , Freeman said he had withdrawn from consideration after concluding that “ the barrage of libelous distortions ” of his record would not end when he took office .
“ I do not believe the National Intelligence Council could function effectively while its chair was under constant attack by unscrupulous people with a passionate attachment to the views of a political faction in a foreign country , ” Freeman wrote .
Lawmakers also questioned Freeman ’s professional ties .
Freeman served on the international advisory board of the state - owned China National Offshore Oil Corp .
when it made its 2005 bid for U.S. oil firm Unocal that was thwarted by U.S. congressional protest .
‘ FORCES LINED UP AGAINST HIM ’
He was also president of the Middle East Policy Council , a Washington think tank that received funding from Saudi Arabia .
Even as Blair defended Freeman on Tuesday , independent Senator Joseph Lieberman , a former Democrat , warned Blair at a Senate hearing that the controversy would not go away .
Lieberman ’s opposition may have been the last straw for Freeman , said a source familiar with Obama administration security policy .
“ There were a lot of forces lined up against him , ” the source said .
Freeman ’s comments on Israel were a key issue , but the business ties also raised serious conflict - of - interest concerns in Congress for an official whose influential estimates cover the globe ’s hot spots , the source said .
Freeman ’s problems were magnified by Obama ’s earlier difficulties with political appointees , he said .
The council that Freeman had been picked to head prepares the National Intelligence Estimates that are heavily relied on by Congress and administration policy makers .
Its work has come under intense scrutiny since it produced a controversial , and inaccurate , assessment in 2002 that Iraq was continuing its weapons of mass destruction programs .
Former President George W. Bush ’s main justification for the U.S. - led war he launched in 2003 was the threat of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction .
A 2007 estimate that Iran had suspended its work on nuclear weapon design also met criticism , this time from conservatives who said it undermined a hardline U.S. policy toward Tehran .
The National Intelligence Council position does not require Senate confirmation .

Treasuries rose , pushing rates on the three - month bill negative for the first time , as investors gravitate toward the safety of U.S. government debt amid the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The Treasury sold $ 27 billion of three - month bills yesterday at a discount rate of 0.005 percent , the lowest since it starting auctioning the securities in 1929 .
The U.S. also sold $ 30 billion of four - week bills today at zero percent for the first time since it began selling the debt in 2001 .
“ It ’s the year - end factor , ” said Chris Ahrens , an interest - rate strategist in Greenwich , Connecticut , at UBS Securities LLC , one of the 17 primary dealers that trade directly with the Federal Reserve .
“ Everyone wants to be in bills going into year - end .
Buy now while the opportunity is still there . ”
The benchmark 10 - year note ’s yield tumbled 11 basis points , or 0.11 percentage point , to 2.63 percent at 4:48 p.m. in New York , according to BGCantor Market Data .
The 3.75 percent security due in November 2018 gained 31/32 , or $ 9.69 per $ 1,000 face amount , to 109 23 /32 .
The yield touched 2.505 percent on Dec. 5 , the lowest level since at least 1962 , when the Fed ’s daily records began .
The two - year note ’s yield fell 10 basis points to 0.84 percent .
It dropped to a record low of 0.77 percent on Dec. 5 .
If you invested $ 1 million in three - month bills at today ’s negative discount rate of 0.01 percent , for a price of 100.002556 , at maturity you would receive the par value for a loss of $ 25.56 .

Why this girls choose green bikini ?
I think it is because global warming effect comes to the beach .
Anyway I do n't care who she is or what bikini colour she 'd wear , all I know she 's hot and has sexy b00bs .
WASHINGTON 
If the global economy were a 100 - yard dash , the U.S. would start 23 yards behind its closest competitors because of health care that costs too much and delivers too little , a business group says in a report to be released Thursday .
The report from the Business Roundtable , which represents CEOs of major companies , says America 's health care system has become a liability in a global economy .
Concern about high U.S. costs has existed for years , and business executives — whose companies provide health coverage for workers — have long called for getting costs under control .
Now President Barack Obama says the costs have become unsustainable and the system must be overhauled .
Americans spend $ 2.4 trillion a year on health care .
The Business Roundtable report says Americans in 2006 spent $ 1,928 per capita on health care , at least two - and - a - half times more per person than any other advanced country .
In a different twist , the report took those costs and factored benefits into the equation .
It compares statistics on life expectancy , death rates and even cholesterol readings and blood pressures .
The health measures are factored together with costs into a 100 - point " value " scale .
That has n't been done before , the authors said .
The results are not encouraging .
The United States is 23 points behind five leading economic competitors : Canada , Japan , Germany , the United Kingdom and France .
The five nations cover all their citizens , and though their systems differ , in each country the government plays a much larger role than in the U.S .
The cost - benefit disparity is even wider — 46 points — when the U.S. is compared with emerging competitors : China , Brazil and India .
" What 's important is that we measure and compare actual value — not just how much we spend on health care , but the performance we get back in return , " said H. Edward Hanway , CEO of the insurance company Cigna .
" That 's what this study does , and the results are quite eye - opening . "
Higher U.S. spending funnels away resources that could be invested elsewhere in the economy , but fails to deliver a healthier work force , the report said .
" Spending more would not be a problem if our health scores were proportionately higher , " Dr. Arnold Milstein , one of the authors of the study , said in an interview .
" But what this study shows is that the U.S. is not getting higher levels of health and quality of care . "
Other countries spend less on health care and their workers are relatively healthier , the report said .
Medical costs have long been a problem for U.S. auto companies .
General Motors spends more per car on health care than it does on steel .
But as more American companies face global competition , the " value gap " is being felt by more CEOs — and their hard pressed workers .
One thing the report does not do is endorse the same solution that countries like Canada have adopted : a government - run health care system .
The CEOs of the Business Roundtable believe health care for U.S. workers and their families should stay in private hands , with a government - funded safety net for low - income people .

gnawing through a shinbone , a high howl inside of which a bloody , slashed - by - growls note is heard , unlike that sound , and instead , its opposite : a barely sounded sound ( put your nuclear ears on for it , your giant hearing horn , its cornucopia mouth wide ) -- a slippery whoosh of rain sliding down a mirror leaned against a windfallen tree stump , the sound a child 's head makes falling against his mother 's breast , or the sound , from a mile away , as the town undertaker lets Grammy 's wrist slip from his grip and fall to the shiny table .
And , if you turn your head just right and open all your ears , you might hear this finest sound , this lost sound : a plow 's silvery prow cleaving the earth ( your finger dragging through milk , a razor cutting silk ) like a clipper ship cuts the sea .
If you do hear this sound , then follow it with your ear and also your eye as it and the tractor that pulls it disappear over a hill until it is no sound at all , until it comes back over the hill again , again dragging its furrow , its ground - rhythm , its wide open throat , behind it .
Often these turn out to be grossly exaggerated .
Or , as in cases like the ones below , completely fucking retarded .
What 's wrong with kids these days ?
Not enough , apparently , since grown - ups seem to feel the need to just make shit up .
Even the flimsiest evidence can convince parents and lazy journalists alike that there is some new , horrible threat to our moral character .

We Heard About It From :
The Evil Genius Dr. Frederic Wertham .
The " Threat : "
1954 was a different time in America .
The streets were safer and kids played just about anywhere they wanted .
Coca - Cola was only five cents a bottle and every kid had a comic book rolled up in his back pocket .
There were superhero comics , crime comics , romance comics and horror comics .
If you forget the rigidly enforced social rules , the racism , bad haircuts and constant threat of nuclear annihilation , the early 50s were a pretty sweet time to be a kid .
And then this fucker showed up to ruin everyone 's fun .
Frederic Wertham .
Or maybe George Burns .
Who could tell ?

Fredic Werthem was a respected psychologist who fought to integrate the mental health care system , refused to serve in a racial - segregated army and was a pioneer in working with troubled youth .
Having conquered all of the real world problems , he then decided to devote his life to bullshit .
During his time working with young offenders , Wertham noticed that many of them were fans of comics .
Forgetting his education and lifetime of experience as a scientist , Wertham assumed that comics must be somehow responsible for the trouble these kids were in .
His 1954 book , Seduction Of The Innocent , outlined what he saw as the depraved effect of comics on kids .
Granted , some comics in the 50s - - especially the horror comics published by E.C. Comics -- were pretty gruesome .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Dr. Wertham is inexplicably shocked by the contents of Shock Illustrated .
But Wertham did n't just go after stories of cold - blooded murder and busty dames .
Oh , no .
We went after the superheroes , too .
In his mind , Wonder Woman was a lesbian who got off on bondage ( we wish ! ) and horror of horrors , Batman and Robin were actually gay lovers .
His evidence for Batman being gay ?
He wore a dressing gown .
Honestly .
That , combined with the fact that he had flowers in his house and had a butler , were proof to Wertham that Bruce Wayne and his young ward Dick Grayson were performing Bat - sodomy behind the scenes .

The lynchpin of Wertham 's case against the Caped Crusader and the Boy Wonder ( okay , that does sound a little gay ) were panels like these :
Hey , if two dedicated crime fighters can't spend a little time under the tanning lights together , then something 's gone terribly wrong with the world .
Leaving questions of Batman and Robin 's perversions aside , Seduction Of The Innocent was a huge bestseller and the tempest that Wertham stirred up led to the end of horror comics and the introduction of the Comics Code , which basically meant that superheroes lost what little balls they had left , and Batman always kept a discreet distance from Robin - at least in public .

But it was n't all bad .
E.C. Comics , faced with the cancellation of all its horror and true crime comics , threw all of its effort into perhaps the single greatest corrupter of America 's youth : Mad Magazine .
Mad Magazine then led to the publication of Cracked , which eventually led to this very website .
So , the next time you 're enjoying an article about sexy cartoon characters you can thank the overactive gay - obsessed imagination of one Dr. Fredric Wertham .
… or “ The Basic Fallacy of all Leftist Economics ”
The political left throughout the world loves to proclaim its eternal devotion to diversity .
They like diverse schools , diverse workplaces , diverse TV shows , diverse music , and on and on .
It turns out , though , that this love of diversity is only skin deep .
That is , the skin of the faces of the people they see as diverse .
When it comes to economic choices , the left invariably believes that choices can and should be made by the intelligent elite for the good of everyone .
How could a group so concerned with diversity believe that the intelligent elite should make economic decisions for millions of people with diverse wants and needs ?
It ’s a good question .
Let ’s start with looking at the left ’s claim to being a reality - based ideology .
Here ’s Ron Suskind revealing the term for the first time :
The aide said that guys like me were ” in what we call the reality - based community , ” which he defined as people who ” believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality . ”
I nodded and murmured something about enlightenment principles and empiricism .
“ Enlightenment principles and empiricism , ” did you hear that ?
The reality - based community believes that solutions can be arrived at through these principles alone .
They ignore a key idea , though :
Logic can only produce a true conclusion when all the premises are known and true .
Most economic and social problems the government tries to solve are so complex they cannot be understood by a single person in their entirety .
Therefore , a community of reality - based thinkers who propose solutions based “ only on their judicious study of discernible reality ” are not reality - based at all .
The problem is that the left , when making economic decisions in reality - based mode , never has complete information .
Yet , from their perspective , they understand the problem completely .
How ?
They fill in the missing information by assuming all people should want the same things .
This assumption manifests a couple of ways .
The first is the simple , unthinking way in which a person reflexively assumes that other people wants what he wants .
This bears a striking resemblance to the way we teach children to be sympathetic to others .
We ask them , “ How would you like that if someone did it to you ? ”
Slipping into this mode of thought when trying to understand an economic problem is forgivable , as it simply a sign of immature thought .
The second manifestation , though , is unforgivable .
It is the idea that all people should want a certain thing , even if their personal needs and desires are different .
To someone in this mindset , wanting something different than what should be wanted is a sign of inferiority that ca n’t be tolerated .
This idea is at the heart of leftist policy .
Look at the list of things banned because you should n’t want them ( from reason. tv ) :
Now , the left tries to cover these bans with appeals to the public good or health and safety , but really they just do n’t want you to have cigarettes , trans fats , internet poker , bacon dogs , incandescent light bulbs , aluminum baseball bats , etc. because they think you should n’t want them in the first place .
It works the other direction , too .
The left thinks that everyone wants certain things from their health insurance , and so mandates them with the force of law .
Thanks , but being a single guy , I really do n’t want to pay for an OB / GYN benefit .
Too bad , I should want it , therefore I get it no matter what .
It ’s the same thing with prescription drugs .
There ’s only one valid risk - reward calculation in this country , the FDA ’s .
It does n’t matter if a person is dying of cancer and is willing to take a chance most would find unreasonable .
The left has determined that you should only take the chances they think are good for you , therefore all you can do is die .
The truth is we all have different wants and needs based on our situation in life and our personal preferences and that it is impossible for government decision makers to know these .
An ideology that truly respects diversity would be in favor of free markets where diverse people can have their diverse needs met to their satisfaction .
Instead , when confronted with this real diversity , all the leftist can say is , “ you should want what I want . ”
A new university is sprouting up in the Bay Area this summer with quite an ambitious charter : solving the world 's biggest problems .
Singularity University , which will be housed on the NASA Ames base near Mountain View and begin classes in June , is the brainchild of Ray Kurzweil and Peter Diamandis .
The two world - renowned scientists were expected to unveil their plans at the TED ( Technology , Entertainment , Design ) conference beginning in Long Beach today .
The school hopes to attract students from a cross section of emerging disciplines - including nanotechnology , biotechnology and information technology - to tackle huge issues facing humanity .
Pandemics and global health care concerns would be typical in scope and import .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
" We are reaching out across the globe to gather the smartest and most passionate future leaders and arm them with the tools and network they need to wrestle with the grand challenges of our day , " said Diamandis , who is perhaps best known for his current work as chairman and CEO of the X Prize Foundation , a group that gives $ 10 million awards to teams working on breakthroughs in fields such as space travel and genomics .
" There is no existing program that will offer the breadth and intensity that SU will offer . "
At the core of the university 's mission is Kurzweil 's theory of " Technological Singularity , " which theorizes that a number of exponentially growing technologies - such as nanotechnology and biotechnology - will massively increase human intelligence over the next two decades and fundamentally reshape the future of humanity .
In his 2005 book , " The Singularity is Near , " Kurzweil famously predicted that artificial intelligence would soon allow machines to improve themselves with unforeseeable consequences .
" Accelerating technologies is really what the university is focusing on , " Kurzweil told The Chronicle .
" We 're at a point where we can apply these exponentially growing information technologies to address the pressing problems of humanity .
Health and medicine .
Poverty .
Democratization . "
Kurzweil , known for his inventions along with his futuristic writings , will act as chancellor and trustee of the new school .
He 'll be joined by Diamandis , who will act as vice chancellor and trustee , and Salim Ismail , a former Yahoo executive , who will work as executive director .
Kurzweil and Diamandis began talking about creating the school last year , which led to a semi-secret meeting on the grounds of NASA Ames on Sept. 20 .
Nobel Prize - winning scientists joined up with NASA engineers and executives from companies like Google Inc. to brainstorm ideas for the new university .
In the end , Google provided some money and NASA provided the physical space to house the school .
Google co-founder Larry Page played a key role in focusing the school 's mission , encouraging its founders to " address the grand challenges of humanity , " according to Kurzweil .
Unlike a traditional university , Singularity will consist of a single , nine - week course of study every summer , during which 120 students from a cross-section of disciplines will mix together to tackle weighty issues .
Tuition will be $ 25,000 .
Candidates will be chosen mostly from graduate and post - graduate programs around the world .
" Disruptive innovation usually comes about when you mash together different disciplines , " said Ismail , who will be the hands - on manager of Singularity U. " It 's important to note that we intend to complement the Stanfords and MITs of the world .
We hope to bring together the products of those schools and help connect them . "
Singularity will also be offering three - day and 10 - day courses for business executives throughout the year , hoping to give them a glimpse of the future in their various industries .
" The Bay Area is the ideal place for this university to be placed , given the venture capital community , the entrepreneurial community and the academic community already in place , " said Diamandis .
Scientific papers are mostly written in LaTeX , a markup language for typesetting .
With LaTeX , a document is programmed rather than edited in a WYSIWYG - way .
There is a great deal of specialized editors or editor modes ( e.g. AucTeX ) simplifying the creation of LaTeX documents .
In many cases , however , you just want to quickly write down what ’s in your head instead of getting stuck in the details of LaTeX markup .
I found that Emacs org - mode is very well suited to fill that gap .
You can efficiently draft a scientific document that can directly be converted into LaTeX code which you can beautify later on .
I ’ll show you here how .
Installation
First , you have to install org - mode for Emacs as described here .
Org-mode is included in Emacs since version 22.1 and the latest version can be obtained from the a git repository via
git clone git://repo.or.cz/org-mode.git
Be sure to use the latest version for this tutorial as there really is some active development going on and some of the features I use were included just recently .
The First Document
Begin by opening a new files with a “ .org ” extension .
Paste the following lines into that document
The Impact of Beer Consumption on Scientific Collaboration
#+AUTHOR : Mario Fasold
* Introduction
** Previous Work
Some studies relating scientific output and beer have previously been done .
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In Europe , most alcohol is consumed as beer and , based on well known negative effects of alcohol consumption on cognitive performance , I predicted negative correlations between beer consumption and several measures of scientific performance .
#+END_QUOTE
( [ [ www.zoologie.upol.cz/osoby/Grim/Grim_Oikos_2008_on-line.pdf ] ] )
* Results
** What beer should you drink
+ Becks
+ Czech Budweiser
+ Duff
The first line contains the title of your document .
It will be used by each of the exporters , e.g. LaTeX or HTML .
Note that there was a bug in the latex exporter , leading to duplicated text after the table - of - contents if the first line of the document was a headline .
Leaving the fist line empty is the suggested workaround here .
The export can be controlled by various parameters that can be set anywhere in the org - document .
The syntax is “ #+ OPTIONS : toc:nil ” , for example ( available options ) .
Some export options that might be useful to create a paper draft include
#+AUTHOR : the author ( default taken from user - full - name )
#+DATE : A date , fixed , of a format string for format - time - string
#+EMAIL : his / her email address ( default from user - mail - address )
Using the very simple org - mode markup , the document then defines some sections , subsections , textblocks and formulas .
Note that only the first three outline levels (* – ***) are used for headlines by default .
Using the markup you can easily define lists , include other files , enter footnotes , define literal and source code blocks ( and even use Emacs font - lock for those areas ) and more .
For example , a text literal is inserted via
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Some example from a text file .
#+END_EXAMPLE
and the following passes code directly into latex
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
All lines between these markers are exported literally
#+END_LaTeX
Another honored mention be the org - tables mode which lets you create and edit and tables in a dead - easy manner ( try to swap a table column in AucTeX … ) .
Figures
Papers and their drafts can’t live without images in most cases .
The following syntax allows since december to insert one
#+CAPTION : Degradation Plot
#+ATTR_LaTeX : scale=0.75
#+LABEL : fig: degradation
[ [./images/DegradationPlot.png ] ]
It ’s a little buggy still , for example , no underscores seem to be allowed within filenames for now .
For more complex cases , you can just write the LaTeX - code ( org - mode will recognize many identifiers ) :
\ begin{figure} [!tpb ]
\centerline {
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{images/BeerPlot}
}\caption
{This is plot looks like a beer.}\label{fig:Beer}
\end {figure}
References
You may also want to include references while drafting the paper .
Luckily , you can use RefTex - Mode ( included in Emacs ) to scan your BibTeX - file ( containing the bibliographies ) and easily insert a reference to an entry of that file .
First , activate RefTex in org - mode by inserting the following lines into .emacs :
( defun org- mode - reftex - setup ()
( load - library " reftex " )
( and ( buffer - file - name )
( file - exists - p ( buffer - file - name ) )
( reftex - parse - all ) )
( define - key org - mode - map ( kbd " C- c ) " ) ' reftex - citation )
)
( add - hook ' org - mode - hook ' org - mode - reftex - setup )
Second , include the BibTeX - file by inserting
\bibliographystyle{plain}

The number of its users is growing by the population of Singapore ( more than four million ) every 12 days and nearly a third of its registered subscribers now use it for business purposes .
As if to celebrate its fifth birthday , IP telephony service provider Skype recently achieved a milestone of 15 million concurrent users , meaning there are now 405 million skype users across the planet .
This figure , they say , is growing by 380,000 every day .
Skype , an eBay company , unveiled these extraordinary figures in Singapore , to mark the launch of its new software Skype 4.0 , which it describes as ' the most exciting and fundamental change to Skype 's software in the company 's history ' .
Despite the downturn , Skype last year earned US $ 550 million in revenue , a 44 per cent rise , year on year .
In the final quarter 2008 , they earned US $ 45 million -- the eight consecutive quarter of profit .
The company offers free calling between subscribers and low - cost ' Skype Out 'calling to standard landline telephones and mobiles .
The software , also allows calls , file transfers , texting , video chat and videoconferencing .
The service is available for desktop computers , notebook and tablet computers and other mobile devices , including mobile phones .
A number of companies , including Skype , produce dedicated Skype phones .
' Skype Out ' revenue growth
According to the company , in the fourth quarter of 2008 , people used 2.6 billion ' SkypeOut minutes ' and that is growing by 61 per cent quarterly .
According to preliminary data , released by TeleGeography Research , Skype accounted for eight per cent of the world 's international calling minutes in 2008 .
Skype maintains that separate research points to 95 per cent of business users saving money using it , with about a third cutting their phone bills by half .
Almost 80 per cent of the survey of ' Skype for Business ' users , showed that nearly 80 per cent had seen an increase in productivity and were working closer with their co-workers because of using Skype .
Perhaps most telling of all , the research shows that some 62 per cent of business subscribers were using Skype to better communicate with their customers .
Keen to grow its business subscribers , Skype now even offers a free ' Business Control Panel ' , a web - based tool that allows company 's to control all of their Skype credit expenditure .
Super wideband audio
Skype 4.0 , which took three years to develop , is claimed to be ' more user - friendly than ever before ' to offer higher quality audio , through ' super wideband audio ' and a new bandwidth manager that provides ' the very best Skype video calling experience possible , even on a low bandwidth connection ' .
According to Dan Neary , Skype 's new Vice President and General Manager , Asia Pacific , " there has never been a better time than now for enterprises -- particularly small to medium businesses -- to consider switching to Skype for their communications " .
" In this type of environment people are looking for cost savings wherever they can find them , they are looking to ' recession - proof ' their businesses , " Neary said .
" They do n't want to fly from A to B , they want to do video - conferencing .
More and more , this offering is becoming applicable for people in business .
" We are quite happy to offer many services that are free , because we know that some people are always going to want to upgrade to our premium paid services . "
Other ' paid for '
Skype features include on line numbers , Skype Voicemail and Skype SMS .
This story , " Skype Growing by 380,000 Users a Day " was originally published by CIO .

It is codenamed “ half - way to world domination A.K.A. the belligerent blue bike shed ” to give an idea where we stand in the grand scheme of things and to commemorate the many fruitful discussions we had during its development .
This release includes a very extensive number of changes , but some of the highlights are : Significant work to support at least decoding of all widespread mainstream proprietary codecs , such as decoders and encoders ( ALAC ; Flash Screen Video ; WMAv2 decoder fixed , WMAv1 / v2 encoder - decoders ; Atrac3 ; MLP / TrueHD ; On2 VP3 improvements and VP5 / VP6 support ; RealVideo RV30/40 ; WMV3 / WMV9 / VC - 1 and IntraX8 frame support for WMV2 / VC - 1 ) ; VDPAU support and much more .. ”
Imagine spending your life savings on an invention you are sure will someday be successful , even if skeptics think it is impossible .
It ’s pretty risky right ?
Well Adam Fuller from Racine , Wisconsin has done this very thing .
He has spent his life savings designing an invention he believes in , a vertical wind turbine .
Will it work ?
In 2007 , the first reports ( Gazette Extra ) of his invention mentioned that his windmill consists of 8 - stacked turbines .
Each turbine has 4 structural steel wind scoops .
In total the vertical turbine has 32 scoops .
It stands 36 feet tall and has a 12 - foot diameter .
Because his wind turbine has multiple points of contact the smallest breeze , from whichever way the wind blows will make the blades spin .
Adam Fuller ’s vertical wind turbine prototype has worked successfully so far .
If funding becomes available once again he would like to build a larger version , 120 - foot model .
Fuller estimates it can produce up to 75,000 kWh each month .
This is estimated to power up to 30 to 70 homes .
Whether his invention will work or not is up for debate , but its clear that Fuller wants to make a difference and is giving it his all to do it .
One neat topic Fuller mentions in the video is the safety of the birds around his invention .
Considering the hot topics about the death of birds due to windmills , because of the size and shape of Fuller ’s vertical wind turbine is it possible that it could be safer for the birds compare to the alternative ?
That ’s definitely something to think about .
What do you think about his invention , how it works and bird safety because of it ?

The much - awaited Public - Private Investment Program , curiously labeled “ PPIP ” was released on Monday creating a massive rally on Wall Street .
Initially we were getting glimpses of the plan through cracks in the financial wall over the weekend and what I was seeing was disappointing .
The confirmation was made when the plan was made public early on Monday .
The public has a right to be outraged .
Not so much for the bonuses to A.I.G. , which are disturbing but the fact that our political system seems to be an extension of the Wall Street and banking elite .
I remember when the $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program was released back in the fall on the pretense that it was going to buy toxic assets .
Remember the storm that created ?
The public was appalled and that initial gut reaction was proven to be right .
Ultimately the first $ 350 billion of the TARP went directly to banks as capital injections and did absolutely nothing for the health of our economy and ultimately was a major safety net for the banks .
Yet the bad assets remained .
No credit lending to average Americans .
Bad assets still there .
TARP 1 was a gift to banks and Wall Street .
Which brings us to the PPIP .
The problem with the PPIP is that it is designed to provide a major subsidy to so - called private investors to buy up toxic assets .
This is a misnomer .
Why is that ?
Language is important in any legislation and especially when presenting a money grab like this one .
First , there is very little about this plan that encourages the “ private sector ” in buying these toxic assets .
At least it is n’t private in the sense that you and 95 percent of Americans would like to think of it as private .
That is to say , if you had some capital laying around and wanted to buy up some toxic assets yourself , you would not be able to do so ?
Why ?
Well let us take a look at the application for this PPIP on the Financial Stability website :
I ’ll get into the details of the plan later in this article but this application pretty much sums up everything that is wrong with this program .
First , participating institutions must have the capacity to raise $ 500 million of private capital .
This is great for bailout participants that are deemed too big to fail since they ’ll have that money easily accessible .
Next , they ’ll need a minimum of $ 10 billion in market value assets under management .
This is important to keep out the riff raff of “ small time investors ” since only the big boys know how to mange money .
Finally , the deadline for the PPIP application is get this , April 10 , 2009 at 5:00 pm Eastern Time .
Bwahahaha !
They already know who is going to get the bids !
So much for that “ open ” market place notion .
They spent such a long time devising this plan and now they expect solid plans to come out in a little over 2 weeks ?
The Treasury already has an idea who is going to play in this game on taxpayer funds and it is the same institutions that created this mess .
If you want a sense of who stands to benefit just look who posted massive rallies today :
Even though the market posted a “ broad ” 7 percent rally , many of these firms tripled that in the same day .
And do n’t think this rally was somehow spurred by the retail investor sitting on the sideline .
You mean the unemployed ran back in to gamble in the stock market ?
You mean to tell me that 50 percent of those in our country that are 1 or 2 paychecks away from financial trouble knew to invest in these firms that stand to benefit the most from this poorly planned investment program ( the real PPIP ) ?
Amazing is n’t it ?
This was a major gift to Wall Street .
This plan was being built over time while Americans were kept in the dark .
Remember on March 6 when word was spreading that the FDIC was going to go to the Senate for $ 500 billion ?
“ WASHINGTON — Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd is moving to allow the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to temporarily borrow as much as $ 500 billion from the Treasury Department .
The Connecticut Democrat ’s effort — which comes in response to urging from FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner — would give the FDIC access to more money to rebuild its fund that insures consumers ’ deposits , which have been hard hit by a string of bank failures .
Ms. Bair said a change in the law would give the FDIC more options to determine the best way to rebuild its depleted fund .
In an interview , she stressed that all insured deposits were already backed by the “ full faith and credit of the United States government . ”
Scammed again !
The subtle pretext here of course was that the funds were going to be used to protect consumer deposits , which of course , is something most Americans would back and did .
Instead , that $ 500 billion which is now the amount the FDIC will insure is the amount we will be backing for Tim and Ben ’s excellent adventure into converting the United States into a mega hedge fund .
So this fund was being beefed up for the PPIP that was released on Monday .
Okay , let us start digging into the details of the PPIP :
“ Despite these efforts , the financial system is still working against economic recovery .
One major reason is the problem of “ legacy assets ” – both real estate loans held directly on the books of banks ( “ legacy loans ” ) and securities backed by loan portfolios ( “ legacy securities ” ) .
These assets create uncertainty around the balance sheets of these financial institutions , compromising their ability to raise capital and their willingness to increase lending . ”
Now you may be wondering , what in the world is a “ legacy loan ” or a “ legacy security ? ”
Frankly it was n’t going to sell if they called it “ toxic-ninja-fog-a-mirror-no-pulse-zero-down-subprime-non-prime- alt-a-okay - smoldering - junk - pile ” loan program .
Did n’t have a nice ring like legacy loans .
Using the word legacy tries to give this program some mythical powers .
Calling this a legacy loan is tantamount to calling a pimple a beauty mark .
So right off the bat , this is disingenuous .
Also , the reason banks can’t raise capital or lend is because their business models were based on selling “ legacy loans ” in the first place !
Let us read more :
“ Creation of a Negative Economic Cycle :
As a result , a negative cycle has developed where
declining asset prices have triggered further deleveraging , which has in turn led to further price
declines .
The excessive discounts embedded in some legacy asset prices are now straining the
capital of U.S. financial institutions , limiting their ability to lend and increasing the cost of credit
throughout the financial system .
The lack of clarity about the value of these legacy assets has also
made it difficult for some financial institutions to raise new private capital on their own . ”
Believe it or not , the declining asset prices are the markets way of popping the bubble and trying to find a bottom .
The assumption above is that these assets are now marked with “ excessive discounts ” and that assumption in fact is incorrect .
As we have seen with over a hundred homes profiled here in Southern California , some loans are actually worthless .
It is very possible that some mortgage portfolios are only worth 20 or 30 cents on the dollar .
Is that so hard to believe with the rampant systemic fraud in the system ?
It is only hard to believe if you live in a Wall Street world so disconnected from Main Street that they forget how it really is to work for a living and the massive surges with unemployment are only a ticker on a Bloomberg Terminal .
They forget that what is inconvenient in their models is many people are simply unable to pay these loans .
There are now many sub-divisions that boomed that have no economic viability or sustainability .
That is , we will see some areas become ghost towns .
Now how much are those loans worth ?
There is “ clarity ” on these legacy loans just not the clarity Wall Street or banks would like to see .
Think like a bank for a minute .
We ’ll call you Bank X .
You ’ve made a ton of horrible Pay Option Adjustable Rate Mortgages during the boom .
You have $ 1 billion of these bad loans .
Yet many of them are still paying because they are set to recast in the next few years .
Yet you know once they recast , they will start defaulting ( you are already seeing signs of this ) .
You also have a portfolio of $ 1 billion of fixed prime mortgages .
These are paying like clockwork .
You have another portfolio of Alt - A loans on fixed terms paying on time as well but defaults are rising .
Take a wild guess which bundle is going to be put up for auction ?
It ’ll be the $ 1 billion in Pay Option ARMs .
You would be insane as a bank to let go of any of the actual good loans .
So right off the bat the incentive is to get rid of the worst loans .
This was my entire point with temporarily nationalizing the banks .
Banks are not going to lend until the bad assets are off their books .
Someone is going to pay .
If we nationalized , at least we shared on the upside potential .
Plus , we get to eliminate management , wipe out shareholders , and spend the actual cash on getting lending going again with a new model .
We are already paying through the nose but we are basically nationalizing the profits for the banks and “ private partners ” while socializing the massive losses .
Is it any wonder that in a recent poll 41 percent of Americans are now saying , “ let the banks fail ” and are outraged ?
Philosophically the plan is horrible for the taxpayer as you can see but let us keep on reading :
“ Three Basic Principles : Using $ 75 to $ 100 billion in TARP capital and capital from private investors , the Public - Private Investment Program will generate $ 500 billion in purchasing power to buy legacy assets – with the potential to expand to $ 1 trillion over time .
The Public - Private Investment Program will be designed around three basic principles :
Maximizing the Impact of Each Taxpayer Dollar : First , by using government financing in
partnership with the FDIC and Federal Reserve and co-investment with private sector investors ,
substantial purchasing power will be created , making the most of taxpayer resources .
Shared Risk and Profits With Private Sector Participants : Second , the Public - Private
Investment Program ensures that private sector participants invest alongside the taxpayer , with
the private sector investors standing to lose their entire investment in a downside scenario and the
taxpayer sharing in profitable returns .
Private Sector Price Discovery : Third , to reduce the likelihood that the government will overpay
for these assets , private sector investors competing with one another will establish the price of the
loans and securities purchased under the program . ”
Now we ’re getting to the nuts and bolts of this thing .
I ’ve gotten a few e-mails of people asking , “ well they still have to pass this right ? ” Nope .
Remember that $ 500 billion FDIC bait and switch above ?
That money is good to go .
The other $ 100 billion is coming from the craptastic TARP .
There is a Monty Python skit in the fact that the TARP is funding the PPIP , which will get loans from the FDIC .
Let us go through these three so - called basic principles .
First , you are not maximizing each taxpayer dollar .
The notion that we are sharing risk with private sector participants is absurd because they are hedged to the max as we will soon see .
Finally , this price discovery notion is insane .
By default we ARE GOING TO OVERPAY !
That is the entire point of this exercise .
The market has already discovered the price .
It is 20 cents or 30 cents for each dollar .
That does n’t work for Wall Street or banks so therefore they need to juice up the game by subsidizing the adventure of more hedge funds , banks , or others that actually created this crony model of investing .
The irony here is that nationalization would have discovered the prices much quicker .
And this would have been the truly private - public model .
Why ?
Remember the notion of portfolios ?
Once the toxic assets were isolated , they would be sold off to the private market .
I assure you that there are many private investors licking their chops to buy loans at 40 or 50 cents on the dollar .
Remember we are already losing money here with the PPIP .
And this would have been a much more open market because guess what ?
You already have the system in place to sell these loans .
In fact , the FDIC could have then used the money to loan out to private investors , both big or small .
That is truly opening it up to the market .
Instead , we are setting up a system where large middlemen are going to buy these loans and then what ?
That is right , SELL THEM TO INVESTORS !
Have n’t we learned that a toxic loan is a toxic loan no matter what you do or call it ?
You have to love this logic :
“ The Merits of This Approach : This approach is superior to the alternatives of either hoping for banks to gradually work these assets off their books or of the government purchasing the assets directly .
Simply hoping for banks to work legacy assets off over time risks prolonging a financial crisis , as in the case of the Japanese experience .
But if the government acts alone in directly purchasing legacy assets , taxpayers will take on all the risk of such purchases – along with the additional risk that taxpayers will overpay if government employees are setting the price for those assets . ”
Bwahaha !
By subsidizing large private investors we are already guaranteeing that we ’ll be overpaying for these assets .
By the way , as we ’ll discuss soon , these private investors are only going to be putting in $ 6 for control of $ 84 which is basically leveraging up to 14 freaking times !
Here we are beating up on banks and Wall Street for leveraging up 12:1 or 20:1 and we are designing a program with 14:1 leverage !
And the downside is minimal for investors .
All they risk is $ 6 . 14 times on the upside and 1 time on the downside ?
Did Geithner consult with Mozilo for this plan ?
The premise of “ the government will overpay if we take over ” and the boogeyman of nationalization creeping to socialism has kept any sensible plan from being implemented .
Now , we are assured a massive overpayment for these toxic assets .
Geithner is right that we are not going to have a Japanese experience .
Japan zombified banks .
With this plan we just zombified the taxpayer .
Here is the breakdown of the program :
It is n’t true that the leverage will be 6:1 .
It is looking more like 14:1 .
What they are assuming via the 6:1 ratio is they are counting the Treasury matching funds as actual equity and only looking at the FDIC loan as debt .
That is n’t the case .
Those Treasury funds are coming from the taxpayer TARP !
Since when did the TARP become a private hedge fund ?
When you see the math of this you really get a sense of how absurd this is going to play out :
I love the PR wording in this .
Divest instead of dumping this crap onto taxpayers .
Legacy loans instead of toxic assets .
So the above is a basic scenario .
We have a $ 100 craptastic pool of loans .
The highest private bid comes in at $ 84 .
It then breaks down as follows :
FDIC : $ 72 loan
Treasury : $ 6
Private Investor : $ 6
Total : $ 84
I love step 6 here .
For $ 6 , these private investors now fully control the entire pool of mortgages .
And one more thing , the loan from the FDIC is NON - RECOURSE .
It just does n’t get better for these private investors and frankly , the banks .
Who will suffer ?
The taxpayer .
What the government is doing is creating a musical chair game once again .
The first investor will want to sell this pool off for a premium and who really cares since the loan is non-recourse , creating another phony market .
Eventually the last bag holder will realize that indeed , the loans are still crap and the full losses will fall flat on the taxpayer ’s shoulders .
Of course this plan is being scrutinized by many people but take a look at this shady scenario .
Say I am Bank X again .
I have a loan portfolio on my books at $ 1 billion full of horrible loans .
I ’m the bank and have full access to documentation and verify that yes , these are some sweet smelling legacy loans .
In fact , some preliminary bids are at 20 cents on the dollar and even I think that is overpriced .
What do I do ?
Well say I am a big player and apply for the PPIP .
What is to stop me from being a bidder here ?
After all , if I sell this portfolio on the market I will only get $ 200 million and recognize a mega loss of $ 800 million .
That would sink my bank .
So we get ready and go bidding .
Let us assume we use that 84 mark used in the Treasury example :
FDIC : $ 720 million loan
Treasury $ 60 million
Private Investor : $ 60 million
Total : $ 840 million
This is a freaking no brainer as the bank !
And remember , many of these banks have been sitting on those capital injections since they sure as hell are n’t lending so they have some of our cash stashed away to play with .
So as the bank , we can them limit our downside here for a mere $ 60 million on a $ 1 billion portfolio .
Sure beats an $ 800 million loss .
In fact , we can even overbid :
Face value : $ 1 billion
FDIC : $ 1,080 million
Treasury : $ 90 million
Private investor : $ 90 million
Total : $ 1.26 billion
The FDIC better have measures against gaming of this sort .
Think about it .
As a big bank $ 90 million for unloading a $ 1 billion toxic portfolio is worth it .
It would be a perfect hedge for these banks .
An excellent out .
PIMCO and Blackrock must be itching to go for these things .
Bottom line ?
This is one gigantic put option for private investors .
If you lose , so what .
You only lose the premium put in since the loan is non-recourse .
If you hit the pot of gold , then you make out like a bandit gambling with the taxpayer money .
That is n’t going to happen .
What is going to happen is short term gaming , Pollyanna thinking , and a stealth cleansing of the books which eventually will zombify the taxpayer .
At a certain point these assets will hit the market .
Who is going to buy these homes at inflated prices ?
The only reason home sales are bouncing up recently is because of nearly 50 percent of the homes being sold are foreclosure re-sales at rock bottom prices .
This plan runs along the same vein of the initial Paulson TARP .
That somehow , the only reason banks are n’t lending is because of these stubborn toxic loans .
That premise is false .
The reason banks have pulled back on lending is because there is a limited pool of qualified borrowers .
This plan fails to address that .
How do you get a qualified pool of borrowers ?
By having a strong middle class that is employed .
Finance should be the grease that keeps the engine going .
Yet in our last decade , finance became the actual engine .
That is the root of the problem .
This kind of inside the box thinking shows how entrenched this mentality is .
In fact , there is little room in the plan to acknowledge , “ maybe these toxic assets are worth what the current bids are . ”
No , of course that can not be .
We need to make up all these convoluted programs with acronyms like PPIP , TARP , ABCP , etc and hope the average American blanks out or fails to do the math .
6 months after TARP , we are in a worse position .
Where will we be 6 months after PPIP ?

Though it might seem like a left - field concept to some , it ’s important that we do n’t forget that dinosaurs , dodos and other creatures that once roamed freely about our lands have long since died out .
Top scientists now warn that our seas face a similar catastrophe thanks to a rise in ocean acidification .
A Sea Change is a new , hard - hitting documentary that draws public attention to this urgent but little - known crisis threatening over 1,000,000 species with extinctionâ € ” and with them , our entire way of life .
The documentary follows retired educator ( and concerned grandfather ) Sven Huseby on a journey back to stunning ancestral sites in Norway , Alaska and the Pacific Northwest .
There he finds cutting - edge ocean research underway .
His journey of self - discovery brings adventure , surprise and revelation to the science of ocean acidification .
World Premiere at the DC Environmental Film Festival
The world premiere at the D.C. Environmental Film Festival brought in record - breaking audiences .
D.C. ’s BairdÂ Auditorium where it was held , filled all 565 seats , with another 40 people who stood and 150 who could n’t get in at all .
( See NBC4 Anchor Wendy Rieger ’s blog about how happy she was to not get a seat . )
Director Barbara Ettinger and co-producer / protagonist Sven Huseby were received with a standing ovation following the screening .
And two - thirds of the audience stayed for the Q&A , moderated by Brad Warren , Sustainable Fisheries Partnership .
The Washington Post said that the movie calls for some tough love on the part of even the most sympathetic viewer :
“ A Sea Change , ” which was co-produced by Huseby and directed by Barbara Ettinger , looks terrific , with lots of breathtaking footage of the natural world , from the tiniest pteropod ( the fluttery , planktonic sea snail that is most threatened by acidification ) to the most majestic Norwegian scenery .
And , at a time when plenty of documentaries want to be the “ Inconvenient Truth ” of fill - in - the - issue , “ A Sea Change ” brings a genuinely important subject to the fore with a welcome lack of jargon and preaching . ”
Here ’s the movie trailer and a rundown of upcoming public screenings :

Bob Dinneen , president of the Renewable Fuels Association , a trade group , estimated that of the country ’s 150 ethanol companies and 180 plants , 10 or more companies have shut down 24 plants over the last three months .
That has idled about 2 billion gallons out of 12.5 billion gallons of annual production capacity .
Mr. Dinneen estimated that a dozen more companies were in distress .
Ronald H. Miller , the president and chief executive of Aventine Renewable Energy , said , “ The economics right now are very poor . ”
Aventine has suspended construction of one Nebraska plant and delayed completion of a second in Indiana .
This is not how it was supposed to be when Congress mandated in 2007 that refiners blend increasing amounts of ethanol into the country ’s transportation fuel supply .
The law came at a time when the country ’s thirst for gasoline seemed unquenchable , and oil prices seemed only to go up .
In an effort to reduce the country ’s dependence on foreign oil and to lower the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming , Congress mandated a doubling of corn ethanol use , to 15 billion gallons a year by 2015 .
Congress also mandated , by 2022 , the use of an additional 21 billion gallons of ethanol and other biofuels produced from materials collectively known as biomass .
The potential materials include corn stubble , wood chips and straw .
Congress hoped that advanced biofuels would overcome the longstanding controversies associated with corn ethanol , including the contention that its production raises food prices .
Congress started small , decreeing that industry produce 100 million gallons of advanced biofuels next year and 250 million gallons in 2011 .
But it is becoming clear that even these modest targets will not be met .
Producing the advanced fuels entails breaking down a tough material , cellulose , that is abundant in corn cobs , wood chips and other biological waste , then converting it to liquid fuel .
While scientists have proven it can be done , the cost is still high , and little if any cellulosic ethanol is being produced at commercial scale .
Carlos A. Riva , president and chief executive of Verenium , a company working to produce ethanol from sugar cane waste , said that solving the technological hurdles for this type of fuel was “ not a slam dunk . ”
But he and other executives say they are optimistic the challenges can be overcome , and the 2011 and 2012 targets may be met a few years late .

Hotties and Notties
There ’s been a “ serious ” : http://www.themonkeycage.org/2009/01/the_best_jobs_and_the_worst.html “ debate ” : http://www.themonkeycage.org/2009/01/ivory_tower_sexytime.html at the “ other place where I blog ” : https://www.crookedtimber.org over whether academia in general , and political science in particular is a sexy profession .
I ’m glad to say that we actually have Real Social Scientific Data1 that we can bring to bear on this topic .
In 2006 , James Felton , Peter T. Koper , John Mitchell and Michael Stinson “ conducted research ” : http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=918283 that sought to establish , _inter alia_ how perceived hotness of professors affected their RateMyProfessors evaluations for teaching quality .
As part of this exercise , Felton et al. ranked ( Table 2 in their paper ) the relative hotness quotients of 36 different academic disciplines .
My estimable colleague John Sides prepared a nice graph of the Felton et al. data ( see below ) .
Three important research findings leap out from this picture .
First – that academic disciplines are , without exception , more ‘ not ’ than ‘ hot . ’
When adjusted positive and negative hotness scores are totted up against each other , no discipline does better than – 0.062 ( Languages ) .
Thus , the main hypothesis of “ Careerbuilder et al .
2009 ” : http://msn.careerbuilder.com/Article/MSN-1737-Job-Info-and-Trends-10-Sexy-Careers-You-Never-Thought-Of/?sc_extcmp=JS_1737_hotmail1&SiteId=cbmsnhm41737&ArticleID=1737>1=23000&cbRecursionCnt=1&cbsid=3af4ed160fc34141a4e6546d5cc61da3-284680908-R9-4 is decisively refuted .
Second , the above proviso aside , political scientists are pretty damn hot in comparative terms .
We rank as number 5 , trailing only languages , law , religion and criminal justice .
From eyeballing the data , it looks as though there is a minor discontinuity right after political science , where the hotness lurches down a notch , and another , more significant one between psychology ( at number 10 ) and finance ( at number 11 ) .
Third , economists are , without any jot , tittle , scintilla or iota of doubt or ambiguity , the notties rather than the hotties of the social sciences ( coming 30th out of 36 ) .
Tough luck , John .
Sociologists are sixth ( heh ) , philosophers come in at number 9 ( which is a perfectly respectable score , I suppose ) , and English professors are middlin ’ , at number 12 in the ranking .
( An earlier version of this post appeared at “ The Monkey Cage ” : http://www.themonkeycage.org)
1 Real Social Scientific Data is a term of art here , meaning ‘ statistics that are sufficiently entertaining and gratifying2 that I really do n’t want to look at them too hard . ’
This understanding of data is very commonly applied in the public sphere of learned debate although it is , perhaps surprisingly , rarely spelled out in explicit terms .
I note in passing that some commenter at the Monkey Cage wants to control for differences in sex ratios between professors and students and similar irrelevant persnickets .
All I want to say to this pedant ( whom I suspect to be a jealous chemistry professor or denizen of a similarly low - ranked discipline ) is _political science is number 5 !
Suck on it ._
2 In a collective rather than individual sense ( I do n’t imagine that I ’m pulling my discipline ’s score up ) .

GM is struggling in the dire market for new cars
The European Commission has called for a crisis meeting among EU states hosting General Motors ( GM ) plants .
EU Industry Commissioner Guenter Verheugen said that the way GM was " dealing with the issue of Europe is not acceptable " .
Earlier , the troubled carmaker 's auditors said there was " substantial doubt " about the ability of General Motors to stay afloat .
Last week GM posted a $ 30.9 bn ( £ 21.9 bn ) loss for 2008 .
It also warned that 2009 was set to be " challenging " .
Shares in General Motors fell more than 15 % in New York trading .
European worries
We expect GM to disclose everything
Guenter Verheugen , EU Industry Commissioner Earlier this week , GM's top executive warned the European divisions of General Motors ( GM ) could collapse within weeks without European governments ' help - costing up to 300,000 jobs .
Chief operating officer Fritz Henderson also said governments should step in immediately to ensure GM Europe did not run out of money by April or May .
Mr Verheugen said : " We expect GM to disclose everything , " What are their plans with their European daughter companies and locations ?
What are they doing with property rights , and especially is GM prepared to maintain responsibility for the European companies or not ? "
He said that at the emergency meeting he wanted to find out " what the different member states that have GM sites are considering to do " .
EU countries that have GM - related production plants include Britain , Belgium , Poland , Germany , Spain and Sweden .
Some other EU states host suppliers .
Liquidation fear Ongoing losses and the struggle to generate cash flow meant the firm 's ability to continue as a going concern should be questioned , said the auditors .
The firm , which plans to cut 47,000 jobs , has said it might need another $ 22.6 bn in government loans to survive .
It had already received $ 13.4bn in federal loans as it struggles in what analysts say is the worst vehicle sales market in 27 years .
GM said that its creditors had decided not to force the company to repay more than $ 6bn in loans following the auditor 's warning , in order to let GM press the case for more government financial aid .
" The corporation 's recurring losses from operations , stockholders ' deficit , and inability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations and sustain its operations raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern , " auditors for Deloitte & Touche wrote in the annual report .
GM reiterated on Thursday that a bankruptcy filing could lead to liquidation , as the company would not have enough funds to finance its reorganisation .
Besides , consumers could be reluctant to buy bankrupt carmakers ' vehicles , GM said .
According to GM , its February sales plummeted 53 % from a year earlier , while its rival Ford posted a 48 % drop .
The auditors ' remarks reflect comments already made by the firm about its difficulties .
GM said in its annual report : " Our future is dependent on our ability to execute our viability plan .
" If we fail to do so for any reason , we would not be able to continue as a going concern and could potentially be forced to seek relief through a filing under the US bankruptcy code . "

( CNN ) --
Over the years digital signage in public places has become an increasingly common sight in shopping centers around the world .
TruMedia have been pioneering the smart sign surveillance technology .
However until recently there 's always been one big problem with the expensive advertising medium :
How can advertisers tell if anyone is actually watching it ?
To solve that problem , ad companies are turning to technologies more commonly used to track terrorists than trace consumer behavior in an attempt to regain ground with fragmented audiences .
The new breed of digital signs are capable of measuring which ads are most appealing to what demographic , even instantly changing screen content based upon the age and sex of the people in front of it .
They would be able to switch to flower - scented shampoo for young females , arthritis medicine for senior citizens , or a new sports car for younger men .
The smart signs digest all the information they see and create a profile without ever having to ask you a single question or tell you that they doing it .
This is why a growing number of privacy advocates are raising red flags about just how far retailers are willing to go to reach target audiences .
" Whenever we talk about our technology , everybody always says , ' Is Big Brother watching ? ' " said Vicki Rabenou , chief measurement officer of Florida - based TruMedia Technologies , a company that designs and sells audience measurement solutions based on surveillance systems used by the Israeli Government .
One of the company 's main products called the iCapture AlliO , which Samsung Electronics recently licensed to manufacture with some of its LCD screens , is an oblong black box containing cameras and software capable of generating detailed demographic reports about audiences and can change ad content in real - time depending on who it determines is in front of the sign .
" We never record anything .
We never actually attach a name to the face or a name to the data or a face to the data , " said Rabenou .
" We only generate the data .
It is just plain data . "
TruMedia , whose slogan is " Every Face Counts , " has a privacy policy clearly stated on their web page , however other companies do not , and , according to Harley Geiger of the U.S. - based Center for Democracy and Technology , this is a big problem .
" I call it the beginning of surveillance for profit , " said Geiger .
" Companies do n't have to be forthcoming about whether they are using this stuff .
The only person they really need to report to is their client . "
" We simply do n't know how many companies are doing this because companies do n't have to tell us , and there is nothing saying that they do , " added Geiger .
" And in a recession there will be even more of a push to get your advertisements in front of consumers and for advertisers to save dollars and manufacturers to save money . "
Proponents of audience measurement technologies say it is more crucial than ever to support its integration into the burgeoning digital signage industry , which , despite the downturn , analysts predict will grow by nearly 20 percent this year .
" Until today , out - of - home media based advertising was suffering because it was an unmeasured media , and as an unmeasured media , it was undervalued by the advertiser , " said Rabenou .
" Nobody would allocate their media money to this unless you have some type of measurement .
Let 's support the industry .
Let 's let it flourish . "
Watching you shop , to shop better
Other companies are layering even more technologies on top of digital signage networks to further pinpoint consumer behavior , moving beyond generic demographics to collecting information about individual shoppers , their preferences , purchase histories , habits and even hobbies .
Some retailers , for example , have discussed implanting RFID tags , or wireless tracking devices , into loyalty cards .
When customers walk into a store , kiosks would read the tiny chips , offering them discounts or other promotions based upon their individual purchase history .
In 2004 , German supermarket chain Metro AG tested such a system in one of its locations , implanting 10,000 RFID chips in rewards cards , but ultimately decided to drop the program after a consumer backlash .
" With the loyalty card , if you give them your information , they will know that it is Harley Geiger who just walked in the store , " said Geiger .
" And that is a big difference . "
" Who do the companies share this information with and to whom is it accessible ? " he added .
" How would they respond to a warrant or subpoena ?
What policies do they have in place for that ? "
However others argue that the more information retailers are able to collect about their customers , the better it is for consumers and their overall shopping experience .
" Who would n't you want to walk into a store where people do n't have to ask your name because they already know you ? " said John Eisenhauer , head of Seattle - based Kombi , a company developing smart - phone software for use in retail spaces .
" Any number of us have chosen to join loyalty programs , and we chose to join because of the benefits those programs deliver . "
Many stores are already incorporating cell phones into their digital signage infrastructure .
In Japan , for example , digital signs developed by NEC Corporation often have bar codes integrated into ad content , which customers can snap pictures of with their mobiles and take to checkout counters to redeem free items or discounts .
Other billboards have numbers that consumers can text to receive various promotions .
The technology Eisenhauer is creating for smart - phones is a downloadable application that would , among other things , allow retailers , with customer consent , to access information on an individual 's social networking site .
When that person is then in the retailer 's store or nearby in a shopping mall , the store 's network could send messages to his or her cell phone if other friends are in the area or send other customized information tailored to a customer 's preferences , habits or hobbies .
" Our intention is to push into a Web 3.0 world where social networks occur in real space in real time with real people looking each other in the eye , and the shopping experience is taking place where I can touch the clothes , touch the shoes , touch the cars in real space and real time , " said Eisenhauer .
" I get the best of both worlds . "
" If you are at the mall and you can find out whether any of your other friends are there who might be able to take 20 minutes out for a cheeseburger , " said Eisenhauer .
" Would that be great ? "
Stroustrup ’s C++ Design Goals in 1986
From “ An Overview of C++ , ” by Bjarne Stroustrup , SIGPLAN Notices , 1986 - 10 .
Section 6 . What is Missing ?
C++ was designed under severe constraints of compatibility , internal consistency , and efficiency : no feature was included that
would cause a serious incompatibility with C at the source or linker levels .
would cause run-time or space overheads for a program that did not use it .
would increase run-time or space requirements for a C program .
would significantly increase the compile time compared with C. could only be implemented by making requirements of the programming environment ( linker , loader , etc. ) that could not be simply and efficiently implemented in a traditional C programming environment .
Features that might have been provided but were n’t because of these criteria include garbage collection , parameterized classes , exceptions , multiple inheritance , support for concurrency , and integration of the language with a programming environment .
Not all of these possible extensions would actually be appropriate for C++ , and unless great constraint is exercised when selecting and designing features for a language , a large , unwieldy , and inefficient mess will result .
The severe constraints on the design of C++ have probably been beneficial and will continue to guide the evolution of C ++.
COLOMBO
Humanitarian conditions in the north - eastern conflict zone are deteriorating , warns the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) , with thousands of civilians inside a government safe area at risk of shelling and lacking safe drinking water and sanitation .
The warning comes as clashes between government forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) , who have been fighting for an independent homeland since 1983 , intensify .
“ The situation is desperate .
The population trapped inside the combat zone has been displaced so many times .
It is completely dependent on outside supplies [ of food and medicine ] for survival , ” Sophie Romanens , ICRC communications coordinator in Sri Lanka , told IRIN .
In a statement on 17 March , ICRC confirmed that tens of thousands of people confined to a rapidly shrinking area had headed for the coast to escape the fighting , in search of safety , food and medical care .
“ The area is affected by shelling every day , and the cramped conditions and lack of water and proper sanitation are putting people at risk of epidemics , ” the ICRC , the only international agency with a staff presence inside the combat zone , said .
Heavy rains are compounding the problem .
“ You can just imagine the situation , with thousands of people under tarpaulins or tents and water everywhere , and poor sanitation facilities , ” Romanens said .
Fighting between Sri Lankan government forces and the LTTE has forced tens of thousands to flee in and around the northern Mullaithivu District since late December .
Most have moved into a 12 km no - fire zone declared by the government at the eastern edge of the combat zone on 21 February .
The ICRC calculates that up to 150,000 people may be trapped inside the combat zone , while the government puts that figure at 70,000 .
According to the authorities , more than 42,000 have fled to government - controlled areas and are now being housed at 22 relief sites in the northern districts of Mannar , Vavuniya and Jaffna .
Over 1,500 escaped into government areas in the last week .
Since early February the ICRC has been facilitating the sea - borne evacuation of sick and wounded civilians and the transport of supplies to the combat zone by ship after the suspension of overland convoys due to deteriorating security .
The Sri Lankan government said that despite allegations that the bulk of the supplies sent to combat zones were being siphoned off by the LTTE , deliveries would continue .
“ We can send medicine , we can send food stuffs [ to the combat zone ] , but the LTTE takes charge of all of them , ” Nimal Siripala de Silva , the Sri Lankan Health Minister , told a press conference at the Foreign Ministry on 17 March .
“ What they give [ to the civilians ] is a small portion [ but ] because of that we are not stopping the inflow of medicine and food items .
” The ICRC said the naval supply route was now a vital lifeline into the combat zone .
“ With patients continuing to arrive at the improvised medical facility in Putumattalan [ a coastal village inside the safe zone ] , it is essential that evacuations take place regularly and without interference , ” Morven Murchison , ICRC medical coordinator in Sri Lanka , said .
" It is encouraging to see food and medicines going into the conflict area , but they must be delivered regularly if they are to have an impact .

You know what ?
I ’ll admit it .
Not only did I pay to see Alien vs. Predator in theaters , I paid to see Alien vs. Predator : Requiem on the silver screen as well .
There is no denying how awful the movies were , but come on , they ’re fun .
And yes , I am eagerly awaiting a third movie , and paying close attention to the rumors .
These ads , created by DDB New Zealand , are , at least according to the folks at Super Punch , probably advertising the fact that Alien vs. Predator will be on television .
You can check out a third shot of Alien and Predator playing swing ball on Super Punch , as well as load up the full , high rez version of the ads .

“ He told me he was sleeping on the floor of the cell when a very large man came in and dumped cold water on him and began hitting him with a thick cable , ” Uday al - Zaidi said in the TV interview .
He said his brother had told him that he was brutally beaten by several men and burned on his right ear by a cigarette .
Uday al - Zaidi said that on Sunday his brother had bruises on his face , stitches on the bridge of his nose and swelling in his legs , arms and hands .
His jailers had periodically demanded that he state in a videotaped confession that he had been ordered to commit the act by enemies of the prime minister , Uday al - Zaidi said his brother had told him .
Uday al - Zaidi said his brother had said : “ After the torture and the cold - water shower , I told them to bring me a blank sheet of paper and I would sign it , and they could write whatever they wanted .
I am ready to say I am a terrorist or whatever you want . ”
But Muntader al - Zaidi told his brother that the men had stopped beating him and did not force him to write or sign anything .
The journalist said that a letter to the prime minister written by him from jail expressing regret for the attack had not been coerced , his brother said .
It was unclear if this was the same letter Mr. Maliki referred to .
Uday al - Zaidi said his brother told him that he had bought the shoes  used  at a market in Cairo .
Meanwhile , leaders of the blocs in Parliament reached consensus on Sunday on a resolution that would allow troops from Britain , Australia and other countries to operate on Iraqi soil after the end of the year .
The resolution grants the Iraqi government the authority to set the terms for the presence of those troops , as long as they are to be out of Iraq by the end of July , said Taha Diraa , a lawmaker from the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq , a leading Shiite party .
The author and playwright Hanif Kureishi was born in London in 1954 .
He is the author of The Buddha of Suburbia , Intimacy and Something to Tell You .
His first play , Soaking the Heat , was staged in 1976 , and My Beautiful Laundrette , for which he wrote the screenplay , was released in 1985 .
He was appointed CBE in 2007 , for services to literature and drama .
Here he briefly tells BBC News his thoughts about religion .
Would you describe yourself as religious ?
I 've always been fascinated by religion .
For me it 's the deepest form of human expression , along with culture .
Hanif Kureishi's favourite religious song is the Rolling Stones 's " Sympathy for the Devil " God is mankind 's finest creation .
Has there been a better idea than that of God ?
Do you believe in God , and if so , what sort of god ?
I believe in the need to understand what the idea of God , or gods , do for us .
What do you think happens after you die ?
You dissolve into the minds of others , and you haunt them until they are tired of you , and even after .
Does it change your view of someone when you find out that they are religious and how ?
You have to think about whether they are merely following the values of those around them , or whether they are delusional psychotics !
Is religion a good thing ?
That 's an impossible question .
Most people in most societies during human history have lived in what could be described as ' religious ' communities .
Religions , like novels and myths , describe the world and help make it safer .
What impact has religion had on your life ?
It 's made me think about the important questions : sexuality , childhood , authority , death , power .
Have you ever had a religious experience and can you describe it ?
I was thrown out of the East London mosque for being a dissident writer and critic of radical Islam .
What is your favourite religious song ?
Sympathy for the Devil , by the Rolling Stones .
What religious leader , if any , most inspires you ?
Most religious leaders are ignorant fools .
It 's a shame so few of them are intelligent or even interesting .
It makes you wonder why the dullest people hang around religions .
Gives the whole thing a bad name .
What is your favourite religious book ?
The most interesting work about the use of religion as a form of organisation of the resentful and envious is Nietzsche 's " On The Genealogy of Morals " .

Molecules - to - man evolution requires that non-intelligent processes could produce vast quantities of functional complex information .
Molecules - to - man evolution is the theory that everything made itself , and that no creator was necessary .
But this requires that non-intelligent processes could produce vast quantities of functional complex information .
Even the simplest free - living organism carries the equivalent information of a 500 - page book ; humans have as much information as a thousand 500 - page volumes .
A big obstacle for evolutionary belief is this :
What mechanism could possibly have added all the extra information required to transform a one - celled creature progressively into pelicans , palm trees , and people ?
Natural selection alone can’t do it — selection involves getting rid of information .
A group of creatures might become more adapted to the cold , for example , by the elimination of those which do n’t carry the genetic information to make thick fur .
But that does n’t explain the origin of the information to make thick fur .
Also , natural selection by definition is the survival of the fittest , meaning those who leave the most surviving offspring .
Therefore it requires self - reproducing entities to start with .
So it is powerless to explain the origin of the vast quantities of information of the first self - reproducing cell .
For evolutionists there is only “ one game in town ” to explain the new information which their theory requires — mutations .
These are accidental mistakes as the genetic ( DNA ) information ( the coded set of instructions which is the “ recipe ” or “ blueprint ” specifying the construction and operation of any creature ) is copied from one generation to the next .
Naturally , such scrambling of information will often be harmful — thousands of hereditary diseases in people , for instance , are caused by just such inherited mutational defects .
At best they may be neutral — having no effect on the outcome , or the expressed meaning of the code .
Using English as an ( admittedly limited ) analogy , assume a message were transmitted saying “ the enemy is now attacking ” , which accidentally suffers a one - letter substitution changing it to “ the enemy is not attacking ” .
The result is potentially disastrous , like a harmful mutation .
Whereas a change to “ tha enemy is now attacking ” would be neutral ; a change , but not affecting the end result .
This is not surprising — an analogy : new computer programs do not arise from old computer programs by copying errors .
Instead , the resulting program usually jams .
However , evolutionists believe that occasionally , a “ good ” mutation will occur which will be favoured by selection and will allow that creature to progress along its evolutionary pathway to something completely different .
The Wrong Type of Change
Are there “ good ” mutations ?
Evolutionists can point to a small handful of cases in which a mutation has helped a creature to survive better than those without it .
Actually , they need to take a closer look .
Such “ good ” mistakes are still the wrong types of changes to turn a fish into a philosopher — they are headed in precisely the wrong direction .
Rather than adding information , they destroy information , or corrupt the way it can be expressed ( not surprising , since they are random mistakes ) .
Wingless Beetles
For example , beetles losing their wings .
A particular winged beetle type lives on large continental areas ; the same beetle type on a small windy island has no wings .
What happened is easy to imagine .
Every now and then in beetle populations , there might be a mutational defect which prevents wings from forming .
That is , the “ wing - making ” information is lost or scrambled in some way .
The damaged gene ( a gene is like a long “ sentence ” carrying one part of the total instructions recorded on the DNA ) is then going to be passed to all that beetle ’s offspring , and to their offspring , as it is copied over and over .
All these descendant beetles will be wingless .
If a beetle with such a wingless defect is living on the Australian mainland , for example , it will have less chance to fly away from beetle - eaters , so it will be more likely to be eliminated by “ survival of the fittest ” before it can leave offspring .
Such so - called “ natural selection ” can help to eliminate ( or at least reduce the buildup of ) such genetic mistakes .
However , on the windy island , the beetles which can fly tend to get blown into the sea , so not having wings is an advantage .
In time , the elimination of all the winged ones will ensure that only those of this new “ wingless ” variety survive , which have therefore been “ naturally selected ” .
“ There ! ” says the evolutionist .
“ A favourable mutation — evolution in action ! ”
However , it fails to make his case , because though beneficial to survival , it is still a defect — a loss or corruption of information .
This is the very opposite of what evolutionists need to demonstrate real evolution .
To support belief in a process which has allegedly turned molecules into man would require mutations to add information .
Showing that information - losing defects can give a survival advantage is irrelevant , as far as evidence for real evolution is concerned .
Similarly , many animals in caves are blind , with shrivelled eyes .
A mutation causing shrivelling of the eye and loss of sight would not harm the individual in a cave with no light to see by anyway .
And it would even be beneficial , since there is less chance of injuring a delicate eyeball .
But in the light , such blind mutants would be eliminated by natural selection .
Antibiotic Resistance
Some antibiotic resistance was already present in the bacterial population , as shown by specimens frozen before the development of antibiotics .
So natural selection only selected from pre-existing variation .
But nothing new was produced .
Similarly , myxomatosis - resistant rabbits were already present in the population .
When myxomatosis was introduced to Australia , non-resistant rabbits were selected against .
But this processes caused the loss of information from the bacteria and rabbit population due to the loss of genetic diversity .
Also , a loss of information can cause bacterial antibiotic resistance , e.g. penicillin resistance in Staphylococcus can be due to a mutation causing a regulatory gene ’s loss of control of production of penicillinase ( an enzyme which destroys penicillin ) .
The resulting overproduction of penicillinase increases resistance to penicillin .
But in the wild ( away from artificial environments swamped with penicillin ) , the Staphylococcus would be less “ fit ” because it wastes resources producing heaps of unnecessary protein .
Another common cause of antibiotic resistance is mutational defects which hinder the bacterium ’s ability to transport substances through its cell membrane .
Such a defect means that the antibiotic is less readily absorbed , so it is less likely to kill the bacterium .
But in the wild , it would be unable to compete with bacteria with properly working cell membrane pumps which take up nutrients into the cell .
Of the many cases of antibiotic resistance studied , none have involved the production of new functionally complex information , such as a new enzyme .
This would be real evolution , but such has not been found .
Sometimes bacteria have acquired resistance genes from other species via viruses or by direct transfer through tiny tubes , but this is not the addition of new information to the biosphere as a whole .
Bacteria only produce bacteria “ after their kind ” , not a different type of creature .
Viruses are sometimes said to “ evolve ” , but what really happens is that mutations cause the changes to their protein coats .
There is no increase in complexity , but sometimes the changes mean that antibodies do not recognise them .
So the viruses are “ fitter ” , but there is still no increase in information .
A similar case is a recent discovery that some antibiotic - resistant bacteria have abnormally high mutation rates .
This is caused by a mutation in the genes for the sophisticated genetic proof - reading mechanisms present in all life .
This means there is more chance of errors not being corrected .
Sometimes one of these defects happens to result in antibiotic resistance , as explained above .
Peppered Moths and Breeding
One common fallacy promoted by evolutionists is that variation within a kind somehow proves particles - to - people evolution .
The examples commonly cited , e.g. peppered moths and the Gal‡pagos finches , are indeed examples of natural selection .
But this is not evolution , since not new information has arisen .
Given a pre-existing gene pool , different combinations of the genes arise through sexual reproduction and some of those may be better able to survive .
So natural selection can account for the formation of different varieties , but cannot account for the origin of moths or finches .
With the peppered moths , even were we to grant the truth of the story , all it would show is that natural selection changed the ratios of black and peppered forms .
They were already present in the population , so nothing new was produced .
And more recently , the whole story has been shown to be based on faked photos of moths glued on to tree trunks — the moths almost never rest there in real life .
It ’s also important to note that rapid speciation , involving no gain of genetic information , is in fact a prediction of the creation model .
It explains how many varieties could arise from comparatively few “ kinds ” on board the Ark .
The different breeds of cattle and dogs are quite consistent with creation of separate types — e.g. a canine kind and a bovine kind , with large amounts of information .
Man chose the animals with the characteristics he wanted , and bred from them .
Thus the information for certain desired characteristics was concentrated in smaller selected populations .
But the resulting breeds have all lost the information for the characteristics not wanted by man .
Therefore , these breeds have less information than the wild type , so again the change is not of the right sort for molecules - to - man evolution .
And they are still cattle and dogs , not different types of creature .
Summary
Evolutionary theory requires some mutations to go “ uphill ’ — to add new information .
The mutations which we observe are generally neutral ( they do n’t effectively change the information , or the “ meaning ” in the code ) or else they are informationally downhill — defects which lose / corrupt information .
The rare “ beneficial ” mutations to which evolutionists cling all appear to be like wingless animals , blind cave animals , and many examples of antibiotic resistance .
They are downhill changes , losses of information which , though they may give a survival advantage , are headed in precisely the wrong direction for evolution .
The examples commonly cited as “ evolution happening today ” usually involving adaptation by natural selection , are without exception instances in which the net result is a loss of information in the population — either by mutation or by way of reduced genetic variety .
All of our real - world experience , especially in the “ information age ” , would indicate that to rely on accidental copying mistakes to generate real information is the stuff of wishful thinking by “ true believers ” , not science .
It had been a morning of fierce close - quarter combat with incessant fire coming from insurgents in the heart of Taliban country .
As the Royal Marines edged their way past the high walls of a compound the section commander , a corporal , fell to the ground with two shots to the groin .
The team had walked into an ambush and Marine Sam Alexander knew that the only chance they had was to fight their way through .
He picked up a heavy machine - gun and " traded lead " with the insurgents just 15 metres away .
Running out of ammunition , he opened up with his 9 mm pistol until that too was spent .
The Taliban fighters were forced to withdraw and found themselves being hunted as they ran into other marine units coming in from the flanks .
By his bravery , 26 - year - old Marine Alexander saved the life of the shot corporal and also earned vital minutes for the rest of the team from 42 Commando to gain cover .
What made his actions even more remarkable was that just a few hours earlier he had been shot in the head , the bullet embedding itself in his helmet .
Waving away offers to fall back , he had insisted on continuing with the others as they went through compounds clashing repeatedly with the insurgents .

Marine Alexander continued with Operation Abii Toorah , Pashtu for Blue Sword , one of a series of missions led by the marines in Helmand which also involved Afghan troops and a Danish contingent with Leopard tanks .
The fighting went on with little let - up for the two remaining days , until the Taliban withdrew from the area .
About 600 British and Afghan troops had taken part in an airborne assault supported by B1 bombers and Apache and Cobra helicopter gunships attempting to drive out the Taliban from entrenched positions near Marjah to pave the way for the planned surge which will come with arrival of up to 30,000 extra American troops .
The marines say they came across some of the fiercest resistance they have faced from the insurgents , who were being aided , it is claimed , by Pakistani , Chechen and Arab fighters .
According to British forces , " several dozens " of the enemy were killed and more than 100 injured .
It was also the first time the Taliban had carried out repeated night attacks , with large bands of fighters attempting to break through the lines while reinforcements arrived from surrounding regions over the days .
According to Afghan and Western officials , while the Americans build up their forces in Helmand and Kandahar , the Taliban are also building up their strength with hundreds of reinforcements arriving from across the Pakistani border .
Several more operations will be undertaken by Afghan and British forces in the next few weeks , with the aim of intercepting the flow of men and weaponry coming through southern Helmand while the Americans are due to carry out missions further east .

Last night I had an urge for a delicious caramel Sunday from McDonalds .
Where better to find nutritional facts about MickyD's than McDonalds.com ?
So I visited and Ba da bum bum bum ...
I 'm * not* loving it .
Surgeon General 's Warning : The McDonalds.com home page may induce nausea and a loss of appetite .
In other words , you might be seeing that Happy Meal again ...
McDonalds.com
Ingredients : a flash landing page , fixed - width tables used for layout , low - quality images , and a navigation bar outclassed by most homemade DVD menus .
@McDonalds :
It 's 2009 .
Not 1999 .
Your website is as fashionable as trans fats and you are losing value because of it .
You 're # 17 in the world with ad spending .
The world .
1.7 billion dollars on advertising a year .
You 're # 1 amongst quick - serve restaurants in online marketing spending .
That 's 10 million display ads a day .
These are impressive numbers .
Your website gets over a million unique visitors each month and you greet your visitors with a severely outdated , aesthetically nauseating , dysfunctional website .
Your web strategy is lacking balance : extravagant ad spending is driving traffic to a website that tarnishes your brand when it should be polishing it .
Large online ad buys demand a well designed website .
Let 's try and put this in perspective .
Imagine your monumental restaurant that opened on Times Square some 7 years ago .
Sure , this is n't your busiest location in the world , but even if it were , it would see less visitors in a month than your website .
Now imagine the owners of the Times Square location refused to clean or maintain it since it opened .
This is what your website is doing for your brand .
Here are some quick ideas to improve your internet marketing strategy :
Find a new internet team .
It is hard to tell if the current site was designed by the CEO ’s nephew or by an expensive , outdated ad agency that does n’t get interactive .
Either way , fire them .
Find an agency or design firm that understands the web .
Build a website for 2009 .
You 're going to have a hard time convincing the iPhone generation McDonalds is worthy of " lovin ' it " when your mobile site is designed for the WAP / WML phones of the early 2000s and lacks interesting content like nutritional facts .
Get rid of the tables , inaccessible flash , and put as much effort in carrying your brand properly on your site as you do in your commercials .
Pay attention to your social streams .
There are 3 McDonalds Facebook Pages that collectively have 1.5 million fans and they are n't monitored .
These are being used host radical political messages , and offensive photos and comments right beside of your golden arches .
Get more involved with Twitter .
Join the online conversation .
Get some dynamic content !
In the News section of your current site , there are literally no stories from 2008 .
You should even take the next step and add a Blog to your site .
Give your famous brand an online voice by blogging about corporate news , trends , interesting facts , and McDonald 's happenings .
By putting your site on a Content Management System ( looks like it currently is n't ) , you could easily have dynamic content on your site .
As we move into a new year , @McDonalds , consider bringing your website along for the ride .
The internet is quite nice in 2009 .
With an improved site you 'll see million of people a month smile ... and we all know that 's what you love .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) - Boosted by an 82 % increase in construction of apartment buildings , U.S. housing starts surged 22 % in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 583,000 , the Commerce Department estimated Tuesday .
It was the largest percentage gain in 19 years and was the first increase in eight months in the sector that was at ground zero in the global economic recession .
The housing data in winter months are especially volatile because of the weather .
Building permits , which are less volatile than the starts data , rose 3 % in February to a 547,000 annual rate .
Permits for single - family units rose 11 % to a 373,000 rate , the largest percentage gain in 18 years .
" We 're inclined to write this off as a weather - related fluke for now , " wrote economists for Wrightson ICAP .
" If the permits series can hold onto its gains in next month 's March report , though , we 'll take it as a sign that new construction has finally found a floor ( albeit a very low one ) . "
" We hold to the view that the level of housing construction is becoming so low in absolute terms that starts will bottom out in the months ahead , " wrote John Ryding and Conrad DeQuadros of RDQ Economics .
Construction of new housing units had plunged 38 % in the previous three months before February 's unexpected jump .
Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had forecast a further drop to 456,000 , despite an expected surge in multifamily construction .
But despite February 's gain , housing starts are down 47 % from a year ago , and are down 74 % from the peak in early 2006 .
Permits are down 44 % in the past year .
Builders are trying to reduce their inventories of unsold homes as they face relentless competition from older homes thrown on the market by foreclosures or short - sales .
" With new home sales still falling and the months ' supply at a record there is no reason for homebuilding to rise , " wrote Ian Shepherdson , chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics .
The mood of home builders ' has rarely been worse .
The National Association of Home Builders reported Monday that its sentiment index was stuck at 9 on a scale of 1 to 100 in March .
See full story .
The government cautions that its monthly housing data are volatile and subject to large sampling and other statistical errors .
In most months , the government can't be sure whether starts increased or decreased .
In February for instance , the standard error for starts was plus or minus 13.8 % .
Large revisions are common .
It can take four months for a new trend in housing starts to emerge from the data .
In the past four months , housing starts have averaged 568,000 annualized , down from 614,000 in the four months ending in January .
Details
February 's housing start rate of 583,000 was the highest since November .
January 's starts were revised higher to a 477,000 pace , a record low dating back to the 1940s .
Completions of housing units rose 2.3 % to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 785,000 .
Completions of single - family homes fell 8.2 % to a record - low 505,000 .
The number of units under construction fell 2.7 % to a 762,000 annual rate .
Single - family homes under construction dropped 3.4 % to 370,000 , the lowest in 38 years .
Starts rose 89 % in the Northeast , rose 58 % in the Midwest , rose 30 % in the South and fell 25 % in the West .
" Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth , where moth and rust destroy , and where thieves break in and steal .

Orange drinks with 300 times more pesticide than tap water
Fizzy drinks sold by Coca - Cola in Britain have been found to contain pesticides at up to 300 times the level allowed in tap or bottled water .
A worldwide study found pesticide levels in orange and lemon drinks sold under the Fanta brand , which is popular with children , were at their highest in the UK .
The research team called on the Government , the industry and the company to act to remove the chemicals and called for new safety standards to regulate the soft drinks market .
The industry denies children are at risk and insists that the levels found by researchers based at the University of Jaen in southern Spain are not harmful .
The study uncovered pesticides in some fizzy drinks at up to 300 times the level permitted in tap water
The researchers tested 102 cans and bottles of soft drinks , bought from 15 countries , for the presence of 100 pesticides .
The UK products were bought in London , Cambridge , Edinburgh , St Andrews and at Gatwick Airport .
The experts said the levels found were low under the maximum residue levels allowed for fruit , but they were ' very high ' and ' up to 300 times ' the figure permitted for bottled or tap water .
The chemicals detected included carbendazim , thiabendazole , imazalil , prochloraz , malathion and iprodione .
They are mainly applied to fruit after harvest to stop it developing fungal infections and rotting .
A total of 19 products were bought in the UK , all made by Coca - Cola .
Two orange drinks bought in the UK contained imazalil at 300 times the limit permitted for a single pesticide in drinking water .
Two similar products contained 98 times the legal drinking water limit for thiabendazole .
The average level of the total pesticide contamination of the British drinks was 17.4 parts per billion - 34.6 times the EU maximum residue level for water .
Coca -Cola GB insisted the products are safe .
A spokesman said : ' All of the drinks tested meet the safety regulations relating to food products made from agricultural ingredients , which include drinks with fruit juice as an ingredient .
' The generally miniscule levels that were detected were well within the acceptable daily intake levels and these findings should reassure consumers there is no safety issue here . '
Mr. Hughes ’s early life was darkened by shadows of depression and suicide .
Ms. Plath explored the themes in her 1963 novel “ The Bell Jar , ” which follows an ambitious college student who tries to kill herself after suffering a nervous breakdown while interning at a New York City magazine .
The novel reflected Ms. Plath ’s own experiences , including her early struggles with depression and her attempt at suicide while working at Mademoiselle in New York as a college student .
After a stay at a mental institution , Ms. Plath went on to study poetry at Cambridge University , where she met Ted Hughes , who was on his way to world fame as a poet .
The two were married in 1956 , and had two children  Nicholas and Frieda  but separated in 1962 after Mr. Hughes began an affair with another woman , Assia Wevill .
Ms. Plath killed herself at the age of 30 by sticking her head in an oven in her London home on Feb. 11 , 1963 , as Nicholas and Frieda slept nearby .
Six years later , Ms. Wevill , who had helped raise Nicholas and Frieda after Ms. Plath ’s death , killed herself and her 4 - year - old daughter , Shura .
Ms. Wevill styled the murder - suicide in the same manner , using a gas stove .
Mr. Hughes , who became Poet Laureate in 1984 and was widely regarded as one of the greatest poets of his generation , resisted speaking openly about the deaths for many years .
But in his last poetic work , “ Birthday Letters , ” published in 1998 , he finally broke his silence and explored the theme .
He died the same year , as the book  in some ways considered a quest for redemption  was climbing best - seller lists .
Mr. Hughes was said to have protected his children from details about their mother ’s suicide for many years .
But in at least one poem he seemed to indicate that Nicholas , who was only 1 at the time of her death , was pained even as a small child , recalling in one stanza how Nicholas ’s eyes “ Became wet jewels /
The hardest substance of the purest pain /
As I fed him in his high white chair . ”
I 've never been a big fan of frameworks .
They are often clunky , contain a lot of excessive features and most importantly , they make things a little too easy , hiding many common problems behind a screen of smoke and preventing you from really getting to know the ins and outs of a language .
But rather than explain myself , I usually give out a link to an article on 456 Berea Street which describes the problem a lot better than I can .

Then came the day that I wanted to update my blog and remove all the obtrusive javascript present .
Now , I 've worked with javascript before , my masterpiece being a back office application that contained more javascript and ajax than it had html .
A truly magnificent disaster that was impressive to look at but failed to pass any serious accessibility test .
Long gone are those days and I wanted to create javascript code that was clean and unobtrusive .
So following my own advise , I was supposed to dig into the whole unobtrusive javascript thing .
After doing a whole xhtml rework on the site , creating new templates for my gallery , re-engineering my back office and css the whole damn thing again , somehow the appeal of starting to learn javascript from scratch was not all that appealing anymore .
Even more so because I 'm quite aware of all the browser inconsistencies that exist within javascript .
So I did what any curious web developer would do .
I went to the jquery site and downloaded their library .
In secret of course .
magic moments I have a background in javascript , but I have n't been occupying myself with it for a pretty long time ( maybe the last javascript thingy I made was three years ago ) .
After about 30 minutes fiddling with the jquery library I made myself a whole tab - pane which worked in every browser and degraded as gracefully as a ballet dancer , only making use of my own html .
I was quite astounded that it could actually be this easy to get something done with a javascript library without resorting to pre-made components .
Of course it was a big help that I could directly target elements on a page using css selectors ( quite sad though , seeing a javascript library that has better css support than a certain unnamed browser family ) , but the syntax too was incredibly easy and intuitive , and the built - in functionality seemed to be tailor - made to the needs of a modern web developer .

Tesla Motor Company CEO
Elon Musk has just announced that the US DOE has granted their request for loans and expects to receive $ 350 million in loans within 4 to 5 months that will go towards producing the 4 - door 5 - seat Model S electric sedan .
This they say will allow them to have the car in production in 2011 .
Furthermore Tesla now plans to unveil a " street - drivable prototype of the Model S four door sedan " at the SpaceX rocket factory on March 26th .
The company also reports it expects to be profitable by mid-year largely because it has already sold out its full production capability of Roadsters through the end of the year .
Press Release Below :
Tesla to be Profitable by Mid Year
The $ 40 M financing round completed in December was twice the amount Tesla needed to reach profitability .
Moving forward two months later , we remain on track with our cost reductions and production ramp , so it appears highly likely that Tesla will meet the goal promised to those investors of becoming profitable by mid year .
The main reason for this confidence is that Tesla is already in the fortunate position of being sold out until early November , something few automakers can claim , and will soon be sold out of all 2009 production .
While we have had some cancellations due to buyers experiencing personal financial difficulties , new orders continue to flow in every week from the United States and Europe .
We have now produced more than 200 Roadsters for customers and there are more than 1,000 customers still awaiting delivery .
Due to our order backlog , it seems that owning a Roadster can be a good investment .
Last September , as the financial and real estate markets began crashing , a Roadster was sold at the Sonoma Paradiso in California wine country for $ 160,000 , well above the current list price of $ 109,000 .
Many Roadster owners who have taken delivery of their cars have already decided to purchase a second Roadster or Roadster Sport because they like the first one so much .
The continued strong demand is driven by the fact that the Tesla Roadster has no direct competitors .
It is faster than almost any sports car on the market ( our Roadster beat a Porsche GT3 on the Top Gear test track ) and yet uses less energy and has a smaller carbon footprint than a Toyota Prius , even if you assume the worst possible case where all electricity comes from coal .
I expect sales demand to strengthen further as this awareness grows .
After all , what ’s the point of driving another exotic sports car when it is slower than a Tesla and damages the environment ?
Already , the Tesla Roadster is the car of choice among the technology , business and Hollywood A lists – this year ’s Academy Awards will be a lineup of Teslas – and we have never had to give a discount to anyone .
Many customers also appreciate the fact that profit from their purchase goes towards helping Tesla develop more affordable , mass market electric cars .
The same cannot be said for those who buy gas - guzzling sports cars from other automakers .
And owners are n’t the only ones impressed with the Roadster .
Road &
Track was the first auto enthusiast magazine to perform third - party , instrumented testing on the Roadster ; they were “ pleased to see its extravagant claims confirmed . ”
The Washington Post ’s Warren Brown gushed , “ Wheeeeeee !
If this is the future of the automobile , I want it . ”
Dan Neil of the Los Angeles Times had perhaps the most colorful description we ’ve seen to describe the Roadster ’s scorching acceleration : “ God has grabbed me by the jockstrap and fired me off his thumb , rubber band - style .
Wow . ”
And we ’ve also had a torrent of reviews in Europe , where deliveries begin this summer – including a Le Monde story with our favorite headline : “ Le chic électrique . ”
Unveiling the Model S and DOE funding
On March 26th , at the Tesla design studio located within the SpaceX rocket factory , we will unveil a street - drivable prototype of the Model S four door sedan .
Our objective with the Model S was to create one of the most functional , intuitive and beautiful vehicles on the road .
Tesla Roadster customers and select VIPs invited to the event will have an opportunity to judge for themselves firsthand whether we have succeeded .
Regarding funding , I am excited to report that the Department of Energy informed Tesla last week that they expect to disburse funds from our $ 350 M
Model S loan application within four to five months .
The Obama administration has thankfully made it a top priority to move quickly on the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing loan program , as this will both generate high quality jobs in the near term and lay the groundwork for a better environment in the future .
This will keep us on track for production to start in 2011 .
As a gesture of gratitude for their early support , Roadster owners will receive a $ 10,000 discount off the price of the Model S Signature series and automatically be first in line for the sedan .
Daimler Partnership
We announced last month at the Detroit auto show that we have been working with Daimler ( maker of Mercedes ) for over a year to create an electric version of the Smart car .
Daimler has contracted with Tesla to build the battery packs and chargers for an initial run of 1,000 cars .
Pending the results of that test fleet , the relationship could expand to tens of thousands of cars per year .
This is a very significant endorsement of both Tesla ’s technology and our financial strength by one of the world ’s most respected automotive companies .
Daimler would not feel comfortable depending on us for this program if they felt that either our technology was easily replicated or that we were in financial danger .
Daimler was the first company to commercialize the internal combustion engine and has become a benchmark for automotive quality and reliability .
It is an honor that they chose to work with Tesla after a thorough investigation of other options .
The deal is likely to be the first in a series of strategic partnerships between Tesla and other auto manufacturers to engineer and produce electric cars .
My goal for Tesla from the beginning was to do whatever we can to help end the world ’s addiction to oil .
We ’ll do that by making cars directly , helping other automakers develop cars , and serving as an example to the rest of the industry .
Although the Roadster is still the only highway capable production electric car for sale in the United States , it was very encouraging to see that the central theme of the Detroit auto show this year was electric transportation .
J
New Tesla Sales & Service Centers to Open
We have reached agreement on Tesla store leases in Chicago and London ’s Knightsbridge district , and we are close to finalizing locations in Manhattan , Miami , Seattle and Munich .
All six facilities will open this year , and in the following months we ’ll provide details about individual store opening parties .
These new stores will offer prospective customers the chance to see and drive the Roadster in person – and they underscore Tesla ’s commitment to looking at the auto industry with fresh eyes .
Unlike traditional franchise dealerships , Tesla owns its stores and controls the customer experience .
We think you ’ll agree that our stores are a refreshing change from the way most people have bought cars for the last 50 years .
Roadster Sport
Tesla is now taking orders for the Roadster Sport , an even higher performance car that does 0 to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds .
It comes with a hand - wound stator and increased winding density for lower resistance and higher peak torque .
The tires are upgraded to Yokohama Ultra High Performance and the suspension features adjustable dampers and anti-roll bars tuned to the driver ’s preference – allowing for both softer and firmer rides than the standard Roadster .
Deliveries are expected to begin in late June .
Upgraded Roadster Interior and Other Options
Tesla will soon offer an Executive Leather Interior that raises the level of luxury in the Roadster ’s cabin .
We are also offering a Clear Carbon Fiber Exterior Package to add an additional level of sportiness and highlight the lightweight material that makes up the Roadster ’s body .
Currently , the only exterior clear carbon fiber touch on the base model is the roll bar cover – but many customers and fans have asked if we could reveal more of this exotic , braided material .
These packages will be available starting in June .
Battery Replacement Program
One of the top questions customers ask about the Roadster is , “ How long will the battery last and what will it cost to replace ? ”
Tesla engineers have determined that a Tesla battery pack should last approximately seven years or over 100,000 miles under normal use .
Customers may pay $ 12,000 , € 10,000 or £ 9,000 up front and in return receive a replacement battery pack after seven years .
Customers will also have the option of replacing the pack earlier at a premium or later for a partial refund .
With the low production volume of the Tesla Roadster , the current replacement price of the pack is almost three times that number .
The main reason for the relatively low cost up front -- and why this is a smart purchase -- is that we are arbitraging the relative cost of capital between Tesla and our typical customer .
Extended Warranty to Double Standard Period
Many customers have also asked to purchase an extended warranty .
We now offer a doubling of the standard warranty , which means an additional 3 years and 36,000 miles or 60,000 kilometers , for $ 5,000 , € 4,000 or £ 3,800 .
This covers everything on the car except the battery pack .
Should the motor , power electronics , HVAC or any other major system need to be replaced , this will be money well spent , and it provides peace of mind to many customers .
Thanks for your support !

In response to falling state revenues , the state of Oregon slashed $ 11.1 million from its judicial budget .
That in turn prompted the Chief Justice to order Oregon State Courts to Close Fridays .
Oregonians will wait longer for their day in court after Chief Justice Paul De Muniz announced today he 's closing all state courts on Fridays and forcing 1,800 judicial staffers to take Fridays off without pay .
The decision came after the Legislature 's combined Ways and Means Committee voted today to cut $ 11.1 million from the state Judicial Department 's 2007 - 09 budget .
That 's a 28 percent cut from the parts of the budget available to cut .
The closures will begin Friday , March 13 and last at least through June 30 , says Phil Lemman , a Judicial Department spokesman .
They affect the state Supreme Court , Court of Appeals , Tax Court , county circuit courts and administrative offices .
About 1,800 judicial staffers statewide will face a 20 - percent pay cut when they 're forced to take Fridays off .
But Lemman says judges ' salaries are protected by state law and cannot be reduced until they finish their elected term .
As a result , Lemman says , circuit court judges will keep the 17 - percent pay raise they received last year from the Legislature .
Their current annual salary is $ 112,488 .
Chief Justice Paul J. De Muniz Blasts
The Legislature
“ These budget reductions are a huge blow to Oregon ’s courts and the people we serve and will affect public safety , the welfare of children , and everyone who needs their day in court , ” Chief Justice De Muniz said .
“ Oregonians will have the unfortunate opportunity to learn how justice delayed means justice denied . ”
The closures are made necessary by an $ 11.1 million General Fund reduction to the Oregon Judicial Department ’s 2007 - 09 budget .
That cut was approved today by the legislative Ways and Means Committee .
If approved by the full legislature and signed by the governor , expected next week , the cuts will require all department employees to take 16 unpaid furlough days before the end of June .
Chief Justice
De Muniz said he will issue a closure order when the governor signs the budget reduction into law .
The Friday closures will affect over 12,000 trials and other proceedings already scheduled through June .
The closures threaten the courts ’ ability to meet statutory deadlines in all cases and cause lengthy delays in resolving landlord / tenant , divorce , child support , child custody , and many other civil cases .
More than 50,000 new cases are filed in Oregon circuit courts each month .
Of particular concern is the continuing ability of courts to meet federal deadlines to review and handle child welfare cases to ensure their proper placement .

You may already know about this but I thought I should give you a quick nudge – admittedly a last minute one – in the direction of Document Freedom Day .
Tomorrow , 25th of March 2009 will be the 2nd global Document Freedom Day ; “ but what exactly is Document Freedom Day ? ” I hear you ask , I did myself .
Well , here ’s how they describe it on their own website :
“ Document Freedom Day ( DFD ) is a global day for document liberation .
It will be a day of grassroots effort to educate the public about the importance of Free Document Formats and Open Standards in general .
Complementary to Software Freedom Day , we aim to have local teams all over the world organise events on the last Wednesday of March .
2009 is the second year that Document Freedom Day is being called for , and we are again looking for people around the world who are willing to join the effort .
DFD ’s main goals are :
* promotion and adoption of free document formats
* forming a global network
* coordination of activities that happen on last Wednesday of March , Document Freedom Day
Once a year , we will celebrate Document Freedom Day as a global community .
Between those days , DFD will be focused on facilitating community action and building awareness for issues of Document Freedom and Open Standards . “
All noble objectives I think we can get behind .
For my own part I always use Open Document Format and I ’m a big proponent of it .
We covered the whole OOXML debacle with the ISO pretty heavily on Linux Outlaws last year .
It was a sad day when MS shoehorned their way in .
I think we need proper open standards for everyone to use Internationally and not formats tied to one software vendor .
OOXML is admittedly better than previous MS formats but in my view they ’re not really trying to make it open ; all we can ever expect from them is the bare minimum required to stay on the right side of the legislators .
I use OpenOffice.org on all my machines and even install it on any Windows machines I ’m forced to fix for friends and family .
Microsoft
Office is a product with a long history and one which most people are still taught on in schools and colleges ; you could even say it has a pedigree , however much it sticks in my throat to say that .
I understand all that , I ’m not unreasonable but the truth of the matter is most people only use a fraction of it ’s features when writing that occasional letter or making a presentation .
OpenOffice.org is more than adequate for 95 % of users .
Seriously , how often do you do a mail merge at home ?
If the answer is “ a lot ” , then my next question would be where the hell do you live ?!
I only export my work to formats like “ .doc ” and “ .ppt ” when given no other option .
Perhaps this makes me an awkward freedom frenzied hippie but I think it ’s important and besides , I ’ve never needed an excuse to be awkward hehe 😉
So as you go about your daily tasks tomorrow , please spare a little thought for open standards and be sure to tell others that they have a choice too .
Thank you everyone , it ’s appreciated .

P.S – Sorry for the late heads up on this , I ’m a failmeister
Summary : Microsoft unleashes lobbyists to fight ODF despite pretending to have changed
THERE ARE all sorts of articles out there right now which portray Microsoft almost as a champion of open source .
There is this one example from IDG and another from InformationWeek .
IBM is on a similar boat with its semi-proprietary derivative of OpenOffice.org , which makes one wonder about IBM buying Sun Microsystems .
There is also this from the news , which is good news to OpenDocument format ( but not so much for Free software ) .
Some 50,000 Australian university students will receive a free version of IBM ’s Lotus Symphony software this month …
It ’s worth watching what Microsoft is doing at the moment despite pretending to have changed .
Regarding a bill that promotes ODF :
The main argument , advanced by a Microsoft lobbyist , is that the bill is anti-competitive , and would be “ like choosing Betamax over VHS . ”
There is also a fear that users would have to replace their current software , although I believe Microsoft has been pretty scrupulous in supporting the Open Document Format .
The original article we have already mentioned a couple of days ago and it contains more details about Microsoft ’s role .
But Microsoft is trying to say that it became a friend of ODF .
It ’s nothing but a lie .
Microsoft understands that without predatory lock - in like its proprietary OOXML , people ’s choice will no longer be very limited and products will compete based on value and merit . █

MIDLAND -- Solar shingles is not a new disease , but Dow Chemical Co. hopes they spread like gangrene .
During the past year , engineers , scientists and others at Dow Solar Solutions -- a $ 50 million investment -- have worked at a photovoltaic facility , a retrofitted former research and development building in the company 's sprawling 1,900 - acre complex here .
Their goal is to produce thermoplastic solar roof shingles for sale throughout North America .
With President Barack Obama 's insistence on renewable energy and conservation , the time is ripe for such an enterprise , said Robert J. Cleereman , senior director of solar development for Dow .
Using thin film photovoltaic technology , Dow intergrates solar cells with shingles .
By 2011 , officials expect to begin selling the product with its partners -- home builders Lennar Corp. of Miami , Pulte Homes Inc. of Bloomfield Hills and Jefferson City , Mo.- based Prost Builders Inc. , and Global Solar Energy , a maker of flexible materials .
The " Solar America Initiative " team has conducted numeorus tests in preparing the shingles for market .
" We 've thrown everything you can imagine at them from ( simulated ) hail to fire to see how they react , " Cleereman said .
" One day , a person would no more think about buying a house without solar shingles than they would buy a house without plumbing .
That is our hope , at least . "
At the center of the project is a $ 2.5 million injecting and molding machine nicknamed " The Beast " that converts solar cells into finished shingles .
Huge reductions in energy costs for consumers , goverment subsidies and / or tax breaks , and even free installation and materials are possibilities as solar consumption evolves , Cleereman said .
" I can see utility companies paying for the roofing for customers , " he said .
" It would save them money on building power plants because the solar shingles can act like individual little power plants . "
The solar power industry has mushroomed 35 percent a year for the past decade .
Government incentives have sped up the pace of solar power installations in several countries , including Germany , Spain , Japan , China and the United States .
For the Great Lakes Bay Region , the technology could mean billions of dollars of investment and hundreds of jobs at Dow .
" Easily , " Cleereman said .
" It just has to take off . "
John Russell , president and chief operating officer of Consumers Energy , said alternative energy makes up 5 percent of the utility 's power pool , and he expects the figure to grow to 10 percent by 2015 .
" We are the leaders , " he said , " and we want to lead the way . "
POPE Benedict last night claimed that placing a bible over an erect penis before intercourse is the only guaranteed way to prevent the spread of Aids .
Speaking before his tour of Africa , the Pontiff said Aids could only be tackled by the ' traditional teaching of the church ' and not a latex rubber sheath that contains infected semen and prevents it from transferring the virus to another human being .
Experts said that either the Pope is suggesting the bible is used like a condom , or he does n't know what a condom is .
Dr Emma Bradford , of Reading University , said : " I guess you would have to rip out a few pages of Leviticus and then somehow fashion them into a condom - like device using lots and lots of masking tape .
" Or you could shred the pages , soak them in water and construct something that looks a bit like a paper maché cigar tube . "
Dr Bradford added : " It has to be one of those two because suggesting that the African Aids epidemic can be contained simply by reading the bible would be criminally insane . "
Since his inauguration in 2005 the Pope has continued the Church 's strong opposition to condoms by calling for abstinence , supervised heavy petting and whacking it repeatedly with a wooden spoon until it goes all soft again .
Meanwhile the Vatican has issued this year 's list of approved non-penetrative carnal techniques including pearl necklaces , light genital branding and something called ' Dutch steamboating ' .
Warning : introspection and metadiscussion follows for several paragraphs .
Piers Cawley is right about Modern Perl , this is a manifesto .
Like all good manifestoes , it ignores some of the details of reality in order to bring about a more pleasing reality .
I 've written voluminously here and elsewhere about many technical problems with Perl 5 and its culture .
I hope I 've not given the impression that I believe these problems are insurmountable , nor that the community and the language and the ecosystem are irredeemable .
I believe the opposite .
I write and argue and debate and think and exhort because I believe that we can address these problems and invent a better future .
It 's difficult to throw a revolution when no one shows up , however .
Hence the manifesto nature of these writings .
I 've deliberately chosen black - and - white imagery and simple , surgical discussions of various ideas to present my arguments with sharp precision .
Sometimes it may sound like I 'm a knight on a white horse tilting against a big windmill labeled " The Perl 5 Porters " .
That 's not precisely true .
Not only is p5 p an amorphous group of hundreds of individuals with thousands of opinions , but all I really want to fight is inertia .
With that said , there are several people actively working on improving problems I 've identified .
I wo n't take credit for inspiring them ; I can't .
They work often behind the scenes , doing wonderful things that help hundreds of thousands of people directly and hundreds of millions of people indirectly .
Their work is hugely important .
Though I can't name every one of them here right now , they all deserve credit for helping Perl and its ecosystem to continue to evolve .
Nicholas Clark has released more stable versions of Perl in the past decade than anyone else .
He was the initial guinea pig for the experiment of releasing a new maintenance release every three months .
His practical experiences will help us return to a regular release cycle .
As well , one of his current projects is revising portions of the Perl core ( especially its library loading paths in @ INC ) to promote freshly installed modules over core versions .
This is an important step toward moving more modules out of the core .
Andreas König , the creator and maintainer of the CPAN module has wonderful tools for testing any CPAN distribution against any revision of bleadperl .
This has found and fixed many bugs in both the core and CPAN modules .
Rafaël Garcia - Suarez is a core committer and was the pumpking for Perl 5.10 .
He approved several important changes such as deprecating pseudo - static lexical variables , making the topic variable lexicalizable , and adding the name of an undefined variable to the undefined variable concatenation warning .
These deprecations and backwards - incompatible changes make modern Perl easier to write and to maintain .
Dave Mitchell is a core committer and pumpking for Perl 5.10.1 .
He 's fixed countless bugs -- countless difficult and thankless bugs -- and is the man to convince to continue to improve Perl .
Yves Orton refactored the regular expression engine for Perl 5.10 , making it more correct , often faster , and much more featureful .
It 's impossible to overestimate how much work this was .
Paul Fenwick marshalled a group of volunteers to maintain a list of changes between Perl 5.8 and Perl 5.10 .
He 's also written a replacement for the difficult - to - use Fatal core module .
Its replacement is autodie .
Michael Schwern maintains the core module ExtUtils :: MakeMaker .
No one wants to see this code die more than he does .
( Not even I want to see it die that much . )
It 's thankless , difficult work -- but Schwern has kept up with necessary changes so that its eventual replacement can take over silently and effortlessly .
He also recently effectively removed any reason to use Perl 5.005 , by declining to support it in newer versions of MakeMaker .
I can only mention several other contributors , such as Renée Bäcker , David Landgren , Sam Vilain ( who helped migrate Perl 5 to git , making releases and collaboration much easier ) , Leon Brocard ( another migration worker and pumpking in his own right ) , David Cantrell , Steffen Mueller , Craig Berry , and John Malmberg .
I could list dozens more .
Perl 5 is not perfect .
Its development process still has its flaws .
We can improve it many times over .
Yet credit must go to all contributors who have brought it this far -- and who continue to help it grow and thrive .
Thank you all .
Oh , cruel irony .
The Minnesota Timberwolves do n’t exactly have a lot going for them .
The franchise has a career 669-929 record or a .419 winning percentage .
They ’ve made it past the first round of the playoffs exactly once .
They traded star Kevin Garnett only to see him promptly win a championship with the Boston Celtics .
Basically , nothing good goes their way .
But this season marks their 20 - year anniversary as a team , and they ’re trying hard to honor their history , as pathetic as it may be .
Sunday night was Sam Mitchell appreciation night , with the first 5000 fans to receive a poster of Mitchell as a memento ( see picture to the right ) .
Now Mitchell is no star , but he was a long time Timberwolf and one of the franchise ’s better players .
Just one problem .
The poster is supposed to show Mitchell in his “ Wolves ” Minnesota jersey .
Except there ’s no “ L ” .
That ’s right , he ’s wearing a jersey that is misspelled , saying “ Woves . ”
How a team that racks up more
Ls than most in the league can forget that letter is difficult to understand .
And to add insult to inury , it was not only Sam Mitchell night , but it was also one of two “ Read to Achieve ” nights on the season .
Stay in school kids !
Chalk another one up for Minnesota in their efforts to be the laughingstock of the league .

An oil spill along the coast of Queensland in north - east Australia is 10 times worse than originally thought , state authorities said .
A Hong Kong - registered ship damaged by a tropical storm on Wednesday leaked 230 tonnes of oil , not 20 - 30 tonnes as initially reported , officials said .
They warned that the toxic sludge is carcinogenic and threatening wildlife .
Dozens of beaches along a 60 km stretch ( 37 mile ) on the Sunshine Coast have been declared disaster zones .
See map showing the oil - affected areas
The crisis was sparked when high seas whipped up by Cyclone Hamish toppled 31 containers of ammonium nitrate fertiliser from the deck of the Pacific Adventurer .
As they fell , the containers punctured the hull and released the oil , also taking 620 tonnes of the chemical fertiliser to the ocean floor .
Election issue
The BBC's Phil Mercer in Sydney says the environmental disaster has become a dominant issue ahead of a Queensland state election next weekend .
" This has been a debacle of extraordinary magnitude , " conservative opposition leader Lawrence Springborg said of the government 's response .
" A dozen people with buckets and shovels was never going to do it .
The plan had n't been activated .
The government was caught short . "
But Queensland 's Premier Anna Bligh denied accusations that she had been too slow to react .
" These are beaches that have been battered by cyclonic activity and are severely eroded .
You do not take heavy earth - moving equipment onto these beaches without first assessing them and having a clear plan of how you will proceed on the clean - up , " she said .
Clean - up costs
The ship 's owner , Swire Shipping , faces fines of up to A$ 1.5 m ( $ 977,000 ; £ 703,000 ) if found guilty of environmental breaches , as well as clean - up costs of A$ 100,000 a day .
" The company very much regrets the environmental impact caused as a consequence of the vessel being caught in Cyclone Hamish , " it said in a statement .
" The company and its insurers will meet all their responsibilities . "
Apart from the oil damage , experts fear the fertiliser could cause harmful algal blooms , suffocate fish and kill natural habitats .
Hundreds of people are working to clean the beaches and save affected wildlife .
Moreton Bay , a marine sanctuary worst hit by the oil spill , is home to a range of sea birds as well as turtles , dolphins and pelicans .

We went down to Coolum Beach today ( about 35 km north of Moreton Island ) , for my eight - year - old 's weekly surf lesson with his school .
The beach was shut and we watched the oil washing ashore in the waves and covering the sand and rocks .
Terrible .
This was a pristine ecosystem and it has been badly damaged in the search for money and through " risk assessment " .
Allowing this boat out into a cyclone area was n't a risk worth taking however much money was involved .
Laurie Cokell , Doonan Australia
I live in Brisbane , QLD , and the damage is done .
This will affect tourism more than ever and it's sad because we need tourists now .
Thanks to another oil company .
Colin , Brisbane , QLD , Australia
This is a total tragedy !!!
Apart from the obvious environmental catastrophe , this has screwed some top - notch surf spots .
Devastating it is !
I am on the verge of tears as I type .
Just last week I was splashing about at Caloundra thinking how heavenly it was .
Now it 's dirty !
Gutted .
Completely gutted .

Here 's some good news for fans of the beleaguered Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles : Friday 's ratings saw a reversal of fortunes that took everyone by surprise ... and may be a good sign for the future .
Advertisement
Amazingly , Terminator 's last episode , " Today is the Day Part 1 , " saw a 20 % bump in audience size to 3.5 million viewers on Friday ( Dollhouse also rose , 7 % ) ; while some expected a rise following last week 's appalling numbers - which we suspected had more to do with Watchmen 's premiere than the show itself - a 20 % rise is more than was expected , and in addition to the 30 % audience bump the show gains from DVR viewers , enough to make the argument that the show 's audience may be larger if it was given a different timeslot .

The Hollywood Reporter 's James Hibbard is playing it cool , however :
It 's too early to read too much into this .
After four weeks of gradual but steady decline , hopefully the gain means both shows have at least found their midseason bottoms ...
On the other hand , it could be a one - time surge too .
We 'll see .
' Dollhouse ' & ' Terminator ' improve for first time [ THR Live Feed ]
My friend Charlotte works for LEGO and the last time I saw her there , she handed me her new business card .
This is it :
When LEGO employees get a business card like this , they even try to match the look of the minifig ( gender , hair , glasses ) to the person .
I love it .
It ’s a brilliant way for LEGO to use their brand and to create some happiness along the way .
What does your business card look like ?
Is it fun , surprising and memorable … or is it just like all the other ones out there .
Update : I should probably add that only a few LEGO employees get these – they ’re expensive to make so only a few executives and people in PR roles get them .

Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu has urged new US President Barack Obama to signal a real change of heart on Middle East policy by apologizing for the Iraq war .
Archbishop Tutu , aged 77 , who is a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and the retired Anglican archbishop of Cape Town , said late last week that Mr Obama risked squandering goodwill from around the world if he failed to acknowledge mistakes and annunciate policies for " moving forward " .
The archbishop , who is part of a network called " the elders " who are seeking to bring influence to bear on situations needing reconciliation and conflict transformation , also encouraged President Obama to support the International Criminal Court and to “ come down hard ” on African dictators .
The anti-apartheid figurehead warned in an article for the BBC ’s website that the high hopes surrounding Mr Obama ’s presidency could turn sour .
The president , he said , “ could easily squander the good will that his election generated if he disappoints . ”
Archbishop
Tutu wrote : “ It would be wonderful if , on behalf of the nation , Obama apologizes to the world , and especially the Iraqis , for an invasion that I believe has turned out to be an unmitigated disaster . ”
The European Parliament has approved a report which goes against the French plan to implement a ' 3 strikes ' regime for alleged P2P copyright infringers .
The proposals to increase security and ensure freedom on the Internet were accepted , but disconnecting users from the Internet was ruled out .
For the third time in a year the European Parliament has spoken out against tougher anti-piracy legislation that would allow alleged file - sharers to be disconnected from the Internet based on evidence from anti-piracy lobby groups .
Instead , they chose to protect rights and freedoms of Internet users .
The report from Greek MEP Stavros Lambrinidis concerning security and the protection of fundamental freedoms on the Internet , has been accepted by an overwhelming majority .
The European Parliament adopted the report with 481 votes in favor , 25 against and 21 abstentions .
French proposals that would allow a ‘ graduated response ’ aka ‘ 3 strikes ’ regime to deal with alleged copyright infringers were rejected .
“ While ensuring that the Internet is more secure is a legitimate goal for our societies , we must monitor and restrict the use of surveillance and control techniques that threaten our freedoms , especially in cases which question its necessity , proportionality and effectiveness , ” says the report .
In a clear snub to both the French government and copyright holders the report says , “ Governments or private companies should not see the denial of such access as a means of imposing sanctions , as proposed in some countries in the union . ”
The report further states that computer and electronic literacy is the new literacy of the 21st century and that guaranteeing Internet access to all European citizens is synonymous with guaranteeing education .
The French tried to protect their upcoming 3 Strikes law , but failed .
An amendment proposed to read , “ Access to the Internet should not be the subject of abuse for purposes of illegal activities and that a balance between the various basic rights guaranteed in Community legislation must be respected , ” was rejected .
At this stage it is unclear if this pressure from the European Parliament will cause the French to reconsider their ‘ 3 strikes ’ plans .
It would not be the first time Sarkozy has chosen to ignore the democratic vote .

Clearly I ’m sending through another SMTP server , who goes as far as mangling my ‘ Return - Path ’ address header .
Only I ’m not .
My SMTP server is set ( as always ) to the corporate SMTP who is accessible through the VPN , in an encrypted connection that should not allow anyone to change fields .
Just in case , I check it again .
Yup , the SMTP server is there .
So what ’s up ?
A quick investigation shows the following :
The hotel ’s network blocks my VPN ( as some of them do ) but happily resolves any unresolvable host name ( such as my SMTP server ’s hostname ) .
This is resolved to a catch - all server that proxies everything .
Transparently .
( well , almost )
Lesson learned .
Changed the hostname to the IP , and will soon switch to SSL based SMTP who will authenticate the server .
In the meanwhile – be careful from helpful Beijing wifi providers who are only too happy to forward your mail on !
( with some changes , of course ) .
Maybe when CBS , ABC , MSNBC and CNN take a break from genuflecting before their God , Lord Cheney , they might parse his words a bit – oh hell , do n’t even parse , just read .
Especially where Cheney suggested , yet again , that Saddam was building WMD and was supporting terrorists up until the US invasion .
( Hint : He was n’t . )
Said Cheney to CNN ’s John King on Sunday :
“ There is no prospect ” that Iraq will return to producing weapons of mass destruction or supporting terrorists , Cheney asserted , “ as long as it ’s a democratically governed country , as long as they have got the security forces they do now and a relationship with the United States . ”
Well , yes , there is no prospect because there was no prospect before the invasion either .
Iraq was n’t building WMD , and Saddam was n’t supporting Al Qaeda .
Why did King let Cheney get away with this ?
Why did AP ?
It ’s not like it was some curveball that Cheney ’s never used before .
He always lies about Saddam ’s supposed WMD and supposed ties to Al Qaeda ( Prague anyone ? )
Why was n’t King prepared to challenge Cheney on this , and why did n’t AP put anything in their story pointing out that this quote was untrue ?
1 Victor Lustig : the Man who sold the Eiffel Tower
Known as “ the man who sold the Eiffel Tower ” , Victor Lustig was one of the most talented confidence tricksters who ever lived .
Born in 1890 in Bohemia , Czechoslovakia , he was a glib and charming conman , fluent in multiple languages .
He established himself by working scams on the ocean liners steaming between Paris and New York City .
Lustig ’s first con involved a “ money - printing machine ” .
He would demonstrate the capability of the small box to clients , all the while lamenting that it took the device six hours to copy a $ 100 bill .
The client , sensing huge profits , would buy the machines for a high price , usually over $ 30,000 .
Over the next twelve hours , the machine would produce two more $ 100 bills .
After that , it produced only blank paper , as its supply of $ 100 bills became exhausted .
By the time the clients realized that they had been scammed , Lustig was long gone .
In 1925 , Lustig ’s master con began when he was reading a newspaper : an article discussed the problems the city was having maintaining the Eiffel Tower .
So he adopted the persona of a government official , and sent six scrap metal dealers an invitation to discuss a possible business deal .
Lustig told the group that the upkeep on the Eiffel Tower was so outrageous that the city could not maintain it any longer , and wanted to sell it for scrap .
So he sold the Eiffel Tower to one of the scrap metal dealers and took a train to Vienna with the suitcase full of cash .
The buyer was too humiliated to complain to the police .
Later , Lustig convinced gangster Al Capone to invest $ 40,000 in a stock deal .
Lustig kept Capone ’s money in a safe deposit box for two months , then returned it to him , claiming that the deal had fallen through .
Impressed with Lustig ’s integrity , Capone gave him $ 5,000 .
It was , of course , all that Lustig was after .
On 1907 , Lustig arrived to the United States and conducted a number of scams , but eventually his luck ran out : he was arrested for counterfeiting and sent to Alcatraz prison .
On March 9 , 1947 , he contracted pneumonia and died two days later .
2 Frank Abagnale : catch me if you can
The movie “ Catch Me If You Can ” is loosely based on Frank Abagnale ‘s exploits , as he collected over $ 2,5 million in 26 countries .
Born in 1948 , his first con was writing checks on his own overdrawn account .
Then he printed out his own , almost perfect copies of checks .
He also collected over US $ 40,000 by printing his account number on blank bank deposit slips and added them to the stack of real blank slips in the bank .
Then , for a period of two years , Abagnale masqueraded as Pan Am pilot “ Frank Williams ” , to get free rides around the world by dead heading on scheduled airline flights .
Later , he impersonated a pediatrician for 11 months in a Georgia hospital under the name “ Frank Williams ” .
He also forged a Harvard University Law diploma , passed the bar exam of Louisiana and got a job at the office of the State Attorney General of Louisiana .
Eventually he was caught in France in 1969 when an Air France attendant recognized his face from a wanted poster .
When the French police apprehended him , 12 of the countries in which he had committed fraud wanted to extradite him .
After a two day trial , he first served prison time in Perpignan ’s House of Arrest in France ; a one - year sentence that was reduced by the presiding judge at his trial to six months .
His stay in Perpignan left him fearful of spending more time in another version of the prison .
He was then extradited to Sweden where he was treated fairly well under Swedish law .
During trial for forgery , his defense attorney almost had his case dismissed by arguing that he had “ created ” the fake checks and not forged them , but his charges were instead reduced to swindling and fraud .
He served six months in a Malmö prison , only to learn at the end of it he would be tried next in Italy .
Later , a Swedish judge asked a U.S. State Department official to revoke his passport .
Without a valid passport Swedish authorities were forced to deport him to the U.S.
He was sentenced to 12 years in a federal prison for multiple counts of forgery .
3 Charles Ponzi : created the Ponzi Scheme
One of the greatest swindlers in American history , Charles Ponzi created the famous “ Ponzi scheme , ” a scam that pays early investors returns from the investments of later investors .
He promised clients a 50 % profit within 45 days , or 100 % profit within 90 days , by buying discounted postal reply coupons in other countries and redeeming them at face value in the United States as a form of arbitrage .
By the time he was making $ 250,000 a day in 1920 , federal agents arrested him , afterstarted a series of articles that asked hard questions about the operation of Ponzi ’s money machine .
He was sent to prison for years ; on 1934 Ponzi was released , sent to Italy , and eventually Brazil , where spent the last years of his life in poverty , working occasionally as a translator .
He had a stroke in 1948 , and died in a charity hospital in Rio de Janeiro on 1949 .
4 Christopher Rocancourt : the french “ Rockefeller ”
An imposter and con artist who scammed affluent people by masquerading as a French member of the Rockefeller family , Christopher Rocancourt pulled his first big con in Paris , faking the deed to a property he did n’t own , then “ selling ” it for USD $ 1.4 million .
Making his way to the United States , Rocancourt pretended to be a movie producer , ex-boxing champion or venture capitalist .
He dropped names like “ his mother ” Sophia Loren or “ his uncles ” Oscar de la Renta and Dino De Laurentiis and was associated with various celebrities .
He married Playboy model Pia Reyes ; they had a son , Zeus .
He lived for a time with Mickey Rourke and apparently convinced actor Jean - Claude Van Damme to produce his next movie .
One of his trademarks was to always have a stunningly beautiful woman on his arm .
Beside being married to Pia Reyes , according to the press , he lived with playboy model Rhonda Rydell for six months .
She did not know Rocancourt was married , and said he had told her he was French nobility , the son of a countess .
In March 2002 he was extradited to New York and pleaded to charges of theft , grand larceny , smuggling , bribery , perjury and fraud against 19 victims .
He was fined $ 9 million , was ordered to pay $ 1.2 million in restitution and sentenced to five years in prison .
In Switzerland , the police have connected him with a jewel theft and barred him from the country until 2016 .
He once estimated to Dateline that his various schemes / ventures netted him at least $ 40 million ( USD ) , but this can not be confirmed .
5 Gregor MacGregor : drew investors to “ Poyais ” , a fictional country
A Scottish soldier , adventurer and colonizer who fought in the South American struggle for independence , Gregor MacGregor was also one of the most famous con artists of all time as he , upon his return to England in 1820 , claimed to be cazique of “ Poyais ” , a fictional Central American country that MacGregor had invented which , with his help , drew investors and eventually colonists .
Not only did Gregor MacGregor gain the trust and hard - earned pounds of his eager would - be colonists , he also created a guidebook detailing the geography and abundant natural resources of his island off the coast of Honduras .
By the time his 250 investors had sailed to the vacant patch of water where their island should have been , MacGregor was already rounding up his next group of colonists , this time from France .
Undeterred by the eventual deaths of 200 of his first settlers , MacGregor went through the trouble of drafting a Poyois constitution naming himself as head of the republic .
Even after his trial and conviction for fraud , this magnificent man continued selling non-existent land and stock to European nobility .
6 Cassie Chadwick : Andrew Carnegie ’s “ illegitimate daughter ”
Born as Elizabeth Bigley but later known as Cassie Chadwick , defrauded Cleveland - area banks by claiming to be an illegitimate daughter of Andrew Carnegie .
At the age of 22 , Cassie was arrested in Woodstock , Ontario for forgery but released on grounds of insanity .
In 1882 she married Wallace Springsteen in Cleveland , Ohio ; her husband threw her out eleven days later when he found out about her past .
In Cleveland , she married a Dr. Chadwick .
In 1897 , Cassie began her largest , most successful con game : that of establishing herself as Andrew Carnegie ’s daughter .
She faked a promissory note of $ 2 million with Carnegie ’s signature .
The information leaked to the financial markets in northern Ohio , and banks begun to offer their services .
For the next eight years she used this fake background to obtain loans that eventually totaled between 10 and 20 million dollars .
When Carnegie was later asked about her , he denied ever knowing her : the scheme collapsed , she was arrested and the trial was a media circus .
She died in jail .
7 Ferdinand Demara : improvised successful surgeries as a fake surgeon
Known as “ the Great Impostor ” , Ferdinand Demara masqueraded as many people from monks to surgeons to prison wardens .
Born in Massachusetts in 1921 , he joined the U.S. Army in 1941 and began his new live by borrowing the name of his army buddy Anthony Ignolia .
He then faked his suicide and borrowed another name , Robert Linton French , and became a religiously - oriented psychologist .
Both Navy and Army caught him eventually and he served 18 months in prison .
A string of pseudo - academic careers followed .
He was , among other things , a civil engineer , a sheriff ’s deputy , an assistant prison warden , a doctor of applied psychology , a hospital orderly , a lawyer , a child - care expert , a Benedictine monk , a Trappist monk , an editor , a cancer researcher , and a teacher .
One teaching job led to a six months in prison .
He never seemed to get much monetary gain in what he was doing – just temporary respectability .
His most famous exploit was to masquerade as surgeon Joseph Cyr on the HMCS Cayuga , a Canadian Navy destroyer , during the Korean War .
He managed to improvise successful surgeries and fend off infection with generous amounts of penicillin .
This worked until the mother of the real Dr. Joseph Cyr found out and reported it .
Demara returned to the U.S. , inspired the 1960 film “ The Great Imposter , ” and died on 1982 as a Baptist minister .
8 David Hampton : Six Degrees of Separation from Sidney Poitier
An African - American con artist , David Hampton ‘ story became the inspiration for the famous movie “ Six Degrees of Separation , ” as he assumed the identity of Sidney Poitier ’s son and was suddenly ushered in as celebrity .
Hampton began employing the persona of “ David Poitier ” to cadge free meals in restaurants .
He then persuaded at least a dozen people into letting him stay with them in their homes or to give him money , including Melanie Griffith , Gary Sinise , and Calvin Klein .
He told some of them that he was a friend of their children , some that he had just missed his plane to Los Angeles and that all his luggage was on it , some that his belongings had been stolen .
On 1983 , Hampton was arrested and convicted for his frauds and was ordered to pay restitution of $ 4,490 to his various victims ; on 2003 he died of AIDS - related complications .
9 Mary Baker : Princess Caraboo from the island of Javasu
On 1817 , a cobbler in England , met an apparently disoriented young woman with exotic clothes who was speaking a language no one could understand .
Locals brought many foreigners who tried to find out what strange language the lady was talking , until a Portuguese sailor “ translated ” her story : she was Princess Caraboo from the island of Javasu in the Indian Ocean .
She had been captured by pirates , then jumped overboard in the Bristol Channel and swam ashore .
For the next ten weeks , this representative of exotic royalty was a favourite of the local dignataries .
She used a bow and arrow , fenced , swam naked and prayed to God , whom she termed Allah Tallah .
She acquired exotic clothing and a portrait made of her was reproduced in local newspapers .
Eventually the truth came out : she was actually a cobbler ’s daughter , Mary Baker , from Devon .
She had been a servant girl in various places all over England but had not found a place to stay .
She had invented a fictitious language out of imaginary and gypsy words and created an exotic character .
She continued her role in the USA , France and Spain without the same luck .
Her story was the basis of the 1994 movie “ Princess Caraboo ” , written by John Wells .
10 Milli Vanilli : the pop duo that tricked the world
A pop vocal duo composed of Fab Morvan and Rob Pilatus , Milli Vanilli was formed in Germany in the mid-1980s .
The duo started to grow worldwide rapidly in 1988 and won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist on 1990 .
And then , in that same year , during a ‘ live ’ performance recorded by MTV at the Lake Compounce theme park in Connecticut , the recording of the song “ Girl You Know It ’s True ” jammed and began to skip , resulting in one of the most embarrassing moments in popular music history .
The truth was revealed : the Milli Vanilli sound was actually created by Frank Farian featuring the vocal talents of other singers , and Morvan and Pilatus did not sing at all on the records .
After this , the Grammy Award they received was stripped from them , and at least 26 different lawsuits were filed under various U.S. consumer fraud protection laws against Pilatus , Morvan and Arista Records .
In 1998 , only ten years after Milli Vanilli ’s inital debut , Pilatus was found dead in a Frankfurt hotel of an apparent drug overdose .
Last year ’s Future of WordPress Themes ( read it here ) found 11 people committed to thinking creatively about WordPress themes stopping to look where WordPress theming was heading — and now we ’re doing it again !
These 15 people — designers , developers , and WordPress enthusiasts — are some of the people who will shape WordPress themes , and what they mean , into version 3.0 and beyond .
Here is how they answered the question “ What is the future of WordPress Themes ? ”
Brian Gardner
I think the future of WordPress themes is heading into a very positive direction – there are a lot of designers who are developing some really great themes .
It seems that a lot of us have our own unique style , which makes it great for users to enjoy a wide selection of quality themes .
Another thing that I have personally experienced is building plugin - type functions into a theme , which enhances it that much more .
Special thanks go to guys like Nathan Rice who are focusing more on the code / functionality of a theme , because they are adding to the overall impact that themes are making .
Overall , I ’d say that the next year of WordPress themes should be as productive , if not more than the last , and the ability to use WordPress as a content management system only seems to become an easier thing to achieve .
Brian Gardner has made many a WordPress theme and currently releases his pay - to - download GPL themes over at StudioPress .
Andrew Rickmann
I think we are going to see a realization from free premium ( as opposed to proprietary ) theme authors that there are immense gains to be had from modularizing themes and working together .
I think this will manifest itself through functional classes where development is shared between several authors , or possibly with each author creating one in their area of specialty which they share with others .
These will make up a library of functionality that will provide standard UI and database interaction and along the way make it harder for proprietary themers to offer that little extra .
It will hasten the switch from selling licenses to selling services .
It would n’t surprise me if someone created a theme plugins module , where the user could add and remove functionality with the themes falling back to a default and which would allow full plugins to be included in a sub - folder so they could also be distributed , and therefore developed , separately .
I have been predicting intelligent solutions for some time .
I still do n’t feel the theme community are ready for this yet , so I think there will still be a strong focus on making things simple for users .
I see a lot of redevelopment as a lot of complex solutions are modularized to make their development easier and I think this might delay the introduction of some great things .
I would like to see a growing trend in premium themes that really put the onus on the user to understand HTML and PHP .
The kind of themes that are designed to be activated and left on instead of tweaked to within an inch of their lives .
Finally , I really think this year we will start to see themes in HTML 5 .
There have been a number of great blog posts about how to use HTML 5 , the specs are pretty easy to follow , and the basics can be used now , albeit some minor jiggery - pokery is required for IE .
I am developing one for “ the platform that shall not be named ” and I really like the way it operates .

Elliot Jay Stocks
Once Automattic allow users to discover and install themes directly through the WordPress admin ( as you currently can with plugins ) , this will – obviously – have a huge impact on the way in which themes are found and used .
Although it ’s a huge plus for the user , it might not be a desirable situation for some theme developers , because it means that – as users abandon Google searching and instead rely on the in - built theme directory – themes that are n’t submitted will potentially be left undiscovered .
And as we ’ve seen in recent times , ‘ premium ’ theme developers have been prevented from submitting their themes to the directory , and that ’s a huge chunk of the theme market , especially if you consider that premium themes are usually – but of course not always – of a higher quality than most free themes .
I ’m still sitting on the fence with regards to the premium theme debate .
I can understand Automattic ’s concern over profit being made from open source software , but I also understand the premium theme developers ’ wish to make money from the hard work they ’re putting in .
Right now I ’m really not sure which way the tide will turn , and can only hope for an amicable agreement between both camps .
With regards to child themes , I think we ’re on the cusp of seeing them go very big , once they ’re adopted by the community as a whole .
The work of people like Ian is certainly helping to promote this change .
I personally think child themes need to see further improvement before they can become a viable option for non-blog sites that use WordPress , but I ’m confident that time will come soon , and there will be a lot of people ready to take that new approach to theming .

Theme ( a stripped down starting point for WordPress Theme development ) has powered up many a blog .
Darren Hoyt
One thing I noticed in 2008 was a major spike in the number of WordPress tutorial blogs popping up .
A lot of them offer creative code hacks and ideas you would n’t find in the Codex .
Major design blogs like Smashing Magazine have also been making WordPress modding a featured topic .
As for 2009 , I think all the recent exposure and accessibility of documentation will encourage a new wave of themers .
More front - end designers who ordinarily shy away from coding will begin experimenting more rapidly with WordPress theming .
What I hope is they ’ll bring a fresh visual style to the way blogs traditionally display content .
I think more themers will begin to deviate in general , instead of relying on standard columns and bloggy stuff ( date archives , tag clouds , recent comments ) which seem to have become less useful .
On that note , I think users are already realizing the limitations of the traditional blog format .
I ’m guessing by the end of 2009 the WordPress core itself will resemble a true CMS more closely .
As CMS - like functions are added to the core , themers will incorporate them in creative ways , and the face of themes will begin to change .
Overall blogging frequency will probably continue to decline as microblogging goes more mainstream and all the other branches of social media pull people in various directions .
I imagine more users will want themes that tie all their content together in a meaningful way .
Sweetcron , Friendfeed and Tumblr all capitalize on the fact that people are writing ( longform ) less , in favor of sharing links and accumulating media .
Finally , I hope Automattic takes notice of projects like Thematic and Hybrid and considers shipping WordPress with a more robust default theme to replace Kubrick .

WordPress 2.8 , due out within a couple of months , will undoubtedly contain a feature set not unlike the current “ automatic plugin update ” feature , but for themes .
Users will be able to upgrade their themes automatically from their dashboard , assuming their theme is hosted on WordPress.org Extend .
Given this , it is my opinion that 2009 will see more “ Theme Frameworks ” than ever before .
2008 saw the introduction of Ian Stewart ’s Thematic , Justin Tadlock ’s Hybrid , and Chris Pearson ’s Thesis , all of which are ( in reality ) theme frameworks .
And 2009 will , no doubt , offer newer , better frameworks than even these .
Why ?
Two words : Modification Protection .
Let ’s face it , users want to always be up - to - date with the latest code from theme authors , but they HATE the fact that , most of the time , when they upgrade they lose their modifications .
Pearson introduced a combination of hooks , user functions , and user styles .
Ian Stewart spearheaded the child - theme concept , which WordPress 2.7 seems to support .
Both of these options allow for the protection of user modifications during upgrades , because users are encouraged to make modifications separate from the core files of the theme , much like WordPress allows in its plugin functions .
And when WordPress eventually includes automatic upgrade features , the protection of user modifications becomes ESSENTIAL .
Frameworks also allow theme authors to allow their themes to accumulate fixes and functions .
If every theme offered by a theme author was built on an internal framework , updates to the framework would apply to ALL themes built on it .
Fixes and Features would snowball .
Frameworks are n’t perfect .
They require unnecessary overhead that I believe can lead to code bloat , but the benefits they offer are undeniable .
They ’re here to stay , and they will be a staple for 2009 in the WordPress world .
PS – This year , the line dividing theme and plugin will be blurred even further .
Plugins will , in some cases , do a theme ’s job , and themes will , in some cases , do a plugin ’s job .

The future of WordPress themes has two directions : I see more and more themes with functionality coming up , complete job boards , bookmarking sites etc .
Next to that , the premium theme market is growing it seems , and is adding tons of great design ideas to the community .
In no way is it dead , but the times that people could sell 100,000 copies of the same “ simple ” theme are gone , as there ’s more competition and the market is becoming fragmented .
Chris Pearson ’s Thesis and Ian Stewart ’s Thematic might be pointing in the direction where it should be heading : a theme that basically is n’t a theme anymore , it ’s a layout engine .
That layout engine allows people to get a unique design .
I ’m seeing a lot of “ simple ” bloggers around me become more professional about their blog and switching to their own “ unique ” theme , because they see it ’s their online business card , and it can get them recognition , and may even get them hired .
Another “ new ” thing is that people seem to think about SEO a lot more , as well as optimizing their themes for the different social visitors that might come to it .
In all , the theme market is a pretty cool one , with lots of improvements flowing back into the general WordPress community , which is the way it should be , I guess . 🙂

Jeff Chandler
While 2008 proved to be a dynamite year for WordPress themes , especially the news / magazine layout , I think this year will continue down that same road but with improvements being made in all areas such as less dependency on the end user knowing how to utilize custom fields , better UI when it comes to configuring the theme in the WordPress administration panel , better documentation bundled with themes , etc .
In last years prediction , I mentioned that the next trend of themes would revolve around Widgets enabling the end user more control of the initial layout of the theme .
It did n’t quite take off as I thought it would however , I saw bits and pieces of the trend taking shape at the end of 2008 and I think it will make lots of progress throughout 2009 .
Another trend I ’m subscribing to in 2009 is the year of the theme framework .
We have quite a few theme frameworks already in action and throughout 2009 , I feel a few more will come online .
However , educating end users about theme frameworks , child themes , CSS , should be a top priority or else this child theme concept will never lift high off the ground .
Last but not least , I see the premium / proprietary theme market expanding instead of shrinking .
Will these new entrants abide by the GPL ?
Only time will tell .

There are several genres of themes available which target different types of site :
‘ Blog ’ themes are created for your ( mostly ) typical blog user .
Though they might vary quite a bit in their general visual design , they follow the typical ‘ header / content / sidebars / footer ’ model , with the content presented in the usual reverse chronological order .
The main change I see happening here is with themes which provide some sort of customizing feature on the backend which lets you choose options like : header graphics ; one , two , or three sidebars , along with their positions ; color schemes ;
They will also be pre-bundled with several plugins which allow you to pull in your content from other sources such as Twitter , Facebook , Flickr , etc .
These kinds of themes already exist , but I think we ’ll see the ease of customization rise to a new level .
‘ Portfolio ’ themes are specialized for sites that mainly deal with pages more than posts .
I think we ’ll see a spike in the number of available portfolio themes , with a variety of specialities .
Some will come ready for e-commerce use , some will be geared towards showcasing artwork or multimedia , others may be specialized towards providing downloadable products , with features for tracking click - throughs and such .
‘ Magazine ’ themes are already pretty abundant , but I think we ’ll see more of these appear , as well .
These usually differ from standard ‘ blog ’ themes by including features such as ‘ featured articles ’ , detailed author profiles , more complex and precise grid - based layouts , more advanced typography and various other visual tidbits borrowed from more traditional print media .
And across all types of themes , I think we ’ll be seeing more themes which provide ways to fine - tune placement of text snippets , widgets , and such .
One way will be by providing many widget containers , like Thematic .
Another way will be by creating advanced “ theme frameworks ” , like Carrington .
All in all , if I had to sum it up in two words : extreme customization .

I ’m seeing more of a call for themes that do n’t require users to edit any code .
This way , they can be used by really novice WordPress users , and are out - of - the - box ready for WPMU setups .
Speaking of WPMU , over the next year you will start to see more themes coming out specifically for mu-driven home pages .
On top of that , I think the BuddyPress theme market will explode , especially for the member themes , which are a different beast than regular WordPress themes .
More of the premium sites will show up with WPMU installs so people can “ try before they buy ” .
Paid themes will continue to thrive , because when users see a theme they want , they buy it .
And if you ’re not following WordPress MU development and BuddyPress , or have n’t even looked at either , then you ’re already too late . 😉

Derek Punsalan
When I think of the future of WordPress themes , I hope for a major push in the distribution model to better benefit the end user .
WordPress 2.7 introduced a major convenience milestone by introducing the ability to install and update plugins from within the Dashboard .
When are users going to enjoy the same convenience with themes ?
And when are theme developers going to be able to push updates to users without having to rely on their own homegrown methods of updating users ?
Blog posts , RSS feeds , email newsletters , and Twitter updates can only go so far .
Is this a distribution solution managed from WordPress.org , or can theme developers deploy updates directly from their own servers ?
Because anyone is free to distribute their own themes , the immediate challenge – of course – will revolve around the question of moderation .
That in itself is an entirely different blog post .

I just re-read last year ’s “ Future of WP Themes ” post and it ’s funny to see that not many of the predictions came to fruition .
I think part of this reason is that WordPress ( the core ) has n’t really progressed as we thought it would ( i.e. to more of a general CMS ) .
Ultimately themes are limited to include functionality that is supported by the core ( mostly ) .
Sure – we ’ve done quite a few unique add - ons on our themes at WooThemes , but there ’s always a balance to adding functionality that is not supported by the core ( I sometimes get the feeling I ’m hacking WP ; especially on client projects ) .
So for themes to really progress in 2009 , WP needs to progress as well ( that ’s assuming that Matt & co actually want to turn it into a more generally - purposed CMS ) .
So considering these limitations , I ’d like to see themes containing more widgetized spaces ( not only in the sidebars ) and allow the theme ’s user to incorporate widgets specifically designed for that theme .
In addition to this , a variety of page , post & archive templates will extend the options available to the user , in terms of which widgets to display where .
And then lastly , I think that we ’ll see quite a big fuss being made about BuddyPress themes soon , as everyone searches to build their own , little niche social network .

I ’m surprised every day at things I see happening with WordPress themes .
Even if my predictions are n’t correct , this will be a bit of a look into the direction my themes will be headed in the next year .
Theme authors will start focusing more on niche themes .
We ’ve already started seeing the rise of real estate themes , video themes , and others .
This will allow theme authors to grab the attention of small businesses with highly - focused designs .
The proprietary theme market will continue to grow .
More theme clubs will pop up .
The top developers will continue to rake in cash while new designers looking to break into the market will have to undercut the major players drastically in price while offering the same level of support and design .
I hope we continue thinking of more creative ways to make money while still honoring the GPL .
There ’s a lot of untapped potential that could make for some interesting business strategies for themes .
End users are demanding more .
There will be a three - way split in users .
I see theme developers branching off to cater to each group .
These three groups will be :
Users that want simple themes that they can customize to their heart ’s content .
Users that want complete control of their theme from the WordPress admin .
Users that want the flexibility of a theme framework .
A theme developer that can merge all three groups will be unstoppable .
I ’d like to make it the Year of the Theme Framework .
We ’ve seen quite a few frameworks pop up , and I ’ve heard of a few other people considering developing their own .
Frameworks allow for quick turnover when you have many clients .
Theme authors can put out loads of different designs without having to do all the mundane work of recoding the same things .
Reusing code is a cornerstone of good development practice , and it ’s starting to spill over into the WordPress theme development world .
If it ’s not going to be the Year of the Theme Framework , then it should at least be the year that widgets break from the bonds of the sidebar .
WordPress widgets allow users to add custom content easily .
The text widget itself is the most versatile tool in WordPress — you ca n’t convince me otherwise .
Theme developers will start adding many widget areas to their themes , giving users more control .
I suspect many developers will continue to pile on extra theme options to try and satisfy a need with an ever - growing user base that demands not having to touch code .
Many mistakes will be made in this regard in terms of best practices , but many users will flock to the most option - filled themes .
As always , I ’m excited and happy to be in the mix of things .
I ’m looking forward to another year of developing WordPress themes .

Blogging will continue to grow .
WordPress will continue to dominate .
And themes , both free and premium , will continue to grow in number and quality .
Hopefully a consensus will be reached regarding the ethical and legal implications of applying restrictive licenses to WordPress themes .
Currently the majority of premium theme developers attach restrictive licenses to their themes which actively prevent any further development and release .
Even if I buy a developers license for Thesis , for example , I am not allowed , according to that license , to develop the theme and redistribute it back into the WordPress community for further development .
This raises an important question that needs to be answered .
Given that all WordPress themes , by their very nature , are rooted in open source code , is any restrictive license that is attached to that code legally enforceable and , if so , how much theme modification is required by a developer , licensed or otherwise , before they are able to redistribute that theme for free in order to facilitate further open source development ?

Since 2005 , there ’s been a very understated , very organic evolution in the world of WordPress theme development .
Largely unnoticed until 2008 , this evolution has really picked up steam in recent months , and now theme development is , in my opinion , a market force that is becoming extremely influential .
Themes represent a crucial link in the chain of mass communication , simply because they have the power to allow non-technical people to operate effectively in a space that has , heretofore , only been dominated by the technically - inclined .
In 2009 , themes will allow more creative individuals from a wider array of backgrounds and interests than ever before to express themselves purposefully and efficiently on the Web .
Themes are a big , big deal .
Wait , maybe I should rephrase that — intelligent themes that truly bridge the technical gap and allow more creative individuals to operate online are a big , big deal 😀

I think WordPress themes are ( almost ) fundamentally flawed thanks to WordPress ’s lack of a proper presentation layer .
It ’s so hard to make changes for non-PHP people because they have to learn both PHP and loads of WordPress functions to do funky stuff .
So with my ( forever upcoming ) Vanilla theme I have implemented a proper templating engine to ensure that , at least within the scope of what Vanilla can do , theme designers and users do n’t have to see and PHP at all , and yet are free to make dramatic design changes to their themes .
WordPress is not about to get retrofitted with a proper templating engine because — last I heard him on the subject —
Matt was against the idea , liking the leanness of the current “ raw PHP ” approach , and he has many who agree with him .
But for mine , I think WordPress really needs proper separation of the presentation layer , however that is achieved .
Another issue that bugs me : in their efforts to create the next killer theme , I am seeming more and more themers trying to bloat their themes with a load of features which is best kept out of the theme and in plugins .
Today I watched a themer on video boasting that his upcoming secret theme would do all of this and all of that so that all kinds of plugins were no longer necessary .
That ’s just plain wrong .
Let the plugin authors do what they do , and lets keep themes about clean , flexible , fast and standards - sensitive presentation , and ( ideally ) nothing more .
It ’s arrogant to try and do better than a plugin author who does what he / she does really well .
And it ’s silly .
I could say more but I wo n’t .
So I think we ’ll hit a crisis point some time soon where themers will try and add everything including the kitchen sink into their themes and then finally we ’ll all get over that stupid idea and instead write themes that are plugin - aware .
Many of us are heading that way , anyway .
Can the rest of you please catch up sooner rather than later ?!
Finally , I do think it IS a theme developers problem to look at performance and scalability .
This , in particular , when it comes to how CSS and Javascript are handled / optimized .
It ’s also to do with how easy it is for someone to use your theme in the context of a very large site with a lot of pages and subsections and plugins , etc .
There are challenges with building large magazine / news / company sites that demand more than what more themers are capable of …
I ’m really excited about my Vanilla theme ( if you can bear with a teeny bit of self - promotion ) because , although I ’m very slow about it , I ’ve focused on nothing other than best - practice , on speed , and on that issue of separating out a proper presentation layer .
The result is something I ’m having loads of fun with and which I fully expect will take a while to grow on people and make sense to them — at least those who do n’t do themes all day long !
I am personally saddened that so much attention is paid to themes like Thesis , which owe their success more to good marketing than to good product ( sorry Brian and Chris ) , and which play games with the GPL ( yes , I ’m going there again ) .
I hope that the future of WordPress themes is also about the emergence of such good free themes that the “ premium ” market shrivels up and dies .

The live of Chinese fishermen is so poor that they have to go out to sea everyday to catch fish to sell although there is an incoming thunderstorm on the way .
The choppy waters and heavy rain made it very difficult to fish .
The fishermen ’s little boat swayed vigorously from side to side .
As they are about to throw their net into the sea , a huge wave rocked their boat , causing them to lose their balance and fall into the sea .
“ God , please help us ! ” they screamed in the water , “ Who is going to take care of our wife and children ? ”
I just want to share that the live of fishermen is not easy and very life - threatening .
Please be grateful on what you have today .
Anyway , please see following photos .
Really awesome !

This was probably the most stupid fire in Moscow for the last few years .
What was so stupid about it ?
Well , the building on those pictures on fire was one of the theaters in Moscow , Russia .
It has got on fire and pretty soon firefighter squads started arriving .
They wanted to enter the building to stop the fire from the inside while it ’s not too late but … that ’s when all the stupidity begins : the security guards on the entrance have not let the firemen in .
That ’s what you call the best order subjection ever .
In that theater building there was a private disco club also .
And the owners of the club gave a strict order to the guards : “ Do n’t let ANYBODY in until further instructions would be given ” .
Of course they said it before the fire , but for those guys on the entrance there was only one rule : “ We have an order and we have to obey ” .
So they did n’t let any single fireman to enter even when they have seen the fire itself .
A few hours firemen could n’t enter the building and had to watch how the fire takes over and over the historical building in the Moscow downtown .
The Obama Administration this week released its predecessor 's post - 9/11 legal memoranda in the name of " transparency , " producing another round of feel - good Bush criticism .
Anyone interested in President Obama 's actual executive - power policies , however , should look at his position on warrantless wiretapping .
Dick Cheney must be smiling .
In a federal lawsuit , the Obama legal team is arguing that judges lack the authority to enforce their own rulings in classified matters of national security .
The standoff concerns the Oregon chapter of the Al - Haramain Islamic Foundation , a Saudi Arabian charity that was shut down in 2004 on evidence that it was financing al Qaeda .
Al - Haramain sued the Bush Administration in 2005 , claiming it had been illegally wiretapped .
At the heart of Al - Haramain 's case is a classified document that it says proves that the alleged eavesdropping was not authorized under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , or FISA .
That record was inadvertently disclosed after Al - Haramain was designated as a terrorist organization ; the Bush Administration declared such documents state secrets after their existence became known .
In July , the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the President 's right to do so , which should have ended the matter .
But the San Francisco panel also returned the case to the presiding district court judge , Vaughn Walker , ordering him to decide if FISA pre-empts the state secrets privilege .
If he does , Al - Haramain would be allowed to use the document to establish the standing to litigate .
The Obama Justice Department has adopted a legal stance identical to , if not more aggressive than , the Bush version .
It argues that the court - forced disclosure of the surveillance programs would cause " exceptional harm to national security " by exposing intelligence sources and methods .
Last Friday the Ninth Circuit denied the latest emergency motion to dismiss , again kicking matters back to Judge Walker .
" But in other areas they have not been holding it together in the same way and they may be doing just a bit of it .

The change in presidential administrations , cannabis ’ popularity in the country , the outing of Michael Phelps , the record number of reform bills introduced in the states and the crushing economic crisis facing the country have collectively cast a great deal of focus on the question of ending cannabis prohibition portend that now is the best time in 30 years to widely broadcast NORML ’s longstanding message of cannabis law reform for responsible adult use .
What will it take to finally move public opinion sufficiently from tacit support for legalization to majority support ?
For decades some law reform advocates and communication experts have argued that advertising could be the likely missing component .
Let ’s find out !
We can all afford to kick down $ 10 to purchase 125 TV ads , or $ 50 for 625 ads !
Please make a tax - deductible donation to the NORML Foundation today in support of this important project .
Let ’s start a nationwide ‘ cannabis conversation ’ , please donate in support of placing NORML ’s ads on TV and the Internet , let ’s get over the hump and achieve real cannabis law reforms as soon as possible .

New Jersey could see the end of the Brazilian Bikini wax as the NJ State ban the practice .
Officials say that genital waxing has always been illegal , it just has not been spelled out clearly in the law .
They propose to introduce a new law which would specifically ban genital waxing .
The reason given were recent cases where genital waxing had gone wrong and complaints were made by two women who were injured and hospitalized , one of which sued .
Others believe that the proposal is the state 's way of diverting the procedure from beauty salons to the medical community , where hair can be removed using laser treatment by dermatologists .
Genital waxing is popular among women who fashion the skimpier and more revealing Brazilian bikinis and the new law would force the practice underground along the New Jersey shore .
Cherry Hill salon owner Linda Orsuto said that women would " go ballistic " if the proposal passed .
She said that some women would resort to waxing themselves , visiting unlicensed salons or traveling to other states , including Pennsylvania , in a quest to remain bare down there .

Evolution may be viewed as a controversial subject by much of the US population , but evolutionary biologists frequently complain that this controversy is manufactured by opponents of evolution who have a very flawed understanding of what the science of evolution is .
This poor grasp of the science was demonstrated once again in a talk given by Intelligent Design advocate Jonathan Wells , who claims that " DNA does not control embryo development .
" Wells , who has a PhD in biology , ( I do n't know what the director of graduate studies at UC Berkeley was smoking ) , has repeatedly demonstrated his cluelessness about basic elements of biology , and he is a clear illustration of why a PhD does not necessarily indicate anything about its holder 's knowledge .
Over at Pharyngula , PZ Myers has a thorough takedown of Wells ' absurd talk .
The talk is based on the bizarre claim that " DNA does not control embryo development . "
If that 's true , Wells argues , then the whole tottering neo -Darwinian edifice collapses , or something like that .
PZ , who unlike Wells actually uses his developmental biology degree to do science , slices and dices these weird creationist claims with his usual facility .
One of Wells ' PowerPoint slides says that a " paternal centrosome , without DNA , is sufficient to generate a complete parthenogenic frog from from a living egg . "
Go visit PZ if you want a definition of the terminology , but taken literally this false statement claims that you can make a frog without DNA , which is clearly not true .
To be charitable , Wells appears to be referring to the fact that you can generate embryos without paternal DNA .
As PZ explains , you can make an egg cell " think " that it has been fertilized , and get it to start dividing with only maternal DNA around .
How that phenomenon disproves evolution is beyond my comprehension .
In any case , I 'm not writing to echo Myers ' takedown ; head on over and read the whole thing yourself .
But you 've got to give Wells credit for one thing : whether he wants to or not , he 's making a prediction .
It works like this : if you take the DNA out of an egg cell of one species ( let 's say , a cow oocyte ) , replace it with the DNA of another species , like a cat , and then prompt that egg to develop into an embryo , which animal will you get , a cow or a cat ?
If Wells is right , then that cow egg with cat DNA will develop into a cow .
The scientific world says you 'll get a cat .
Well , that experiment 's been done , and unfortunately for Wells , it turns out that DNA does determine which animal you get .
The technique to do this is called ' interspecies somatic cell nuclear transfer , ' and it is being attempted in the hope that we 'll be able to clone endangered or even extinct species .
For example , if you want to resurrect woolly mammoths , you take mammoth DNA , put it into an elephant egg ( minus elephant DNA ) , and implant that egg into an elephant .
In fact , the experiment has been done many times already .
In one case researchers took DNA from an endangered European mouflan ( species Ovis orientalis ) :
They put the DNA into an egg ( missing its own DNA ) from a domesticated sheep ( species Ovis aries ) :
The result ?
A lamb that is a European mouflan ( you can see the cloned lamb next to its biological - but - not - genetic mother ) :
In other words , DNA does in fact control embryo development .
To be honest , no sane scientist thought the outcome would be any different , because decades of genetic experiments revealed that you can change how an embryo develops by altering a single gene , while leaving everything else constant .
Thanks to cloning , another strange attack on evolution bites the dust .
Ridiculous .
Olive oil has about 120 calories per tablespoon .
Calories measure energy content - you can stick a wick in olive oil and burn it like a candle .
If a tablespoon of semen had 25 times as much energy content , it would make a pretty good rocket fuel , or maybe explosive .
It 's closer to six calories per teaspoon .
BTW , an adult daily diet is typically 2000 calories or so .
Teenage boys typically masturbate 5 - 10 times per week .
That would mean 15,000 to 30,000 calories per week , which would have to be replaced in their diet .
In other words , and boy ( or man ) wit reasonably active sex life would have to double or triple the amount they eat .
Apple ’s App Store is currently experiencing a plague of fart applications .
Last week , I detailed one day in which at least 14 new fart apps were accepted into the store .
And now , just in a quick search , it looks like there are about 50 apps all dedicated to making fart noises on your iPhone or iPod touch .
Classy , I know , but why are there so many ?
Because apparently there ’s big money in fart apps — nearly $ 10,000 a day for the most popular ones .
Developer InfoMedia ( Joel Comm ) , which makes i Fart Mobile [ iTunes link ] , has been releasing download statistics for the app each day since it launched .
The $ 0.99 app has been in the top 100 paid apps every day since its launch , and has seen great growth .
In fact , yesterday it hit the number one overall position with over 13,000 downloads .
MacRumors ran the numbers , factoring out the 30 percent cut Apple takes from each sale , and determined that , yesterday alone , iFart Mobile made its developers $ 9,198 .
Certainly , a part of this onslaught of fart apps is that Apple , which had previously rejected all crude apps , changed its policy to let them in .
But now that they glimpse the potential for big business in fart apps , expect even more to come .
Of course , not all fart apps are going to make it to the number one paid app position , but a number of them are selling well .
Personally , I prefer Pull My Finger [ iTunes link ] , but it ’s hard to argue with iFart Mobile ’s icon , which simply reads “ Best Fart App ! ”
Update : Incredibly , the days following this story saw the app ’s popularity explode even more .
Christmas
Day alone saw nearly 40,000 downloads of the app , netting the company nearly $ 30,000 !
dbacl - a digramic Bayesian classifier
Introduction
The dbacl project consist of a set of lightweight UNIX / POSIX utilities which can be used , either directly or in shell scripts , to classify text documents automatically , according to Bayesian statistical principles .
dbacl ( 1 ) is also the name of the core utility .
Automatic text classification can be used for a variety of tasks , including : junk email filtering , web page screening , simple automated answering machines , email prioritization and advanced sorting , topical news gathering , and even playing chess .
The dbacl utilities cannot do all these tasks directly , but by concentrating on simple , powerful , and easily integrated tools these applications become possible .
Bayesian statistics is a formal way of combining prior beliefs with observed facts into posterior beliefs , and ultimately , informed decisions .
The dbacl project uses this method to calculate posterior probabilities that a given text resembles one of any number of previously learned document collections , and makes mathematically optimal decisions based on arbitrarily chosen misclassification costs .
The dbacl utilities are Free Software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) .
Creating LINQToTwitter library using LinqExtender Thursday , January 1 , 2009
In this post , I will show how to cook an LINQToTwitter library with LinqExtender .
My target is to create it easily and over existing twitter API .
I used Yedda Twitter library .
Yedda library basically returns response in XML / JSON / RSS / ATOM format depending on the option provided .
I used XML format and serialized it to objects .
Now , with our LINQToTwitter we will be able to get public / user / friend 's timeline , sort them via date , screen name .
Finally , we will be able to update our status .
Twitter response format for status looks like
< statuses > < status > .... .... < user > .... .... </ user > </ status > </ statuses >
For this , I have created a class named Twit that maps to the status and a class name User that is used as an auto property in Twit .
These two classes contain some Xml Serialization attributes by which response is serialized to respective properties .
We have our Twitter API in place , the next step is to make them LINQ - able .
Prior to the latest release to make an object queryable , it is required to inherit from QueryObjectBase .
Using this approach the feed back I got from users that they need to try LINQ in their existing data objects , which is already inherited from a base class and they need to change a lot for using the abstract approach .
The new release just solves that with a blank IQueryObject interface , which makes it more easier to port LINQ into existing data object in no time .
Building LINQ providers with LinqExtender requires few easy steps .
First , Create or convert an object to be queryable by implementing IQueryObject interface .
With our
Twit object it looks like
Here , note that I added UniqueIdentifier attribute on top of Id property that makes the object trackable during add , update or delete .
Every object should have property that distinguishes entities from each other and should be marked Unique .
There is another attribute called Ignore .
If we want properties not to be processed by the toolkit we can just put the attribute on top .
Once , it is done next we have to create query provider that will be used for making LINQ queries .
Let 's name it TwitterContext and it needs to inherit Query < Twit > and override few methods depending on support that the library is going to provide .
Now , as I said earlier that we will be doing some queries by timeline and update our status .
While adding new items we need to override Query < Twit > .
AddItem where we will add object to repository and update any property that we need to get and finally return true / false depending on the execution status .
Inside Query < Twit >.
AddItem it looks like ( Partially ) .
string username = ( string ) Bucket .
Instance .For.Item(QueryItems.USERNAME ) .
Value ; string password = ( string ) Bucket .
Instance .For.Item(QueryItems .
PASSWORD ) . Value ; Validate ( username , password ) ; string statusText = ( string ) Bucket .
Instance .For .Item ( " Text " ) .
Value ; string source = ( string ) Bucket .
Instance .For .Item ( " Source " ) . Value ; Twitter twitter = new Twitter ( ) ; if ( string . IsNullOrEmpty ( source ) ) { twitter .
Source = source ; } string response = twitter .
Update ( username , password , statusText , Twitter .
OutputFormatType.XML ) ; Twit twit = XmlToObject < Twit >.Deserialize ( response ) ; Type twitType = twit .
GetType( ) ; Bucket .
Instance.For.EachItem . Process ( delegate ( BucketItem item ) { item.
Value = twitType.GetProperty(item.Name ) .
GetValue ( twit , null ) ; } ) ;
The code is pretty simple as we can see that we are getting the required values from bucket object , setting them into Twitter API , updating the result object ( Twit ) and finally returning TRUE that will tell LinqExtender to update it 's collection .
For any FALSE or exception toolkit will remove the partial object .
There are other methods that we can override like UpdateItem , RemoveItem , GetItem .
Due to the API constraint we will skip them now .
But you can check them out at the project documentation or in the provided OpenLinqToSql ORM .
Next , we need to override the Query < Twit > .
Process which will be handling the LINQ queries we make .
protected override void Process ( LinqExtender .
Interface .IModify < Twit > items ) { string response = string .
Empty ; Twitter twitter = new Twitter ( ) ; /// general select statement with no where clause .
if (! Bucket .
Instance .IsDirty ) { response = twitter .
GetPublicTimeline ( Twitter.OutputFormatType.XML ) ; } else { string username = ( string ) Bucket .
Instance .For.Item(QueryItems.USERNAME ) .
Value ; string password = ( string ) Bucket .
Instance .For.Item(QueryItems .
PASSWORD ) .
Value ; object obj = ( Timeline ) Bucket .
Instance.For.Item(QueryItems .TIMELINE ) .
Value ; if ( obj == null ) { throw new Exception ( " Must provide a valid timeline " ) ; } Timeline timeline = ( Timeline ) obj ; if ( timeline == Timeline .
Friends ) { Validate ( username , password ) ; response = twitter .
GetFriendsTimeline( username , password , Twitter .OutputFormatType.XML ) ; } else if ( timeline == Timeline .
User ) { response = twitter .
GetUserTimeline( username , password , Twitter .OutputFormatType.XML ) ; } } Twits twits = XmlToObject < Twits >. Deserialize ( response ) ; /// do some extra in - memory stuff which are not supported by API IList < Twit > list = GetList ( twits ) ; items .
AddRange ( list , true ) ; }
Here , we can see that Bucket .
Instance .
IsDirty is used for public timelines .
When Bucket .
Instance .
IsDirty = false , we can be sure that no where clause is used and as such we can decide to handle the way we want .
IModify < T>. AddRange with true tells the toolkit to do in - memory sort when orderby is used .
There is another way to do sort ( natural sort ) by which we can pass in the sort data to source ( if supported ) and in that case we can either pass false or use the other overload of AddRange or even add items one by one .
This is our simple LINQToTwitter library so far .
To start let 's do some queries .
First , I want to get my friend 's timeline sorted by last updated date .
TwitterContext context = new TwitterConext ( ) ;
var query = from twit in context where twit .
Username == " myuser " && twit .
Password == " mypass " && twit .
Timeline == Timeline .
Friends orderby twit .
LastUpdated descending select twit ; foreach ( var t in query ) { / // do something useful .
}
I also want to update my status .
To do so , the following needs to be done .
Twit twitObject = new Twit ( ) { Username = USERNAME , Password = PASSWORD , Text = " Happy new year to all " } ; context .
Add(twitObject ) ; context .
SubmitChanges ( ) ; if (! string .IsNullOrEmpty(twitObject.Id ) ) { / // do something }
There are few other queries that can be made .
You can download the source here .
I have shown here very few of the options in LinqExtender , to know more check out the word document at project 's release page .
Also , check the OpenLinqToSql ORM that is made on it and comes out of the box .

In the early days of the cold war , many experts in the US government believed that the Kremlin orchestrated the world 's communist movements .
The idea was called " monolithic communism " , and it turned out to be wrong .
The fallacy was exposed when rivalries emerged between communist regimes in East and South Asia .
In 1972 the White House changed course and made one of the most important moves of the cold war : Nixon 's visit to China .
By then , though , the US had spent years failing to appreciate the real nature of its enemies and the threat they posed .
Today , the US and its allies have a new enemy : the Taliban .
As Nato soldiers become bogged down in the hardest close - quarter combat they 've seen in years , Afghanistan 's insurgents have acquired a familiar characteristic .
In both the media and parliament , they are routinely described as though they were a monolithic enemy .
This is n't just likely to be counter - productive : it may even harm Nato 's war effort .
For one thing , stereotyping the Taliban makes it seem like a larger fighting force than it actually is .
As Seth Jones , a US counterinsurgency expert who has advised senior Nato commanders , says : " Reading the newspapers you would think the Taliban is ten feet tall and invincible . "
The truth is much more complex .
The Taliban has grown in popularity , and it can be tenacious and , at times , extremely effective .
But it is increasingly more fragmented , in part because it has accepted fighters with a wide range of motives for joining , from personal profit to vengeance to religious fundamentalism .
Although some leaders want restore the Taliban regime of the late 1990s , many others just want to organise their lives around a conservative Islamist creed .
In fact , there are three disparate groups of insurgents fighting in Afghanistan today .
There is the " real " Taliban , led by Mullah Omar and organised by the so - called Quetta Shura , a council of insurgency leaders who meet in Baluchistan and , recently , in Karachi .
The " real " Taliban operates in the south and has collaborated with drug - smugglers and other criminals for several years .
Then there is the so - called Haqqani network , led by the former mujahideen warlord Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son Siraj Haqqani .
They fight mainly in the east .
Third , there is a collection of insurgent groups which includes al - Qaida .
Some analysts estimate that there are only around 1,000 hardcore al - Qaida fighters – a fraction of the 10,000 fighters thought to be part of the overall insurgency .
Although these disparate groups collaborate , they also fight one another .
They do not have the same aims , except in the broadest sense of opposing Nato .
Nor do they use the same tactics : intelligence reports suggest that Mullah Omar has encouraged his followers to use as little violence as possible towards the local population , to avoid losing popular support .
Acknowledging this political complexity is necessary for the war effort .
If all insurgents are seen solely as the Taliban – as a monolithic group of fighters plotting the next 9/11 – there 's no option but to fight them to the death using all the force that Nato can muster .
They can not be contained , so they must be eradicated , the argument goes .
Such an approach would n't require any civilian reconstruction , because if every insurgent is a crazy Islamist hell - bent on anti-western terrorism , then there 's little point in improving their lot .
Nor does that approach require any political outreach .
After all , who talks to nihilistic terrorists ?
But it would require an additional 300,000 troops , a figure so high the government would need to reinstate national service .
Given that the public is unlikely to bear either such a cost or the necessary slash - and - burn warfare , it would merely be a matter of time before the Nato mission became unsustainable .
However , if the insurgency is seen for what it is – a complex phenomenon that has drawn in a range of actors , including some fanatical Islamists – then it's possible to create a counterinsurgency strategy that relies not only on military means , but also on civilian reconstruction and a political solution .
Such a strategy would n't require hundreds of thousands of ( non-existent ) troops .
Nor would it require the complete ( and probably impossible ) defeat of the insurgents .
For both of these reasons , such a strategy is more likely to succeed and win public support .
The White House took far too long to realise that its analysis of communism was flawed .
Once it did , it brought about a supremely important shift in the balance of power .
Nato leaders need to recognise that the fundamental tenet upon which that shift was based – that the enemy is n't a monolithic bloc – is equally valid in Afghanistan today .

ISLAMABAD , Pakistan —
It was a signal moment in Pakistan ’s political development :
A huge demonstration forced the restoration of a dismissed chief justice , Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry , a symbol of democracy and the rule of law .
The army did not stage a coup , but insisted that the government accept a compromise .
The deal between President Asif Ali Zardari and Nawaz Sharif , the leader of the main opposition party , does not herald a solution to the instability of this nuclear - armed nation .
Nor does it ensure the Obama administration ’s primary objective of tamping down the powerful Islamic insurgency that threatens both Pakistan and Afghanistan .
How the two Pakistani politicians will resolve their rivalry is but one of many uncertainties .
Another is whether the domestic political struggle will allow them — or the military — to focus on their country ’s deteriorating security situation .
President Zardari has been severely weakened by his efforts to squelch a national protest and faces defections from the usually cohesive Pakistan Peoples Party .
His opponent , Mr. Sharif , emerged as a leader in waiting , but with no clear path to power .
The parents of an American peace activist publicly appealed yesterday for a full investigation into how their son was shot in the head with a high velocity tear gas canister by Israeli security forces .
Tristan Anderson , 38 , remains in critical condition after three brain operations at Tel Hashomer hospital in Israel , as a result of the shooting which came at the end of a regular joint Arab - Jewish demonstration against the Israeli separation barrier in the West Bank village of Ni'lin .
Activists say the canister round – with a range of more than 400 metres – was fired directly at Mr Anderson from about 60 metres as he was standing with three or four other activists in the centre of the village .
They say he was well away from the barrier where the main protest had taken place earlier on 13 March .
Mr Anderson suffered a multiple fracture to his skull , severe injury to the frontal lobe of his brain , and a collapsed eye socket
The peace activists insist that neither Mr Anderson , nor his immediate companions , were throwing stones or posing any threat to the forces .
Mr Anderson 's mother .
Nancy , who flew from California with her husband Michael to be at her son's bedside , said yesterday that to fire at peace protesters was " really horrifying " .
She said that tear gas canisters are designed to be fired in an arc to disperse demonstrators , but that the canister had been " shot right at his head " .
" We want the Israeli government to publicly take full responsibility for the shooting of our son , " she said .
" I do n't carry any negative feelings towards the soldier who shot our son .
All I feel is love for Tristan and fear for his recovery . "
Mrs Anderson praised the " excellent " care by medics at Tel Hashomer .
Mr Anderson , who had a seasonal job in Oakland California working for a trade union setting up conventions , was in Israel for the first time .
He was with his Jewish girlfriend on a three - month trip , after which he intended to join his parents on a holiday in Europe .
He had taken part in peace demonstrations in Iraq before the US invasion in 2003 , and in El Salvador and Guatemala .
" He came to understand for himself what the Israeli - Palestinian conflict was about , " said Michael Anderson , his father .
" It is ironic that the country in which he was shot is a democracy where it is supposed to be a duty for everyone to follow their conscience .
" We want to know what happened and we want justice for our son . "
Jonathan Pollack , an activist with the Israeli " Anarchists against the Wall " organisation said the incident had taken place about one kilometre from the barrier after demonstrators had started to disperse .
While stones had been thrown earlier during the protest , Mr Pollack , who first met Mr Anderson at a demonstration in Prague during the World Bank - IMF conference in 2000 , said : " I have known Tristan for nine years and I know he was not throwing stones at that point or any other point . "
The activists say the gas canister , of a kind brought into service only four months ago , was labelled in Hebrew " 40 mm bullet special / long range . "
Four Palestinian residents of Ni'lin – including a 10 - year - old boy – were killed during demonstrations last year against the barrier , which will divide villagers from 400 acres of their farmland , when it is complete .
Michael Sfard , an Israeli human rights lawyer , who has filed a formal demand for an official investigation , said that of some 120 criminal investigations brought against security force members since the beginning of the intifada , there had only been one conviction – against the Arab - Israeli soldier who shot British peace activist Tom Hurndall dead in Gaza .
Nobody was brought to trial in two other cases involving the deaths of foreign nationals .
They were Rachel Corrie , who like Mr Hurndall was an International Solidarity Movement volunteer .
The Israeli military has not accepted responsibility for her death .
In the case of British film - maker James Miller , Israeli authorities made a substantial cash payment to his family this year , which came nearly six years after his death .
The Israeli military said that on the day Mr Anderson was shot , some 400 rioters , “ some masked ” , had thrown “ a massive number of rocks ” at their forces .
They said protesters had thrown firebombs , and directed burning tyres towards the forces , and that 73 personnel were injured in 2008 at or near Ni’lin .
A spokesman said : “ The violent acts of the protesters force Israeli police officers and soldiers to use internationally acceptable riot dispersal means . ”

Obama demanded GM CEO resign Agence France - Presse
Published : Sunday March 29 , 2009
Print This Email This GM CEO Rick Wagoner will be resigning at President Barack Obama 's behest , US media reported Sunday just hours before Obama was to unveil an auto industry rescue package .
" The Obama administration asked Rick Wagoner , the chairman and CEO of General Motors , to step down and he agreed , " Politico.com reported citing an unnamed White House official said .
No reason was immediately given .
Meanwhile " Obama and other administration officials have said they would demand deeper restructuring from General Motors and Chrysler before they would get any more government loans , " The Wall Street Journal reported .
Obama unveils his plan Monday for the sector which has called for billions more in government aid to weather the economic storm .
But the US president warned earlier the automakers still needed to do more if they are to qualify for further government bailout funds .
" They 're not there yet , " Obama told CBS television .
" We think we can have a successful US auto industry .
But it 's got to be one that 's realistically designed to weather this storm and to emerge -- at the other end -- much more lean , mean and competitive than it currently is . "
Obama 's auto task force has been working to solve the woes of US automakers which have been pushed to the brink of bankruptcy in the economic recession amid a global downturn in car sales .
Two of the firms , General Motors and Chrysler , have asked for another 21.6 billion dollars in US aid on top of the 17.4 billion in emergency loans approved in December as they struggle to survive .
Ford , the other member of Detroit 's Big Three , has said it has enough cash to survive the downturn without government aid .

Human Banner Formed to Defend Amazon Rainforest
Around the silhouette of a warrior taking aim with a bow and arrow , indigenous leaders , environmentalists and activists spelled out the message " SALVE A AMAZONIA , " which means Save the Amazon in Portuguese .
Human banner at the World Social Forum January 27 , 2009 ( Photo courtesy Amazon Watch )
" We are the guardians of the forest , " said Marco Apurina , vice - coordinator of COIAB , Brazil 's leading Amazonian indigenous organization .
" This is a critical moment for indigenous peoples to unite with non-indigenous , activists , teachers , environmentalists , unions , government .
The Amazon rainforest needs everyone to work together now to defend it before it's too late . "
The Amazon Basin encompasses 5.5 million square kilometers of rainforest and includes territory belonging to nine nations .
The Amazon contains over half of the planet 's remaining rainforest , but nearly 20 percent of the Amazon wilderness area has been deforested over the past 40 years .
The mean annual deforestation rate from 2000 to 2005 amounted to 22,392 square kilometers per year , a rate that was 18 percent higher than in the previous five years .
The indigenous peoples of the Amazon see its conservation as their sacred responsibility .
COIAB said in a statement , " With the permission of our ancestors ' spirits , we indigenous peoples are here with our friends from all corners of the Earth .
We build this symbol with our bodies as the cry of living beings from this green forest , this planet , for our continuity as humans and diverse creatures . "
" The symbol of the bow and arrow has three meanings , " COIAB explained .
" The first , our aim that every man , woman , and child will decide to care for our planet ; the second , the position of defending the rights of indigenous peoples , of nature , of the planet , and of our home the Amazon ; the third , to send a message to the world so that each of us helps to protect our home , our air , our water , our food . "
" It is urgent that the world act now to stop deforestation and to recognize the importance of the Amazon in stabilizing our climate , " said Atossa Soltani , executive director of Amazon Watch , an advocacy organization based in Washington , DC .
" There needs to be an immediate halt to industrial resource extraction that is bringing the ecosystems and cultures of the Amazon to the brink of collapse . "
Indigenous participants in the human banner at the World Social Forum ( Photo courtesy Amazon Watch )
If development plans for the Amazon continue unchecked , warned Soltani , scientists predict that the entire Amazon region will be at the brink of permanent ecological collapse within the next 10 to 20 years .
This process would release massive amounts of carbon into the atmosphere , accelerating global climate change .
" This amazing action brought together indigenous people from all over the Amazon , raising spears and traditional weapons to the sky , " said Andrea Samulon , campaigner at the Rainforest Action Network , based in San Francisco .
" This banner truly is a call to the world from indigenous peoples all over the continent , " said Samulon " The world needs to pay attention now . "
The state of the Amazon is a critical focus during this World Social Forum , with one full day devoted to discussing the problems facing the world 's largest rainforest and the indigenous peoples who depend on it .
On Friday , the forum will host a panel on water , land and " the plundering of natural resources , the economic basis for national oppression . "
For the first time at the World Social Forum , representatives of 30 different stateless nations and indigenous peoples from across the world will share a tent and a three - day program of lectures , roundtables and workshops .
Palestinian representatives join those from Kurdistan , Balochistan , Catalonia , Basque Country , Tamil , Saharan , Western Shoshone and Andean indigenous peoples , among others , to participate in the Space for Collective Rights of Peoples and other World Social Forum discussions .
Activities in the Collective Rights tent will explore the right of self - determination and sovereignty of peoples of stateless nations , indigenous communities , and marginalized groups .
One of the main issues in the Collective Rights tent is the conflict over the occupied Palestinian territory .
At a General Assembly for Palestine slated for Saturday , Palestinian organizations and those groups that support Palestine will take part in a forum of discussion and debate .

I SUPPOSE I could be described as financially literate .
I have a doctorate in economics ; my dissertation focused on financial decision - making .
I write about economics and finance , and I 've worked in the financial industry , designing investment strategies .
But , when I look at the balance of my brokerage account ( those low - fee global - equity index funds do not seem like such a good idea at the moment ) or my credit card statement ( peppered with frivolous impulse purchases ) , I question my financial savvy .
Nonetheless , I have volunteered to provide financial - literacy training to young mothers at a local homeless shelter .
This is the first time I have volunteered since school , when my guidance counsellor forced me into it .
She thought the experience would look good on my college applications .

Teaching the dismal science
I always justified not volunteering by figuring that my actual time was worth less to the charity than the monetary value of my time .
But something about this project intrigued me .
I thought I 'd learn from the experience ; it could make me a better economist .
I even spent weeks fancying myself the next Suze Orman , empowering the financially downtrodden with my economic knowledge .
Contemplating how best to spend resources given significant budget restrictions is the exact question I spent years solving , but as my first session approached , I started to wonder what value my training could provide .
Economics often neglects solving this problem for genuinely poor people ( or as we economists like to call them , “ liquidity constrained agents ” ) .
At our orientation session , we introduced ourselves and explained why we volunteered for this particular project .
I went first .
I said I volunteered because I thought that learning about how these women respond to their extreme financial constraints would be interesting .
Everyone else said they thought their experiences would be helpful ( most were lawyers or in human resources ) .
I realised I was the only one who did not say I was there to help homeless women .
I wondered if that made me a bad person .
But ( and I may be rationalising here ) I found something presumptuous about the idea I could swoop in from my comfortable life and sort out these women 's financial woes .
I might know about economics and finance , but I know nothing of what it 's like to be a homeless single mother .
I genuinely hope to help these women , but expecting that I can feels naive .
I also wondered what financial literacy skills are exactly .
I 've read my share of academic papers on the subject .
They contain several measures of financial literacy .
One measure , which predictably yields appalled gasps at economics seminars , is most people do not know bond prices fall when yields increase .
How could that information be useful to homeless single mothers ?
I never heard Ms Orman explain that one .
We went through the curriculum we would be teaching .
It was much simpler than fixed income pricing .
We would be focusing on budgeting , principles of saving , repairing credit scores , and basic banking .
If we had time we also would discuss the difference between stocks and bonds .
Not quite an economist 's definition of financially literate , but if people do not know these things already , they probably should .
Tuesday
THE first session was well attended .
Several young women came in and sat across from me .
One , peering at me curiously , asked if I worked in a bank .
To start , the lead volunteer told the rest of us to pair off with one of the homeless women to discuss their spending habits .
I was partnered with a young woman named Tina , who just moved to the shelter and is eight months pregnant .
I asked her to list everything she bought that day .
She recounted her spending to the very cent .
After telling me she paid $ 5.89 on baby lotion , she looked me up and down and said , “ When you do n't have money you got to watch it . ”
We then discussed her monthly expenses , which included $ 125 for cell - phone and credit - card bills .
Just then the lead volunteer interrupted everyone by urging us to consider “ need ” versus “ want ” ( or as we economists call them , “ necessary ” versus “ luxury ” goods ) .
Clothes , he said , seemed like a need but were usually a want .
Ivone , a shelter resident who was sitting across from me , announced with a slight Caribbean accent that she never bought clothes .
“ Five years ago I bought fifteen pairs of jeans at Old Navy and that is all I will ever need , so long as I do n't gain weight . ”
She appeared to be the group 's de facto leader .
She just got a job a Duane Reade , a pharmacy chain in New York , and was starting to look at apartments .

Luxury or necessity ?
The lead volunteer then called a mobile phone a luxury , unless you had a job that required it .
The women vigorously disagreed .
How can you not have a phone when you have a child in day care ?
If you are walking down a dark and street in danger how else can you call someone ?
I did not push the mobile - phone issue with Tina .
To me it seemed a luxury ; to her it was a necessity , and it is not my place to define her preferences .
I did encourage her to find a cheaper plan , perhaps a pre-paid one .
Tina was surprised to learn how much less women on pre-paid plans were spending , and encouraged to learn how much money she could save by switching plans .
Next we were instructed to figure out long - term goals ( an apartment , a job , etc. ) .
Tina 's goal , after having her baby , was to obtain her GED ( her high - school equivalency degree ) .
She said this was important to her because it would provide a positive example for her unborn son .
She also hoped it would get her a better job .
That 's true , I told her ; having a high school diploma or equivalency can raise your lifetime income by hundreds of thousands of dollars .
This excited Tina .
We then discussed how much realising that goal might cost .
Tina would have to pay an exam fee and would also probably need a preparatory class .
Just then Ivone spoke up .
“ Actually , ” she said , “ there is a city program that provides the class , pays for a Metrocard to get to the class , pays for all your materials , and then pays for test . ”
She had an encyclopedic knowledge of every government program meant to help homeless women .
“ Oh , you suffered abuse , great ; you can qualify for this program . ” I heard her say to another woman .
But , Ivone cautioned , “ With all this stuff going on these days you have to be careful .
These programs will be the first ones cut , so do n't count on them for long . ”
Finally , we tackled Tina 's budget .
I asked Tina if she had a job .
She looked at me , laughed , and said , “ I am eight months pregnant . ” I asked if she was receiving welfare .
She hesitantly admitted she had just applied for it , but warned that it was only temporary , until she got back on her feet ; she did not intend to be a “ welfare mother . ”
Up until now she had been using credit cards to finance her spending .
I asked her if she understood what high interest - rates and late fees could do to her credit .
It makes a lot more sense to just go on welfare and try to pay her debts before the baby arrives ( and with it many expenses ) .
Someday she will have a job and pay taxes ; these programs exist to help people just like her .
The libertarian in me never thought I would be giving this advice .
“ You 're right , ” she said , “ a bunch of people spending money they do n't have is how we all got into this mess . ”

Wednesday
JUST two women came to the next session .
Tina did not return , but because she was due to deliver any day , I did not take it personally .
Ivone was back , along with a woman named Marguerite .
This week 's topic was my area of academic expertise : saving and investment .
The curriculum , given in advance , advised saving as much as possible .
Surprising though it may sound , I do n't fully agree .
The poor have different saving needs from the rest of us .
They do not need to save much ( if at all ) for retirement because the state provides them with a generous pension relative to their lifetime income .
They also have less incentive to save for their children 's education .
American universities practice nearly perfect price discrimination : having few assets entitles poor students to more financial aid .
Resources are better spent on education while a child is young , ensuring he 's well prepared for university in the future .
The women at the shelter have little or no income and children to support .
Saving might be a better idea in the future , when they have some income and are less dependent on state benefits .
We began by asking the women how they were faring since last week 's session , when we encouraged them to keep tight budgets and eliminate unnecessary spending .
They listed everything they spent over the past week ; both said they restricted their spending to necessities .
Another volunteer noted that neither woman mentioned spending money on food .
“ I only buy groceries once a month , ” Ivone explained .
Marguerite admitted to using check - cashing services .
The volunteer leader told Marguerite how high the fees for those services are , and encouraged her to open a free checking account at a reputable bank .
Unfortunately , Marguerite was still overdrawn on an account in another state , and thought this prevented her from opening a new account at a different bank .
She assumed check - cashing stores were her easiest alternative .
We encouraged her to open a joint account with a trusted relative .
Both women had bad banking experiences in the past .
They had overdrawn their accounts , bounced checks and had to pay high fees that surprised them .
That , and the current financial turmoil , has rendered them distrustful of conventional banking .
I could see why they preferred the transparent fees and liquidity of check - cashing stores .
To help the women understand the benefits of traditional banking , we explained compound interest .
We also learned that city of New York currently offers a program called “ Work Advantage , ” which provides housing vouchers for up to two years .
A homeless person can qualify for it after finding a stable job .
In addition , if participants save 10 - 20 % of their income in a bank account the government matches it 100 % .
Ivone said they match up to $ 6000 , which means $ 12,000 in the bank .
“ And that 's a down payment on a house in Atlanta , ” she exclaimed .
The lead volunteer advised Ivone and Marguerite to stay away from the stockmarket .
Ivone mentioned the value of her retirement account ( IRA ) had fallen .
“ I suppose that means I have some stock , but I do n't want it , ” she said .
“ All those CEOs are liars and cheats , now they 're all going bankrupt . ”
I suggested that in the future , if she wanted to hold equity , she should invest in index funds .
That way she owns lots of different stocks and a few cheating CEOs will be cancelled out by healthier companies .
This resonated with her ; she wrote down “ index stocks ” and vowed to call her broker the next day .
Everyone was quick to remind Ivone that stocks will probably decline for the foreseeable future .
I was surprised Ivone even had an individual retirement account ( IRA ) .
She explained that she was once a paralegal assistant in a large law firm and earned $ 50,000 a year .
She is bright and capable , and I wondered how she ended up in a shelter .
Another volunteer mentioned that Oprah Winfrey , a talk - show host , often says that most people are just two paychecks away from homelessness .
That sounds a little extreme , but Ivone 's situation shows how vulnerable many people are .
I wondered why Ivone did not make a hardship withdrawal earlier .
She seems determined to keep money in the IRA .
Given the income shocks
Ivone is prone to , I would think the lack of liquidity in a retirement account cancels out any tax benefit .
I wonder if we over - promote retirement savings .
It does not make sense for everyone , particularly people with low income .
Ivone ran up large credit - card debts and ended up in a homeless shelter while maintaining an IRA .
She can probably expect the state or even her children to provide for her in old age ; retirement is not her most pressing financial concern .
She seems to be getting back on her feet : she has a job and is trying to improve her credit ( bad credit makes it difficult to find an apartment ) .
The lead volunteer reminded Ivone that saving now is good for her children because it sets a positive example and she can use that money to pay for their university .
I disagree with the second point , but kept quiet .
Ensuring a better future for her children seems motivation enough .

Thursday
MANY more women showed up for the third session than the second ( we provided pizza ) .
This time I was partnered with a woman named Chrystal .
The curriculum was timely — banking and credit .
We explained compound interest again .
Most of the women had bank accounts at some point , so they were familiar with the concept .
Chrystal once had a CD ( a certificate of deposit — essentially , a fixed - term loan to a bank that offers a higher rate of interest but less liquidity than a standard savings account ) , and maintains a custodial account for her son , from which he will not be able to withdraw until he turns 18 .
Although she can withdraw the money freely , she has not , even in her current financial straits .
“ He 'll need that money when he 's older , but I hope he does n't blow it all like I did when I turned 18 . ”
Chrystal once had a one - year CD and tried to withdraw from it early .
She was shocked to learn that doing so incurred a high penalty .
I explained that CDs pay higher interest rates precisely because they count on having the money for a known period of time .
“ Banks lend out most of the money you give them to other people , so the longer they know you wo n't be asking for it the more valuable it becomes to them , ” I explained .
AP
Incentivisation , with extra cheese
“ Is that how all those banks got into trouble ? ” she asked .
“ All these people asked for their money back and the banks did not have it ? ”
“ Sort of , ” I hedged .
“ It really started when some of the people they lent money to did not pay it back . ”
I then explained securitisation to Chrystal .
“ Really ?!
That 's crazy ! ” she said when she learned about mortgage - backed securities .
I told her that securitisation was not all bad .
It meant more people got mortgages , which was good , but it also meant some people got loans they should never have been offered .
Chrystal shook her head in disbelief .
I reminded her that her savings will be safe whatever happens because the government insures bank accounts .
She asked if the government also insured stocks .
I said no , then explained that when you buy stock , you are buying a piece of a company .
The discussion then moved to credit — specifically , how to repair a bad personal credit-rating .
Unpaid credit - card debt was a universal affliction amongst the women .
All had outstanding debt that kept their credit ratings low , which made renting an apartment impossible .
Some had even had potential employers run credit checks on them .
Collection agents had already bought many of the women 's debts , which will harm their credit ratings for seven years , regardless of whether they pay it .
Once the debt is six years old ( in the state of New York ) the collection agency can no longer sue for it — unless you make a payment , of any size , during those six years .
In that case the statute of limitations resets from the time of the last payment .
If you are poor and jobless , once your debt is sold to collection , there seems to be little incentive to repay it ( assuming you believe you wo n't be taken to court ) .
Once a new debt is sent to collection , your credit remains poor for seven years .
So paying off newer debt not yet sent to collection is the quickest way to repair your credit .
The volunteers encouraged the women to call their debtors and negotiate with them .
Chrystal has quite a bit of experience with this , and seemed adept at negotiating payment options .
She asked if debt consolidators were all just thugs .
I explained to her that they pay all her debts and then she just pays them .
Another volunteer explained to Chrystal how the consolidators make their money .
They often renegotiate your debt : by offering to pay in full now , they might end up paying less than is ultimately due .
The volunteer encouraged Chrystal to negotiate on her own behalf , rather than leaving it to collection agents .

Friday
THE final session initially drew just two women : Ivone ( whose attendance was now perfect ) , and a first - timer named Patrice .
The topic was insurance .
One of the volunteers felt strongly that because the women were single mothers , they should have life insurance .
She explained that means someone will receive a payment upon the insured 's death .
Patrice spoke up .
“ I do n't want that , someone betting on you dying , no way !
Once you have that and you live with someone — friend , boyfriend , family or whoever — they will want to kill you . ”
The volunteer tried to explain to Patrice that she can choose her beneficiary ( and urged her strongly to select her child ) , but that did not help .
She wanted nobody to profit from her death .
We looked at some literature that listed various insurance companies offering life insurance .
AIG was at the top of the list .
I advised Patrice to steer clear of that one .
Just then Chrystal and two other women arrived .
We broke into smaller groups .
I ended up with Chrystal , her two friends and another volunteer .
I began to explain life insurance , which Chrystal believed she already had .
Shortly after having her son , she received a solicitation for insurance that would protect him .
I was familiar with the program and explained the policy covered her son , not her .
Jupiter Images
“ Whoa , this is too much for me .
I 'm leaving , ” said one of Chrystal 's friends as she walked out the door .
Chrystal was reeling from the idea that she had insured her son's life .
The other woman , whose name I did not get , seemed high .
She wore a large fuzzy hat , and kept nodding slowly .
She peered at me and mumbled , “ Why do I need this ?
Does n't Social Security pay for it already ? ”
I explained that Social Security will pay her survivors a death benefit that will likely not cover the funeral , then will pay any children survivor benefits until they turn 18 ( the exact amount of the latter depends on the deceased 's lifetime earnings ) .
Still , she made a good point .
Social Security provides something — probably more then she makes now — and likely not significantly less than a policy she could afford .
Given her present circumstances , I wondered if life insurance should be a financial priority .
Chrystal was concerned that if she got sick her son would be stuck with her health bills , and asked if life insurance could help .
The other volunteer told Chrystal her son would not be liable , but if she was concerned about that she should look into health insurance .
He explained other types of insurance , such as health , renters ' and car .
He cautioned that they would have to pay premiums to keep the policy active .
The woman in the fuzzy hat mumbled something about a 401 ( k ) and asked if insurance was like that .
I explained that the two were different : money in a 401 ( k ) ( a company sponsored retirement account ) is yours .
It grows ( you hope ) by its investments , but whatever the size the balance is always yours .
An insurance policy only pays you if something happens : for instance , renters ' insurance will pay you if your apartment burns down , but if not then you pay them and receive nothing .
Chrystal and the woman in the fuzzy hat thought that sounded unfair .
I explained the idea was to give them security .
“ Suppose after you work hard , get out of here , find an apartment , and spend all this money buying furniture , and then it all burns down .
Then you are left with nothing and have nowhere to go .
If you have insurance you get a few thousand dollars to sort yourself out . ”
The example seemed to resonate , as did the concept of financial derivatives .
They each said “ Ohhhh ” , looked pensive , and then nodded in agreement ( though the woman in the fuzzy hat was nodding continuously anyway ) .
Chrystal had a question about her 401( k ) .
After she left her last job she received a letter informing her that she forfeited her plan .
She assumed she lost the whole account .
I asked if she made contributions to it or just her employer .
She said it was both .
I explained that whatever she put in their 401 ( k ) is hers .
Their employer can sometimes take back what they put in , but her money remains hers .
“ So I still have that money ? ” Chrystal asked hopefully .
I said it was , but withdrawing it before she turned 59 and six months would incur a large penalty .
I mentioned that they might qualify for a hardship withdrawal now .
Chrystal was reluctant ; she was concerned about the state of the world in 40 years and liked having some security .
I was surprised by how many of the homeless women have 401 ( k ) s and IRAs .
One popular perception of women in Chrystal 's situation is that poor impulse control drove them to homelessness , but by keeping a 401 ( k ) in her current circumstances , it seems Chrystal 's discount rate is lower than mine .
The woman in the fuzzy hat was more enthusiastic .
“ Hardship withdrawal , that sounds cool , ” she kept repeating and asked me to write it down for her .
I realised I just encouraged a woman who seemed to be on drugs to raid her 401( k ) .
Chrystal had more questions about insurance .
She wondered why , when she insured her son , the insurer investigated his health status .
I told her insurers hope they never have to pay ; they wanted to make sure his probability of dying soon was low .
Insurance companies often suspect the only people who buy insurance are the ones most likely to collect .
The other volunteer advocated buying get life insurance while young and healthy ; that way they can't deny you in the future .
Chrystal nodded , pondering adverse selection , and said she would look into it .
We then said our goodbyes .
Chrystal and Ivone thanked us for our help .
The woman in the fuzzy hat gazed at me , grinned , shook my hand and said , “ Thanks so much ; you 're so nice , and have really pretty eyelashes . ”

The economic meltdown is starting to set off shockwaves in the charitable marketplace , and plenty more are likely .
In early February , Silicon Valley Community Foundation announced it was laying off 14 percent of its workforce and closing its San Jose office , while the company that manages the endowment for Harvard said it would cut 50 jobs , or roughly one - fourth of its staff .
Small nonprofits are not filling jobs .
Fund drives at local United Ways are falling short of their goals .
Foundations large and small , shaken by big declines in the value of their endowments , are talking about reducing or delaying their grantmaking .
A growing number of foundation executives say they expect the economic crisis will trigger the shutdown of a growing numbers of nonprofits , possibly even in epidemic proportions .
And one in five nonprofit executive directors who responded to a new poll by Bridgespan Group say mergers could play a role in how they try to cope with crisis .
Bridgespan says the poll is in line with its new study that finds a total of over 3,300 nonprofit merger deals in four states over 11 years , the same rate as in the for - profit sector .
Sadly , Bridgespan says , those mergers were made not to reach longer - term strategic goals but in response to financial distress or leadership vacuums .
“ If economic conditions continue to deteriorate , more and more nonprofit leaders will likely consider ” mergers , says William Foster , a Bridgespan partner .
The writing is on the wall .
Yet few nonprofits seem able or willing to see that the massive failure of the U.S. economy is going to inflict deep pain on the giving sector , pain that many nonprofits are not prepared to take and for which their lack of preparation will be partly responsible .
If they do not move quickly to streamline and strengthen their operations , services , message and fundraising , and to focus relentlessly on engaging and connecting with their supporters , nonprofits are going to be in big trouble .

Sea levels are predicted to rise twice as fast as was forecast by the United Nations only two years ago , threatening hundreds of millions of people with catastrophe , scientists said yesterday in a dramatic new warning about climate change .
Rapidly melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are likely to push up sea levels by a metre or more by 2100 , swamping coastal cities and obliterating the living space of 600 million people who live in deltas , low - lying areas and small island states .
Low - lying countries with increasing populations , such as Bangladesh , Burma and Egypt , could see large parts of their surface areas vanish .
Experts in Bangladesh estimate that a one - metre rise in sea levels would swamp 17 per cent of the country 's land mass .
Pacific islands such as Tuvalu , where 12,000 people live just a few feet above sea level , and the Maldives , would face complete obliteration .
Even Britain could face real challenges in lower - lying areas along the east coast , from Lincolnshire to the Thames estuary , with a much greater risk of catastrophic " storm surges " such as the great flood of 1953 that killed 307 people .

Yesterday 's urgent wake - up call to governments about global warming – telling them the data on which they are basing their official advice is flawed – came from four scientists from the US , Australia , France and Germany , who gave a press conference at a scientific meeting on climate change in Copenhagen , Denmark .
Professor Konrad Steffen , from the University of Colorado , Dr John Church , of the Centre for Australian Weather and Climate Research in Tasmania , Dr Eric Rignot , of Nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory in Pasadena , and Professor Stefan Rahmsdorf , from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research , are all experts in sea - level rise .
Their views represent the mainstream opinion of researchers in the field , taking account of the most recent data .
Only two years ago , the UN's Intergovermental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) said in its Fourth Assessment Report , or AR4 , that the worst - case prediction for global sea - level rise was 59 cm by 2100 .
But the scientists in Copenhagen suggested that the 2007 report was a drastic underestimation of the problem , and that oceans were likely to rise twice as fast .
Yesterday 's meeting was a scientific overture to the global conference on climate change , which takes place in the Danish capital in December .
The four researchers underlined how critical it is that world leaders act to slash the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from industry and transport which are causing the atmosphere to overheat .
Advance negotiations begin in three weeks in Bonn .
On pages 20 and 21 , we illustrate in detail just how great the task is , profiling the main emitters of CO2 and what they are doing – or not doing – to cut back .
Yesterday 's alarm call was clearly intended to inject more urgency into the process .
Rising sea levels are caused by the thermal expansion of the ocean – where water increases in volume as it warms .
But although the melting of ice already floating in the sea does not add to the level , because it is already displacing its own mass , melting into the sea of land - based ice most definitely does .
It is the accelerated melting of the vast , land - based ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica , caused by rapidly rising temperatures at high latitudes , which is now speeding up the increase beyond anything previously forecast .
The Greenland ice sheet , in particular , is not simply melting but melting " dynamically " – that is , it is collapsing in parts as meltwater seeps down through crevices and speeds up its disintegration .
Critically , the four scientists said , this process was not taken into account in the AR4 report , leading to estimates of sea - level increase which were far too low .
They revealed remarkable figures showing just how fast it is now happening .
Professor Steffen said Greenland was losing 200 to 300 cubic - kilometres of ice into the sea each year – about the same amount as all the ice in Arctic Europe .
This on its own is causing the global sea level to rise by more than a millimetre a year , he added , whereas a decade ago Greenland 's contribution to sea level rise was non-existent .
Dr Church said that the most recent satellite and in situ data showed seas were now rising by more than 3 mm a year – more than 50 per cent faster than the average for the 20th century .
" As a result of improved estimates of the observed rise , the thermal expansion , the melting of the glaciers and of the ice sheets , we now have a much better quantitive understanding of why sea level is rising , " he said .
" Without significant , urgent and sustained emissions reductions , we will cross a threshold which will lead to continuing sea level rise of metres . "
Professor Steffen added : " What we have learnt in the past three or four years is that the ice dynamic is much stronger than the models indicated , and the prediction has to be revised up to a metre or more – which is enormous if you look at the impact . "
Britain's Environment Agency was apparently unique when it discarded the IPCC 's 2007 advice as flawed .
Based on its own estimates , it is planning flood defences for 2100 on the basis of a one - metre rise in sea levels – with a " worst - case scenario " of 2.7 metres .
" These startling new predictions spell disaster for millions of the world 's poorest people , " said Rob Bailey , Oxfam 's policy adviser on climate change .
" Poor coastal communities in countries such as Bangladesh are already struggling to cope with a changing climate , and it can only get worse .
This must be a wake - up call for rich countries who are not doing anywhere near enough to prevent these cataclysmic predictions from becoming a reality . "

Smoking is GOOD For You
A gentleman dropped by the JREF a couple of weeks ago , and left this flyer ( PDF ) for us .
As skeptics , we 're committed to considering new data , and this flier with its title " Are You Smoking Enough to Stay Healthy ? " made us wonder what we were missing .
Please read this " enlightening " piece of literature before continuing .
According to the flier , smoking can do amazing things , like prevent alzheimers and some forms of cancer .
It can also improve memory and mental acuity .
And while this goes against everything we 've ever been told , there is some truth to it .
Did I just say that ?
Smoking has some health benefits ?
Yes , some studies say it does .
Do n't believe me ?
Check out The Straight Dope for more on that .
Ok ... so wow , could Dr. Douglass be right ?
Are we being lied to about smoking , and should we start smoking today to protect our health ?
First , note the spelling of the final syllable of his last name .
While this method of detecting BS is n't reliable , it seems to be accurate in this case .
Second , apply some critical thinking .
Dr. Douglass is selling this information .
He 's making claims without presenting any backing data , and asking you to pay for the information .
His motivation is to compel you to buy his product - not to give you reliable information .
While this alone does n't call his data into question , it is important to consider .
Third , the organization that named him " Doctor of the Year " was investigated by Dr. Steven Barrett of Quackwatch in 1993 .
In summary :
The National Health Federation ( NHF ) is an alliance of promoters and followers who engage in lobbying campaigns and many other activities .
It is antagonistic toward established medical practices and uses the words " alternative , " and " freedom " to suit its own purposes .
Read the full article to see a very interesting list of indictments against some of the organizations members .
It 's tragic that there are enough discredited doctors that they can actually band together and create a false sense of credibility with a pseudo - scientific organization .
While it is true that there are some studies , good studies in fact , that show a relationship between smoking and specific health benefits , the absolutely slam - dunk overwhelming evidence points to one simple conclusion : smoking is a significant detriment to your health .
And following the advice of Dr. Douglass is likely to be counterindicated as well .
I believe we have here another unscrupulous individual who is trying to profit by telling people what they want to hear , rather than what is supported by evidence .
The fact that his advice could potentially be deadly encourages me to add him to the same list that includes Kevin Trudeau , John of God , and Peter Popoff .
And sadly many others .
The articles above do a great deal to explain what has happened to America 's ( and the world 's ) economies and financial systems .
But one key element is missing or taken for granted in their explanations : an element that makes it all make sense in a way that defied my prior understanding , and probably yours as well .
That element was published weeks ago with little fanfare in this month 's Wired Magazine , in the article The Secret Formula That Destroyed Wall Street , by Felix Salmon .
Part of the reason that it received little attention was the inherent complexity of the subject ( and it 's tough enough that I still do n't fully understand it ) ; but its incredibly important upshot is one that has been missed or left out by most of the writers on the subject of the economic meltdown : that the value of the CDOs was being determined almost entirely by the value of the CDS bets against them .
If you really understand the relationship between CDOs and CDSs , and the efforts being made to combat the current crisis by the Administration , this revelation is nearly earth - shattering in its implications .
Allow me to explain in the simplest terms I can , smoothing out a lot of details .
A bunch of assholes on Wall St. decided they wanted to make a bunch of money they could n't make before with responsible lending .
So they took a bunch of risky mortgages and other bad loans , and stuffed them into big black boxes of debt together with good loans .
They essentially sold all of these black boxes , to make a long tranche - filled story short , as good , safe loans with AAA ratings .
These black boxes were called Collateralized Debt Obligations ( CDOs ) .
Problem was , it was really tough to figure out what these things were really worth because they were made up of so many different loans .
A bunch of these wall street assholes were worried about having so many potentially problematic CDOs ; a bunch of other assholes saw a way to make lots more money , provided the housing market did n't go bust .
That 's where the Credit Default Swaps ( CDSs ) came in .
CDSs are insurance on CDOs : if you own a bunch of CDOs , you can pay me a premium to insure you ; if your CDO ( or a particular part or " tranche " of it ) defaults , I have to pay the entire value of the CDO ( or tranche thereof ) .
The really fucked up part of the CDS deals was that the insurance provider did n't have to have the capital to pay out even a fraction of the premiums ; worse still , you could take out " insurance " on loans neither of you had on " naked " CDS deals -- basically , casino betting of a purer variety than standard Wall St. fare .
There were potentially an infinite number of insurance CDSs that could be written just on one single CDO , by just about anybody willing to do so .
Do the permutations , and that 's how you get , by some estimates , almost $ 70 trillion in CDS deals alone on " just " $ 4.7 trillion of CDOs .
That 's more than the entire world 's GDP .
Then the housing market went south , a bunch of the CDOs ( or the worst " tranches " ) went kablooie , and all the shitheads holding CDS premiums ( AIG , first and foremost ) were fucked because they could n't pay out .
And , of course , the firms like Goldman Sachs who paid CDS firms like AIG want their damn insurance payouts , even if it 's at taxpayer expense .
And the banks who hold a bunch of CDOs can't move them , so they can't raise capital , so they do n't lend .
And when banks do n't lend , a bunch of regular people lose their shirts .
Compared the amount of money and carnage involved here , a couple hundred million dollars in bonuses to the same assholes who got us here may be infuriating , but it 's chump change .
So what 's the big mystery , you say ?
What 's the big problem ?
Just cancel the CDS contracts , let CDS firms like AIG fail , let the taxpayer cover the downside of the worst subprimes in the " BBB " tranches of the CDOs , and let the CDO trading go on as before !
Sounds simple , and that 's exactly what our own Jerome a Paris is calling for .
Well , you can't .
And the Wired article explains why you can't , and why we 're more fucked than you can possibly imagine .
You see , the CDOs have No Determinable Value Without CDSs Attached .
The CDSs determined the value of the CDOs .
And no one is touching CDSs with a thousand foot pole right now , and with very good reason .
The key link that tied CDOs to CDSs forever was made by a mathematician named David X. Li , who pioneered a formula called the Gaussian Copula Function to solve the intractable problem of the correlative relationship between the loans in the CDO black box .
This particular formula and its problems are also discussed The Black Swan , a book written prior to the collapse by a hedge fund manager .
The Wired article explains :
The reason that ratings agencies and investors felt so safe with the triple - A tranches was that they believed there was no way hundreds of homeowners would all default on their loans at the same time .
One person might lose his job , another might fall ill .
But those are individual calamities that do n't affect the mortgage pool much as a whole : Everybody else is still making their payments on time .
But not all calamities are individual , and tranching still had n't solved all the problems of mortgage - pool risk .
Some things , like falling house prices , affect a large number of people at once .
If home values in your neighborhood decline and you lose some of your equity , there 's a good chance your neighbors will lose theirs as well .
If , as a result , you default on your mortgage , there 's a higher probability they will default , too .
That 's called correlation ( emphasis added ) — - the degree to which one variable moves in line with another -— and measuring it is an important part of determining how risky mortgage bonds are .
In other words , you can't consider each loan individually within the box , as all the loans affect one another in some way .
Plus , there 's not enough past data to work from .
How can you possibly judge one individual 's risk of default on a Bank of America no - doc loan on a first home , when nobody at BofA knew the trustworthiness or even the income of the buyer ?
And how the hell were you supposed to figure out the value of an entire box full of these things when they impact each other ?
It 's a statistician 's nightmare .
Without solving it , you can't know what a CDO , or even a tranche of a CDO , is really worth .
That 's where Li's Gaussian Copula Function came in :
In 2000 , while working at JPMorgan Chase , Li published a paper in The Journal of Fixed Income titled " On Default Correlation : A Copula Function Approach . "
( In statistics , a copula is used to couple the behavior of two or more variables . )
Using some relatively simple math — by Wall Street standards , anyway — Li came up with an ingenious way to model default correlation without even looking at historical default data .
Instead , he used market data about the prices of instruments known as credit default swaps .
If your eyes did n't just bulge out of your head and plop on the keyboard , they should have .
This genius decided that the underlying value of the loans really was irrelevant : what was really relevant was what the market decided they were worth , on the basis of the value of the CDS insurance hedges against them .
The infinitely traded , completely unregulated , massively speculative pool of CDS bets against the CDOs that now contained the entire economy 's lifeblood .
You can't make this shit up :
When the price of a credit default swap goes up , that indicates that default risk has risen .
Li's breakthrough was that instead of waiting to assemble enough historical data about actual defaults , which are rare in the real world , he used historical prices from the CDS market .
It 's hard to build a historical model to predict Alice 's or Britney 's behavior , but anybody could see whether the price of credit default swaps on Britney tended to move in the same direction as that on Alice .
If it did , then there was a strong correlation between Alice 's and Britney 's default risks , as priced by the market .
Li wrote a model that used price rather than real - world default data as a shortcut ( making an implicit assumption that financial markets in general , and CDS markets in particular , can price default risk correctly ) .
It was a brilliant simplification of an intractable problem .
And Li did n't just radically dumb down the difficulty of working out correlations ; he decided not to even bother trying to map and calculate all the nearly infinite relationships between the various loans that made up a pool .
What happens when the number of pool members increases or when you mix negative correlations with positive ones ?
Never mind all that , he said .
The only thing that matters is the final correlation number — one clean , simple , all - sufficient figure that sums up everything .
Rather than laugh at the simple - minded insanity of this " valuation " scheme , the brilliant Masters of the Universe on Wall St. could barely contain themselves with glee at the " solution " to their CDO valuation problem :
The effect on the securitization market was electric .
Armed with Li's formula , Wall Street 's quants saw a new world of possibilities .
And the first thing they did was start creating a huge number of brand - new triple - A securities .
Using Li's copula approach meant that ratings agencies like Moody 's — or anybody wanting to model the risk of a tranche — no longer needed to puzzle over the underlying securities .
All they needed was that correlation number , and out would come a rating telling them how safe or risky the tranche was .
As a result , just about anything could be bundled and turned into a triple - A bond — corporate bonds , bank loans , mortgage - backed securities , whatever you liked .
The consequent pools were often known as collateralized debt obligations , or CDOs .
You could tranche that pool and create a triple - A security even if none of the components were themselves triple - A .
You could even take lower - rated tranches of other CDOs , put them in a pool , and tranche them — an instrument known as a CDO - squared , which at that point was so far removed from any actual underlying bond or loan or mortgage that no one really had a clue what it included .
But it did n't matter .
All you needed was Li's copula function .
Having created a system in which profits self - replicated like infinite reflections in funhouse mirrors in such a way that Dutch tulip merchants would laugh with schadenfreude , the rest makes you wonder if straitjackets might not be more appropriate than prison uniforms for this sorry bunch of Jokers :
The CDS and CDO markets grew together , feeding on each other .
At the end of 2001 , there was $ 920 billion in credit default swaps outstanding .
By the end of 2007 , that number had skyrocketed to more than $ 62 trillion .
The CDO market , which stood at $ 275 billion in 2000 , grew to $ 4.7 trillion by 2006 .
At the heart of it all was Li's formula .
When you talk to market participants , they use words like beautiful , simple , and , most commonly , tractable .
It could be applied anywhere , for anything , and was quickly adopted not only by banks packaging new bonds but also by traders and hedge funds dreaming up complex trades between those bonds .
" The corporate CDO world relied almost exclusively on this copula - based correlation model , " says Darrell Duffie , a Stanford University finance professor who served on Moody 's Academic Advisory Research Committee .
The Gaussian copula soon became such a universally accepted part of the world 's financial vocabulary that brokers started quoting prices for bond tranches based on their correlations .
" Correlation trading has spread through the psyche of the financial markets like a highly infectious thought virus , " wrote derivatives guru Janet Tavakoli in 2006 .
The entirety of the article is an absolute must read , but I would be remiss if I left out the following critical detail : nobody even factored in the possibility that the CDOs would go bust , because the the Gaussian copula formula based itself on the CDS , a derivative so brand spanking new that it had never seen a bear market .
All these geniuses ' models did n't even calculate for the possibility of negative growth : the formula for calculating it simply did n't exist .
Li's copula function was used to price hundreds of billions of dollars ' worth of CDOs filled with mortgages .
And because the copula function used CDS prices to calculate correlation , it was forced to confine itself to looking at the period of time when those credit default swaps had been in existence : less than a decade , a period when house prices soared .
Naturally , default correlations were very low in those years .
But when the mortgage boom ended abruptly and home values started falling across the country , correlations soared .
Bankers securitizing mortgages knew that their models were highly sensitive to house - price appreciation .
If it ever turned negative on a national scale , a lot of bonds that had been rated triple - A , or risk - free , by copula - powered computer models would blow up .
But no one was willing to stop the creation of CDOs , and the big investment banks happily kept on building more , drawing their correlation data from a period when real estate only went up .
" Everyone was pinning their hopes on house prices continuing to rise , " says Kai Gilkes of the credit research firm CreditSights , who spent 10 years working at ratings agencies .
" When they stopped rising , pretty much everyone was caught on the wrong side , because the sensitivity to house prices was huge .
And there was just no getting around it .
Why did n't rating agencies build in some cushion for this sensitivity to a house - price - depreciation scenario ?
Because if they had , they would have never rated a single mortgage - backed CDO . "
So now what ?
I 'll tell you what .
As I have explained before , the big Geither vs. Krugman grudge match is overwrought , imbued with more long - term ideological than immediately practical significance .
Both have one concern : get people , somehow , to start buying the CDOs banks have on their books .
Geithner wants to give sweetheart deals to hedge funds to buy the black boxes for cheap , under the premise that the CDOs have real , decent value .
Krugman and other progressive economists are less optimistic , feeling that only the federal government will take the plunge to purchase enough CDOs to make a dent in the banks ' balance sheets and provide a real market for CDOs .
But there 's a big problem with both plans : nobody has any idea what these things are worth .
No one EVER DID .
And without Li's hopelessly naive Gaussian copula formula , an entirely new method of calculating the value of these " toxic assets " will have to be found .
But like trying to predict the long - term weather of any given local area , correlative influences and a lack of relevant predictive data make that task essentially impossible -- almost as impossible as , say , attempting to predict the stock market or the probability that the Knicks will cover the spread against the Lakers on any given night .
And that 's why the credit markets are frozen , and are n't coming unfrozen any time soon .
That 's why they 're trying to rescue AIG and the CDS market .
Because nobody has any other idea how to calculate the value of what amounts to the entire American economy : the vast majority of every mortagage loan , auto loan , business loan , credit card loan , and all manner of other financial debt transaction made by American consumers .
It 's a mess I can't even begin to propose a solution for how to unwind -- but we better , as a nation , figure it out fast .
Then perhaps we can figure out how to employ our best mathematicians and statisticians in fields that actually producesomething of value , rather than destroy the world economy in one fell swoop .
That , truly , would be Change We Can Believe In .
TABLE OF CONTENTS
PREFACE
I 've been sentenced for a D.U.I. offense .
My 3rd one .
When I first came to prison , I had no idea what to expect .
Certainly none of this .
I 'm a tall white male , who unfortunately has a small amount of feminine characteristics .
And very shy .
These characteristics have got me raped so many times I have no more feelings physically .
I have been raped by up to 5 black men and two white men at a time .
I 've had knifes at my head and throat .
I had fought and been beat so hard that I did n't ever think I 'd see straight again .
One time when I refused to enter a cell , I was brutally attacked by staff and taken to segragation though I had only wanted to prevent the same and worse by not locking up with my cell mate .
There is no supervision after lockdown .
I was given a conduct report .
I explained to the hearing officer what the issue was .
He told me that off the record , He suggests I find a man I would / could willingly have sex with to prevent these things from happening .
I 've requested protective custody only to be denied .
It is not available here .
He also said there was no where to run to , and it would be best for me to accept things . . . .
I probably have AIDS now .
I have great difficulty raising food to my mouth from shaking after nightmares or thinking to hard on all this . . . .
I 've laid down without physical fight to be sodomized .
To prevent so much damage in struggles , ripping and tearing .
Though in not fighting , it caused my heart and spirit to be raped as well .
Something I do n't know if I 'll ever forgive myself for . ( 1 )
The letter excerpted above was one of the first to reach Human Rights Watch in response to a small announcement posted in Prison Legal News and Prison Life Magazine , two publications with a wide audience in U.S. prisons .
Having been alerted to the problem of prisoner - on - prisoner rape in the United States by the work of activists like Stephen Donaldson of the organization Stop Prisoner Rape , we had decided to conduct exploratory research into the topic and had put a call out to prisoners for information .
The resulting deluge of letters -- many of which included compelling firsthand descriptions such as this -- convinced us that the issue merited urgent attention .
Rape , by prisoners ' accounts , was no aberrational occurrence ; instead it was a deeply - rooted , systemic problem .
It was also a problem that prison authorities were doing little to address .
The present report -- the product of three years of research and well over a thousand inmate letters -- describes the complex dynamics of male prisoner - on - prisoner sexual abuse in the United States .
The report is an effort to explain why and how such abuse occurs , who commits it and who falls victim to it , what are its effects , both physical and psychological , how are prison authorities coping with it and , most importantly , what reforms can be instituted to better prevent it from occurring .
The Scope of this Report
This report is limited in scope to male prisoner - on - prisoner sexual abuse in the United States .
It does not cover women prisoners , nor does it cover the sexual abuse of male prisoners by their jailers .
Human Rights
Watch investigated the problem of custodial sexual misconduct in U.S. women 's prisons in two previous reports and the issue has been a continuing focus of our U.S. advocacy efforts .
( 2 ) As to custodial sexual misconduct against male prisoners , we decided not to include that topic within the scope of this report even though some prisoners who claimed to have been subject to such abuse did contact us .
An initial review of the topic convinced us that it involved myriad issues that were distinct from the topic at hand , which is complicated enough in itself .
Even though the notices that Human Rights Watch circulated to announce our research on prisoner - on - prisoner sexual abuse were written in gender - neutral language , we received no information from women prisoners regarding the problem .
As prison experts are well aware , penal facilities for men and women tend to differ in important respects .
If the problem of prisoner - on - prisoner sexual abuse exists in women 's institutions - - a possibility we do not exclude -- it is likely to take somewhat different forms than in men 's prisons . ( 3 )
For several reasons , the primary focus of this report is on sexual abuse in prisons , rather than jails .
( 4 ) Most importantly , all of our information save a handful of letters came from prison as opposed to jail inmates .
Many of these prisoners did , however , describe sexual abuses they had suffered when previously held in jails , allowing us to gather some information on the topic .
Nonetheless , the bulk of our prisoner testimonies and documentation -- and all of the information we collected from state authorities -- pertain specifically to prisons .
Already , with fifty separate state prison jurisdictions in the United States , the task of collecting official information was difficult ; obtaining such information from the many thousands of local authorities responsible for city and county jails would have been infinitely more so .
Yet we should emphasize that our lack of specific research on jails should be not interpreted as suggesting that the problem does not occur there .
Although little research has been done on sexual assault in jails , the few commentators who have examined the topic have found the abuse to be similarly or even more prevalent there . ( 5 )
It is evident to Human Rights Watch , even without having completed exhaustive research into the jail context , that the problems we describe with regard to prisons generally hold true for jails as well .
This conclusion derives from the fact that most of the risk factors leading to rape exist in prisons and jails alike .
We therefore believe that our recommendations for reform are largely applicable in the jail context , and we urge jail authorities to pay increased attention to the issue of prisoner - on - prisoner sexual abuse .
While this report does not deal specifically with juvenile institutions , we note that previous research , while extremely scanty , suggests that inmate - on - inmate sexual abuse may be even more common in juvenile institutions than it is in facilities for adults .
( 6 ) Indeed , a case filed recently by the U.S. Justice Department in federal court to challenge conditions in a Louisiana juvenile institution includes serious allegations of inmate - on - inmate rape . ( 7 )
Finally , our choice of U.S. prisons as the subject of this research , over prisons elsewhere in the world , in no way indicates that we believe the problem to be unique to the United States .
On the contrary , our international prison research convinces us that prisoner - on - prisoner rape is of serious concern around the world .
We note that several publications on human rights or prison conditions in other countries have touched on or explored the topic , as have past Human Rights Watch prison reports .
( 8 ) Interestingly , researchers outside of the United States have reached many of the same conclusions as researchers here , suggesting that specific cultural variables are not determinative with regard to rape in prison . ( 9 )
Methodology
The report is primarily based on information collected from over 200 prisoners spread among thirty - seven states .
The majority of these inmates have been raped or otherwise sexually abused while in prison , and were therefore able to give firsthand accounts of the problem .
Numerous inmates who were not subject to sexual abuse also provided their views on the topic , including information about sexual assaults that they had witnessed .
A very small number of inmates who had themselves participated in rape also contributed their perspectives .
Much of the information was received via written correspondence , although Human Rights Watch representatives spoke by telephone with a number of prisoners , and personally interviewed twenty - six of them .
Prisoner testimonies were supplemented by documentary materials such as written grievances , court papers , letters , and medical records .
Prisoners were contacted using several different methods .
Human Rights
Watch posted announcements in a number of publications and leaflets that reach prisoners -- including Prison Legal News , Prison Life Magazine ( which has since ceased publication ) , and Florida Prison Legal Perspectives -- informing them that we were conducting research on the topic of prisoner - on - prisoner sexual abuse and that we welcomed their information .
Several organizations that work with prisoners , including Stop Prisoner Rape , put us in contact with additional inmates .
The prisoners who collaborated in our efforts were thus a largely self - selected group , not a random sampling .
Previous researchers have conducted quantitative studies using statistically valid techniques in certain U.S. prisons -- most recently , in 1998 in seven midwestern state prison systems -- but , given that there are some two million prisoners in the United States , this would be difficult to achieve on a national scale .
The research on which the present report was based was thus qualitative in nature : it sought to identify systemic weaknesses rather than to quantify actual cases of abuse .
The result , we believe , sketches the outlines of a national problem , bridging the gap between academic research on the topic and the more anecdotal writings that occasionally appear in the popular press .
The prisoners with whom Human Rights Watch was in contact , we should emphasize , did not simply serve as a source of case material .
Rather , their comments and insights -- based on firsthand knowledge and close observation - - inform every page of the report .
Besides prisoners , we also obtained valuable information from prison officials , prison experts , lawyers who represent prisoners , prisoners rights organizations , and prisoners ' relatives .
Written materials including academic studies , books , and articles from the popular press supplemented these sources .
In addition , Human Rights Watch conducted an extensive review of the case law relevant to prison rape in the United States .
Critics of the Bush administration accused it of inserting ideology into the scientific process -- from the stem cell issue to climate change and even contraception .
The Obama administration has been working to overturn these policies .
The order will allow research on countless stem - cell lines already in existence , as well as ones yet to be created , typically from embryos left over from fertility treatments that would otherwise be discarded .
The order comes just in time for researchers to take advantage of money in Mr. Obama ’s economic recovery package and use it for stem cell studies .
But because of the Dickey - Wicker amendment , federal researchers would still be unable to create their own stem cell lines .
Mr. Obama has no power to overturn the Dickey - Wicker ban .
Only Congress , which attaches the ban to appropriations bills , can overturn it .
Mr. Obama has not taken a position on the ban and does not intend to , Melody C. Barnes , his chief domestic policy adviser , said Sunday .
The president believes stem - cell research “ should be done in compliance with federal law , ” she said .
Bush could n't -- quite literally -- watch TV and chew a pretzel at the same time .
But he is n't living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue any longer .
And the mess he and his foul regime left behind may take as long to clean up as it took to create .
Fortunately we have anpresident -- responsible to the American people who elected him , not the special interests -- living at that address now , one who can do many things at the same time .
And his team is made up of public servants not of self - servers operating at the expense of the public .
Clearly , President Obama 's # 1 priority -- as he 's always said it would be and as his actions have shown it is -- is the economy , the area Bush and hypocritical Republican rubber stamps like Eric Cantor , did the most damage .
At the same time his administration is working to unfoul the foreign relations messes Bush created in every corner of the globe .
And the hash Bush made of the U.S. Justice system is n't something that can exactly be left on the back burner either .
Obama is determined to move fast and to move NOW on a wide variety of problems left by years of Bush - Republican misrule .
Republican obstructionists are determined to block him from accomplishing his agenda , the one that got him elected just a 3 months ago .
Today President Obama is lifting the ban on stem cell research that the medieval minds who had been formulating the Bush Regime 's policies towards all things science - based had put in place .
When the president signs the executive order reversing the Republican right 's position , which has endangered America 's standing in the international research and development community , he is expected to make an announcement about a broader initiative to restore scientific integrity to government processes .
Count on Virginia 's most reactionary congressman , Eric Cantor , to run to the media and squeal like a stuck pig on behalf of his obstructionist caucus .
Yesterday on CNN he called the executive order " a distraction . "
I think to the thousands and thousands of families who have been hopeful that cures to serious diseases , from Lou Gehrig 's disease , Parkinson 's disease , and diabetes to spinal - chord injuries , heart disease and cancer , would be in the works for the last 8 dark years , it 's anything but a distraction .
Although if the Eric Cantors of the world want to squabble about science and stop obstructing the president 's plans to revitalize the middle class , that would be no one 's loss .
Obama will leave the thorny issue of whether or not to allow federal dollars to be used in stem cell research to Congress .
Labels : Cantor , obstructionist Republicans , stem cell research
It was an attack that shocked two ­nations — a 26 - year - old Brazilian woman living in Zurich claimed to have been attacked by racist skinheads who carved the initials of Switzerland 's main rightwing party into her body and caused her to miscarry her unborn twins .
When news reached Brazil earlier this week , the foreign minister , Celso Amorim , condemned the assault as " grave " and " shocking " and called in the Swiss envoy .
The president , Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , said : " We want people to respect Brazilians overseas in the same way that we respect them here .
We cannot accept and stay silent faced with such a level of violence against a Brazilian woman overseas . "
The story was splashed across newspapers under headlines such as The Marks of Intolerance , and led most television bulletins .
But today , Paula Oliviera 's story appeared to be unravelling .
Swiss authorities said she was not pregnant when the attack was alleged to have happened .
And according to medical experts , she may well have cut herself .
The head of Zurich University 's forensic medicine department , Walter Baer , said that " any experienced forensic doctor would not hesitate to assume that this was a case of self - infliction " .
Chastened by the sudden twist to the episode , Brazilian officials were silent .
A member of Lula 's press office said the presidency would not make any official comment on the case , adding that it appeared to have taken on " new dimensions " .
A spokesman for Brazil 's foreign ministry said it would " wait for the end of the investigation before making new statements " .
Oliviera , a 26 - year - old lawyer , told Zurich police she was attacked by three skinheads , one with a Nazi symbol tattooed on the back of his head , outside a Zurich train station on Monday .
Pictures have shown her stomach and legs scarred with the initials of the rightwing Swiss People 's party ( SVP ) .
The woman 's family told the Brazilian media she had been speaking Portuguese outside Stettbach train station shortly before the attack .
All week , Oliviera has been interviewed from her hospital bed by police and forensic experts .
Her fiance said she was suffering from nightmares .
" She woke up sweating and screaming , " said Marco Trepp .
Police have appealed for witnesses and say they have spoken to three men who were near the scene of the alleged attack but that no one was arrested .
The SVP won 29 % of the vote in the last election and is known for its anti-immigration stance .
During the 2007 election , its poster showed white sheep kicking a black sheep out of Switzerland .
It caused international outrage .
A spokesman for the party , Oskar Freysinger , condemned the alleged attack and denied any involvement .
" If that really was someone from our party , we would n't hesitate for a second .
That person would be immediately kicked out , " he said .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
Years from now , when academics search for causes of the stock market crash of 2008 , they will focus on the pivotal role of mortgage - backed securities .
These exotic financial instruments allowed a downturn in U.S. home prices to morph into a contagion that brought down Bear Stearns a year ago this month - and more recently have brought the global banking system to its knees .
What scholars should not miss is the role that the human element - call it greed or ignorance - played in this tragedy .
In an exclusive excerpt from William Cohan 's new book , " House of Cards : A Tale of Hubris and Wretched Excess on Wall Street , " to be published March 10 by Doubleday , the bestselling author sheds light on the bankers who thought they had mastered what Warren Buffett has called " financial weapons of mass destruction . "
By looking back to the roots of the misadventure in which Bear Stearns traders Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tannin lost roughly $ 1.6 billion while allegedly misleading investors , Cohan illustrates how the missteps of the few can have consequences for the many .
When the first jet hit the World Trade Center towers on the morning of September 11 , 2001 , Jimmy Cayne , then chairman and CEO of Bear Stearns , turned on a small television in his midtown Manhattan office and watched in disbelief as the second jet hit the south tower .
Later in the day , Cayne got a call from Richard Grasso , then CEO of the New York Stock Exchange , telling him that it was important to the United States government that the exchange reopen as quickly as possible .
To that end , Grasso said there would be a meeting the next morning at the stock exchange among the heads of all the Wall Street firms .
When Cayne woke up the next morning , he saw on the news that New York City had closed off access to lower Manhattan below 15th Street , including the New York Stock Exchange .
Cayne called Grasso at home and offered to host the meeting instead at Bear Stearns .
Grasso quickly agreed to Cayne 's suggestion , and the meeting was held in the seventh - floor boardroom on Wednesday at two o'clock .
" Everybody in the world was there , " Cayne said .
" Everybody .
This was heavy cake .
I 've never seen all these people , the heads of every major firm , sit in a room and not hate each other . "
Bear Stearns , the fifth - largest U.S. investment bank , survived the 9/11 attacks unscathed , just as it had survived unscathed every other major crisis since its founding in 1923 , among them : the Great Depression , World War II and the 1987 market crash .
Indeed , until the very end , the firm had never had a losing quarter in its history .
But in the months following 9 - 11 , Cayne and his senior management team , including Alan " Ace " Greenberg , Warren Spector and Alan Schwartz would unwittingly sow the seeds of the firm 's destruction by betting heavily on the manufacture and the sale of mortgage - backed securities .
In the short run , the decision by Bear 's executives to become a leader in this business resulted in huge profits for the firm - and massive paychecks for them .
Along with bankers at Lehman Brothers , Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) , they were only too happy to capitalize on the mortgage boom that occurred in the wake of 9 - 11 when the Federal Reserve loosened the money supply .
One of Bear Stearns profit centers was a small hedge - fund division .
The firm seeded it with a relatively trifling $ 45 million equity investment .
Ralph Cioffi ( pronounced Chee - off - ee ) , a longtime Bear Stearns fixed - income salesman turned hedge - fund manager , ran it .
The funds were part of the firm 's relatively tiny asset management business , known as BSAM .
BSAM reported to Warren Spector , Bear 's resident wunderkind , who as the firm 's co-president ( with Alan Schwartz ) was responsible for overseeing 90 % of its revenue , including its massive fixed - income business .
Like Cayne and Ace Greenberg , the boyish Spector was a world - class bridge player and many people both inside and outside Bear Stearns considered it inevitable that he would one day soon run the firm .
In October 2003 , Spector 's friend Cioffi moved from Bear 's fixed - income department to BSAM , and set up a hedge fund , called the High - Grade Structured Credit Fund , with money from outside investors .
The fund eventually would have around $ 1.5 billion of investors ' cash in it .
Then 47 , Cioffi had joined Bear Stearns in 1985 as an institutional fixed - income salesman , specializing in structured finance products .
Cioffi grew up in South Burlington , Vermont , near Lake Champlain .
From 1989 to 1991 , he was the New York head of fixed - income sales and then , for the next three years , served as global product and sales manager for high - grade credit products .
As a salesman , Cioffi covered the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System account and was making around $ 4 million , year after year .
" He was the top fixed - income salesman in a firm where fixed income was king , " said one senior managing director .
" We all grew up with Ralph here , " explained Paul Friedman , who was the chief operating officer of Bear 's fixed - income division .
" Ralph is one of the smartest guys I 've ever met and was absolutely the best salesman I 've ever met .
When I was a trader , he was a salesman , a fabulous salesman .
He was incredibly personable , incredibly smart , creative and could get things done . "
As a manager , Cioffi was another story .
" He had adult ADD , " says Friedman .
Helping Cioffi run the hedge fund was Matthew Tannin , six years his junior .
Tannin , born in New Jersey , was a graduate of the University of San Francisco law school .
He joined Bear Stearns in 1994 and spent seven years structuring collateralized debt obligations .
In 2001 , he moved over to research , where he studied the trading and value of CDOs .
At the outset , Cioffi and Tannin ( pronounced Ta- neen ) told investors the High - Grade Structured Credit Fund would invest in low - risk , high - grade debt securities , such as tranches of CDOs , which the ratings agencies had rated either AAA or AA .
The fund would focus on using leverage to generate returns by borrowing money in the low - cost , short - term repo markets to buy higher yielding , long - term CDOs .
The difference between the interest rate at which the fund could borrow money and the yield on the CDOs , enhanced by the use of borrowed money , would generage the fund 's profits .
In August 2006 , Cioffi and Tannin decided to open a second fund , the Enhanced Fund , that used substantially more leverage - and took more risk - than the High - Grade Fund .
The Enhanced Fund had about $ 600 million of investors ' money in it and used a $ 400 million credit facility from Barclays , the large British bank , to leverage the securities Cioffi and Tannin bought .
For 40 months , Cioffi's High - Grade hedge fund never had a losing month .
During that time , it achieved a 50 % cumulative return .
The Enhanced Fund also performed well during its short existence .
In typical hedge fund fashion , BSAM kept 20 % of the profits generated by the funds plus a 2 % fee on the net assets under management ; fees from the High - Grade Fund alone accounted for 75 % of BSAM 's total revenues in 2004 and 2005 .
Trading securities and Ferraris
Cioffi lived very well .
In 2000 , he and his wife , Phyllis , purchased a home for $ 815,000 in Tenafly , New Jersey , that in 2007 was assessed for $ 2.6 million .
He owned a home in Naples , Florida , valued at $ 933,000 , and a home in Ludlow , Vermont , valued at $ 2.2 million .
He owned an apartment at the Stanhope , on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan , and a $ 10.7 million , 6,500 - square - foot home in Southampton , Long Island , which had six bedrooms , seven baths , a pool , a tennis court , and a separate guesthouse on two and a half acres .
He was the executive producer of the 2006 independent film " Just Like My Son , " starring Rosie Perez .
But Cioffi's real passion was for Ferraris .
At one point , he owned two of them : a $ 250,000 F430 convertible Spider and a $ 300,000 front - engine V - 12 Superamerica .
One day , his Ferrari dealer in Spring Valley , New York - in Rockland County - called him up and told him he had one low - mileage Ferrari Enzo for sale .
Was Cioffi interested in a trade of his two Ferraris plus some cash for the Enzo ?
Only 399 of the Enzos were built from 2002 to 2004 , and they originally cost $ 650,000 each .
Nowadays , if you can find one , it will cost around $ 1.2 million .
After getting the call from the dealer , Cioffi called up Doug Sharon , a longtime Bear broker and car aficionado who ran the firm 's Boston office .
" Do you think I should do the trade ? " Cioffi asked Sharon .
" The dealer wants me to do this trade . "
" Ralph , as far as I 'm concerned , it 's a no- brainer , " Sharon told him .
" You gotta do it .
Your two cars and some cash for an Enzo ?
Enzos are hard to find . "
" It 's not exactly the kind of car I 'm gonna drive down to the golf club with , " Cioffi responded .
For Sharon , the conversation with Cioffi about the Enzo " was probably the beginning of the end , when Ralph 's thinking about buying million - dollar Ferraris . "
Cioffi pulls his money out
By the time Bear Stearns released its 2006 annual report in mid February 2007 , Cioffi had more on his mind than trading Ferraris .
Bear Stearns had a banner 2006 : $ 9.2 billion in revenue , and it had made $ 2.05 billion of net income , the first time that milestone had been reached .
Profit had increased 40 % from 2005 .
Standard & Poor 's upgraded Bear Stearns to A+ with a stable outlook .
Unbeknownst to shareholders , though , problems in the housing market were starting to effect Cioffi's funds ' performance .
February 2007 had been a very difficult month for Cioffi 's two hedge funds .
The High - Grade Fund had reported a gross return of 1.5 % - respectable , to be sure - but the Enhanced Leverage Fund had lost 0.08 % , the first time either fund had lost money since Cioffi started in 2003 .
But that was not the message that Tannin sent to Barclays about the February performance of the Enhanced Leverage Fund .
" You will be happy to know that we are having our best month ever this February , " he e-mailed the bank on February 19 .
On March 1 , Cioffi told an economist who worked for the hedge funds , " Do n't talk about [ the funds ' February results ] to anyone or I 'll shoot you . "
He also went on to say that he thought the funds might have their first down month ever and that he was disappointed by that fact .
The next day , Cioffi met informally with Tannin and two other members of the funds ' management team and spoke " about the extremely difficult month " February had been for the funds , though he claimed that the funds " had averted disaster . "
With his team around him , Cioffi " led a vodka toast to celebrate surviving the month , " according to the June 2008 , federal grand jury indictment of both Cioffi and Tannin .
Both Cioffi and Tannin declined to comment for this account .
Cioffi was becoming increasingly concerned about the funds ' exposure to the subprime market , even though the monthly statements sent to investors stated that only 6 % of the funds ' money was invested in subprime .
Cioffi was concerned because he knew that actually the funds had closer to 60 % of their money invested in subprime mortgages .
March was not going to be a good month , either .
On March 15 , Cioffi wrote a colleague by e-mail , " I 'm fearful of these markets .
Matt [ Tannin ] said it 's either a meltdown or the greatest buying opportunity ever .
I 'm leaning more towards the former . "
On the very same day , Tannin portrayed the funds in a different light , telling an investor , " We are seeing opportunities now and are excited about what is possible .
I am adding capital to the Fund .
If you guys are in a position to do the same I think this is a good opportunity , " and he added that " it was a very bad time to redeem . "
Tannin never did invest more of his own money in the funds .
Finally on March 23 , Cioffi initiated the process of removing $ 2 million of the $ 6 million that he personally had invested in the Enhanced Leverage Fund .
He moved the money to another Bear hedge fund , Structured Risk Partners , of which Cioffi had oversight responsibility beginning April 1 , and which had still been performing well .
For appearance purposes , hedge fund managers were expected to invest in the hedge funds they managed , and Cioffi 's defenders suggest that this alone was the reason he moved the cash .
The High - Grade Fund lost 3.71 % for the month .
The Enhanced Leverage Fund lost 5.41 % .
' The subprime market is toast '
After 40 months of positive returns , the sudden and sharp decline in the two hedge funds was new territory for Cioffi and Tannin .
They struggled mightily to figure out what to do .
On April 18 , one of Cioffi 's investors , who had $ 57 million invested , informed him that he was considering redeeming his money .
Cioffi told the investor that the portfolio managers had $ 8 million of their own money invested , one - third of their liquid net worth .
He neglected to tell the investor that he had taken $ 2 million of his own money out and invested it in his other hedge fund .
On April 22 , Tannin wrote Cioffi an e-mail from his personal Gmail account to Cioffi 's wife 's personal Hotmail account with the subject line " Things to Think about - Parts I and II . "
He wrote at times with great emotion and about his personal feelings , which may have accounted for his decision not to write the e-mail on the Bear Stearns system .
Tannin , a philosophy major , was certainly waxing philosophical in the correspondence .
" We have spent our time well - and time is the ONLY thing in this life which one can't ever get back . "
He said he was feeling " pretty damn good " about what was happening at the funds because he had no doubt " I 've done the best possible job that I could have done .
Mistakes , yep , I 've made them - but they do not bother me as much as they did years ago ....
So - f*** it - all one can do is their best - and I have done this . "
He went on to wonder whether the funds should be closed or significantly restructured .
The argument for closing the funds was based on the market and on a complex internal April 19 , CDO report , which was a new analysis that Tannin had recently perused .
" If we believe the [ new CDO report ] is ANYWHERE CLOSE to accurate , I think we should close the funds now .
The reason for this is that if [ the CDO report ] is correct , then the entire subprime market is toast , " wrote Tannin .
" If AAA bonds are systematically downgraded , then there is simply no way for us to make money - ever . "
On April 25 , Cioffi and Tannin held a conference call for the funds ' investors , who were getting skittish .
Cioffi and Tannin 's performance was Oscar - worthy .
Cioffi kicked the discussion off with a review of the first - quarter performance at both funds .
The High - Grade Fund was down a cumulative 0.34 % in the first quarter , with the loss coming in March after a positive January and February ; the Enhanced Leverage Fund had lost 4.74 % year to date , with much of the loss coming in March .
" At this point in time , the [ Enhanced ] fund has significant amounts of liquidity , " Cioffi said .
He then predicted returns of 14 % for the year in the Enhanced Leverage Fund and 11 % for the year in the High - Grade Fund .
A charitable view of Cioffi's predictions for the funds ' 2008 performance would be that he was badly mistaken ; another view would be that he deliberately misled investors to keep them from seeking a stampede of redemptions , which would spell the end of the funds and of Cioffi 's lavish lifestyle .
Bear puts more skin in the game
Two factors that Cioffi and Tannin could not have foreseen were starting to cripple their funds .
Investors spooked by the January and February returns put in redemption orders for well over $ 100 million .
With less new money flooding into Cioffi 's funds and BSAM being forced to sell assets out of the funds , the small esoteric market became less liquid .
The second factor was the creation in January 2007 of an index - known as the ABX index - that for the first time allowed investors to bet on the performance of the subprime mortgage market in much the way an S&P index fund allows them to bet on the direction of the stock market as a whole .
The ABX was an index of securities backed by home loans issued to borrowers with weak credit .
" In previous times , if the market sold off , no one really knew how much , " Friedman explained .
" Now you had a published index that people could observe .
More importantly , it was the only real thing they could short as a hedge .
As a result , the index got driven lower and lower as people looked for a way to hedge , going far lower than the underlying bonds .
Potential buyers then demanded to buy bonds at the levels that the index suggested they should trade [ at ] when in fact no one was willing to sell there .
So you had a period of time when , for example , the index would trade at 90 but the underlying bonds traded - when they traded - at 95 .
Hence , there would be no trades . "
On May 1 , despite mounting redemption notices , Bear 's co-president Warren Spector invested an additional $ 25 million into the fund , bringing the firm 's total stake to more than $ 500 million in hedge funds and other seed capital opportunities .
Spector made the additional investment without taking a thorough look at the analytics and without consulting with his boss Jimmy Cayne - a decision he would come to regret even though it was within his authority to do so .
Goldman questions Bear 's marks
Despite what they said in the April 25 conference call , by early May both Cioffi and Tannin anticipated that the funds '
April results were going to be rough .
Cioffi published the net asset value ( NAV ) for the Enhanced Leverage Fund for April at - 6.5 % .
A week later , Goldman Sachs sent , by e-mail , its April marks on the securities to Cioffi .
As a counterparty to trades in the funds , Goldman was obligated to report its thinking about the value of the securities in the funds on a monthly basis .
" Now there 's a funny little procedure that the SEC imposes on you , which is that even if you get a late mark , you have to consider it , " explains one former Bear executive .
" They give us these 50 and 60 [ cents on the dollar ] prices .
What we got from the other counterparties is 98 .
The SEC rules say that when you do this , you either have to average them - but they 're meant to be averaging 97s and 98s , not 50s and 98s ....
So we have to repost our NAV .
And now we go from minus 6 [ percent ] to minus 19 [ percent ] - minus 18.97 [ percent ] to be exact - and that is game f*** ing over .
By the way , the firm that sent us the 50 made a s**t - pot full of money in 2007 shorting the f***ing market . "
Gary Cohn , the co-president of Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) , had a few reactions to the charges made by the Bear executive .
First , he was clear that Goldman did not make nearly as much money in 2007 betting against the mortgage market as people think it did .
" We do n't disclose segment - by - segment reporting , " he said .
" But the market would be really disappointed if they saw our actual mortgage results last year , because they think we made a lot of money . "
As for the marks themselves , Cohn said that Goldman was aggressive about marking down these kinds of securities , especially during the third quarter of 2007 , much to the detriment of its own income statement and those of some of their clients who would then have to account for the new Goldman marks .
He then shared an anecdote about a conversation he'd had with Nino Fanlo , one of the founding partners of KKR Financial Holdings , a specialty finance company started by KKR , the private equity shop .
After Goldman sent out the marks in the 50� to 55 � range , Fanlo called Cohn and told him , " You 're way off market .
Everyone else is at 80 , 85 . "
Cohn then offered to sell Fanlo $ 10 billion of the paper at his 55 � price and encouraged him to sell that in the market to all the other broker - dealers at the higher prices they claimed to be marking the paper at .
In other words , Cohn was offering Fanlo a windfall : buy at 55 and sell at 80 .
" You can sell them to every one of those dealers , " Cohn told Fanlo .
" Sell 80 , sell 77 , sell 76 , sell 75 .
Sell them all the way down to 60 .
And I 'll sell them to you at my mark , at 55 , because I was trying to get out .
So if you can do that , you can make yourself $ 5 billion right now . "
Cohn had been trying to sell the securities at 55 for a period of time and people would just hang up on him .
A few days later , Fanlo called Cohn back .
" He came back and said , ' I think your mark might be right , ' " Cohn said .
" And that mark went down to 30 . "
Cohn said the market changed dramatically through the course of the year .
" We marked our books where we thought we could transact because some of this stuff was n't transacting , " says Cohn .
" We sold stuff at 98 and marked it at 55 a month later .
People did n't like that .
Our clients did n't like that .
They were pissed . "
The moment the bid-ask spread on these securities widened to the point where there needed to be such a fulsome debate about their value was the beginning of the end .
Shouting fire in a crowded theater
As the BSAM funds collapsed , Bear Stearns co-president Warren Spector suspected Cioffi and Tannin might need help .
On June 5 , Spector walked into Paul Friedman 's office , and Friedman remembers Spector saying , " I think Ralph 's got a liquidity problem .
Could you see if you could help ? '
Talk about your great understatement of all time . "
On June 7 , Cioffi announced that redemptions from the Enhanced Fund would no longer be permitted , regardless of whether a redemption notice had already been submitted .
" I go over to see Ralph with the BSAM guys , and not surprisingly , the announcement that he was suspending redemptions had caused his fourteen lenders to raise their margin requirements , mark down the collateral , and start to squeeze , " Friedman said .
( By this time , BSAM had moved out of Bear 's headquarters at 383 Madison Avenue into a separate office down 46th Street , at 237 Park Avenue . )
" And so I sat with Ralph and I said , ' Take me through it .
You must be OK .
You 've got all your funding locked up , non-recourse , no margin calls for term , right ? '
He goes , ' Yeah , most of it , ' and so we go through the balance sheet , and he 's got about $ 14 billion of mostly high - quality stuff , but not entirely , and his average funding is about a month , and I said to him , ' How long would it take you to sell that ? '
He goes , ' Well , I could probably sell a third in six months . '
I said , ' What are you gonna do if you get a margin call ? '
He goes , ' Well , I 've got some more of the same stuff fully paid for in the box . '
I said , ' How much ? '
He goes , ' A few hundred million . '
I went , ' You 're dead . ' "
On the advice of the restructuring team at the Blackstone Group , the BSAM team decided to call a June 14 meeting of the repo lenders to Cioffi 's hedge funds .
The basic gist of Bear 's strategy was to ask these creditors to be patient so that an orderly liquidation in a less pressured environment could commence .
Blackstone 's theory of the situation was that the very same banks that were repo lenders to the funds were up to their eyeballs in the very same illiquid mortgage securities that Cioffi had .
Therefore , no one would have any incentive to force a sale of the securities into a frozen market and thus establish a new , lower mark that everyone would have to adopt .
" It was the classic Mexican standoff , where nobody wins if everybody 's dead on the floor at the end of this thing , " explained one person involved with the strategy .
" Our point was , ' All you guys have this problem .
It does n't help any of you to flood the market with this paper '... But it was like any other panic .
If you 're out early enough , maybe it is good for you . "
The repo counterparties ' meeting took place in the second - floor auditorium at Bear Stearns headquarters at 383 Madison Avenue .
The tactic backfired completely .
Two days later , Merrill Lynch ignored Cioffi 's request for a thirty - day standstill and seized $ 400 million of its collateral from the funds with the intention of auctioning the assets in the market at noon on Monday .
Says Friedman , " had he not been the first fund to go , it would have had a much lower impact as well ....
But it was like the pebble being tossed into the pond .
It was pulling on the thread .
It was any analogy you want to use . "
' Bag the funds '
Around the middle of June 2007 , Chairman and CEO Jimmy Cayne decided to convene a meeting of the twenty most senior executives at the firm to get an update of what was going on with Cioffi 's hedge funds and to decide whether or not the firm should agree to become the repo lender to the funds .
To that point , Bear Stearns ' only exposure to Cioffi 's hedge funds was its $ 45 million equity investment , and the rest of Wall Street was waiting for Bear Stearns to put together a rescue plan .
Before going into the meeting , Cayne asked Steve Begleiter , the firm 's head of strategy , how much money Bear had invested in the funds .
Cayne told Begleiter he thought the amount was $ 20 million ; Begleiter corrected him and informed him the firm actually had $ 45 million invested .
Cayne remembers saying , " Where did the other 25 come from ? '
So Begleiter said , ' I do n't know . '
I said , ' You do n't know where the 25 comes from ? '
He said , ' No . '
We walk in , I said , ' Before we discuss what we 're going to do , does anybody know about $ 25 million that was put into the funds at the last minute ? '
Spector said , ' I did .
Sorry . '
No , he did n't say ' I 'm sorry . '
He said , ' I f***ed up . '
If he had said ' I 'm sorry , ' it would have been different .
He said , ' I f***ed up . '
Now there 's silence .
People were expecting me to say , ' What are you , f** * ing crazy ?
Unauthorized , you yourself authorized $ 25 million into a failing enterprise . '
Well , I did n't , but I also did n't say anything for like a minute .
I just let everybody hear him say , ' I f***ed up . ' "
After shining the bright light of blame on Spector 's decision to invest the extra $ 25 million into the funds on his own authority , Cayne asked the group what to do about the funds .
' I said , ' Okay , so what are our options ?
It seems to me the first option is we just bag the funds .
We suffer a reputational risk , which we are n't really going to avoid anyway .
And we save ourselves the heartache of that crap coming into us . '
Nobody said anything . "
By June 22 , Spector was on the phone with other Wall Street executives .
His message to them was that Bear Stearns had finally decided to step up in a significant way to help the hedge funds ( Cayne 's pitch to let them fail had not carried the day with his fellow board members ) .
But the level of the rescue was not quite what the Street had expected .
Spector outlined a plan in which Bear would become the new repo lender - up to a total of $ 3.2 billion - to the High - Grade Fund only and would do nothing for the Enhanced Leverage Fund , effectively signaling that the second fund would fail and be liquidated .
( In the end , Bear Stearns lent around $ 1.5 billion to the High - Grade Fund . )
Now the hard work of figuring out what the firm had just agreed to buy had to begin .
" It took two or three weeks to mark , " explained Friedman .
" It literally took a dozen people on the mortgage desk night and day , and a bunch of our research people night and day and weekends , three weeks to value this stuff , which tells you just how illiquid it was . "
By the time they did figure out what most of it was worth , the firm had miscalculated badly .
" We thought there was $ 400 million - ish of cushion , and in fact , as it turned out , we missed by like $ 1 billion out of $ 1.5 billion , " says Friedman .
" It was not even close .
You would think you could get it to the nearest billion , and a lot of it was the market deteriorating dramatically in that five or six weeks .
But it was just a guess to begin with . "
On July 17 , Cayne announced the seemingly inevitable news that the hedge funds were kaput .
On July 30 , the hedge funds ' boards of directors authorized the funds to file petitions for liquidation under the Cayman Islands ' Companies Law under the supervision of the Cayman Grand Court .
Subsequently , both a U.S. bankruptcy court and a U.S. district court of appeals struck down the legitimacy of the Cayman Islands venue for the filing .
As a consequence of the filing , Bear Stearns seized $ 1.3 billion of underlying collateral - Cioffi 's panoply of illiquid mortgage - backed securities - that it had been financing for all of one month and absorbed it onto the firm 's balance sheet .
Not long after , Cioffi and Tannin were fired .
Where are they now ?
The hedge - fund debacle and the fateful decision to lend $ 1.5 billion to the High - Grade Fund led to Bear Stearns ' first quarterly loss in its 85 - year history , in the three months ended November 2007 .
Besides Cioffi and Tannin , there was other collateral damage .
On August 1 , 2007 Jimmy Cayne fired Warren Spector .
On January 2008 , Cayne resigned as CEO probably within days of a coup d'etat that was percolating throughout the firm 's corridors .
( Cayne remained the Chairman of the firm 's board of directors ) .
With both Cayne and Spector dispatched , Bear Stearns had little choice but to turn to Alan Schwartz , the firm 's most prominent investment banker , and ask him to be the CEO , the first time an investment banker had run the firm , which had always been predominantly a fixed - income shop .
As respected as Schwartz was on Wall Street , he had little knowledge of the world of trading and fixed income , let alone the billions of dollars of complex , mortgage - related securities that were larding the firm 's balance sheet .
He decided not to raise additional equity capital for the firm or to seek a merger partner .
He determined Bear Stearns could continue to go it alone and succeed .
That was yet another fateful decision .
Within two months of his appointment as CEO , investors , repo lenders , hedge - fund clients and trading counterparties all began to question the firm 's efficacy - the endgame that began nine months earlier with the disaster in Cioffi 's hedge funds .
The failure of Bear Stearns during the four days beginning March 12 , 2008 , culminating in its sale for a pittance to JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) on March 16 , meant that no firm on Wall Street could any longer be considered safe , especially those firms such as Lehman Brothers , Merrill Lynch and Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) that had even more mortgage - related securities on their balance sheet than did Bear Stearns .
The historic unwind of 2008 had begun .
As has become all too apparent , the problems that overwhelmed Bear Stearns were not unique to that firm - far from it .
Nearly every large firm on Wall Street with a significant capital markets business - Lehman Brothers , Merrill Lynch , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to name several - have been damaged by the still - unfolding crisis .
Still to be determined is the fate of both Citigroup and Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) as independent companies .
As for Cioffi and Tannin , the traders who started the panic , they were indicted in June of 2008 by U.S. Attorney Benton J. Campbell , of the Eastern District of New York , on charges of conspiracy , securities fraud and wire fraud in conjunction with their management of the two Bear Stearns hedge funds from their inception in 2003 to their bankruptcy filing in July 2007 .
Cioffi was also indicted on charges of insider trading related to his decision to move $ 2 million of his own money out of the Enhanced Leverage Fund - without telling investors - into another hedge fund he managed that had , to that point , superior returns .
The indictment also revealed that both Cioffi 's notebook and Tannin 's tablet computer had disappeared after federal authorities had asked for them to be produced .
The indictment alleged that by March 2007 , both Cioffi and Tannin " believed that the [ f ] unds were in grave condition and at risk of collapse .
However , rather than alerting the Funds ' investors and creditors to the bleak prospects of the [ funds ] and facilitating an orderly wind - down , the defendants made misrepresentations to stave off withdrawal of investor funds and increased margin calls from creditors in the ultimately futile hope that the [ f ] unds ' prospects would improve and that the defendants ' incomes and reputations would remain intact . "
On the same day as Cioffi and Tannin were indicted in the Eastern District , the SEC filed civil charges against both men .
If convicted of securities fraud , they face maximum sentences of 20 years of imprisonment .
If convicted of conspiracy , they each face a maximum sentence of five years .
( At press time , there were no further public proceedings in this matter . )
The former senior management of Bear Stearns is faring better than Cioffi and Tannin .
Longtime CEO Jimmy Cayne has retired and is spending the month of March in Australia playing bridge .
Short - lived CEO
Alan Schwartz has had many offers to return to Wall Street at both large and small firms but has opted to continue to work by himself out of a few modest offices provided by Rothschild , the international investment bank , on Sixth Avenue in New York .
( He serves as an advisor to Jeff Bewkes , the CEO of Time Warner , Fortune 's parent company . )
Warren Spector has fielded offers to return to Wall Street , too , but so far has preferred to spend his time as chairman of the board of trustees of The Public Theatre , on Lafayette Street , and on overseeing the renovation of the Greenwich Village townhouse he bought for $ 33 million in November 2006 .
Alone among the former top Bear Stearns ' executives , Ace Greenberg , now 80 years old , sought and received a sinecure from JPMorgan Chase as part of the acquisition .
He works as a broker , managing his own and his few clients ' money .
So should these men share in any blame for what happened to the capital markets in the wake of Bear Stearns ' collapse ?
Former Bear CEO
Alan Schwartz has told friends that he sees their role this way , " These things happen and they 're big , and when they happen everybody tries to look at what happened in the previous six months to find someone or something to blame it on .
But , in truth , it was a team effort .
We all f***ed up .
Government .
Rating agencies .
Wall Street .
Commercial banks .
Regulators .
Investors .
Everybody . "

" Tell me yourself , I challenge you — answer .
Imagine that you are creating a fabric of human destiny with the object of making men happy in the end , giving them peace and rest at last , but that it was essential and inevitable to torture to death only one tiny creature .... and to found that edifice on its unavenged tears : would you consent to be the architect on those conditions ?
Tell me , and tell the truth . ” --
Dostoevsky , The Brothers Karamazov .
[ For a recent American answer to this challenge , see The Karamazov Question . ]
AP tells the harrowing story of the hundreds of children who have been slaughtered -- and the hundreds of thousands more who have been terrorized and traumatized -- by Israel 's " war of choice " on Palestinians in Gaza .
From AP :
Tiny bodies lying side by side wrapped in white burial shrouds .
The cherubic face of a dead preschooler sticking up from the rubble of her home .
A man cradling a wounded boy in a chaotic emergency room after Israel shelled a U.N. school .
Children , who make up more than half of crowded Gaza 's 1.4 million people , are the most defenseless victims of the war between Israel and Hamas .
The Israeli army has unleashed unprecedented force in its campaign against Hamas militants , who have been taking cover among civilians .
" Taking cover among civilians . "
This is a curious locution .
When you launch missiles to kill the democratically elected officials of a government -- especially when you target their private homes -- where else do you expect to find them ?
Gaza is a giant , open - air prison which no one can leave and where , as the story notes , 1.4 million people live in densely - packed urban areas and refugee camps .
Where else are the " Hamas militants " supposed to exist in this seething sardine tin except " among civilians " ?
Naturally , it would be far more convenient if every member of Hamas -- including , again , the democratically elected officials of the government -- painted themselves bright red and gathered in , say , a soccer stadium , where Israel could then drop bombs on them with no muss , no fuss .
But we are dealing with the real world , where human beings of every description , profession , ideology and belief must of necessity live and work in close proximity to one another -- especially in the reconstruction of the Warsaw Ghetto that is Gaza today .
But of course , in order to smuggle the smallest nugget of truth about Gaza into the American media , it must first be larded with huge dollops of mitigating " context " to mask the horrific brutality and naked aggression of the Israeli campaign .
And the " human shield " gambit is the probably the most frequently employed fig leaf by the apologists of oppression .
Curiously enough , I did see a shocking example of the use of human shields in Gaza just the other day , on BBC News .
One of their reporters was " embedded " with a squadron of plucky Israeli soldiers as they made their way through a Gaza neighborhood .
The report showed our heroes taking over the home of a Palestinian family , shunting the house 's large number of refugees -- including several children and infants , crying from hunger -- to a cramped space on the bottom floor , while the Israeli soldiers took up residence on the top floor , where they could rain sniper fire on any nearby " militants " and help coordinate air strikes and missile fire on " militant " hotbeds like schools , ambulances , UN relief trucks -- and other houses packed with refugees who had been directed there by the Israelis themselves .
Naturally , if anyone fired back at the Israelis in the house commandeered in the BBC report , they would hit the civilians who were being held prisoner in their own home .
This use of human shields seems like a highly criminal and deeply immoral act to me ; but then , I 'm not a " serious " person , not like the wise and savvy statesmen and stateswomen of the U.S. Senate , who this week declared their unflagging , uncritical , unquestioning support for Israel 's attack in tones so slavish they would have made Stalin 's Politburo blush .
In any case , after its ritual dip in the cleansing context pool , the AP story marshals fact after fact to hammer home the relentless torture of children in the " shock and awe " operation :
A photo of 4 - year - old Kaukab Al Dayah , just her bloodied head sticking out from the rubble of her home , covered many front pages in the Arab world Wednesday .
" This is Israel , " read the headline in the Egyptian daily Al - Masry Al - Youm .
The preschooler was killed early Tuesday when an F - 16 attacked her family 's four - story home in Gaza City .
Four adults also died .
As many as 257 children have been killed and 1,080 wounded — about a third of the total casualties since Dec. 27 , according to U.N. figures released Thursday .
Hardest on the children is the sense that nowhere is safe and adults can't protect them , said Iyad Sarraj , a psychologist hunkering down in his Gaza City apartment with his four stepchildren , ages 3 - 17 .
His 10 - year - old , Adam , is terrified during bombing raids and has developed asthma attacks , Sarraj said ....
Children have been killed in strikes on their houses , while riding in cars with their parents , while playing in the streets , walking to a grocery and even at U.N. shelters .
Sayed , Mohammed and Raida Abu Aisheh — ages 12 , 8 and 7 — were at home with their parents when they were all killed in an Israeli airstrike before dawn Monday .
The family had remained in the ground floor apartment of their three - story building , while the rest of the extended clan sought refuge in the basement from heavy bombardment of nearby Hamas installations .
Those in the basement survived .
The children 's uncle , Saber Abu Aisheh , 49 , searched Thursday through the rubble , a heap of cement blocks , mattresses , scorched furniture and smashed TVs .
He said Israel gave no warning , unlike two years earlier when he received repeated calls from the Israeli military , including on his cell phone , that a nearby house was going to get hit and that he should evacuate .
" What 's going on is not a war , it 's a mass killing , " said Abu Aisheh , still wearing the blood - splattered olive - colored sweater he wore the night of the airstrike .
Then there is the now - infamous case of the Zeitoun house where four young children were found beside their dead mothers .
They had been there for days while Israeli forces prevented Red Cross workers from reaching them .
As Haaretz reports :
The International Committee of the Red Cross on Thursday accused Israel of delaying ambulance access to the Gaza Strip and demanded it grant safe access for Palestinian Red Crescent ambulances to return to evacuate more wounded .
Relief workers said they found four starving children sitting next to their dead mothers and other corpses in a house in a part of Gaza City bombed by Israeli forces , the Red Cross said on Thursday .
" This is a shocking incident , " said Pierre Wettach , ICRC chief for Israel and the Palestinian territories .
" The Israeli military must have been aware of the situation but did not assist the wounded .
Neither did they make it possible for us or the Palestinian Red Crescent to assist the wounded . "
The agency said it believed Israel had breached international humanitarian law in the incident ...
Palestinian Red Crescent ambulances and ICRC officials managed to reach several houses in the Zeitoun area of Gaza City on Wednesday after seeking access from Israeli military forces since last weekend , the ICRC statement said .
The rescue team " found four small children next to their dead mothers in one of the houses , " the ICRC said .
" They were too weak to stand up on their own .
One man was also found alive , too weak to stand up .
In all there were at least 12 corpses lying on mattresses , " it said .
In another house , the team found 15 survivors of Israeli shelling including several wounded , it said .
Three corpses were found in another home .
Israeli soldiers posted some 80 meters ( yards ) away ordered the rescue team to leave the area which they refused to do , it said .
Back to AP :
Medic Mohammed Azayzeh said he retrieved the bodies of a man and his two young sons from central Gaza on Wednesday .
One of the boys , a 1 - year - old , was cradled in his father 's arms .
In the Jebaliya refugee camp , five sisters from the Balousha family , ages 4 , 8 , 11 , 14 and 17 , were buried together in white shrouds on Dec. 29 .
An Israeli airstrike on a mosque , presumably a Hamas target , had destroyed their adjacent house .
Only their parents and a baby girl survived ....
In the ongoing chaos of Gaza , it 's difficult to get exact casualty figures .
Since Dec. 27 , at least 750 Palestinians have been killed , according to Gaza Health Ministry official Dr. Moawiya Hassanain .
Of those , 257 were children , according to the U.N. 's top humanitarian official , John Holmes , citing Health Ministry figures that he called credible and deeply disturbing .
" We are talking about urban war , " said Abdel - Rahman Ghandour , the Jordan - based spokesman for UNICEF in the Middle East and North Africa .
" The density of the population is so high , it 's bound to hurt children ...
This is a unique conflict , where there is nowhere to go . "
... Sarraj , the psychologist , said he fears for this generation : Having experienced trauma and their parents ' helplessness , they may be more vulnerable to recruitment by militants .

When I wrote about Rush Limbaugh last week , I got hundreds of responses from so - called " dittoheads . "
They assured me that they take him seriously when he asserts his status as the spokesman for American conservatives .
This is ridiculous .
I know conservatism .
I was writing groundbreaking conservative commentary back when Limbaugh was spinning vinyl records .
Limbaugh is no conservative .
So then what is he ?
Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele recently termed him " an entertainer . "
For that , Steele is said to be in danger of losing his job .
But that term seems a bit too polite when you consider what Limbaugh 's really up to .
Consider his relationship with General Motors .
In a 2007 article in Automotive News headlined " General Motors Payola , " writer Mary Connelly told how " General Motors is recruiting many of America 's best known radio personalities -- including Rush Limbaugh , Bill O'Reilly , Laura Schlessinger and Whoopi Goldberg -- to talk up its vehicles on the air . "
The article noted that the company did n't pay the stars directly but advertised on their shows and gave them cars to drive and other favors .
In return , the talkers would plug GM products .
But not during advertisements .
They would do so during the normal course of their on - air patter .
In other words , Limbaugh would go from offering some insight about national politics to saying this :
" GM has a ton of momentum .
They are working hard and they are thinking smart .
Believe in General Motors , folks .
They 're a classic American company doing it all . "
A ton of momentum ?
True .
But it was all going in the wrong direction .
A couple of months before Limbaugh made that statement in July 2007 , I wrote a column about the collapse of the U.S. auto industry .
Chrysler had just been dumped by Daimler - Benz and was headed for bankruptcy , the top industry experts told me .
" The same fate may await Ford and GM , " I wrote .
The reason for the impending demise was obvious to any true conservative .
The Big Three had engaged in a practice that we adherents of the free - market call " captive regulation . "
Instead of competing fairly in the free market for cars , they lobbied Congress to rig the market in favor of the obsolete and inefficient SUVs and trucks they were building .
Why did I get this right while Limbaugh got it wrong ?
Perhaps it 's because the only thing I ever took from a car company was the check I got for working on the assembly line at Ford back when I went to Rutgers .
As a member of the mainstream media , I 'm not permitted to take free stuff or promote products .
Meanwhile radio talkers of all stripes were accepting inducements to push GM products .
The article quotes GM director Sam Mancuso boasting of the 17 national radio talkers whose favors he 'd purchased .
" Radio personalities have unique relationships with their listeners .
They make a real emotional connection .
The audience knows they are being genuine . "
Hmmm , they sound genuine when they 're selling their services .
What does that remind you of ?
Me , too .
Limbaugh may be a hooker with a heart of gold .
But he 's still a hooker .
And that is the category into which all of these radio talkers rightly belong .
Limbaugh loves to deride honest journalists as members of the " drive - by media , " but he 's part of what I like to call " the streetwalker media . "
Not that there 's anything wrong with that .
There 's a reason prostitution is called the world 's oldest profession .
Its services are ever in demand .
But there 's also a reason the Democrats have been so busy promoting Limbaugh as the face of the Republican Party , and it relates directly to the way in which he and the other radio talkers have serviced the party leaders .
As my fellow conservative pundit John Derbyshire notes in a recent article in the American Conservative magazine titled " How Radio Wrecks the Right , " they were complicit in the George W. Bush / Karl Rove strategy that " fixed in the minds of too many Americans that conservatism is always low - brow . "
That strategy turned out to be disastrous .
Intelligent people do not want to be in a party headed by a hefty huckster like Limbaugh .
But the Republicans are stuck with him for now .
This is because of another form of captive regulation .
Since its beginning in 1934 , the Federal Communications Commission has helped a handful of broadcast companies create an artificial monopoly of the airwaves .
Limbaugh can make use of that monopoly power to throw his weight around .
But thanks to the magic of the internet , the free market is finally being restored .
You can get streaming internet radio not just on your home computer but on your car radio if you have the right equipment .
I did so just the other day .
As I was driving down the Parkway , I tuned in Derbyshire 's podcast , " Radio Derb . "
This is the free market at work .
For the first time ever , we will be able to hear genuine conservative intellectuals streaming from our car speakers as we go down the road .
So now we can tell all of those streetwalkers what we should have told them long ago :
Take a hike .
Comments temporarily suspended :
Too many moron perspectives
I 'm sorry but I 'm getting altogether too many comments here that represent what I term " The Moron Perspective , " a complete lack of comprehension of the political spectrum .
So I 'm temporarily suspending comments .
In the interim , please read my comments policy and also Google my name and any issue you desire so you may acquaint yourself with the writings of real conservative as opposed to those who prostitute the idea of conservatism .
Comments now restored .
Dittoheads discouraged from commenting here .
Now that everyone has had a chance to read my comments policy , I 'm sure everyone has seen this section :
" 2 . I can't stand commenters who write , ' You 're not a real conservative . '
If you know of some conservative thinker such as Hobbes , Locke , Burke , Oakeshott et al. , whose views disagree with my own , feel free to quote those views .
Hint : Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity do n't count .
If you see them as conservative thinkers rather than entertainers , this is not the blog for you .
There 's a whole vast Internet specifically designed to appeal to people like you .
I encourage you to find your niche .
It is not here . "
If you are so naive you believe that Rush Limbaugh is a real conservative , please do not comment here .
Instead , call in to his program and ask him whether his proud of doing commercials .
If you get past the screener , then you can comment here and tell us all about it .
Otherwise , please forget this blog exists .
It is going so far over your head that you may break your neck reading it .

Vintage TV spots for long - dead gadget merchants ?
They 're not just goofy , nostalgic , and entertaining -- they 're insaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaane .
Today ’s news that Circuit City , American ’s second - largest electronics retailer , has filed for bankruptcy left me sad .
And , oddly enough , nostalgic .
The City is n’t going out of business , but as I reflected on its woes I thought about all the electronics chains I ’ve shopped at over the years –the vast majority of which are no longer with us .
( If Circuit City were to close its doors , it would leave only Best Buy and RadioShack as truly national chains focused solely on consumer electronics of all sorts , right ? )
Once I got nostalgic , I did what I often do in such situations : I headed to YouTube .
Which is rife with old commercials for defunct electronics retailers .
Many of these chains basically did themselves in through poor management or inability to change with the times , and I thought some of them were shabby even when I did business with them ;
But it ’s fun to get reacquainted with them through the miracle of streaming video .
After the jump , a look back , mostly in chronological order sorted by the year of the chain ’s demise ( click on the year for more details on the circumstances of its death ) .
Highland ( died 1993 )
A deeply moving 1985 minidrama , explaining that you can get your busted turntable fixed right at the store–Highland apparently operated a sort of prehistoric ancestor of the Genius Bar .
Another Highland commercial that –as you ’ll see if you watch it–unquestionably dates from the Cold War era .
Fretters ( died 1996 )
A 1985 ad for this chain , which was so unmemorable that I ’d forgotten it ever existed even though I was once a semi-regular customer .
Silo ( died 1996 )
Fretters also ended up owning one - time Silo .
Same bland personality , except for the farmland - themed name .
Here ’s a 1992 spot .
Incredible Universe ( died 1996 )
Actually , I ’m sorry to say that I could n’t find any Incredible Universe ads on the Web .
But I ’m including it here anyhow , because it ’s gotta be one of the most memorable defunct electronics retailers .
Founded by RadioShack owner Tandy Corporation , its stores were sort of anti-RadioShacks : astoundingly large .
In fact , at 185,000 square feet , they were more than seventy - five times as a large as a Shack .
The VCR aisle went on as far as the eye could see .
Despite being a gadget nut , I found the Universe unnecessarily huge , which was probably a bad sign ; the chain lasted only four years .
But I digress–let ’s get back to commercials .
Lechmere ( died 1997 )
Lechmere had a fabulous reputation for good prices and salespeople who knew their stuff when I was growing up in Boston –before Montgomery Ward bought it and did everything in its power to drive it into the ground .
This ad from 1995 is a good reminder of just how much consumer electronics have changed in recent years :
It features CD players , VCRs , tape - based camcorders , film cameras , and tube TVs , all of which were hot products .
This ad with Patriots coach Bill Parcells dates from around 1996 .
He may have led the Pats to the Super Bowl , but he could n’t save Lechmere–it died in 1997 .
( I still miss it . )
Computer City ( died 1998 )
This chain , also owned by Tandy , was sort of a slightly more pleasant clone of CompUSA , which eventually bought and liquidated it .
Watching this 1990s commercial , I ’m once again struck by how much has changed –remember when computer stores had mammoth sections of CD - ROMs ?

GENEVA ( Reuters ) - Washington ’s “ war on terror ” after the September 11 attacks has eroded human rights worldwide , creating lingering cynicism that the United Nations must now combat , international law experts said on Monday .
The " Tribute in Lights " shines on the skyline of lower Manhattan as the sixth anniversary of the attack on the World Trade Center is observed in New York , September 11 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Gary Hershorn
Mary Robinson , who was the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights when al Qaeda militants flew hijacked planes into the World Trade Center and Pentagon in 2001 , said the United States caused harm with some of the ways it responded .
“ Seven years after 9/11 it is time to take stock and repeal abusive laws and policies , ” the former Irish president said , warning that harsh U.S. detentions and interrogations in Iraq , Afghanistan , and Guantanamo Bay , Cuba gave a dangerous signal to other countries that could easily follow suit .
While new U.S. President Barack Obama has announced he will close Guantanamo to break from the practices of his predecessor George W. Bush , Robinson said sweeping changes needed to take place to ensure Washington abandons its “ war paradigm . ”
“ There has been severe damage and it needs to be addressed , ” she told a news conference in Geneva .
“ We are not more secure .
We are more divided , and people are more cynical about the operation of laws . ”
Arthur Chaskalson , former chief justice of South Africa , said that the United States should launch an inquiry into its counter - terrorism practices , including acts of torture by individual security and intelligence agents .
Although counter - terrorism issues have faded from the front pages since the change of government in Washington , Chaskalson said such practices have shifted around the world and could keep restricting liberties if they are not confronted head - on .
“ We all have less rights today than we had five or 10 years ago , and if nothing happens , we will have even less , ” he told a Geneva briefing to launch an International Commission of Jurists ( ICJ ) report on counter - terrorism and human rights .
ABUSE MONITORING
The report found that many undemocratic states have referred to U.S. counter - terrorism practices to justify their own abuses , a trend Robinson said was particularly alarming .
She called on the U.N. Security Council and Human Rights Council to step up their abuse monitoring and to assist poorer nations with police training to better target rights violators .
Counter - terrorism policies worldwide should also be put under the microscope , according to Robinson .
“ It could warrant a special session of the Human Rights Council , ” she said .
The 47 - member - state body has previously had special sessions on Israel and the Palestinians , Sudan ’s Darfur region , Myanmar , the Democratic Republic of Congo , and high food prices , and will assess the global financial crisis on Friday .
Robinson also questioned the effectiveness of the Council ’s universal periodic review , under which every U.N. member has its rights record assessed on a regular rotation .
“ We have looked at some of the universal periodic reviews of countries that we know from our hearings have severely abused human rights in their counter - terrorism measures , and it is a soft review , there is no accountability , ” she said .
“ There is a necessity now for leadership at the United Nations . ”
Countries recently reviewed by the Council include China , Russia , Germany , Canada , Saudi Arabia , and Mexico .
Hearings for the ICJ report took place in Bogota , Nairobi , Sydney , Belfast , London , Rabat , Washington , Buenos Aires , Jakarta , Moscow , Delhi , Islamabad , Toronto , Ottawa , Jerusalem , Cairo , and Brussels .
I ’ve been a little too busy to read the 647 - page “ stimulus ” bill the House just approved and the Senate is set to consider .
So , for the moment , I must rely on what others , such as the Wall Street Journal , are reporting about this $ 825 billion statute .
Given the gargantuan amount of money being appropriated in this bill , you might think that it certainly must portend a great deal of economic stimulus , especially if you , like most Americans , labor under vulgar Keynesian misconceptions about the effects of government spending — you know , more government spending is always good ( it has a “ multiplier ” effect ) and more government debt is no problem ( we ’ll be dead before our kids and grandkids get saddled with the lion ’s share of the burden of paying off this additional debt , directly or indirectly , and nobody really gives a damn about future generations , right ?
What did they ever do for us ? ) .
Well , those might have been your feelings if you had n’t bothered to look inside this stimulus - sausage factory , to see what ingredients go into the product .
I ca n’t recite all of them here , complete with all of the preservatives and the spices , but some are as follows :
Amtrak , $ 1 billion ; child - care subsidies , $ 2 billion ; National Endowment for the Arts , $ 50 million ; global - warming research , $ 400 million ; carbon - capture demonstration projects , $ 2.4 billion ; digital TV conversion coupons , $ 650 million ; renewable energy funding , $ 8 billion ; mass transit , $ 6 billion ; new cars for the federal government , $ 600 million ; modernizing federal buildings and other facilities , $ 7 billion .
These items are only some of the small potatoes , however .
Note that , in most cases , the amounts given are actually additions to amounts made available elsewhere in the budget .
Bigger - ticket items include : bridge repairs and other highway projects , $ 30 billion ; broadband and electric - grid development , airports , and clean - water projects , $ 40 billion .
Notice that these are the sorts of public - works projects usually implied when the legislation is discussed in general terms , yet they add up to less than 10 percent of the total spending .
Almost a third of the total spending is targeted for income - transfer programs , including : refundable tax credits , $ 82.7 billion ; Medicaid , $ 81 billion ; food stamps , $ 20 billion ; public housing , $ 7.5 billion ; COBRA insurance extension , $ 30.3 billion ; unemployment insurance , $ 36 billion ; and various others .
Education will get $ 66 billion more than it gets elsewhere in the budget .
The motto there : no education bureaucrat or teacher - union member left behind .
Call me old - fashioned , but when I gaze upon all of this booty , I do n’t see stimulus ; I see rip - off .
The Democrats are using the alleged crisis as the pretext for a monumental looting of the taxpayers ( present and future ) in the service of rewarding — whuda thunk ? — the interest groups that put them in power .
All of this comes , of course , close on the heels of the gigantic Republican rip - off of last October ’s bailout bill , by which we peasants were plundered to transfer hundreds of billions of dollars to the owners , managers , and creditors of banks and other financial institutions — all under the pretext , of course , that the impending financial catastrophe meant that “ something had to be done ” at once .
Well , something was damn sure done then , and something even worse is being done now .
The list of beneficiaries from these piratical actions differs , to be sure , but the common denominator remains : ROBBERY — robbery most foul , and on an almost unthinkably grand scale .
A spokesman for the institute , Caree Vander Linden , said an earlier review had located all the germ samples listed in the database .
But she said some “ historical samples ” in institute freezers were not in the database , and the new inventory was intended to identify them so they could be recorded and preserved , or destroyed if they no longer had scientific value .
One scientist , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment , said samples from completed projects were not always destroyed , and departing scientists sometimes left behind vials whose contents were unknown to colleagues .
He said the Army ’s recordkeeping and security were imperfect but better than procedures at most universities , where research on biological pathogens has expanded rapidly since 2001 .
The suspension will interrupt dozens of research projects at the institute , whose task is to develop vaccines , drugs and other measures to protect American troops from germ attacks and disease outbreaks .
Ms. Vander Linden said some critical experiments involving animals  often used to test vaccines and drugs  would not be halted .
News of the suspension , first reported Monday by the Science magazine blog ScienceInsider , comes as the Justice Department has been interviewing scientists at the Army institute to prepare the government ’s legal defense against a lawsuit filed by the family of Robert Stevens , the Florida tabloid photography editor who was the first to die in the 2001 letter attacks .
That lawsuit , filed in 2003 and delayed by the government ’s unsuccessful efforts to have it dismissed , accuses officials of failing to assure that anthrax bacteria at Fort Detrick and other government laboratories were securely stored .
Dr. Ivins was not suspected in the attacks at that time , but the F.B.I. ’s conclusion last year added new weight to the lawsuit ’s claims .
As old media races to catch up with the Web and figure out how to successfully monetize print content online , one publication is taking a drastically different approach : web to print .
The Printed Blog , a startup founded and funded by former business productivity software entrepreneur Joshua Karp , is launching a twice - daily free print newspaper in cities across the country aggregating localized blog posts .
“ Why has n’t anyone tried to take the best content and bring it offline ? ” said Karp , who thinks print media is far from dying .
“ [ For ] people around the world , who need to and want to consume information , whether it be in developing countries or emerging countries , newsprint is still going to be a main mechanism for information for years to come , ” he said .
The hope is that the hyperlocal content will attract local advertisers who can spend less to reach out to their target audience .
Ads are relatively cheap in comparison ( $ 15 - $ 25 ) and the paper has already lined up a number of Chicago - based businesses for its debut .
It will also host classified ads .
The first issue is expected to launch on Jan. 27 , handed out at three CTA stations around Lincoln Park and Wicker Park in Chicago and one location in San Francisco .
A New York edition is due out shortly .
While the cost of printing alone – not to mention two issues a day – seems daunting , Karp says he would surprised if he spends more than 15 thousand dollars on the entire production and distribution of the first paper .
There are currently nine people on staff , mostly unpaid interns .
The printing is done on commercial printers located near each distribution point .
Each 11x17 - inch paper will be three pages , six sides in full color .
And the ultimate goal is to automate the production process as far as aggregating the stories into the separate editions , with the ability for readers to vote on which blogs appear in the next issue .
They ’ve been actively reaching out in preparation for launch on various social networks , including Twitter and Flickr and will incorporate them into the feedback and voting process .
It ’s sort of a Current TV model for print news .
Some bloggers – without betraying a hint of irony – have denied the paper of the right to republish their posts , but Karp says the overall response has been positive .
What blogger or photographer would turn down an offer for more exposure , especially in the confines of a luxurious printed page ?
“ We ’re not necessarily looking for the people who have a readership , we ’re looking for compelling content in a variety of areas , ” said Karp .
“ The person who ’s an industry expert , the person who worked for a campaign and is blogging about it , the person who has some insight into our financial system , the person who has been a principal at a high school and has something to say about education . ”
Karp admits
The Printed Blog is an experiment for now , but he is optimistic in its success and with the low production costs it is n’t much of a risk .
With old media struggling to stay afloat , any experimentation with new business models is better than doing nothing .

Or I ’m about to witness the greatest advance in electrical science in a hundred years .
Maybe both .

Either way , all I can think of is my electrician , Billy Sullivan .
Sullivan has 11 tattoos and a voice marinated in Jack Daniels .
During my recent home renovation , he roared at me when I got too close to his open electrical panel : “ I ’m the Juice Man ! ” he shouted .
“ Stay the hell away from my juice ! ”
He was right .
Only gods mess with electrons .
Only a fool would shoot them into the air .
And yet , I ’m in a conference room with a scientist who is going to let 120 volts fly out of the wall , on purpose .
“ Do n’t worry , ” says the MIT assistant professor and a 2008 MacArthur genius - grant winner , Marin Soljacic ( pronounced SOLE - ya - cheech ) , who designed the box he ’s about to turn on .
“ You will be okay . ”
We both shift our gaze to an unplugged Toshiba television set sitting 5 feet away on a folding table .
He ’s got to be kidding :
There is no power cord attached to it .
It ’s off .
Dark .
Silent .
“ You ready ? ” he asks .
If Soljacic is correct — if his free - range electrons can power up this untethered TV from across a room — he will have performed a feat of physics so subtle and so profound it could change the world .
It could also make him a billionaire .
I hold my breath and cover my crotch .
Soljacic flips the switch .
Soljacic is n’t the first man to try to power distant electronic devices by sending electrons through the air .
He is n’t even the first man from the Balkans to try .
Most agree that Serbian inventor Nikola Tesla , who went on to father many of the inventions that define the modern electronic era , was the first to let electrons off their leash , in 1890 .

Tesla based his wireless electricity idea on a concept known as electromagnetic induction , which was discovered by Michael Faraday in 1831 and holds that electric current flowing through one wire can induce current to flow in another wire , nearby .
To illustrate that principle , Tesla built two huge “ World Power ” towers that would broadcast current into the American air , to be received remotely by electrical devices around the globe .
Few believed it could work .
And to be fair to the doubters , it did n’t , exactly .
When Tesla first switched on his 200 - foot - tall , 1,000,000 - volt Colorado Springs tower , 130 - foot - long bolts of electricity shot out of it , sparks leaped up at the toes of passersby , and the grass around the lab glowed blue .
It was too much , too soon .
But strap on your rubber boots ; Tesla ’s dream has come true .
After more than 100 years of dashed hopes , several companies are coming to market with technologies that can safely transmit power through the air — a breakthrough that portends the literal and figurative untethering of our electronic age .
Until this development , after all , the phrase “ mobile electronics ” has been a lie :
How portable is your laptop if it has to feed every four hours , like an embryo , through a cord ?
How mobile is your phone if it shuts down after too long away from a plug ?
And how flexible is your business if your production area ca n’t shift because you can’t move the ceiling lights ?
The world is about to be cured of its attachment disorder .
WIRELESS JUICE : A PRIMER TECH 1 : Inductive Coupling
Availability : April
advertisement
>> THE FIRST WIRELESS POWERING SYSTEM to market is an inductive device , much like the one Tesla saw in his dreams , but a lot smaller .
It looks like a mouse pad and can send power through the air , over a distance of up to a few inches .
A powered coil inside that pad creates a magnetic field , which as Faraday predicted , induces current to flow through a small secondary coil that ’s built into any portable device , such as a flashlight , a phone , or a BlackBerry .
The electrical current that then flows in that secondary coil charges the device ’s onboard rechargeable battery .
( That iPhone in your pocket has yet to be outfitted with this tiny coil , but , as we ’ll see , a number of companies are about to introduce products that are . )
The practical benefit of this approach is huge .
You can drop any number of devices on the charging pad , and they will recharge — wirelessly .
No more tangle of power cables or jumble of charging stations .
What ’s more , because you are invisible to the magnetic fields created by the system , no electricity will flow into you if you stray between device and pad .
Nor are there any exposed “ hot ” metal connections .
And the pads are smart :
Their built - in coils are driven by integrated circuits , which know if the device sitting on them is authorized to receive power , or if it needs power at all .
So you wo n’t charge your car keys .
Or overcharge your flashlight .
The dominant player in this technology for the moment seems to be Michigan - based Fulton Innovation , which unveiled its first set of wirelessly charged consumer products at the Consumer Electronics
Show early this year .
Come April , Fulton ’s new pad - based eCoupled system will be available to police , fire - and - rescue , and contractor fleets — an initial market of as many as 700,000 vehicles annually .
The system is being integrated into a truck console designed and produced by Leggett & Platt , a $ 4.3 billion commercial shelving giant ; it allows users to charge anything from a compatible rechargeable flashlight to a PDA .
The tools and other devices now in the pipeline at companies such as Bosch , Energizer , and others will look just like their conventional ancestors .
Companies such as Philips Electronics , Olympus , and Logitech will create a standard for products , from flashlights to drills to cell phones to TV remotes , by the end of this year .
TECH 2 : Radio - frequency Harvesting
Availability : April >>
THE INDUCTION SYSTEMS are only the beginning .
Some of the most visually arresting examples of wireless electricity are based on what ’s known as radio frequency , or RF .
While less efficient , they work across distances of up to 85 feet .
In these systems , electricity is transformed into radio waves , which are transmitted across a room , then received by so - called power harvesters and translated back into low - voltage direct current .
Imagine smoke detectors or clocks that never need their batteries replaced .
Sound trivial ?
Consider : Last November , to save on labor costs , General Motors canceled the regularly scheduled battery replacement in the 562 wall clocks at its Milford Proving Ground headquarters .
This technology is already being used by the Department of Defense .
This year , it will be available to consumers in the form of a few small appliances and wireless sensors ; down the road , it will appear in wireless boxes into which you can toss any and all of your electronics for recharging .
TECH 3 : Magnetically Coupled Resonance
Availability : 12 -18 months

>> INVENTED BY MIT ’S SOLJACIC ( who has dubbed it WiTricity ) , the technique can power an entire room , assuming the room is filled with enabled devices .
Though WiTricity uses two coils — one powered , one not , just like eCoupled ’s system — it differs radically in the following way : Soljacic ’s coils do n’t have to be close to each other to transfer energy .
Instead , they depend on so - called magnetic resonance .
Like acoustical resonance , which allows an opera singer to break a glass across the room by vibrating it with the correct frequency of her voice ’s sound waves , magnetic resonance can launch an energetic response in something far away .
In this case , the response is the flow of electricity out of the receiving coil and into the device to which it ’s connected .
The only caveat is that receiving coil must be properly “ tuned ” to match the powered coil , in the way that plucking a D string on any tuned piano will set all the D strings to vibrating , but leave all other notes still and silent .
( This explains why Soljacic considers the machinery that create these frequencies , and the shape of the coils , top secret . )
Importantly , then , WiTricity does n’t depend on line - of - sight .
A powered coil in your basement could power the rest of the house , wirelessly .
Will the cat be okay ?
“ Biological organisms are invisible to , and unaffected by , a magnetic field , ” Soljacic says .
While I am mulling that statement , he tells me the company will not yet reveal the name of its partners because those partnerships have n’t been formalized , but they include major consumer electronics brands and some U.S. defense customers .
As has been the tradition since Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison angrily parted ways in 1885 , the enormous consumer demand for wireless electricity is begetting intense competition .
Last November , a consortium of manufacturers coalesced around Fulton ’s eCoupled system .
But Fulton and WiTricity are n’t the only companies fighting to bring wireless electricity to market .
WiPower , in Altamonte Springs , Florida , has also created an induction system and says it , too , is close to announcing partnerships .
And Pittsburgh - based Powercast , an RF system , sells wireless Christmas ornaments and is testing industrial sensors for release this summer .
Just as Tesla derided his doubters as “ nothing more than microbes of a nasty disease , ” some name - calling is inevitable in this increasingly heated battle .
WiPower , for example , insists that the eCoupled technology approach has several problems .
“ Their system is very sensitive to alignment , and I ’ve heard there ’s a heating issue , ” says CEO Ryan Tseng .
“ Our system is more elegant , much less expensive , and easier for manufacturers to integrate . ”
Meanwhile , Powercast calls Dave Baarman , Fulton Innovation ’s director of advanced technologies , “ irresponsible ” for wondering aloud whether RF power solutions could be dangerous around pacemakers and powered wheelchairs .
“ It ’s competitive drivel , ” says Steve Day , Powercast ’s VP of marketing and strategic planning .
“ Baarman has been saying this for a couple of years , because what we do will eventually replace what he does . ”
But as I stand , covering myself , in that featureless suburban conference room , such bickering fades to background noise .
Because with Tesla ’s 100 - foot - long lightning bolts and blue grass vivid in my mind , I have a big question : Will Soljacic , the MacArthur Foundation fellow , be able to turn on that Toshiba TV from across the room ?
Or will I be bathed in a magnetic field so intense my molecules all align to face true north ?
After he flips the switch , the little television , 5 feet away , springs to life .
Wirelessly .
The DVD player inside spins up to a low whine .
Colors flicker on the moving screen .
And Soljacic ’s eyes dance with the reflected light of the image .

Chimp used planning skills to attack humans Agence France - Presse
Published : Tuesday March 10 , 2009
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP ) - A scientist who watched a rock - throwing chimpanzee gather an arsenal to use against zoo visitors said his research could prove primates prepare for the future in a similar way to humans .
Over the course of a decade researcher Mathias Osvath said he watched Santino , a male chimpanzee , calmly collect stones and fashion concrete discs before visitors arrived each day at a Swedish zoo .
Later , the chimp would hurl the rocks across a moat toward onlookers .
According to correspondence published in Monday 's edition of Current Biology , zoo minders uncovered hundreds of stone caches in Santino 's enclosure .
They decided to stake out the enclosure to get a better idea of the chimp 's behavior .
" On five consecutive days , before the zoo opened , the chimpanzee gathered stones from the water and placed them in caches , " wrote Osvath , a Lund University researcher .
" Later on each of these days , the stones were used as ammunition . "
Apparently dissatisfied with the ammunition on hand , Santino then began to craft his own .
" The chimpanzee was observed to gently knock on the concrete rocks , from time to time delivering harder blows to break off the detached surface section in discoidal pieces .
" These manufactured missiles were often transported to the caches at the shoreline . "
Osvath said that Santino was " without exception " calm when gathering or manufacturing his ammunition , " in contrast to the typically aroused state " during displays .
" These observations convincingly show that our fellow apes do consider the future in a very complex way , " he said .
" It implies that they have a highly developed consciousness , including life - like mental simulations of potential events .
They most probably have an ' inner world ' like we have when reviewing past episodes of our lives , " Osvath added .
" When wild chimps collect stones or go out to war , they probably plan this in advance .
I would guess that they plan much of their everyday behavior . "

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
Stocks finally broke out of their doldrums Tuesday as hopes that banks were finding their feet took the Dow Jones Industrial Average up more than 375 points for its biggest gain since November .
Investors were encouraged on multiple fronts : assurances that the financial system was under improvement from U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke , word that Citigroup was profitable by one measure in the first two months of 2009 and hints at reinstatement of a short - selling restriction .
Still , similar sharp rallies in September , October and November turned out to be fleeting , and the market has still not had two gaining sessions since Feb. 5 and Feb . 6 .
" This kind of broad - based move is encouraging , but the question becomes , will it be sustained ?
At this point , it certainly feels that way , " said Gordon Charlop , managing director at Rosenblatt Securities .
Traders pointed to comments from U.S. Rep. Barney Frank , D - Mass. , chairman of the House of Representatives ' Financial Services Committee , who said he expects the " uptick rule " - used to require investors to wait until a company 's stock rises before it could be sold short - to be restored within about one month .
If reintroduced , the rule will serve as a stabilizer of the market " because people can't pile on a stock all at once , " said Dave Rovelli , managing director of U.S. equity trading at Canaccord Adams .
Still , the rule is n't going to prevent failing companies from going down under , Rovelli noted .
The Dow industrials closed up 379.44 points , or 5.8 % , at 6926.49 , marking its biggest percentage gain since Nov. 21 and closing at its highest level since Feb. 27 .
Gains were paced by shares of Citigroup , which jumped 38 % to $ 1.45 after Chief Executive Vikram Pandit , in an internal memo , said the company was profitable during the first two months of the year , before taxes and set - aside for problem loans .
Also , Bank of America rose 28 % to $ 4.79 .
Fellow Dow component General Electric tacked on 20 % to $ 8.87 as its finance arm sold $ 8 billion of guaranteed bank notes via the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . 's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program , which helped reduce the cost of insuring debt .
Still , some uncertainty was showing in the credit markets as the cost to insure General Electric Capital Corp .'s senior bonds swung right back into distressed territory almost immediately after moving to more reasonable levels .
Fred Dickson , market strategist at D.A. Davidson , said that " until we get stability in the credit markets , I think we 'll see little relief rallies and short - covering ( in stocks ) , but do n't see a sustainable rally . "
Setting the tone for the session was Bernanke 's speech to the Council on Foreign Relations , in which he said it was important to address the valuation of illiquid assets .
He said he would n't support suspension of " mark to market " rules .
Still , banks are looking for any leeway in accounting for illiquid - often called toxic - assets such as mortgage bonds , and investors in banks were encouraged by Bernanke 's statement .
" Bernanke said the magic words , that the Fed was considering looking at accounting standards , " Dickson said .
The Fed chairman also signaled it is n't too early to consider longer - term reforms including - in the U.S. - putting responsibility for addressing possible systemic risks with one authority , such as the Fed .
" The systemic risk regulator probably was not a surprise but it was the first time we heard that explicitly stated .
I think the market was waiting for some kind of comprehensive policy statement from the Fed , and this is the closest we 've come , " Dickson said .
The broad Standard & Poor 's 500 rose 43.07 points , or 6.37 % , to 719.6 , its highest close of the month and biggest gain since November .
The Nasdaq Composite gained 89.64 , or 7.07 % , to 1358.28 , its biggest gain since Oct. 28 .
The Financial Select Sector SPDR
Fund , a basket of banks and lenders , closed up nearly 15 % at 7.19 .
On the economic data front , U.S. wholesalers cut inventories in January , but sales are falling faster than stock levels , suggesting a further drawdown is needed , perhaps weighing on the slumping economy even more .
Those economic fears weighed on some commodities : Oil futures closed 2.9 % lower at $ 45.71 a barrel .
As I mentioned over the weekend , I ’ve seen a lot of Republicans on TV complaining that spending programs that demonstrably do create jobs do not create jobs , like buying new and more energy efficient vehicles for government workforces , etc .
But where I ’ve really seen the press dropping the ball is doing some simple arithmetic on the spending items Republicans say constitute the wasteful spending in the bill .
Now , the tell in my eyes is that almost all the criticisms I ’ve heard are about budget items in the millions .
And when you ’re talking about a bill with over $ 800 billion in spending , you just have a hard time getting to any substantial percentage of the total spend with such relatively small items .
Now , here ’s a representative list from Rep. LoBiondo ( R ) of New Jersey …
$ 1.9 billion for high - level physics research ; $ 1.5 billion for universities to improve their biomedical research programs ; $ 600 million for the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) to purchase new satellites to improve weather forecasts ; $ 600 million to buy new cars for federal government workers , adding to the existing inventory of 640,000 vehicles ; and , $ 335 million for education and prevention programs regarding sexually transmitted diseases .
Separate criticism has been directed at $ 75 million for smoking cessation plan .
Set aside whether you think these line items are worthwhile .
( And it seems obvious to me that it ’s good for the economy to buy more vehicles for the government fleet , when our auto industry is cratering and demand for cars is flatlining . )
But just add those up and you get a total — $ 3.51 5.01 Billion — out of $ 819 Billion .
The pretty simple fact here is that the Republicans are not willing or able to criticize any of the substantial amounts of spending in this bill .
They ’re focused on a few tiny parts of it .
And too few people are pointing out that these amount to maybe one or two percent of the program total .
Obama believes that the way to get out of an economic toxic disaster caused by too much government spending and debt , is to spend more and go further into debt .
Interesting logic .
The Republican Party is n't the party of the rich .
It 's the party of every American who wants to be rich .
We 're into our second year of " stimulus plans , " and they all seem to feature the same logic :
If the government spends more money ( provided it spends that money " right " ) , the economy will improve .
To quote Wayne Allyn Root , the Libertarian Party 's 2008 vice - presidential nominee and one of my opponents for the party 's 2012 presidential nomination :
Of course , that logic does n't just thrive on the Democratic side of the aisle .
Last year 's " stimulus " -- mailing out tax " rebates " financed not by cuts in government spending but by additional government debt -- went forward with considerable Republican support .
We 've got to get past the notion that government is the engine driving the economy .
It is n't now , and it never has been .
FDR 's New Deal -- which Obama's " public works " plan echoes -- probably added at least five years or more to the Great Depression .
Hopefully we 're not counting on another world war to pull our fat out of this fire .
Wayne Root and I agree on a lot of things , including the necessary foundation of a real " stimulus " program and a real economic recovery -- reducing the expense , not increasing the spending power , of government .
We agree on some of the details , too .
For example , I wholeheartedly support Wayne 's call for a 2009 income tax " holiday . "
As a matter of fact , I worked with 2008 pre-nomination presidential candidate Steve Kubby to craft and promote such a " holiday " last year .
On other details we disagree , and I want to explore that disagreement .
But first , a disclaimer : I do n't oppose any of Root 's suggestions for tax cuts .
I 've never met a tax cut I did n't like .
When Root advocates cutting capital gains taxes , offering business tax credits for new hires , flattening taxes to lower rates , etc. , I can only say " yeah !
Cut , cut , cut !
" That said , if we are going to select only some tax cuts from the menu of all possible tax cuts ( instead of just ending taxation , which I 'd do if I could snap my fingers and make it so ) , I do disagree with Root 's argument for cutting " from the top down . "
His tax cuts are concentrated on the " supply side , " and his " flat tax " proposal is even specifically and intentionally " regressive " ( your rate goes down as your income goes up ) .
I prefer a " bottom up " tax - cutting regimen which provides a tax cut for all Americans .
If we stick to the current rate regime , that tax cut gets proportionally smaller as income increases , but everyone gets a cut .
I support two mechanisms for achieving this cut :- Adopting a regular annual increase to the personal exemption from the income tax .
Every year , every American will be able to make more money before any of it is taxed , and some of the poorest Americans will fall off the tax rolls altogether . -
Applying that personal exemption to FICA -- Social Security and Medicare -- payroll taxes .
Once again , every American will get that tax cut , although it will constitute a proportionally smaller percentage of their incomes as those incomes go up .
In support of this plan , I 'm going to quote -- or at least paraphrase -- Wayne Allyn Root himself .
In his book Millionaire Republican , Root ( who , when he wrote it , was a Republican ) characterized his party as follows : That may be a paraphrase , because I can't find my copy of the book at the moment ( I believe it 's out on loan ) .
But whether the quote is exact or not , I believe that it's an accurate statement of what Wayne was trying to convey .
I also assume that the statement reflected one of the positive things he saw , or wanted to see , in the Republican Party at that time ... and that he considers it even more true of the Libertarian Party , which he joined not too long after writing it .
Cut taxes for the rich ?
Sure .
No problem -- if we can cut all taxes .
But if we can only cut some taxes , and that 's probably the political reality , cut them for those who are trying to get rich , or at least richer .
There are a lot more of them , and I love the word " more " -- the phrase " more votes for Libertarian candidates " has a very musical ring , does n't it ?
If we cut the capital gains tax , Bill Gates gets a tax cut , and Bob flipping burgers down at McDonald 's does n't .
If we increase the personal exemption , Bill Gates gets a tax cut , and so does Bob .
Thing is , for every Bill there are a hundred or a thousand Bobs .
Bill 's already rich .
Bob 's trying to get rich , or at least richer .
If I could only cut taxes on one of them , it would be on Bob .
Call it " class warfare " if you like , and I wo n't argue with you .
The fact is that more Americans consider themselves " middle class , " or even " poor , " than consider themselves " rich . "
When they hear ( or think they hear ) " tax cuts for the rich , " that translates to them as " tax cuts for ... NOT ME . "
As we get about the business of leaving people 's money in their own pockets , the more people we do that for the better .
Especially when Election Day comes around .
" Supply siders " argue that tax cuts on what one might call the " entrepreneurial class " produce economic growth because the additional wealth remaining in that class 's pockets gets invested in enterprises which create jobs .
That may be true as far as it goes , but I do n't see that it 's a one - sided truth .
Money left in the pockets of the " non-entrepreneurial class " gets spent .
It represents economic demand , and that demand is diffuse enough that it probably provides more accurate information to the " supply side " versus the guesses of a smaller number of entrepreneurs with a few more dollars in pocket to spend on testing those guesses .
Instead of hoping that those entrepreneurs guess correctly and create wealth which then " trickles down , " why not let the market determine to whom wealth " trickles up ? "
And since we 're going to run into " class warfare " considerations , why not be like God and come down on the side with the most battalions when we can do so consistently with our principles ?
Scarlet Fever , the disease which killed thousands during the 19th century , is making a comeback , public health specialists have warned .
Almost 3,000 cases of the disease were recorded in 2008 in England and Wales , the highest number for a decade , and there are fears its virulence may be increasing .
The Health Protection Agency has launched a programme of " enhanced surveillance " to monitor infections and spot any unusual features that could signal a change in the disease .
Winter is the peak season for scarlet fever but the increase seen in the past two months is " above that seasonally expected " , according to the HPA .
Alerts have been issued to regional health protection staff and consultant microbiologists .
A letter has also been prepared for circulation to hospital emergency wards and GP surgeries warning them to be alert .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Scarlet fever , also known as Scarletina , is caused by a bacterium , Group A Streptococcus , which is the most common cause of bacterial sore throat ( " strep throat " ) .
Symptoms of scarlet fever usually include a sore throat , fever and swollen glands .
Most cases are easily treated with antibiotics .
In rare cases the disease can lead to pneumonia , throat abscess , sinusitis and meningitis .
In severe cases , the bacteria may become invasive , causing necrotising fasciitis ( the " flesh eating " bug ) , septicaemia and toxic shock syndrome .
An increase in cases of invasive strep A is of particular concern because it can be deadly , killing up to one in four of those diagnosed .
The risk is highest in those already seriously ill with reduced immunity , but also depends on the type of infection and the strain .
Scarlet fever caused devastating epidemics through the 19th and early 20th centuries , and killed almost5 per cent of those infected in 1914 .
Sufferers were isolated for weeks and their clothes and bedding burnt to prevent contagion .
Over the past century , the number of cases and virulence of the infection has declined for reasons not fully understood .
Experts say the disease follows a cycle , rising and falling roughly every four years and that is mirrored by a rise and fall of the more deadly invasive variant .
Cases have hovered between 1,600 and 2,500 over the past decade but rose to 2,913 last year .
Theresa Lamagni and colleagues from the HPA say in the journal Eurosurveillance : " It is possible the significant influenza activity this winter may be contributing by increasing transmission ... and / or rendering individuals with influenza more susceptible ... "
The disease may also be becoming more severe .
The authors note that no unusual strains have been identified but the number of infectious caused by one of the more dangerous strains is suspected to have risen .
Case Study : I could not breathe ...'
* Ed Gyde , 40 , spent a week in hospital with pneumonia after he caught scarlet fever earlier this year .
The chief executive of Audience PR , a communications consultancy , caught the infection from his three - year - old son , James , and was eventually in hospital being administered with intravenous antibiotics , oxygen , and asthma inhalers .
" It was a horrendous experience .
My skin was like sandpaper .
It was as if my body had been taken over , " he said .
The disease struck the family after their return from a holiday .
James escaped with a mild infection , but his father was not so lucky .
" For five or six days I was unable to sleep with the cough and fever .
Then my skin peeled off as if I had very bad sunburn ... I was coughing , thirsty and weak and could n't breathe . "

Star gazing and looking up to the skies has been going on since the beginning of man .
Wondering what is out there .
Wondering what is that point of light and what could be there .
This is called astronomy .
Here on Earth we can see the stars of our own galaxy , the Milky Way galaxy , and it ’s hard to realize just how big our own galaxy is .
And there are thousands more galaxies out there in the universe .
With the naked eye on a clear night you can also see a neighboring galaxy called Andromeda , it will appear as a white puff .
You can also see planets , thousands of stars , meteors , nebulas , the aurora and star clusters .
With a telescope you can see more of these .
A hobby such as astronomy can turn into a lifelong hobby or a career in astronomy , radio astronomy or even to the point of flying and working in outer space .
What to Look for with Beginning Astronomy
You can start enjoying astronomy by looking at the night sky with unaided eyes , there is a lot to see without the aid of a telescope .
There is the moon to look at it , and all its craters and phases .
On nights where there is no moon , the entire night sky and all its stars are much brighter .
Planets .
Look for the planets that are visible for the time of year it is .
There are all kinds of star charts and guides that will tell you where to look .
There are five planets that are visible with the naked eye at the right time .
They are Mercury , Venus , Mars , Jupiter and Saturn .
Venus is usually the brightest of the planets .
How do you know if you ’re looking at a planet or a star , a general rule of thumb is that if it is twinkling then it is a star .
Constellations have been guiding travelers for thousands of years .
By knowing the constellations and the stars , travelers have known where they are from looking at the night sky .
Constellations have names of historic legends , animals and objects .
Learning the constellations is a great way to learn about the night sky and the stars names .
The big dipper is a part of the constellation Ursa Major or the The Great Bear .
Interestingly , the flag of Alaska has the Big Dipper on it .
Stars , a star is what our sun is .
Stars are different colors and many light years away .
A light year is equal to 5.9 trillion miles , the amount of time it takes light to travel in one year .
Actually , when you look at stars , you are also looking back in time .
The light you see from a distant sun started many years ago .
With the Hubble telescope now , we can look back in time to almost the big bang .
The more notable and colorful stars are the bright blue Rigel and the bright red Betelgeuse in the constellation Orion .
Meteors are tiny bits of rock that enters the Earths atmosphere and burns up .
Meteor showers happen at certain times of the year when the Earth passes through a known debris cloud of these bits of dust of rock forming a meteor shower , when a meteor shower is very intense , it is known as a meteor storm .
These storms can sometimes be predicted , but often times they are a surprise .
A well known meteor storm was the Leonid meteor shower in 1966 .
On any night there is the chance to see a meteor .
Aurora Borealis or northern lights ( in the southern hemisphere they are called the aurora australis ) are a beautiful sight .
This occurs when particles from the sun hit the Earths magnetic field and get charged and then they start to glow .
They occur at any time of the year but seem more prevalent during the fall and spring .
When there is an intense aurora they can be seen as far south as the southern US .
Galaxies can be seen by the naked eye .
Andromeda is the most common galaxy to see , at times you can also see the Pinwheel , M31 , M82 , M33 and other galaxies .
Great time lapse of the Milky Way rising .

Nebulas are clouds of gas that can also be seen .
Maybe the most famous is the Crab nebula , which has been written about as far back 1054 .
This nebula started as a star went supernova .
Comets are referred to as dirty snowballs , they are ice and at the center is rock .
As they move towards the sun , they start to melt and you can see their tails blowing away from the sun .
Usually you ca n’t see comets with the naked eye , but sometimes like in the mid 1990s you can when comet Hale Bopp came by the Earth .
Tools for Beginning Astronomy
Telescopes , once you have explored the sky with the unaided eye , you will want to get a telescope .
Meade and Celestron are probably the most popular brands at this time .
With a telescope you can see the rings of Saturn most times , some of the moons of Jupiter and the bands of color in the Jupiter atmosphere , the craters and shadows on the moon , more galaxies , star clusters , asteroids and more nebulas like the Orion , Lagoon , Swan and the Ring nebula
Before you get your own telescope , there might be planetariums or observatories in your town you can go to .
Of course their telescopes will most likely be more powerful then one you use in your backyard , but there is plenty to see and look for as an amateur astronomer and your own telescope .
Also look in your town for local astronomy clubs who can help you with your new hobby .
In using some online star charts , you will need to know your latitude and longitude , I included a good web site to find your own .

CBS News says Michael Brown rehired as FEMA consultant RAW STORY Click here for CBS video clip CBS News ' Bob Schieffer just announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has rehired ex-FEMA chief Michael Brown -- as a consultant to evaluate the agency 's response to the disaster !
From CBS 's Katrina blog : " Sept. 26 , 2005 /6:44 p.m. ( CBS ) — CBS
News correspondent Gloria Borger reports that Michael Brown , who recently resigned as the head of the FEMA , has been rehired by the agency as a consultant to evaluate it's [ sic ] response following Hurricane Katrina . "

CBS says they 've confirmed Brown had been rehired .
Brown resigned after taking heat when a Time Magazine article revealed that he had padded his resume with bogus jobs .
The Associated Press , however , tells the story differently : " Brown is continuing to work at the Federal Emergency Management Agency at full pay , with his Sept. 12 resignation not taking effect for two more weeks , said Homeland Security Department spokesman Russ Knocke . "
Late Monday evening , CBS contacted Knocke , and then published a story on their Website , which is co-credited to the Associated Press , that clarified Brown 's current employment status with FEMA : CBS News correspondent Gloria Borger reports that Knocke told her that technically Brown remains at FEMA as a " contractor " and he is " transitioning out of his job . "
The reason he will remain at FEMA about a month after his resignation , said the spokesman , is that the agency wants to get the " proper download of his experience . "
During that time , Brown will advise the department on " some of his views on his experience with Katrina , " as he transitions out of his job , Knocke told the Associated Press .
Brown had been shopping his resume in Washington .
Wrote U.S. News ' Washington
Whispers last week : " Ex-FEMA Administrator Michael Brown seems to be doing for his career what he did for the beleaguered agency .
Less than a week after FEMA 's dismal Hurricane Katrina response forced Brown out of the agency , he has been shopping his resume to headhunters and Washington PR firms .
And it 's not working .
" He 's radioactive , " said one exec .
An ally of Brownie in the PR world said he should have waited a month before starting his job hunt .
" It 's just a bad play . "
