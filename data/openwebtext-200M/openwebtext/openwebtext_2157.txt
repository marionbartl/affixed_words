Six in 10 think it ’s a good idea to meet with president of Iran
PRINCETON , NJ -- Large majorities of Democrats and independents , and even about half of Republicans , believe the president of the United States should meet with the leaders of countries that are considered enemies of the United States .
Overall , 67 % of Americans say this kind of diplomacy is a good idea .
This is according to a Gallup Panel survey of a representative national sample of 1,013 Americans , conducted May 19 - 21 .
Although separate Gallup polling shows that few Americans view Iran favorably , and that Iran leads Americans ' list of top U.S. enemies in the world , the new Gallup survey also finds high public support for presidential - level meetings between the United States and Iran , specifically .
About 6 in 10 Americans ( 59 % ) think it would be a good idea for the president of the United States to meet with the president of Iran .
This includes about half of Republicans , a majority of independents , and most Democrats .
Both positions enjoy broad popular appeal , with majorities of men , women , younger and older Americans , and those from different regions of the country all saying direct presidential - level talks with Iran and other enemies are a good idea .
The issue of using presidential diplomacy with U.S. enemies distinguishes Barack Obama from the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , John McCain , and even from his opponent for the Democratic nomination , Hillary Clinton .
Obama is the only one of the three who has said he would personally meet with the leaders of countries like Iran , Syria , Cuba , and Venezuela as president , and he recently defended his position by saying " strong countries and strong presidents talk to their adversaries . "
Clinton has criticized Obama 's approach as " naïve , " and McCain has been unrelenting in his attacks on the issue , accusing Obama of being dangerously inexperienced and having " reckless judgment . "
Bottom Line
McCain may eventually persuade more Americans that there is nothing for the president of the United States to discuss with hostile foreign leaders like Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , and that to do so only undermines U.S. efforts to destabilize such regimes .
However , for now , whether it's the leader of an " enemy " country , generally , or the president of Iran , specifically , Americans think it 's a good idea for the president of the United States to meet directly with the nation 's adversaries .
Survey Methods
Results for this Gallup Panel study are based on telephone interviews with 1,013 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted May 19 - 21 , 2008 .
Gallup Panel members are recruited through random selection methods .
The panel is weighted so that it is demographically representative of the U.S. adult population .
For results based on this sample , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±4 percentage points .
For results based on the 529 national adults in the Form A half - sample and 484 national adults in the Form B half - sample , the maximum margins of sampling error are ±5 percentage points .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

WASHINGTON  Abraham Lincoln is getting a little color in his cheeks .
New $ 5 bills bearing the gaunt visage of the nation 's 16th president — with some touches of color added — are making their way to banks and cash registers today .
The Federal Reserve , supplier of the nation 's cash , will start Thursday shipping the bills to banks , which send them to businesses and eventually into the hands of people in this country and beyond .
DETAILS OF NEW BILL :
See the security features Fittingly , one of the new bills will be spent for the first time Thursday at the gift shop of President Lincoln 's Cottage on the grounds of the Armed Forces Retirement Home in northwest Washington .
The new $ 5 bill is the latest in a series of redesigned banknotes aimed at foiling counterfeiters , who over the years have grown increasingly sophisticated .
A portrait of Lincoln is still on the front and the Lincoln Memorial remains on the back .
To the naked eye , the most notable difference is splashes of light purple at the center of the bill that blend into gray near the edges .
Small yellow " 05 " numerals are printed to the left of Lincoln on the front and to the right of the memorial on the back .
The Great Seal of the United States , which features an eagle and shield , will appear in purple to the right of the president 's portrait .
Arcs of purple stars border Lincoln and the seal .
The note also will feature an enlarged " 5 " printed in high - contrast purple ink in the lower right corner of the back of the bill .
It also will have two separate watermarks and a number of other high - tech changes to make it harder for counterfeiters to knock off .
The old $ 5 bills will continue to be accepted and recirculated until they wear out .
The makeover of the $ 5 bill is similar to changes to $ 10 , $ 20 and $ 50 bills .
Next up for a new look : the $ 100 bill .

Apple has quietly included handwriting recognition for Chinese ( Traditional and Simplified ) into the latest iPhone Firmware 2.0 beta .
When you select Chinese input , you are given the option to use handwriting recognition allowing you to draw characters on the screen with your finger .
As you write the character , four possibilities appear on the right side of the screen .
Wretch.cc ( Chinese ) details many screenshots of the new feature , and MacRumors has been able to independently verify that this does exist in the latest iPhone firmware beta available to registered iPhone developers .
There is no support for English at this time .
Apple was one of the pioneers in handwriting recognition technology with their Newton Personal Digital Assistant .
While the original Newton contained a 3rd party handwriting engine that generated some early bad press , Apple later deployed their own much improved handwriting technology known as " Rosetta " .
Rosetta technology later found its way into Mac OS X under the name " Inkwell " .
Apple recently started hiring for a new Handwriting Recognition Engineer , so it appears Apple is reinvesting in this technology .
A judge hearing a war crimes case at Guantanamo Bay who publicly expressed frustration with military prosecutors ’ refusal to give evidence to the defense has been dismissed , tribunal officials confirmed Friday .
Army Col. Peter Brownback III was presiding over the case of Canadian detainee Omar Khadr .
Marine Col.
Ralph Kohlmann , in his role as chief judge at Guantanamo , ordered the dismissal without explanation and announced Brownback ’s replacement in an e-mail this week to lawyers in Khadr ’s case .
In another indication of the Pentagon ’s drive to step up the pace at Guantanamo , charges were drafted against three more terrorism suspects , bringing to 17 the number accused of war crimes .
Charges of conspiracy and supporting terrorism were prepared for Ghassan Abdullah Sharbi , a Saudi with an engineering degree from Embry - Riddle Aeronautical University ; fellow Saudi Jabran Said bin Qahtani ; and Algerian Sufyian Barhoumi .
The three are alleged to have attended Al Qaeda training camps and studied bomb - making .

Brownback had threatened to suspend the proceedings against Khadr unless prosecutors handed over Khadr ’s medical and interrogation records since his July 2002 capture in Afghanistan .
Khadr ’s Navy lawyer , Lt. Cmdr. William C. Kuebler , had asked for the records months ago , and Brownback had ordered the government to produce them .
The lead prosecutor in the Khadr case , Marine Maj .
Jeffrey Groharing , this week reiterated to Brownback his view that the defense was n’t entitled to the records .
He urged the judge to set a trial date .
Brownback said during an April hearing that he had been “ badgered and beaten and bruised by Maj. Groharing ” to set a date but could n’t do so in good conscience when the prosecution was withholding evidence .

Brownback revealed in a November 2007 session that Pentagon officials had made clear they “ did n’t like ” his decision the previous June to dismiss the Khadr case for lack of jurisdiction .
That ruling was overturned a few weeks later by a hastily assembled Court of Military Commission Review .
Asked about Brownback ’s removal , Air Force Capt .
Andre Kok , a tribunal spokesman , said it was “ a mutual decision between Col .
Brownback and the Army that he revert to his retired status when his current active - duty orders expire in June . ”
Human rights monitors saw Brownback ’s dismissal as indicative of political influence on the tribunal .

“ The fact that Judge Brownback has now been taken off the case , without explanation , creates the appearance of political meddling and highlights why these commissions cannot be considered full , fair and independent , ” said Jennifer Daskal , senior counter - terrorism counsel for Human Rights Watch .
“ The message of the Pentagon ’s decision seems to be that it is unwilling to let judges exercise independence if it means a ruling against the government , ” said Jamil Dakwar , human rights program director for the American Civil Liberties Union .
While Brownback made several rulings in favor of the defense , earlier this month he sided with the prosecution in refusing to classify Khadr as a child soldier at the time of his alleged offenses .
Kuebler has been lobbying Canadian officials for the repatriation of Khadr so he can be tried in a forum in compliance with international accords on the treatment of child soldiers .

Khadr , now 21 , faces up to life in prison if convicted at Guantanamo on charges of murder , conspiracy and supporting terrorism .
He is accused of lobbing a grenade that killed U.S. Army Sgt. 1st Class Christopher J. Speer during the firefight in which he was captured .
In other developments at the military tribunal , lawyers for confessed Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and four codefendants complained Wednesday that prosecutors were pushing for a Sept. 15 trial date to play out the emotionally charged case just ahead of the November presidential election .
“ Three months and 18 days is not enough time to prepare a defense in this death penalty case , even if the government had provided the defense with the attorneys , resources and facilities necessary to do so , ” Navy Lt. Cmdr. Brian Mizer said .
The Sept. 11 suspects are to be arraigned June 5 at Guantanamo , the first time the men , who were held abroad for years in secret CIA prisons , will be brought before a judge , journalists and human rights observers .

Their lawyers urged Kohlmann to dismiss the charges against them because of “ unlawful command influence ” exercised by Air Force Brig .
Gen. Thomas W. Hartmann , the legal advisor to the tribunal convening authority .
Hartmann was disqualified from another war crimes case this month on the same grounds .
Lawyers for Yemeni prisoner Salim Ahmed Hamdan successfully argued that Hartmann had shown a lack of independence in pressing prosecutors to try “ sexy ” cases that would produce quick convictions .

Districts have different rules about who has access to which information .
Parents then decide how much they want to know .
Katie Mazzuckelli , a mother of twin seventh graders in Alpharetta , Ga. , checks ParentConnect daily .
“ There are two types of parents , ” she said .
“ They either do what I do and embrace it , or they say : ‘ They ’re in middle school and beyond , and they need to be independent .
This is an invasion of their privacy . ’ ”
Mrs. Dobbins of Alpharetta , a comfortable Atlanta suburb , checks ParentConnect even on weekends .
Although there is only modest data on her fourth grader , she goes through the exercise to prepare the child for the scrutiny that her older children receive .
She asks the sixth grader close questions about coming assignments .
And she reminds her high school freshman , whom she describes as a bright student with a tendency to coast , “ ‘ My personal philosophy is that you need to be on your own , but if you fail to do your job , I will know about it , ’ ” Mrs. Dobbins said .
When he does not turn in his homework , she makes sure it is done that night even if it is too late to get credit for it .
“ And through ParentConnect , ” she said , “ I ’ll e-mail the teacher , ‘ Please let me know if you do n’t get it within the next day because that ’s part of his punishment . ’ ”
MRS .
DOBBINS is unapologetic about her monitoring of her children ’s schoolwork .
“ I know , ” she said , “ I ’m the mom with big horns .
But it ’s been a fabulous parenting tool .
I think every school should implement it , especially in high school , when kids do n’t talk to parents and parents ca n’t talk to each teacher . ”
The software , some educators say , can be misused as a surrogate for meaningful connection between families and schools .
“ Some teachers love it because it takes the burden of communication off them , ” said Diana Brown , a high school English literature teacher in Georgia who still sends home the occasional handwritten note .
“ Their attitude is : ‘ The parents should know what the kid ’s grade is .
It ’s not my job to contact them . ’ ”
The guards at the Guantánamo Bay prison camp are the " overlooked victims " of America 's controversial detention facility in Cuba , according to a psychiatrist who has treated some of them .
In some cases , a tour of duty at the camp has made guards suicidal and prompted a variety of psychiatric symptoms , from depression and insomnia to flashbacks .
The guards ' testimony also provides a harrowing insight into the treatment of prisoners .
Professor John Smith , a retired US Air Force captain , treated a patient who was a guard at the camp .
" I think the guards of Guantánamo are an overlooked group of victims , " Smith told the American Academy of Forensic Sciences annual meeting in Washington DC on Saturday .
" They do not complain a lot .
You do not hear about them . "
The patient ( ' Mr H' ) is a national guardsman in his early 40s who was sent to Guantánamo in the first months of its operation , when prisoners captured in Afghanistan were beginning to flood into the camp .
Mr H reported that he found conditions at the camp extremely disturbing .
For example , in the first month two detainees and two prison guards committed suicide .
Painful positions
The taunts of prisoners and the things his superiors required him to do to them had a severe psychological impact on Mr H .
" He was called upon to bring detainees , enemy combatants , to certain places and to see that they were handcuffed in particularly painful and difficult positions , usually naked , in anticipation of their interrogation , " said Smith .
On occasion he was told to make prisoners kneel , naked and handcuffed , on sharp stones .
To avoid interrogation the prisoners would often rub their wounds afterwards to make them worse so that they would be taken to hospital .
Some of the techniques used by interrogators resulted in detainees defecating , urinating , vomiting and screaming .
Mr H told Smith he felt profoundly guilty about his participation .
" It was wrong what we did , " he said .
The prisoners also threatened Mr H.
" They would tell him they had networks of people throughout the world , " said Smith .
" If he did not take letters out and mail them then they would see to it that his family suffered the consequences . "
Flashbacks and depression
When he returned to the US he was suffering from panic attacks , insomnia , nightmares , flashbacks and depression .
Another guard whom Smith treated described an incident in which a prisoner had hanged himself in his cell after partially gnawing his own arm off .
The prisoner lost a substantial amount of blood but was cut down by guards and survived .
Amnesty International UK spokesperson Neil Durkin pointed out that the psychological trauma inflicted on the Guantánamo inmates should not be overlooked .
" With numerous suicide attempts and reports of Guantánamo prisoners on the edge of psychosis , we are extremely concerned that even those eventually released from the camp will be mentally scarred for the rest of their lives , " he said .
" Over 200 of the Guantánamo prisoners are now held in solitary confinement - and after years of detention without charge or trial this is taking a heavy toll . "
There have been few scientific studies of the psychological effects of working as a prison guard , but classic experiments in the 1960s and 1970s showed how easy it is to prompt ordinary people to perpetrate extremely cruel acts given the right conditions .
In the so - called ' Stanford prison experiment ' in 1971 , college students were asked to act out roles as guards and detainees in a mock prison in the basement of the university 's psychology department .
Both groups quickly adapted to their roles and the guards became increasingly sadistic and cruel in their treatment of the prisoners .
The results were so shocking the experiment was stopped early .
" It 's not that we put bad apples in a good barrel .
We put good apples in a bad barrel .
The barrel corrupts anything that it touches , " the experiment 's author Dr Philip Zimbardo is quoted as saying on the American Psychological Association 's website .

Some federal air marshals have been denied entry to flights they are assigned to protect when their names matched those on the terrorist no - fly list , and the agency says it ’s now taking steps to make sure their agents are allowed to board in the future .
The problem with federal air marshals ( FAM ) names matching those of suspected terrorists on the no-fly list has persisted for years , say air marshals familiar with the situation .
One air marshal said it has been a major problem , where guys are denied boarding by the airline .
In some cases , planes have departed without any coverage because the airline employees were adamant they would not fly , the air marshal said .
I ’ve seen guys actually being denied boarding .
A second air marshal says one agent has been getting harassed for six years because his exact name is on the no-fly list .
Earlier this month the agency issued a new security directive ( SD ) to address those situations where air carriers deny FAMs boarding based on ‘ no - fly list ’ names matches .
The memo was issued April 23 from the assistant director of the office of flight operations .
Gregory Alter , spokesman for the Federal Air Marshal Service , said the new directive mitigates any misidentification concerns by empowering airlines to quickly clear an air marshals status after positively identifying their law enforcement status .
In rare instances air marshals , like all travelers , are occasionally misidentified as being on a watch because of name or personal identifier similarities to individuals actually on the lists , Mr. Alter said .
The air marshal service does not release how many agents are employed , and declined to specify the number of agents whose names are similar to those of wanted or suspected terrorists .
The new procedures are classified as sensitive security information and address both domestic and international check - in procedures .
FAMs may encounter situations where this SD has not yet reached every air carrier customer service representative ( CSR ) , the memo said .
If a FAM is denied boarding based on ‘ no fly list ’ issues , FAMS should request to speak to an air carrier supervisory CSR .
If the air carrier continues to deny the FAM a boarding pass , FAMS should contact ( their supervisor ) as soon as possible for assistance , the memo said .

Originally posted to the sidebar by " snoofle " ...
Some time back , I worked for a large company ( now defunct ) .
It was your basic IT department of about 150 people organized into groups of ~ 10 , all on a big open cubicle farm on one floor .
Every barrel has it 's bad apple .
Ours would routinely view kiddie porn - during work hours .
He would occasionally leave the images up on the screen when he walked away .
Finally , someone got offended enough to say something to HR .
HR had " the talk " with him .
A few weeks later , he did it again .
The same person was offended , again , and complained to HR , again .
The same person from HR had " the next talk " with him .
A few weeks later he did it yet again .
The same person made a much more formal complaint to HR .
The head of HR told his # 1 to sit down with everyone in IT , 5 at a time , with their immediate boss and their boss , and lay down the law .
Personally , I think they were excessively tolerant to this point .
Ok , so it 's time for me and 4 of my peers , and 2 levels of management to go sit in a conference room and get yelled at .
And yell she ( HR # 1 ) did .
For 45 continuous minutes .
" You people have no morals .
You people do n't obey the rules .
You people ... "
I had zoned out , but had finally had it , and fired back : " WE are n't the ones doing it !
You are preaching to the choir .
You know who did it - just fire him ! "
She fired back " But you people are downloading an unhealthy amount of kiddie porn ... "
I knew what she meant , but before I could think , I fired back , on auto - pilot : " So what does the company consider a healthy amount of kiddie porn ? "
I knew it was wrong as I started saying it , but it was like watching a train wreck as it happens - you just can't stop .
Both of my bosses just slapped their hands on their faces .
The HR # 1 was tongue - tied .
Later that day , I got , shall we say , " talked to " by both bosses , about the intricacies of knowing when to keep my mouth shut , but off the record they thought it was the best line ever .
A ban on cigarette smoking in bars is meant to save lives by reducing patrons ’ exposure to secondhand smoke .
But it may actually be having an unintended consequence , according to a study done at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee ( UWM ) .
By comparing data from a variety of locations around the United States where laws requiring smoke - free bars exist with locations without bans , economists Scott Adams and Chad Cotti found a relative increase in fatalities caused by drunk driving following ban enactment .
The results of their study appear in the June issue of the Journal of Public Economics and have also been reported in the May issue of The Economist .
While the results at first seemed surprising to Adams , a UWM assistant professor of economics , and Cotti , now at the University of South Carolina , literature on consumer behavior suggests an explanation : Smokers are willing to drive longer distances to an establishment that allows smoking .
“ Like they would to buy fireworks , lotto tickets or , in some cases , alcohol , people will often go to a neighboring jurisdiction that does n’t have a ban , ” says Adams .
The number of smokers willing to drive extra distances offsets any reduction in driving from smokers choosing to stay home following a ban , he adds .
Using fatalities as a gauge in the study is more accurate than using data on DUIs , since drunk - driving laws are not uniformly enforced , he says .

The study ’s evidence suggests that consumers are driving longer distances to smoke and drink , but this does not exclude other potential explanations .
“ We ca n’t rule out the explanation that smoking bans might reduce the propensity to drink in moderation , ” Adams says , “ But in each and every instance of ‘ border shopping ’ we found , the increase in fatalities was true . ”
The study is the second on the topic of smoking bans for the pair of economists .
The first study focused on whether smoking bans have an effect on bar employment .
Results from that study showed that restaurants were helped by smoking bans , especially in warmer climates and in warmer months .
But bar employment fell .
They then decided to examine the effect of the bans on drunk driving , says Adams .
“ The thinking was that the bans might have additional health benefits if there ’s a reduction in driving associated with it . ”
It still appears that the positive health effects of smoking bans outweigh the negative , he says , but the real conclusion is that a universal smoking ban would eliminate the danger of people trying to avoid the individual bans .
Twenty states have universal bans , and Gov. Jim Doyle has proposed one for Wisconsin .
Adams and Cotti have begun a new study to see if smoke - free bars are associated with evidence of a reduction in heart disease .
Preliminary evidence strongly suggests it does .
“ I view economics very much as a social science – the costs associated with people ’s behavior , ” says Adams , who specializes in health and labor economics .
“ Public economists are concerned with the externalities and whether what affects you also has an impact on others – without those costs being accounted for . ”

Obama : America 's complex race issue is ' a part of our union we have yet to perfect '

Print This Email This Dem candidate addresses race , history of slavery in speech
In an attempt to quiet a maelstrom of criticism swirling around his former pastor 's controversial remarks , Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama put the Rev. Jeremiah Wright 's comments into the context of race relations in America since its inception .
Obama repeated his condemnation of Wright 's most incendiary rhetoric , calling the comments that have been the focus of recent controversy " expressed a profoundly distorted view of this country . "
But he said the sound bytes that have been endlessly replayed over the last few days do not reflect his pastor 's true character .
" The fact is that the comments that have been made and the issues that have surfaced over the last few weeks reflect the complexities of race in this country that weve never really worked through  a part of our union that we have yet to perfect , " he said during a highly anticipated speech Tuesday .
" And if we walk away now , if we simply retreat into our respective corners , we will never be able to come together and solve challenges like health care , or education , or the need to find good jobs for every American . "
Speaking in Philadelphia , Obama invoked the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution that the Founding Fathers crafted there .
He said the country was " stained " by its " original sin of slavery " followed by Jim Crow laws and segregation that has persisted in creating racial divisions for the last two centuries .
" For the men and women of Reverend Wrights generation , the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away ; nor has the anger and the bitterness of those years .
That anger may not get expressed in public , in front of white co-workers or white friends , " Obama said .
" But it does find voice in the barbershop or around the kitchen table .
At times , that anger is exploited by politicians , to gin up votes along racial lines , or to make up for a politicians own failings . "
Obama said Wright 's comments did not represent his former pastor 's full character , and he refused to disown Wright completely .
" I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community , " he said .
" I can no more disown him than I can my white grandmother  a woman who helped raise me , a woman who sacrificed again and again for me , a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world , but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street , and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe . "
He went on to say that hardships were not limited to the black community , and he called for unity among all races to confront common problems .
" Most working - and middle - class white Americans dont feel that they have been particularly privileged by their race .
...
Theyve worked hard all their lives , many times only to see their jobs shipped overseas or their pension dumped after a lifetime of labor , " he said .
" They are anxious about their futures , and feel their dreams slipping away ; in an era of stagnant wages and global competition , opportunity comes to be seen as a zero sum game , in which your dreams come at my expense . "
The Democratic Illinois Senator went on to say he hoped to help America move beyond its racial divide , although he recognized such a path would not be easy .
" Just as black anger often proved counterproductive , so have these white resentments distracted attention from the real culprits of the middle class squeeze  a corporate culture rife with inside dealing , questionable accounting practices , and short - term greed .
...
And yet , to wish away the resentments of white Americans , to label them as misguided or even racist , without recognizing they are grounded in legitimate concerns  this too widens the racial divide , and blocks the path to understanding , " he said .
" This is where we are right now .
It s a racial stalemate weve been stuck in for years .
Contrary to the claims of some of my critics , black and white , I have never been so naïve as to believe that we can get beyond our racial divisions in a single election cycle , or with a single candidacy  particularly a candidacy as imperfect as my own . "
Although he did not directly invoke any of Wright 's most controversial statements , Obama said the " inexcusable " comments were predicated on a belief that society could not change and move beyond racial divisions .
" In the white community , the path to a more perfect union means acknowledging that what ails the African - American community does not just exist in the minds of black people ; that the legacy of discrimination - and current incidents of discrimination , while less overt than in the past - are real and must be addressed , " Obama said .
" It requires all Americans to realize that your dreams do not have to come at the expense of my dreams ; that investing in the health , welfare , and education of black and brown and white children will ultimately help all of America prosper . "

The Full Text of Obama 's remarks ( as prepared for delivery ) :  We the people , in order to form a more perfect union . 
Two hundred and twenty one years ago , in a hall that still stands across the street , a group of men gathered and , with these simple words , launched Americas improbable experiment in democracy .
Farmers and scholars ; statesmen and patriots who had traveled across an ocean to escape tyranny and persecution finally made real their declaration of independence at a Philadelphia convention that lasted through the spring of 1787 .
The document they produced was eventually signed but ultimately unfinished .
It was stained by this nations original sin of slavery , a question that divided the colonies and brought the convention to a stalemate until the founders chose to allow the slave trade to continue for at least twenty more years , and to leave any final resolution to future generations .
Of course , the answer to the slavery question was already embedded within our Constitution  a Constitution that had at is very core the ideal of equal citizenship under the law ; a Constitution that promised its people liberty , and justice , and a union that could be and should be perfected over time .
And yet words on a parchment would not be enough to deliver slaves from bondage , or provide men and women of every color and creed their full rights and obligations as citizens of the United States .
What would be needed were Americans in successive generations who were willing to do their part  through protests and struggle , on the streets and in the courts , through a civil war and civil disobedience and always at great risk - to narrow that gap between the promise of our ideals and the reality of their time .
This was one of the tasks we set forth at the beginning of this campaign  to continue the long march of those who came before us , a march for a more just , more equal , more free , more caring and more prosperous America .
I chose to run for the presidency at this moment in history because I believe deeply that we cannot solve the challenges of our time unless we solve them together  unless we perfect our union by understanding that we may have different stories , but we hold common hopes ; that we may not look the same and we may not have come from the same place , but we all want to move in the same direction  towards a better future for of children and our grandchildren .
This belief comes from my unyielding faith in the decency and generosity of the American people .
But it also comes from my own American story .
I am the son of a black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas .
I was raised with the help of a white grandfather who survived a Depression to serve in Pattons Army during World War II and a white grandmother who worked on a bomber assembly line at Fort Leavenworth while he was overseas .
Ive gone to some of the best schools in America and lived in one of the worlds poorest nations .
I am married to a black American who carries within her the blood of slaves and slaveowners  an inheritance we pass on to our two precious daughters .
I have brothers , sisters , nieces , nephews , uncles and cousins , of every race and every hue , scattered across three continents , and for as long as I live , I will never forget that in no other country on Earth is my story even possible .
It s a story that hasnt made me the most conventional candidate .
But it is a story that has seared into my genetic makeup the idea that this nation is more than the sum of its parts  that out of many , we are truly one .
Throughout the first year of this campaign , against all predictions to the contrary , we saw how hungry the American people were for this message of unity .
Despite the temptation to view my candidacy through a purely racial lens , we won commanding victories in states with some of the whitest populations in the country .
In South Carolina , where the Confederate Flag still flies , we built a powerful coalition of African Americans and white Americans .
This is not to say that race has not been an issue in the campaign .
At various stages in the campaign , some commentators have deemed me either too black  or not black enough .
We saw racial tensions bubble to the surface during the week before the South Carolina primary .
The press has scoured every exit poll for the latest evidence of racial polarization , not just in terms of white and black , but black and brown as well .
And yet , it has only been in the last couple of weeks that the discussion of race in this campaign has taken a particularly divisive turn .
On one end of the spectrum , weve heard the implication that my candidacy is somehow an exercise in affirmative action ; that its based solely on the desire of wide - eyed liberals to purchase racial reconciliation on the cheap .
On the other end , weve heard my former pastor , Reverend Jeremiah Wright , use incendiary language to express views that have the potential not only to widen the racial divide , but views that denigrate both the greatness and the goodness of our nation ; that rightly offend white and black alike .
I have already condemned , in unequivocal terms , the statements of Reverend Wright that have caused such controversy .
For some , nagging questions remain .
Did I know him to be an occasionally fierce critic of American domestic and foreign policy ?
Of course .
Did I ever hear him make remarks that could be considered controversial while I sat in church ?
Yes .
Did I strongly disagree with many of his political views ?
Absolutely  just as I m sure many of you have heard remarks from your pastors , priests , or rabbis with which you strongly disagreed .
But the remarks that have caused this recent firestorm werent simply controversial .
They werent simply a religious leaders effort to speak out against perceived injustice .
Instead , they expressed a profoundly distorted view of this country  a view that sees white racism as endemic , and that elevates what is wrong with America above all that we know is right with America ; a view that sees the conflicts in the Middle East as rooted primarily in the actions of stalwart allies like Israel , instead of emanating from the perverse and hateful ideologies of radical Islam .
As such , Reverend Wrights comments were not only wrong but divisive , divisive at a time when we need unity ; racially charged at a time when we need to come together to solve a set of monumental problems  two wars , a terrorist threat , a falling economy , a chronic health care crisis and potentially devastating climate change ; problems that are neither black or white or Latino or Asian , but rather problems that confront us all .
Given my background , my politics , and my professed values and ideals , there will no doubt be those for whom my statements of condemnation are not enough .
Why associate myself with Reverend Wright in the first place , they may ask ?
Why not join another church ?
And I confess that if all that I knew of Reverend Wright were the snippets of those sermons that have run in an endless loop on the television and You Tube , or if Trinity United Church of Christ conformed to the caricatures being peddled by some commentators , there is no doubt that I would react in much the same way
But the truth is , that is nt all that I know of the man .
The man I met more than twenty years ago is a man who helped introduce me to my Christian faith , a man who spoke to me about our obligations to love one another ; to care for the sick and lift up the poor .
He is a man who served his country as a U.S. Marine ; who has studied and lectured at some of the finest universities and seminaries in the country , and who for over thirty years led a church that serves the community by doing Gods work here on Earth  by housing the homeless , ministering to the needy , providing day care services and scholarships and prison ministries , and reaching out to those suffering from HIV / AIDS .
In my first book , Dreams From My Father , I described the experience of my first service at Trinity :  People began to shout , to rise from their seats and clap and cry out , a forceful wind carrying the reverends voice up into the rafters .
And in that single note  hope ! 
I heard something else ; at the foot of that cross , inside the thousands of churches across the city , I imagined the stories of ordinary black people merging with the stories of David and Goliath , Moses and Pharaoh , the Christians in the lions den , Ezekiels field of dry bones .
Those stories  of survival , and freedom , and hope  became our story , my story ; the blood that had spilled was our blood , the tears our tears ; until this black church , on this bright day , seemed once more a vessel carrying the story of a people into future generations and into a larger world .
Our trials and triumphs became at once unique and universal , black and more than black ; in chronicling our journey , the stories and songs gave us a means to reclaim memories that we didnt need to feel shame about memories that all people might study and cherish  and with which we could start to rebuild . 
That has been my experience at Trinity .
Like other predominantly black churches across the country , Trinity embodies the black community in its entirety  the doctor and the welfare mom , the model student and the former gang - banger .
Like other black churches , Trinitys services are full of raucous laughter and sometimes bawdy humor .
They are full of dancing , clapping , screaming and shouting that may seem jarring to the untrained ear .
The church contains in full the kindness and cruelty , the fierce intelligence and the shocking ignorance , the struggles and successes , the love and yes , the bitterness and bias that make up the black experience in America .
And this helps explain , perhaps , my relationship with Reverend Wright .
As imperfect as he may be , he has been like family to me .
He strengthened my faith , officiated my wedding , and baptized my children .
Not once in my conversations with him have I heard him talk about any ethnic group in derogatory terms , or treat whites with whom he interacted with anything but courtesy and respect .
He contains within him the contradictions  the good and the bad  of the community that he has served diligently for so many years .
I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community .
I can no more disown him than I can my white grandmother  a woman who helped raise me , a woman who sacrificed again and again for me , a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world , but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street , and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe .
These people are a part of me .
And they are a part of America , this country that I love .
Some will see this as an attempt to justify or excuse comments that are simply inexcusable .
I can assure you it is not .
I suppose the politically safe thing would be to move on from this episode and just hope that it fades into the woodwork .
We can dismiss Reverend Wright as a crank or a demagogue , just as some have dismissed Geraldine Ferraro , in the aftermath of her recent statements , as harboring some deep - seated racial bias .
But race is an issue that I believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now .
We would be making the same mistake that Reverend Wright made in his offending sermons about America  to simplify and stereotype and amplify the negative to the point that it distorts reality .
The fact is that the comments that have been made and the issues that have surfaced over the last few weeks reflect the complexities of race in this country that weve never really worked through  a part of our union that we have yet to perfect .
And if we walk away now , if we simply retreat into our respective corners , we will never be able to come together and solve challenges like health care , or education , or the need to find good jobs for every American .
Understanding this reality requires a reminder of how we arrived at this point .
As William Faulkner once wrote ,  The past is nt dead and buried .
In fact , it is nt even past . 
We do not need to recite here the history of racial injustice in this country .
But we do need to remind ourselves that so many of the disparities that exist in the African - American community today can be directly traced to inequalities passed on from an earlier generation that suffered under the brutal legacy of slavery and Jim Crow .
Segregated schools were , and are , inferior schools ; we still havent fixed them , fifty years after Brown v. Board of Education , and the inferior education they provided , then and now , helps explain the pervasive achievement gap between todays black and white students .
Legalized discrimination - where blacks were prevented , often through violence , from owning property , or loans were not granted to African - American business owners , or black homeowners could not access FHA mortgages , or blacks were excluded from unions , or the police force , or fire departments  meant that black families could not amass any meaningful wealth to bequeath to future generations .
That history helps explain the wealth and income gap between black and white , and the concentrated pockets of poverty that persists in so many of todays urban and rural communities .
A lack of economic opportunity among black men , and the shame and frustration that came from not being able to provide for ones family , contributed to the erosion of black families  a problem that welfare policies for many years may have worsened .
And the lack of basic services in so many urban black neighborhoods  parks for kids to play in , police walking the beat , regular garbage pick - up and building code enforcement  all helped create a cycle of violence , blight and neglect that continue to haunt us .
This is the reality in which Reverend Wright and other African - Americans of his generation grew up .
They came of age in the late fifties and early sixties , a time when segregation was still the law of the land and opportunity was systematically constricted .
What s remarkable is not how many failed in the face of discrimination , but rather how many men and women overcame the odds ; how many were able to make a way out of no way for those like me who would come after them .
But for all those who scratched and clawed their way to get a piece of the American Dream , there were many who didnt make it  those who were ultimately defeated , in one way or another , by discrimination .
That legacy of defeat was passed on to future generations  those young men and increasingly young women who we see standing on street corners or languishing in our prisons , without hope or prospects for the future .
Even for those blacks who did make it , questions of race , and racism , continue to define their worldview in fundamental ways .
For the men and women of Reverend Wrights generation , the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away ; nor has the anger and the bitterness of those years .
That anger may not get expressed in public , in front of white co-workers or white friends .
But it does find voice in the barbershop or around the kitchen table .
At times , that anger is exploited by politicians , to gin up votes along racial lines , or to make up for a politicians own failings .
And occasionally it finds voice in the church on Sunday morning , in the pulpit and in the pews .
The fact that so many people are surprised to hear that anger in some of Reverend Wrights sermons simply reminds us of the old truism that the most segregated hour in American life occurs on Sunday morning .
That anger is not always productive ; indeed , all too often it distracts attention from solving real problems ; it keeps us from squarely facing our own complicity in our condition , and prevents the African - American community from forging the alliances it needs to bring about real change .
But the anger is real ; it is powerful ; and to simply wish it away , to condemn it without understanding its roots , only serves to widen the chasm of misunderstanding that exists between the races .
In fact , a similar anger exists within segments of the white community .
Most working - and middle - class white Americans dont feel that they have been particularly privileged by their race .
Their experience is the immigrant experience  as far as they re concerned , no ones handed them anything , theyve built it from scratch .
Theyve worked hard all their lives , many times only to see their jobs shipped overseas or their pension dumped after a lifetime of labor .
They are anxious about their futures , and feel their dreams slipping away ; in an era of stagnant wages and global competition , opportunity comes to be seen as a zero sum game , in which your dreams come at my expense .
So when they are told to bus their children to a school across town ; when they hear that an African American is getting an advantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because of an injustice that they themselves never committed ; when they re told that their fears about crime in urban neighborhoods are somehow prejudiced , resentment builds over time .
Like the anger within the black community , these resentments arent always expressed in polite company .
But they have helped shape the political landscape for at least a generation .
Anger over welfare and affirmative action helped forge the Reagan Coalition .
Politicians routinely exploited fears of crime for their own electoral ends .
Talk show hosts and conservative commentators built entire careers unmasking bogus claims of racism while dismissing legitimate discussions of racial injustice and inequality as mere political correctness or reverse racism .
Just as black anger often proved counterproductive , so have these white resentments distracted attention from the real culprits of the middle class squeeze  a corporate culture rife with inside dealing , questionable accounting practices , and short - term greed ; a Washington dominated by lobbyists and special interests ; economic policies that favor the few over the many .
And yet , to wish away the resentments of white Americans , to label them as misguided or even racist , without recognizing they are grounded in legitimate concerns  this too widens the racial divide , and blocks the path to understanding .
This is where we are right now .
It s a racial stalemate weve been stuck in for years .
Contrary to the claims of some of my critics , black and white , I have never been so naïve as to believe that we can get beyond our racial divisions in a single election cycle , or with a single candidacy  particularly a candidacy as imperfect as my own .
But I have asserted a firm conviction  a conviction rooted in my faith in God and my faith in the American people  that working together we can move beyond some of our old racial wounds , and that in fact we have no choice is we are to continue on the path of a more perfect union .
For the African - American community , that path means embracing the burdens of our past without becoming victims of our past .
It means continuing to insist on a full measure of justice in every aspect of American life .
But it also means binding our particular grievances  for better health care , and better schools , and better jobs - to the larger aspirations of all Americans -- the white woman struggling to break the glass ceiling , the white man whose been laid off , the immigrant trying to feed his family .
And it means taking full responsibility for own lives  by demanding more from our fathers , and spending more time with our children , and reading to them , and teaching them that while they may face challenges and discrimination in their own lives , they must never succumb to despair or cynicism ; they must always believe that they can write their own destiny .
Ironically , this quintessentially American  and yes , conservative  notion of self - help found frequent expression in Reverend Wrights sermons .
But what my former pastor too often failed to understand is that embarking on a program of self - help also requires a belief that society can change .
The profound mistake of Reverend Wrights sermons is not that he spoke about racism in our society .
It s that he spoke as if our society was static ; as if no progress has been made ; as if this country  a country that has made it possible for one of his own members to run for the highest office in the land and build a coalition of white and black ; Latino and Asian , rich and poor , young and old -- is still irrevocably bound to a tragic past .
But what we know -- what we have seen  is that America can change .
That is true genius of this nation .
What we have already achieved gives us hope  the audacity to hope  for what we can and must achieve tomorrow .
In the white community , the path to a more perfect union means acknowledging that what ails the African - American community does not just exist in the minds of black people ; that the legacy of discrimination - and current incidents of discrimination , while less overt than in the past - are real and must be addressed .
Not just with words , but with deeds  by investing in our schools and our communities ; by enforcing our civil rights laws and ensuring fairness in our criminal justice system ; by providing this generation with ladders of opportunity that were unavailable for previous generations .
It requires all Americans to realize that your dreams do not have to come at the expense of my dreams ; that investing in the health , welfare , and education of black and brown and white children will ultimately help all of America prosper .
In the end , then , what is called for is nothing more , and nothing less , than what all the worlds great religions demand  that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us .
Let us be our brothers keeper , Scripture tells us .
Let us be our sisters keeper .
Let us find that common stake we all have in one another , and let our politics reflect that spirit as well .
For we have a choice in this country .
We can accept a politics that breeds division , and conflict , and cynicism .
We can tackle race only as spectacle  as we did in the OJ trial  or in the wake of tragedy , as we did in the aftermath of Katrina - or as fodder for the nightly news .
We can play Reverend Wrights sermons on every channel , every day and talk about them from now until the election , and make the only question in this campaign whether or not the American people think that I somehow believe or sympathize with his most offensive words .
We can pounce on some gaffe by a Hillary supporter as evidence that shes playing the race card , or we can speculate on whether white men will all flock to John McCain in the general election regardless of his policies .
We can do that .
But if we do , I can tell you that in the next election , well be talking about some other distraction .
And then another one .
And then another one .
And nothing will change .
That is one option .
Or , at this moment , in this election , we can come together and say ,  Not this time . 
This time we want to talk about the crumbling schools that are stealing the future of black children and white children and Asian children and Hispanic children and Native American children .
This time we want to reject the cynicism that tells us that these kids cant learn ; that those kids who dont look like us are somebody elses problem .
The children of America are not those kids , they are our kids , and we will not let them fall behind in a 21st century economy .
Not this time .
This time we want to talk about how the lines in the Emergency Room are filled with whites and blacks and Hispanics who do not have health care ; who dont have the power on their own to overcome the special interests in Washington , but who can take them on if we do it together .
This time we want to talk about the shuttered mills that once provided a decent life for men and women of every race , and the homes for sale that once belonged to Americans from every religion , every region , every walk of life .
This time we want to talk about the fact that the real problem is not that someone who doesnt look like you might take your job ; its that the corporation you work for will ship it overseas for nothing more than a profit .
This time we want to talk about the men and women of every color and creed who serve together , and fight together , and bleed together under the same proud flag .
We want to talk about how to bring them home from a war that never shouldve been authorized and never shouldve been waged , and we want to talk about how well show our patriotism by caring for them , and their families , and giving them the benefits they have earned .
I would not be running for President if I didnt believe with all my heart that this is what the vast majority of Americans want for this country .
This union may never be perfect , but generation after generation has shown that it can always be perfected .
And today , whenever I find myself feeling doubtful or cynical about this possibility , what gives me the most hope is the next generation  the young people whose attitudes and beliefs and openness to change have already made history in this election .
There is one story in particularly that Id like to leave you with today  a story I told when I had the great honor of speaking on Dr. Kings birthday at his home church , Ebenezer Baptist , in Atlanta .
There is a young , twenty - three year old white woman named Ashley Baia who organized for our campaign in Florence , South Carolina .
She had been working to organize a mostly African - American community since the beginning of this campaign , and one day she was at a roundtable discussion where everyone went around telling their story and why they were there .
And Ashley said that when she was nine years old , her mother got cancer .
And because she had to miss days of work , she was let go and lost her health care .
They had to file for bankruptcy , and thats when Ashley decided that she had to do something to help her mom .
She knew that food was one of their most expensive costs , and so Ashley convinced her mother that what she really liked and really wanted to eat more than anything else was mustard and relish sandwiches .
Because that was the cheapest way to eat .
She did this for a year until her mom got better , and she told everyone at the roundtable that the reason she joined our campaign was so that she could help the millions of other children in the country who want and need to help their parents too .
Now Ashley might have made a different choice .
Perhaps somebody told her along the way that the source of her mothers problems were blacks who were on welfare and too lazy to work , or Hispanics who were coming into the country illegally .
But she didnt .
She sought out allies in her fight against injustice .
Anyway , Ashley finishes her story and then goes around the room and asks everyone else why they re supporting the campaign .
They all have different stories and reasons .
Many bring up a specific issue .
And finally they come to this elderly black man whos been sitting there quietly the entire time .
And Ashley asks him why hes there .
And he does not bring up a specific issue .
He does not say health care or the economy .
He does not say education or the war .
He does not say that he was there because of Barack Obama .
He simply says to everyone in the room ,  I am here because of Ashley . 
 Im here because of Ashley . 
By itself , that single moment of recognition between that young white girl and that old black man is not enough .
It is not enough to give health care to the sick , or jobs to the jobless , or education to our children .
But it is where we start .
It is where our union grows stronger .
And as so many generations have come to realize over the course of the two - hundred and twenty one years since a band of patriots signed that document in Philadelphia , that is where the perfection begins .
Everyone loves a good swordfight and thankfully there have been an enormous number of movies with brilliant fighting scenes in them .

10 Pirates of the Carribbean Johnny Depp vs. Orlando Bloom
The “ Pirates ” series may have overstayed its welcome , but the first entry gave us some of the most inspired and thrilling action sequences in recent memory .
Like any respectable blood - and - thunder epic , it comes with some mighty fancy swordplay .
The high - flying acrobatics of Depp and Bloom strike just the right balance of adventure and comedy .
Interestingly , if Depp had played Jack Sparrow as a classic hero instead of a rum- addled fop , it probably would n’t be worth mentioning .

9 Adventures of Don Juan Errol Flynn vs. Robert Douglas
Errol Flynn was no stranger to the adventure genre , and he had more than his share of swordfighting .
One instance that is often overlooked is his turn as womanizing , international man - of - mystery Don Juan in 1948 .
In the midst of a palace coup , Flynn ’s Don Juan slogs it out with Douglas ’ scheming Duke de Lorca .
It is every bit as grandiose as Robin Hood , and the atmosphere of dimly - lit corridors and long shadows adds an impressively artistic look to the film .

8 Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon Ziyi Zhang vs. Yun-fat Chow
Hong Kong films had been using the technique dubbed “ wire - fu ” for years .
But this film was the first major release in the West to use it , and the result was spectacular .
Combat was no longer restricted by physics – here we see warriors fly through the air , run up vertical walls , and even balance themselves on flimsy tree branches .
The confrontation between Jen Yu and Li Mu Bai in the pine forest is imaginative and beautiful , casting white - clad opponents against a palette of jade greens as they battle among the tree - tops .

7 The Seven Samurai Toshiro Mifune , et al , vs. Nasty Bandits
Although not a swordfight in the strictest sense , the final battle in this Kurosawa masterpiece is certainly one of the best action sequences of all time .
We see the quiet discipline of the vastly - outnumbered samurai as they draw their sabers , ready for the coming onslaught of their enemies .
The samurai dispatch many of them , even as they arrive on horseback .
A swordfight against mounted cavalry .
Does it get any cooler than that ?

6 Return of the Jedi Mark Hamill vs. um … Darth Vader
It is not the most frenetic lightsaber duel in the Star Wars saga .
It is certainly not the most elaborately - choreographed .
But this ultimate confrontation , between father and son , is by far the most dramatic in the series .
As Luke unleashes his fury on Vader , nearly killing him , the eerie vocal score swells to convey the magnitude of this apocalyptic moment .
Flashes of red and green light illuminate an otherwise pitch - black scene as sabers clash .
And it gives us a nice break from the Ewok scenes .

5 The Princess Bride Mandy Patinkin vs. Christopher Guest
I must say , I am generally not drawn to films that have the words “ princess ” or “ bride ” in the title .
However , this is a film that just gets better every time I see it .
Rarely has there been a more enjoyable mixture of adventure , comedy , romance , and intrigue .
Who could forget the climactic duel between Spanish wanderer Inigo and the sleazy , six - fingered Count Rugen ?
The conclusion of this fight alone is reason enough to watch the film .

4 The Mark of Zorro Tyrone Power vs. Basil Rathbone
Many swordfights of Hollywood ’s Golden
Age were epic in scale , spanning entire castles and involving armies of extras .
But in this early adventure of the masked Mexican aristocrat , the swordplay occurs entirely within the confines of one room .
Zorro crosses rapiers with the magnificently slimy Captain Pasquale in a fast and furious ( and likely very dangerous ) battle of skill .
Oh , and it was done without the use of stunt doubles or special effects .

3 Kill Bill Uma Thurman vs. The Crazy 88
There was so much blood spilled in Tarantino ’s living anime that it had to be filmed in black and white for ratings purposes .
No worries , in a way it actually adds to the scene .
The sheer level of carnage here , morbid yet strangely beautiful , transcends reality and enters the realm of cartoon .
Not only does it pay homage to the flamboyant kung - fu movies of the 70’s , it leaves us with imagery that becomes iconic in its own right .

2 Rob Roy Liam Neeson vs. Tim Roth
One aspect of an activity as physically demanding as swordfighting that is rarely addressed in film is the exhaustion that must accompany it .
Rob Roy and his opponent , the deceptively effete Cunningham , do not effortlessly fly about the room with balletic dexterity .
It is a hard , brutal , draining match whose outcome seems inevitable , until old Rob does something completely unexpected .
Of all the swordfights ever depicted on screen , one feels that this is the most realistic .

1 Raiders of the Lost Ark Harrison Ford vs. Scimitar Guy
Is it possible that the coolest swordfight in film history never actually takes place ?
Rumor has it that Ford was suffering from gastroenteritis and was n’t up to an elaborately - staged duel with an apparently badass swordsman in the streets of Cairo .
The result : one of the most memorable sequences of all time .
While the black - clad swordsman gives us the requisite display of skill , Indy pulls out his revolver and shoots him on the spot , to the amazement of the crowd .
It is a defining moment for this iconic character who , although he probably could win such a match , would much rather take the easy way out and get on with his day .

Contributor : The Bed- headed Stranger
Charleston , S.C .
WITH Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama trying to figure out whether it would work for her to play teammate , the question keeps coming up of what to do with Bill Clinton .
No White House occupant would want a restless former president hanging around .
Here ’s an easy answer .
Give Mr. Clinton a real job with real power , a challenging position that would be engaging , in part because it would be new .
Let me explain .
Once the campaigns agree on an Obama - Clinton ticket , Mr. Obama calls Gov. David Paterson of New York , lays out the situation and gets an agreement that if an Obama - Clinton ticket wins , the governor appoints the former president to fill Mrs. Clinton ’s Senate seat , where he would serve until 2010 .
He could then run in a special election for the two remaining years of the term .
As for precedent , recall that John Quincy Adams moved from the executive to the legislative branch of the federal government , serving in Congress after his time in the White House .
No , this is not a overdue April Fool 's Joke .
Ben Smith just let me know that he heard a Ron Paul ad on KYW , a news station in Philly .
I thought Ben may have had a little too much wiz on his cheesesteak at first , but sure enough there is an ad .
Without mentioning McCain 's name , Paul paints himself as the true conservative and draws obvious contrasts on immigration , taxes , and campaign finance reform .
No mention of the issue that has drawn so many to Paul , his opposition to the Iraq war ( he does say he supports " a pro-America defense policy " ) .
Anybody want to wager what percent of the vote Paul pulls tomorrow in Penn ?
And , to you Paul'ites , are you doing any get out the vote stuff to supplement the ad ?

I started thinking about it today .
What if I was stuck on the proverbial desert island ?
What programming language would I want to have to hammer out that critical calculation that would somehow return me back to civilization ?
I know this is heresy , but I think I 'd choose C .
" WTF !?!?! "
I hear you cry .
" This is a Lisp blog , dammit .
You can't choose C. "
Well , you 're right .
But let me ramble for a second .
In my thinking this afternoon , I started to consider which programming languages are really timeless ?
Not just popular , mind you , but timeless .
There are n't that many .
COBOL was popular once .
It was n't timeless .
PERL is certainly popular , but given the changes happening in PERL 6 , it 's not timeless either .
Python ?
A very fun language , but not timeless .
Ruby ?
Very hip and cool , but not timeless .
How about Java ?
I once read something from the Long Now folks saying that they would be using Java for any programming because it was a language that could stand the test of time because of WORA .
( If somebody can point me to a reference for this , please do .
I was Googling madly for it this afternoon , but I can't seem to find it .
I believe it was something Bill Joy wrote . )
I did n't believe it then , and I certainly do n't believe it now .
Nope , there is a huge difference between popularity and timelessness .
I think C is timeless .
C has been called " high level assembler . "
There are few other languages that do such a great job of raising you just slightly out of the world of bits , bytes , and machine registers , just enough to give you high level conditionals and loops , but not far enough that you can't get back to machine words .
Lisp is also timeless .
Alan Kay has said that Lisp is " Maxwell 's Equations of software . "
He 's right .
There is something that is so fundamental about Lisp that it simply cannot go away .
It 's far more than the parenthesis or the lists or the macros or any of that stuff that Lispers love .
It 's more than Common Lisp or Scheme or MacLisp or Emacs Lisp .
It 's all that stuff and more .
At its core , Lisp is so compact and powerful as to be timeless .
From McCarthy 's original paper springs forth the whole world of every program that can be written .
In fairness to Kay , Smalltalk is pretty close to being timeless , too .
In a certain sense , Smalltalk lives on in Ruby , but it 's really the idea of message passing rather than Smalltalk specifically .
Insofar as Smalltalk is synonymous with message passing ( which it really is n't ) , it 's timeless .
FORTH is timeless .
The basics of a stack machine are pretty fundamental .
The various FORTH words and implementation techniques may change ( c.f. Factor ) , but the fundamentals are still recognizable as FORTH .
And that 's why I 'd choose C as my desert island language .
Because in less than 10 pages of C , I can bootstrap a basic Lisp interpreter ( or FORTH interpreter , for that matter ) .
And with Lisp , I can write everything else .
When PERL and Python are as dated as COBOL and Pascal , we 'll still have Lisp .
And it'll still be very recognizable as Lisp .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- MoveOn.org , a grassroots powerhouse that supports Sen. Barack Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination , launched a fundraising drive Thursday to counter Sen. Hillary Clinton 's wealthy supporters .
A MoveOn.org campaign for Sen. Barack Obama will spotlight new and old ways of fundraising .
Her supporters have recently argued with their checkbooks that superdelegates should vote their conscience at the Democratic National Convention in August .
MoveOn 's drive sets up a face - off that illustrates the widening gap in the Democratic Party between some of its traditional financial backers , many of whom support Clinton , and a Netroots donor base that leans toward Obama .
Twenty of Clinton 's major donors sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Wednesday that suggested they might rethink their support for the party 's congressional efforts this cycle if Pelosi did not alter her publicly stated view that superdelegates should support the party 's pledged delegate leader -- a position that would be fatal to Clinton 's presidential bid .
" We have been strong supporters of the DCCC , " they wrote .
" We therefore urge you to clarify your position on superdelegates and reflect in your comments a more open view to the optional independent actions of each of the delegates at the National Convention in August . "
The DCCC -- Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee -- assists the party 's House candidates .
A day later , MoveOn.org announced its fundraising drive to demonstrate its support for Pelosi 's position
" It 's the worst kind of insider politics -- billionaires bullying our elected leaders into ignoring the will of the voters , " wrote organizers in an e-mail to the group 's members .
" But when we all pool our resources , together we 're stronger than the fat cats .
So let 's tell Nancy Pelosi that if she keeps standing up for regular Americans , thousands of us will have her back .
And we can more than match whatever the CEOs and billionaires refuse to contribute . "
Senior advisers to Clinton 's campaign denied Thursday the campaign had anything to do with the donors ' message to Pelosi .
" We got a heads up that a letter was being sent , but we did n't know what was in it and that was it .
Our supporters let us know that they were sending something over , " said Clinton spokesman Phil Singer on a conference call with reporters .
But he would not repudiate the content of the note .
" I think that the letter speaks for itself , " said Singer .
" There 's clearly a broad feeling among many Democrats , many people who are active in the party , that the role of superdelegates is to exercise independent judgment , to make their decision based on what is best for the party , what is best for the country . "
It 's a delicate balancing act for the Clinton team .
Its success will depend in part on this kind of donor pressure .
But the campaign cannot be seen by the majority of the party to be endorsing these actions in any way without risking a major backlash -- a point not lost on the Obama team , which moved quickly to highlight the message 's implied threat .
" This letter is inappropriate and we hope the Clinton campaign will reject the insinuation contained in it , " said spokesman Bill Burton .
" Regardless of the outcome of the nomination fight , Sen . Obama will continue to urge his supporters to assist Speaker Pelosi in her efforts to maintain and build a working majority in the House of Representatives . "
The nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics reported Thursday that the 20 Clinton donors who signed the letter to Pelosi had collectively contributed nearly $ 24 million to Democratic candidates and committees over the last decade , including more than $ 500,000 to Clinton 's senate and presidential campaigns and leadership PAC .
They have collectively donated less than a tenth of that amount to Obama .
The Pelosi letter is not the first time Democratic heavyweights backing Clinton 's run have contacted party officials to press for decisions critical to her campaign and hinted their financial support might depend on the party 's positions .
Earlier this month , The New York Times reported Clinton fundraisers in Florida and Michigan were threatening to withhold funds intended for the Democratic National Committee or ask for refunds of previous donations if the party did not seat their state 's full delegations at the convention or hold new contests in those states .
Drawing the bulk of superdelegate support regardless of the pledged delegate outcome and seating the Michigan and Florida delegations despite party penalties have both been priorities for the Clinton campaign .
The idea that some Clinton backers might keep their checkbooks closed if she does not win the Democratic nomination comes as a Gallup Poll this week found that 28 percent of her supporters might back presumptive Republican nominee Sen .
John McCain this fall if she is not on the ballot .
Pelosi and DNC Chairman Howard Dean have so far defended their positions in the face of the mounting pressure .
" The speaker believes it would do great harm to the Democratic Party if superdelegates are perceived to overturn the will of the voters , " said Pelosi spokesman Brendan Daly after the release of this week 's letter .
" This has been her position throughout this primary season , regardless of who was ahead at any particular point in delegates or votes . "
Earlier in the month , the national party seemed to take an even tougher tone against these critics .
" While Howard Dean has been working hard to be an honest broker , too many involved have been more concerned with headlines than results , " DNC spokeswoman Stacie Paxton told the Times .
" It 's never productive to negotiate through the press , but make no mistake , Howard Dean will continue to lead the effort to find a workable solution that 's fair and consistent with the rules . "
The DNC , however , may be particularly vulnerable if similar threats continue .
As both the party 's presidential candidates continue to break fundraising records , the national committee stands as the sole Democratic entity at a cash disadvantage to its Republican counterpart , with less than $ 5 million cash on hand , according to the latest FEC filing -- a fifth of the RNC 's war chest .

That ’s the issue that the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is currently dealing with :
Avery Doninger , 17 , claims officials at Lewis S. Mills High School violated her free speech rights when they barred her from serving on the student council because of what she wrote from her home computer .
In her Internet journal , Doninger said officials were canceling the school ’s annual Jamfest , which is similar to a battle of the bands contest .
The event , which she helped coordinate , was rescheduled .
According to the lawsuit , she wrote : “ `Jamfest ’ is canceled due to douchebags in central office , ” and also referred to an administrator who was “ pissed off . ”
After discovering the blog entry , school officials refused to allow Doninger to run for re-election as class secretary .
Doninger won anyway with write - in votes , but was not allowed to serve .
A lower federal court had supported the school .
U.S. District Judge Mark Kravitz , denying Doninger ’s request for an injunction , said he believed she could be punished for writing in a blog because the blog addressed school issues and was likely to be read by other students .
Her lawyer , Jon L. Schoenhorn , told the appeals court Tuesday that what students write on the Internet should not give schools more cause to regulate off - campus speech .
“ It ’s just a bigger soapbox , ” he said .
But Thomas R. Gerarde , an attorney for school officials , argued that the Internet has completely changed the way students communicate .
The Supreme Court has issued four major rulings on the issue of student ’s First Amendment rights in school over the years .
In the first such case , Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District where the Court held that a school could not discipline students who wore anti-Vietnam War armbands to school because the student ’s speech did not cause a disruption to school activities and constituted protected speech .
Two other cases — Bethel School District v. Fraser and Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier — seemed to limit the scope of student free speech rights , but both are unique cases ; the Fraser case involved a student who had given a speech filled with sexual inneundo at an assembly , and Hazelwood involved the extent to which the school had editorial control over a school - sanctioned student newspaper .
Most recently , the issue of the free speech rights of students was before the Supreme Court a year ago in what has become known as the “ Bong Hits 4 Jesus ” case .
In that case , a school had suspended a student who had unfurled , as an apparent joke , a banner that read “ Bong Hits 4 Jesus ” during a school outing to watch the Olympic Torch pass through town .
The school suspended the student , and the Supreme Court ruled that the suspension did not violate the student ’s First Amendment rights :
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court tightened limits on student speech Monday , ruling against a high school student and his 14 - foot - long “ Bong Hits 4 Jesus ” banner .
Schools may prohibit student expression that can be interpreted as advocating drug use , Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the court in a 5 - 4 ruling .
Joseph Frederick unfurled his homemade sign on a winter morning in 2002 , as the Olympic torch made its way through Juneau , Alaska , en route to the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City .
Frederick said the banner was a nonsensical message that he first saw on a snowboard .
He intended the banner to proclaim his right to say anything at all .
His principal , Deborah Morse , said the phrase was a pro-drug message that had no place at a school - sanctioned event .
Frederick denied that he was advocating for drug use .
“ The message on Frederick ’s banner is cryptic , ” Roberts said .
“ But Principal Morse thought the banner would be interpreted by those viewing it as promoting illegal drug use , and that interpretation is plainly a reasonable one . ”
Agree or disagree with the decision , and I disagree with it , that is the law of the land .
So where does that leave our student blogger ?
First of all , neither Bethel nor Hazelwood would seem to be applicable here ; the student ’s blog was not school - sanctioned activity .
Moreover , it seems fairly clear that this situation is closer to Tinker than it is to Morse .
The student was making a comment on an event at school and expressing , albeit not in the language of William F. Buckley , her opinion of school officials .
She was not mis-behaving at an official school function , nor was she participating in an off - campus school event ; she was sitting in her home writing on her blog .
In the Tinker case , Justice Abe Fortas wrote in the majority opinion the following :
“ It can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate . ”
Nor can it be argued that they lose those rights when they ’re sitting in their bedroom blogging .
From the Earth 's perspective in late May and into June , the Sun lies along a line of sight to the constellation Taurus .
Earlier in the year , the Sun would have appeared in Aries .
As the Earth proceeds in its orbit around the Sun ( counterclockwise in this picture ) , the line of sight will point to Gemini , off the left side of the image .
Of the imaginary coordinate lines that astronomers and navigators use in mapping the sky , perhaps the most important one is the ecliptic , the apparent path the sun appears to take through the sky as a result of the Earth 's revolution around it .
Because of the Earth 's yearly revolution around the sun , the sun appears to move in its annual journey through the heavens with the ecliptic as its path .
Technically then , the ecliptic represents the extension or projection of the plane of the Earth 's orbit out towards the sky .
But since the moon and planets also move in orbits , whose planes do not differ greatly from that of the Earth 's orbit , these bodies , when visible in our sky , always stay relatively close to the ecliptic line .
In other words , our solar system can be best defined as being somewhat flat , with the planets moving in very nearly the same plane .
It is for this reason that most sky charts plot the position of the ecliptic ; it is something of a warning to sky watchers that strange " stars " ( planets ) often appear near and along this path through our heavens , as well as the moon .
Usually the moon and planets are not positioned exactly on the ecliptic ( because they 're not located exactly in the same orbital plane as Earth ) , but lie within several degrees of it and form a sort of narrow strip encompassing the entire sky which we call the Zodiac .
The ecliptic runs exactly along the middle of the Zodiac .
The " Classic Twelve "
Twelve constellations through which the ecliptic passes form the Zodiac .
The name is derived from the Greek , meaning " animal circle , " and also is related to the word " zoo , " coming from the fact that most of these constellations are named for animals , such as Leo , the Lion ; Taurus , the Bull ; and Cancer , the Crab , just to name a few .
These names which can be readily identified on sky charts are familiar to millions of horoscope users ( who — ironically — would be hard pressed to find them in the actual sky ! ) .
If we could see the stars in the daytime , we would see the sun slowly wander from one constellation of the Zodiac to the next , making one complete circle around the sky in one year .
Ancient astrologers were able to figure out where the sun was on the Zodiac by noting which was the last zodiacal constellation to rise ahead of the sun , or the first to set after it .
Obviously , the sun had to be somewhere in between .
As such , each month a specific constellation was conferred the title of " House of the sun , " and in this manner each month - long period of the year was given its " sign of the Zodiac . "
Some discrepancies
Interestingly , however , the " sign " which has been assigned for a given month in the horoscope that you 'll find in your daily newspaper is not where the sun actually is for that particular month , but where it would have been several millennia ago !
This is due to the " wobble " of the Earth 's axis ( known as precession ) ; yet today 's astrologers , who believe that the sun , moon and planets mysteriously direct our lives , continue to adhere to star positions that for all intents and purposes are out of date by thousands of years !
In addition , the ecliptic crosses through the constellation of Ophiuchus , the Serpent Holder .
In fact , the sun spends more time traversing through Ophiuchus than nearby Scorpius !
It officially resides in Scorpius for less than a week : from Nov. 23 through 29 .
It then moves into Ophiuchus onNovember 30 and remains within its boundaries for more than two weeks — untilDec. 17 .
And yet the Serpent Holder is not considered a member of the Zodiac and so must defer to Scorpius !
In addition , because the Moon and planets are often positioned either just to the north or south of the ecliptic , it allows them to sometimes appear within the boundaries of a number of other non-zodiacal star patterns .
In fact , as pointed out by the well - known astronomical calculator , Jean Meeus , along with Ophiuchus , there are nine other constellations that occasionally can be visited by the Moon and planets : Auriga , the Charioteer ; Cetus , the Whale ; Corvus , the Crow ; Crater , the Cup ; Hydra , the Water Snake ; Orion , the Hunter ; Pegasus , the Flying Horse ; Scutum , the Shield ; and Sextans , the Sextant .
So in truth , there really are n't twelve zodiacal constellations , but twenty - two !
Origin of " Ecliptic "
Although the moon 's orbit is inclined 5.5 degrees to the Earth 's orbital plane , periodically there will come times when it crosses over the ecliptic .
Should this happen when the moon is at new phase , it will end up crossing in front of the sun causing a solar eclipse .
If the moon crosses over the ecliptic when the moon is at full phase , it will pass into the shadow of the Earth resulting in a lunar eclipse .
Usually when the new moon is in the vicinity of the sun it appears to pass above or below it and no eclipse occurs .
Similarly , the full moon usually misses the Earth 's shadow by sweeping above or below it .
Only when all three bodies ( sun , Earth and moon ) are on a straight line occupying the plane of the ecliptic can an eclipse occur .
Hence the name " ecliptic " : the place where eclipses occur .

Obama lawyer : Bush fixing FEC for McCain
Obama counsel Bob Bauer , on his always - punchy personal blog , considers the newest appointments to the FEC and writes that the regulatory body is being put back together to exclude a Republican commissioner who had taken a critical stance toward McCain 's attempt to thread the needle on public financing .
In this one move , the White House ended McCain 's accountability for his use or abuse of the primary public financing system while putting him in position to take money for the general .
For this maneuver to have been arranged for the benefit of Senator McCain , of all people -- the John McCain who has regularly , severely criticized the FEC as a " corrupt " agency -- is a remarkable turn in his career as a reformer .
A Commissioner who acted to enforce the law , to just raise an important question of enforcement , has been stripped of his post .
This was clearly in Senator McCain 's interest , this raw power play .
It is also in his interest to have the FEC , back in business minus Mason , arrange for his money for the fall campaign .
He goes on to make a case that 's going to be central to Obama 's logic for forgoing public financing , despite his pledge to join the system :
That McCain is a hypocrite on this reform issue .
For all the time that McCain has savaged the performance of the FEC , he has led the sizeable crowd of critics who believed that the agency is too beholden , on the whole , to the narrow interests of parties and their candidates .
Yesterday , Republicans could not have acted more narrowly in just this vein : effectively firing a Commissioner to immunize their Presidential nominee from enforcement action in a pending case but making sure that there is enough of an agency left to get him the money needed to finance his campaign .

The internet has grown quite a bit over the last ten years .
Social media platforms have exploded in popularity and there are now more ways to reach potential customers on the web than ever before .
With all of these changes , is e-mail marketing still a relevant way to think about marketing ?
Yes .
On the contrary , the power of email marketing has only grown alongside other innovations in the online world .
In many instances , email marketing is still the best form of marketing available out there to get the word out about your business .
Do n’t believe us ?
Read on and we ’ll walk you through everything you need to know about the potential of email marketing .
Everyone Uses E-Mail
Despite the popularization of other forms of online communication , e-mail still remains one of the primary ways that people communicate with one another .
There are hundreds of billions sent each and every day around the world .
These numbers far outweigh the number of users on even the most popular of social media websites like Facebook .
If you want to reach the widest possible swath of people , ensuring you have a good email marketing plan in place will make all of the difference .
It really is a wide audience too .
Young people use e-mail just as much as older folks , so you do n’t have to worry you ’re missing out on the younger crowd by marketing through the electronic mail .
E- Mail Will Deliver Your Message
There ’s a lot that is not understood about how advertising through a platform like Facebook works .
There are a lot of people out there still scarred from the reveal that the social media website was inflating their video watch numbers , tricking tons of businesses who had sunk money into the pivot to video trend .
When it comes to advertising on social media platforms , you never really know how frequently or how directly your targets are connecting with your message .
You simply do n’t have this problem when it comes to e-mail marketing .
E-mails will get in front of their client ’s eyes 90 % of the time , and most likely on the very day that you send your message out .
You ca n’t beat the efficiency of e-mail marketing in this way .
You can rest easier knowing the hard work you ’re putting in will actually get in front of your consumers .
E - Mail Has a High ROI
Of all the various forms of marketing out there , none of them have as high of a potential ROI as e-mail marketing does .
E-mail marketing has better conversion rates and is relatively cheap to employ .
You ’ll likely pay a lot less to gather and send out a message to your e-mail list than you would be paying one of the social media giants .
With a cheaper asking price and a higher rate of success , is there any reason you would n’t employ an e-mail marketing plan this year ?
Do n’t Underestimate The Power of E-mail Marketing
If you want to get the word out about your business , you truly need to understand the potential and the power of e-mail marketing .
The above information can break down why it can be so helpful to you .

Strange Ring Found Circling Dead Star
Media contact : Whitney Clavin 818-354-4673
Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif .

2008-086
Pasadena , Calif . -- NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope has found a bizarre ring of material around the magnetic remains of a star that blasted to smithereens .
The stellar corpse , called SGR 1900 +14 , belongs to a class of objects known as magnetars .
These are the cores of massive stars that blew up in supernova explosions , but unlike other dead stars , they slowly pulsate with X - rays and have tremendously strong magnetic fields .
" The universe is a big place and weird things can happen , " said Stefanie Wachter of NASA 's Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology , Pasadena , who found the ring serendipitously .
" I was flipping through archived Spitzer data of the object , and that 's when I noticed it was surrounded by a ring we 'd never seen before . "
Wachter is lead author of a paper about the findings in this week 's Nature .
You can see the ring at http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/multimedia/20080528.html
Wachter and her colleagues think that the ring , which is unlike anything ever seen before , formed in 1998 when the magnetar erupted in a giant flare .
They believe the crusty surface of the magnetar cracked , sending out a flare , or blast of energy , that excavated a nearby cloud of dust , leaving an outer , dusty ring .
This ring is oblong , with dimensions of about seven by three light - years .
It appears to be flat , or two - dimensional , but the scientists said they can't rule out the possibility of a three - dimensional shell .
" It 's as if the magnetar became a huge flaming torch and obliterated the dust around it , creating a massive cavity , " said Chryssa Kouveliotou , senior astrophysicist at NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center , Huntsville , Ala. , and a co-author of the paper .
" Then the stars nearby lit up a ring of fire around the dead star , marking it for eternity .
"
The discovery could help scientists figure out if a star 's mass influences whether it becomes a magnetar when it dies .
Though scientists know that stars above a certain mass will " go supernova , " they do not know if mass plays a role in determining whether the star becomes a magnetar or a run - of - the - mill dead star .
According to the science team , the ring demonstrates that SGR 1900 +14 belongs to a nearby cluster of young , massive stars .
By studying the masses of these nearby stars , the scientists might learn the approximate mass of the original star that exploded and became SGR 1900 +14 .
" The ring has to be lit up by something , otherwise Spitzer would n't have seen it , " said Enrico Ramirez - Ruiz of the University of California , Santa Cruz .
" The nearby massive stars are most likely what 's heating the dust and lighting it up , and this means that the magnetar , which lies at the exact center of the ring , is associated with the massive star - forming region .
" Rings and spheres are common in the universe .
Young , hot stars blow bubbles in space , carving out dust into spherical shapes .
When stars die in supernova explosions , their remains are blasted into space , forming short - lived beautiful orbs called supernova remnants .
Rings can also form around exploded stars whose expanding shells of debris ram into pre-existing dust rings , causing the dust to glow , as is the case with the supernova remnant called 1987A .
But the ring around the magnetar SGR 1900 +14 fits into none of these categories .
For one thing , supernova remnants and the ring around 1987A cry out with X - rays and radio waves .
The ring around SGR 1900 +14 only glows at specific infrared wavelengths that Spitzer can see .
At first , the astronomers thought the ring must be what 's called an infrared echo .
These occur when an object sends out a blast wave that travels outward , heating up dust and causing it to glow with infrared light .
But when they went back to observe SGR 1900 +14 later , the ring did n't move outward as it should have if it were an infrared echo .
A closer analysis of the pictures later revealed that the ring is most likely a carved - out cavity in a dust cloud -- a phenomenon that must be somewhat rare in the universe since it had not been seen before .
The scientists plan to look for more of these rings .
" This magnetar is still alive in many ways , " said Ramirez - Ruiz .
" It is interacting with its environment , making a big impact on the young star - forming region where it was born .

Remember when I blogged about strange fetishes and I promised to report back on how including certain words in the tags , article and title affected my blog traffic ?
Well it ’s been a while since the experiment began now and I can say that particular test article is my second most popular of all time .
The GREAT thing about it , is that some of those who discovered my little corner of the wordpress thanks to such shameless tactics , do appear to be sticking around for more of what this site is actually all about – so , in short , IT WORKED !
AND just so I ca n’t be accused of failing to deliver on my promises , here ’s a lady who matches the title of this entry so well , it ’s as if I did it deliberately !
Mrs. Jonathan Ross , Jane Goldman , is a bit too superstitious for my tastes .
She hosts a TV show on a Living TV that investigates white witchcraft and other new - age mumbo jumbo .
Having said that , however , she does have three very attractive things going for her .
One , her bright red hair is flippin nuts !
Nutty birds are cool .
Two , she has nice teeth .
Three .. .. well , just see for yourself !
And boy - oh - boy is he pissed at Barack Obama , citing campaign finance shenanigans while ignoring the blatant criminality of John McCain 's own shenanigans .
This anti-Obama fervor is probably to be expected -- Brooks is a smart , perceptive , conservative Republican and Obama is not a conservative Republican so I would n't expect Brooks to find his campaign appealing .
But earlier in the cycle , Brooks seemed surprisingly positive about Obama , and his current wave of detraction is a bit odd .
After all , it was just one week ago today that Brooks wrote a column on " Obama , Liberalism and the Challenge of Reform " laying down as a key test for Obama whether he would embrace an education reform agenda that goes beyond calling for more resources and " emphasize [s ] things the status quo camp does n’t : rigorous accountability and changing the fundamental structure of school systems . "
So then Obama gave a speech on economic competitiveness in which he did exactly what Brooks said he should do , but predicted he would n't do :
We can fix the failures of No Child Left Behind , while focusing on accountability .
That means providing the funding that was promised .
More importantly , it means reaching high standards , but not by relying on a single , high stakes standardized test that distorts how teachers teach .
Instead , we need to work with governors , educators and especially teachers to develop better assessment tools that effectively measure student achievement , and encourage the kinds of research , scientific investigation , and problem - solving that our children will need to compete .
And we need to recruit an army of new teachers .
I 'll make this pledge as President – if you commit your life to teaching , America will pay for your college education .
We 'll recruit teachers in math and science , and deploy them to under - staffed school districts in our inner cities and rural America .
We 'll expand mentoring programs that pair experienced teachers with new recruits .
And when our teachers succeed , I wo n't just talk about how great they are – I 'll reward their greatness with better pay and more support .
But research shows that resources alone wo n't create the schools that we need to help our children succeed .
We also need to encourage innovation – by adopting curricula and the school calendar to the needs of the 21st century ; by updating the schools of education that produce most of our teachers ; by welcoming charter schools within the public schools system , and streamlining the certification process for engineers or businesspeople who want to shift careers and teach .
We must also challenge the system that prevents us from promoting and rewarding excellence in teaching .
We cannot ask our teachers to perform the impossible – to teach poorly prepared children with inadequate resources , and then punish them when children perform poorly on a standardized test .
But if we give teachers the resources they need ; if we pay them more , and give them time for professional development ; if they are given ownership over the design of better assessment tools and a creative curricula ; if we shape reforms with teachers rather than imposing changes on teachers , then it is fair to expect better results .
Where there are teachers who are still struggling and underperforming , we should provide them with individual help and support .
And if they 're still underperforming after that , we should find a quick and fair way to put another teacher in that classroom .
Our children deserve no less .
But instead of following up on the topics , we get today 's extended rant about campaign finance reform .
It 's all very strange -- the bottom line is that Brooks is a conservative and Obama 's a liberal so there 's no real reason Brooks should like Obama but for some reason he was super - enthusiastic about him in the past and now seems unduly bitter when it turns out that , yes , Obama 's a liberal .

The news is full of headlines about Senator Clinton 's " apology " for her tone - deaf comment about the RFK assassination : " Clinton apologizes for citing RFK killing " ; " Clinton apologizes for gaffe " ; " Clinton apologizes for Kennedy comment " ; " Clinton Sorry for Remark about RFK Assassination " ; " Clinton sorry for Kennedy remark " ; and hundreds of others .
But from a linguistic point of view , these headlines are wrong .
Here 's the evidence :
Geoff Pullum 's classic post " Pete Rose and sorry statements of the third kind " ( 1/13/2004 ) offered a taxonomy of apologies , based on a pairing of syntactic structures and communicative content :
The word sorry is used in three ways .
First , sorry can be used with a complement having the form of what The Cambridge Grammar calls a content clause :
(1) I 'm sorry that the the political situation in the Holy Land is still mired in violence , because I wanted to go to Bethlehem at Christmas .
If I utter ( 1 ) , I am not apologizing ; I have never caused or defended any of the violence in the Middle East .
It 's not my fault .
I just regret that the situation persists .
This use can constitute an apology ( as Jonathan Wright reminded me when he read the first version of this post ) , but only when the content clause subject is first person as well : I 'm sorry I hit you is an apology , but I 'm sorry you were hit is not , so watch for that subject .
Second , sorry can be used with a preposition phrase headed by for with a complement noun phrase denoting a sentient creature :
(2) I 'm sorry for that poor little kitten , which seems to have figured out how to climb up a tree without having any idea how to get down .
If I utter ( 2 ) , I am not apologizing ; I never suggested to the stupid kitten that it should climb fifty feet up into a beech tree .
I 'm just expressing sympathy , as a fellow mammal , for its present plight .
And third , sorry can be used with a preposition phrase headed by for where the preposition has as its complement a subjectless gerund - participial clause or a noun phrase denoting an act :
( 3 ) a .
I 'm sorry for doing what I did ; I behaved like an utter pig , and you have a right to be angry .
(3 ) b. I 'm sorry for my actions last night ; I should never have acted that way and I want you to forgive me .
Only this third kind of use can constitute an apology , as opposed to a statement of regret about the truth of a proposition or a statement of sympathy for a fellow creature .
And here 's a transcription of what Senator Clinton said :
um I you know regret that if uh my referencing
uh that moment of trauma for our entire nation , and particularly for the Kennedy family
uh was in any way offensive .
uh I certainly had no
uh intention of that whatsoever .
MY view is that
uh we have to
look to the past , and to
our leaders , who have inspired us , and
uh give us uh
a lot to live up to ,
uh and I'm
honored to hold Senator Kennedy 's seat in the United States Senate ,
from the state of New York ,
uh and have the highest
regard
uh for
uh the entire Kennedy family .
She uses the word regret rather than sorry , so that the syntactic side of Geoff 's taxonomy needs to be adjusted a bit — but not much , since what she says is of the form " I regret that < sentence > " , which is clearly a sorry statement of type 1 .
But the sentential complement of regret in her statement continues in a curious way :
" I regret that if my referencing that moment of trauma … was in any way offensive . "
This is n't a well - formed sentence .
It appears to result from blending a sentence using regret with one using sorry :
" I regret that my referencing that moment of trauma … was in any way offensive "
" I 'm sorry if my referencing that moment of trauma … was in any way offensive . "
The " sorry if " pattern is a syntactic structure that Geoff did n't include in his taxonomy .
It might be a form of the conditional " If my referencing … was in any way offensive , ( then ) I 'm sorry " , with the apodosis put in front of the protasis .
Or maybe sorry has developed an if - complement , as in structures like " I wonder if … " or " I do n't know if … " .
In any case , from a communicative and emotional point of view , Senator Clinton 's sentence clearly belongs with Geoff 's sorry statements of the first kind .
And in fact " If my remarks were in any way offensive , I 'm sorry " is even weaker than " I 'm sorry that my remarks were in any way offensive " , since it does n't even grant that it's a fact that the remarks were in any way offensive .
We should also note that being sorry for causing offense is itself a rather weak form of sorriness , since it does n't necessarily imply being sorry for the actions or words that caused the offense .
It 's perfectly appropriate to take a stance like " I 'm sorry for offending you , but what I said was true and had to be said . "
Senator Clinton did n't go so far as to express regret for having referenced the RFK assassination , only for the fact that referencing it might have caused offense ( and only , she feels , because it was misinterpreted ) .
Of course , the offense caused by mentioning a national trauma ( and piling woes on the Kennedy family ) was small compared to the offense caused by implying that she hopes that her opponent might be killed .
I do n't think that she meant any such thing , at least consciously , but a lot of people took it that way .
There have been many other LL posts on the linguistic analysis of apologies — you can find a sample here .
Some especially useful links :
" A tin ear " , 5/6/2004 " , 5/6/2004
" Air quotes and non-apologies " , 7/4/2006
" Apologize already " , 9/18/2006
" ' Sorry ' spectacles " , 4/16/2007
" Spitzer limps through a public apology " , 7/30/2007
I particularly recommend Geoff Nunberg 's analysis of politicians ' apology rituals in his 2006 post " Apologize already " , where he observes in connection with some earlier episodes in " the contemporary theater of contrition " that :
If their remarks failed as sincere apologies , they still satisfied a social purpose .
In the contemporary theater of contrition , the point of ritualistic public apologies is n't to demonstrate that an offender is really , truly sorry , but only that public opinion has the power to exact the expression of self - abnegation ( or in Goffman 's terms , self - splitting ) that 's inherent in a formal apology .
[…]
Does anybody really care whether Pat Robertson was genuinely remorseful about suggesting that Hugo Chavez should be assassinated , or whether Charles Stimson felt a pang of conscience after attacking the lawyers representing the Guantanamo detainees ?
Sometimes , the more insincere and grudging a nonapology is , the better it makes the point : it does n't matter whether you 're really sorry — if you say this kind of stuff , you 're going to have to go out there and take it back
From this perspective , an important part of the public ritual of political apology is the question of which feelings of offense ( however allegedly misguided ) the politician feels compelled to mention .
The apologizer 's goal is to cite the narrowest possible range of offended people and reasons for offense .
Thus it's not an accident that Senator Clinton mentioned the feelings of the Kennedy family and others about mentioning RFK 's assassination , but not the feelings of those who were shocked by the implication that she should stay in the race in case her opponent is killed .

“ Beauty , ” goes the old saying , “ is in the eye of the beholder . ”
But does the beholder have to be human ?
Not necessarily , say scientists at Tel Aviv University .
Amit Kagian , an M.Sc. graduate from the TAU School of Computer Sciences , has successfully “ taught ” a computer how to interpret attractiveness in women .
Kagian published the findings in the scientific journal Vision Research .
Co-authors on the work were Kagian ’s supervisors Prof. Eytan Ruppin and Prof. Gideon Dror .
The study combined the worlds of computer programming and psychology , an example of the multidisciplinary research for which TAU is world - renowned .
But there ’s a more serious dimension to this issue that reaches beyond mere vanity .
The discovery is a step towards developing artificial intelligence in computers .
Other applications for the software could be in plastic and reconstructive surgery and computer visualization programs such as face recognition technologies .
From Mathematics to Aesthetics
" Until now , computers have been taught how to identify basic facial characteristics , such as the difference between a woman and a man , and even to detect facial expressions , " says Kagian .
“ But our software lets a computer make an aesthetic judgment .
Linked to sentiments and abstract thought processes , humans can make a judgment , but they usually do n't understand how they arrived at their conclusions . ”
In the first step of the study , 30 men and women were presented with 100 different faces of Caucasian women , roughly of the same age , and were asked to judge the beauty of each face .
The subjects rated the images on a scale of 1 through 7 and did not explain why they chose certain scores .
Kagian and his colleagues then went to the computer and processed and mapped the geometric shape of facial features mathematically .
Additional features such as face symmetry , smoothness of the skin and hair color were fed into the analysis as well .
Based on human preferences , the machine " learned " the relation between facial features and attractiveness scores and was then put to the test on a fresh set of faces .
Says Kagian , " The computer produced impressive results – its rankings were very similar to the rankings people gave . "
This is considered a remarkable achievement , believes Kagian , because it ’s as though the computer “ learned ” implicitly how to interpret beauty through processing previous data it had received .
Beauty is Golden
The notion that beauty can be boiled down to binary data and interpreted by a mathematical model is nothing new .
More than 2,000 years ago the Greek mystic , philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras observed the connection between math , geometry and beauty .
He reasoned that features of physical objects corresponding to the “ golden ratio ” were considered most attractive .
“ I know that Plato connected the good to the beautiful , ” says Kagian .
“ Personally , I believe that some kind of universal correctness to beauty exists in nature , an aesthetic interpretation of the
universal truth .
But because each of us is trapped with our own human biases and personalized viewpoints , this may detract us from finding the ultimate formula to a complete understanding of beauty . ”
Kagian , who studied under the Adi Lautman multidisciplinary program for outstanding students at Tel Aviv University , says that a possible next step is to teach computers how to recognize “ beauty ” in men .
This may be more difficult .
Psychological research has shown that there is less agreement as to what defines “ male beauty ” among human subjects .
And his own portrait , jokes Kagian , will not be part of the experiment .
“ I would probably blow up the machine , ” he says .

The Curry –Howard isomorphism is a striking relationship connecting two seemingly unrelated areas of mathematics — type theory and structural logic .
Introduction [ edit ]
The Curry –Howard isomorphism , hereafter referred to as simply CH , tells us that in order to prove any mathematical theorem , all we have to do is construct a certain type which reflects the nature of that theorem , then find a value that has that type .
This seems extremely weird at first : what do types have to do with theorems ?
However , as we shall see , the two are very closely related .
A quick note before we begin : for these introductory paragraphs , we ignore the existence of expressions like error and undefined whose denotational semantics are ⊥ .
These have an extremely important role , but we will consider them separately in due time .
We also ignore functions that bypass the type system like unsafeCoerce# .
We can build incredibly complicated types using Haskell 's higher - order functions feature .
We might want to ask the question : given an arbitrary type , under what conditions does there exist a value with that type ( we say the type is inhabited ) ?
A first guess might be ' all the time ' , but this quickly breaks down under examples .
For example , there is no function with type a -> b , because we have no way of turning something of type a into something of a completely different type b ( unless we know in advance which types a and b are , in which case we 're talking about a monomorphic function , such as ord :: Char -> Int ) .
Incredibly , it turns out that a type is only inhabited when it corresponds to a true theorem in mathematical logic .
But what is the nature of this correspondence ?
What does a type like a -> b mean in the context of logic ?
A crash course in formal logic [ edit ]
We need some background on formal logic before we can begin to explore its relationship to type theory .
This is a very brief introduction ; for a wider grounding we recommend you consult an introductory textbook on the subject matter .
In everyday language we use a lot of ' If ... then ...' sentences .
For example , ' If the weather is nice today , then we 'll walk into town ' .
These kinds of statements also crop up in mathematics ; we can say things like ' If x is positive , then it has a ( real ) square - root ' .
Formal logic is a way of representing statements which approximate English meanings with a Boolean logic on which we can do computations .
We use the A→B sign ( read as ' A implies B ' ) to indicate that B is true whenever A is true .
For example , our earlier statement could be recast as ' x is positive → x has a real square - root ' , meaning the number 's positivity implies the existence of the desired kind of root .
We 'll often use letters to stand for entire statements , so for example if W is the statement ' the weather is nice ' , and T is the statement ' we 'll walk into town ' , then we could say W → T .
Our definition of P→Q has some flaws .
If Q is some statement that is always true , no matter what the circumstances — like ' the sun is hot ' — then it does n't matter what P is .
P could even be a false statement , Q would still be true if P were true , so the implication P → Q is not considered to be proved wrong .
P → Q is defined to be true whenever P is false and whenever Q is true .
So → does n't really represent any kind of cause - effect relationship ; things like ' the sky is pink → the sun is hot ' are defined to be true .
There are other logical algebras besides Boolean logic which try to fix these " problems " [ 1 ] and we can also construct them in Haskell .
Other things that crop up lots in both everyday language and mathematics are things called conjunctions and disjunctions .
The former represent statements involving an ' and ' , the latter statements involving an ' or ' .
We could represent the statement ' I will buy this magazine if it's in stock and I have enough money ' by the symbolism ( M ∧ S ) → B {\displaystyle ( M\wedge S ) \to B} , where M = ' I have enough money ' , S = ' The magazine is in stock ' , B = ' I will buy the magazine ' .
Essentially , one can just read the symbol ∧ {\displaystyle \ wedge } as ' and ' .
Similarly , one can read the symbol ∨ {\displaystyle \vee } as ' or ' , so that the statement ' I will either walk or get the train to work or both ' could be represented as W ∨ T {\displaystyle W\vee T} , where W = ' I will walk to work ' , and T = ' I will get the train to work ' .
Using these symbols , and a few more which will be introduced as we go , we can produce arbitrarily complicated symbol strings .
There are two classes of these symbol strings : those that represent true statements , often called the theorems ; and those which represent false statements , called the nontheorems .
Note that whether a symbol string is a theorem or nontheorem depends on what the letters stand for , so P ∨ Q {\displaystyle P\vee Q} is a theorem if , for example , P represents the statement ' It is daytime ' and Q represents the statement ' It is night time ' ( ignoring exceptions like twilight ) , but it would be a nontheorem if P were ' Trees are blue ' and Q were ' All birds can fly ' .
We 'll often call a symbol string a proposition if we do n't know whether it's a theorem or not .
There are many more subtleties to the subject of logic ( including the fact that when we say ' If you eat your dinner you 'll get dessert ' we actually mean ' Only if you eat your dinner will you get dessert ' ) .
If this is a subject that interests you , there are many textbooks around that comprehensively cover the subject .
Propositions are types [ edit ]
So , given a type a -> b , what does that mean in terms of symbolistic logic ?
Handily , it simply means that a → b .
Of course , this only makes sense if a and b are types which can further be interpreted in our symbolistic logic .
This is the essence of CH .
Furthermore , as we mentioned before , a → b is a theorem if and only if a -> b is an inhabited type .
Let 's see this using one of the simplest of Haskell functions .
const has the type a -> b -> a .
Translated into logic , we have that a → b → a .
This must be a theorem , as the type a -> b -> a is inhabited by the value const .
Now , another way of expressing a → b is that ' If we assume a is true , then b must be true . '
So a → b → a means that if we assume a is true , then if we further assume that b is true , then we can conclude a .
This is of course a theorem ; we assumed a , so a is true under our assumptions .
The problem with ⊥ [ edit ]
We 've mentioned that a type corresponds to a theorem if that type is inhabited .
However , in Haskell , every type is inhabited by the value undefined .
Indeed , more generally , anything with type forall a . a , a value with denotational semantics of ⊥ , is a problem .
⊥ in type theory corresponds to inconsistency in logic ; we can prove any theorem using Haskell types because every type is inhabited .
Therefore , Haskell 's type system actually corresponds to an inconsistent logic system .
However , if we work with a limited subset of Haskell 's type system , and in particular disallow polymorphic types , we have a consistent logic system we can do some cool stuff in .
Hereafter it is assumed we are working in such a type system .
Now that we have the basics of CH , we can begin to unpack a little more the relationship between types and propositions .
Logical operations and their equivalents [ edit ]
The essence of symbolic logic is a set of propositions , such as P and Q , and different ways of combining these propositions such as Q → P or P ∨ Q {\displaystyle P\vee Q} .
These ways of combining propositions can be thought of as operations on propositions .
By CH , propositions correspond to types , so we should have that the CH equivalents of these proposition combinators are type operations , more normally known as type constructors .
We 've already seen an example of this : the implication operator → in logic corresponds to the type constructor ( -> ) .
The rest of this section proceeds to explore the rest of the proposition combinators and explain their correspondence .
Conjunction and Disjunction [ edit ]
In order for A ∧ B {\displaystyle A\wedge B} to be a theorem , both A and B must be theorems .
So a proof for A ∧ B {\displaystyle A\wedge B} amounts to proving both A and B. Remember that to prove a proposition A we find a value of type A , where A and A are CH correspondents .
So in this instance we wish to find a value that contains two sub-values : the first whose type corresponds to A , and the second whose type corresponds to B .
This sounds remarkably like a pair .
Indeed , we represent the symbol string A ∧ B {\displaystyle A\wedge B} by ( a , b ) , where a corresponds to A and b corresponds to B .
Disjunction is opposite to conjunction .
In order for A ∨ B {\displaystyle A\vee B} to be a theorem , either A or B must be a theorem .
Again , we search for a value which contains either a value of type A or a value of type B .
This is Either .
Either A B is the type which corresponds to the proposition A ∨ B {\displaystyle A\vee B} .
Falsity [ edit ]
It is occasionally useful to represent a false statement in our logic system .
By definition , a false statement is one that can't be proven .
So we 're looking for a type which is n't inhabited .
Although none of these types exist in the default libraries ( do n't get confused with the ( ) type , which has precisely one value ) , we can define one ( or for older versions of GHC that does not support Haskell2010 , we turn on the - XEmptyDataDecls flag ) :
data Void
The effect of omitting the constructors means that Void is an uninhabited type .
So the Void type corresponds to a nontheorem in our logic .
There are a few handy corollaries here :
( Void , A ) and ( A , Void ) are both uninhabited types for any type A , corresponding to the fact that F ∧ A {\displaystyle F\wedge A} A ∧ F {\displaystyle A\wedge F} F is a nontheorem .
Either Void A and Either A Void are essentially the same as A for any type A , [ 2 ] corresponding to the fact that F ∨ A {\displaystyle F\vee A} A ∨ F {\displaystyle A\vee F} F is a nontheorem , are theorems only if A is a theorem .
Any type that corresponds to a nontheorem can be replaced with Void .
This is because any nontheorem - type must be uninhabited , so replacing it with Void everywhere does n't change anything .
Void is really equivalent to any nontheorem type [ 3 ] .
As we remarked in the first section , the implication P → Q is true if Q is true , regardless of the truth value of P .
So we should be able to find a term with type Void -> a .
In fact one does exist , but it 's somewhat complicated to explain : the answer is the empty function .
We can define a function f :: A -> B as a ( probably infinite ) set of pairs whose first element is an element of A ( the domain ) and second element is f 's output on this term , an element of B ( the codomain ) .
For example , the successor function on the naturals is represented as { ( 0,1 ) , ( 1,2 ) , ( 2,3 ) , ...} .
Note that in order to be a ( total and well - defined ) function , we must have precisely one pair ( a , f a ) for each term a with type A .
The empty function , let 's call it empty is represented in this way by the empty set .
But as we must have a pair for each element of the domain , and there no pairs in our representation , the domain type must be empty , i.e. Void .
What about the range type ?
empty never produces any output , so there are no restrictions placed on the range type .
Thus , it is valid to assume that the range type has any type , so we can say empty :: forall a . Void -> a .
Unfortunately , it 's not possible to write this function in Haskell ; we 'd ideally like to write something like : empty :: Void -> a
And stop there , but this is illegal Haskell .
The closest we can come is the following : empty :: Void -> a empty _ = undefined Alternatively : empty :: Void -> a empty = empty
Another reasonable way would be to write ( valid in GHC with EmptyCase extension ) : empty x = case x of { }
The case statement is perfectly well formed since it handles every possible value of x .
Note that this is perfectly safe , since the right - hand side of this function can never be reached ( since we have nothing to pass it ) .
So , the conclusion of all this is that Void -> a is an inhabited type , just as P → Q is true if P is false .
Negation [ edit ]
The ¬ operation in logic turns theorems into nontheorems and vice versa : if A is a theorem then ¬ A is a nontheorem ; if A is a nontheorem then ¬A is a theorem .
How can we represent this in Haskell ?
The answer 's a sneaky one .
We define a type synonym :
type Not a = a ->
Void
So for a type A , Not A is just A -> Void .
How does this work ?
Well , if A was a theorem - type , then A ->
Void must be uninhabited : there 's no way any function could return any value , because the return type , Void has no values ( The function has to provide values for all inhabitants of A ) !
On the other hand , if A was a nontheorem , then A can be replaced with Void as we explored in the last section .
Then the function id :: Void ->
Void is an inhabitant of Not A , so Not A is a theorem as required ( The function does n't have to provide any values , since there are no inhabitants in its domain .
Nevertheless it 's a function — with an empty graph ) .
Axiomatic logic and the combinatory calculus [ edit ]
So far we 've only used some very basic features from Haskell 's type system .
Indeed , most of the features of logic we 've mentioned can be explored using a very basic ' programming language ' , the combinator calculus .
To fully appreciate how closely CH ties together these two areas of mathematics , we need to axiomatise both our discussion of formal logic and our discussion of programming languages .
Axiomatic logic [ edit ]
We start with two axioms about how the → operation should behave ( from now on , we assume that → is a right - associative function , i.e . A → B → C means A → ( B → C ) ) :
A → B → A ( A → B → C ) → ( A → B ) → A → C
The first axiom says that given any two propositions A and B , if we assume both A and B , we know that A is true .
The second says that if A implies that B implies C ( or equivalently , if C is true whenever A and B are true ) , and A itself implies B , then knowing A is true would be enough to conclude that C is true .
This may seem complicated , but a bit of thought reveals it to be common sense .
Imagine we have a collection of boxes of various colours , some with wheels , some with lids , such that all the red boxes with wheels also have lids , and all the red boxes have wheels .
Pick one box .
Let A = ' The box under consideration is red ' , B = ' The box under consideration has wheels ' , C = ' The box under consideration has a lid ' .
Then the second law tells us that , as A → B → C ( all red boxes with wheels also have lids ) , and A → B ( all red boxes have wheels ) , then if A ( if the box is red ) , then C must be true ( the box has a lid ) .
We also allow one inference law , called modus ponens :
If A → B , and A , then B .
This law allows us to create new theorems given old one .
It should be fairly obvious ; it is essentially the definition of what → means .
This small basis provides a simple enough logic system which is expressive enough to cover most of our discussions .
Here 's a sample proof of the law A → A in our system :
Firstly , we know the two axioms to be theorems :
A → B → A
→ → ( A → B → C ) → ( A → B ) → A → C
You 'll notice that the left - hand side of the second axiom looks a bit like the first axiom .
The second axiom guarantees that if we know that A → B → C , then we can conclude ( A → B ) → A → C .
In this case , if we let C be the same proposition as A , then we have that if A → B → A , then ( A → B ) → A → A .
But we already know A → B → A , that was the first axiom .
Therefore , we have that ( A → B ) → A → A is a theorem .
If we further let B be the proposition C → A , for some other proposition C , then we have that if A → C → A , then A → A .
But , again , we know that A → C → A ( it 's the first axiom again ) , so A → A , as we wanted .
This example demonstrates that given some simple axioms and a simple way to make new theorems from old , we can derive more complicated theorems .
It may take a while to get there — here we had several lines of reasoning to prove just that the obvious statement A → A is a theorem ! — but we get there in the end .
This kind of formalisation is attractive because we have essentially defined a very simple system , and it is very easy to study how that system works .
Combinator calculus [ edit ]
The lambda calculus is a way of defining a simple programming language from a very simple basis .
If you have n't already read the chapter that was just linked to , we recommend you read at least the introductory sections on the untyped version of the calculus .
Here 's a refresher in case you 're feeling dusty .
A lambda term is one of three things :
A value , v .
, .
A lambda abstraction λ x .
t {\displaystyle \lambda x.t} t is another lambda term .
is another lambda term .
An application ( t 1 t 2 ) {\displaystyle ( t_{ 1}t_ { 2} ) } t 1 {\displaystyle t_ {1}} t 2 {\displaystyle t_{2}}
There is one reduction law , too , called beta-reduction :
( ( λ x . t 1 ) t 2 ) {\displaystyle ( ( \lambda x.t_ {1} ) t_{2} ) } t 1 [ x := t 2 ] {\displaystyle t_ {1}[ x:=t_ {2} ] } t 1 [ x := t 2 ] {\displaystyle t_ {1}[ x:=t_ {2} ] } t 1 {\displaystyle t_ {1}} x replaced with t 2 {\displaystyle t_{2}}
As mentioned in the lambda calculus article , the difficulty comes when trying to pin down the notion of a free occurrence of an identifier .
The combinator calculus was invented by the American mathematician Haskell Curry ( after whom a certain programming language is named ) because of these difficulties .
There are many variants on the basic combinator calculus , but we consider one of the simplest here .
We start with two so - called combinators :
K takes two values and returns the first .
In the lambda calculus , K = λ x y .
x {\displaystyle \mathbf { K} =\lambda xy.\ x}
takes two values and returns the first .
In the lambda calculus , S takes a binary function , a unary function and a value , and applies that value and the value passed into the unary function to the binary function .
again , in the lambda calculus : S = λ x y z .
x z ( y z ) {\displaystyle \mathbf { S} =\lambda xyz . \ xz( yz ) }
The first function you should recognise as const .
The second is more complicated , it is the monadic function ap in the ( (-> ) e ) monad ( which is essentially Reader ) .
These two combinators form a complete basis for the entire lambda calculus .
Every lambda calculus program can be written using just these two functions .
Sample proofs [ edit ]
Intuitionistic vs classical logic [ edit ]
So far , all of the results we have proved are theorems of intuitionistic logic .
Let 's see what happens when we try to prove the basic theorem of classical logic , Not Not A -> A .
Recall that this translates as ( ( A -> Void ) -> Void ) ->
A .
So , given a function of type ( A -> Void ) ->
Void we need a function of type A . Now a function of type ( A -> Void ) ->
Void exists precisely if type A ->
Void is uninhabited , or in other words if type A is inhabited .
So we need a function which takes any inhabited type , and returns an element of that type .
Although it is simple enough to do this on a computer - we need only find the " simplest " or " first " inhabitant of each type - there is no way to do this using standard lambda - calculus or combinator techniques .
So we see that this result cannot be proved using these two techniques , and hence that the underlying logic is intuitionistic rather than classical .
Instead , consider a traditional error handling function which calls throw when an error occurs , transferring computation to catch .
The throw function cancels any return value from the original function , so it has type A ->
Void , where A is the type of its arguments .
The catch function then takes the throw function as its argument , and , if the throw triggers ( i.e. returns a Void ) will return the argument of the throw function .
So the type of catch is ( ( A -> Void ) -> Void ) -> A . [ 4 ]
Notes
The first study to determine the global threat status of 21 species of wide - ranging oceanic pelagic sharks and rays reveals serious overfishing and recommends key steps that governments can take to safeguard populations .
These findings and recommendations for action are published in the latest edition of Aquatic Conservation : Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems .
This international study , organised by the IUCN Shark Specialist Group ( SSG ) , was conducted by 15 scientists from 13 different research institutes around the world , with additional contributions from scores of other SSG members .
The experts determined that 16 out of the 21 oceanic shark and ray species that are caught in high seas fisheries are at heightened risk of extinction due primarily to targeted fishing for valuable fins and meat as well as indirect take in other fisheries .
In most cases , these catches are unregulated and unsustainable .
The increasing demand for the delicacy ' shark fin soup ' , driven by rapidly growing Asian economies , means that often the valuable shark fins are retained and the carcasses discarded .
Frequently , discarded sharks and rays are not even recorded .
Sharks and rays are particularly vulnerable to overfishing due to their tendency to take many years to become sexually mature and have relatively few offspring .
" Fishery managers and regional , national and international officials have the opportunity and the obligation to halt and reverse the rate of loss of biodiversity and ensure sharks and rays are exploited sustainably . " says lead author Nicholas Dulvy from the Centre for Environment , Fishers and Aquaculture Science , Lowestoft Laboratory in Lowestoft , UK .
" The current rate of biodiversity loss is ten to a hundred times greater than historic extinction rates , and as humans make increasing use of ocean resources it is possible that many more aquatic species , particularly sharks , are coming under threat , " says Dulvy , now based at Simon Fraser University , Vancouver .
" This does not have to be an inevitability .
With sufficient public support and resulting political will , we can turn the tide . "
The group 's specific recommendations for governments address the need to :
Establish and enforce science - based catch limits for sharks and rays
Ensure an end to shark finning ( removing fins and discarding bodies at sea )
Improve the monitoring of fisheries taking sharks and rays
Invest in shark and ray research and population assessment
Minimize incidental catch ( ' bycatch ' ) of sharks and rays
Cooperate with other countries to conserve shared populations .
" The traditional view of oceanic sharks and rays as fast and powerful too often leads to a misperception that they are resilient to fishing pressure , " said Sonja Fordham , co-author of the paper and Deputy Chair , IUCN Shark Specialist Group and Policy Director , Shark Alliance .
" Despite mounting evidence of decline and increasing threats to these species , there are no international catch limits for oceanic sharks .
Our research shows that action is urgently needed on a global level if these fisheries are to be sustainable . "
Conyers mulls hearings over McClellan revelations Nick Juliano

Print This Email This ( Updates at bottom : McClellan tells CNN he'd ' be happy ' to testify ; Perino suggests White House could block )
Lawyers working for the House Judiciary Committee are meeting with former White House spokesman Scott McClellan regarding the explosive revelations contained in his new tell - all memoir , and the committee 's chairman says he may renew hearings on the administration 's leak of a CIA officer 's identity now that new details have been published .
Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) said he was bothered by the accounts in What Happened : Inside the Bush White House and Washington 's Culture of Deception , McClellan 's just - published memoir .
" I find Mr. McClellan 's revelations about attempts to cover - up the Valerie Plame leak extremely troubling , " the Judiciary chairman said in a statement released Friday .
" Particularly disturbing is McClellan 's assertion that he was specifically directed by Andy Card to ' vouch ' for Scooter Libby after the investigation had begun , which , if true , could amount to obstruction of justice beyond that for which Mr. Libby has already been convicted .
" I believe this issue may require closer examination so I have instructed my counsels to begin discussions with Mr. McClellan to determine whether a hearing is necessary and to secure his possible cooperation . "
Judiciary Committee member Rep. Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) already has called for McClellan to testify under oath about his book .
In the book , McClellan suggests that vice presidential aide I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby and former Bush confidant Karl Rove may have privately discussed their involvement in the Plame scandal as the Justice Department was beginning its investigation .
Both men released information about the former covert agent to reporters in attempt to discredit her husband , former Ambassador Joe Wilson , who was criticizing the White House 's faulty intelligence about Iraq 's weapons programs .
Libby was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice before President Bush commuted his sentence .
Rove avoided any official sanctions for his involvement in the leak .
After resigning his White House post , he 's gone on to be a commentator for Fox News , columnist for Newsweek and freelance political operative .
McClellan says he'd ' be happy ' to testify " Former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan said Friday he would be willing to comply with a possible congressional subpoena to discuss the administrations handling of pre-war intelligence , telling CNNs Wolf Blitzer hed be ' happy to talk if I am asked to testify , ' " CNN 's Political Ticker blog reports .
Earlier today at the afternoon press briefing , Press Secretary Dana Perino was asked , " Could the White House block him from testifying , if he wanted to testify ? "
" Conceivably ? " Perino asked .
" Yes , " the reporter said .
" Hypothetically , which I m not supposed to answer a hypothetical , yes , I think so , " Perino said .
" The law would allow for that .
But by saying that , I m not suggesting that thats what would happen or not happen . "
Think Progress observes , " It s not clear on what grounds the White House would be able to block McClellan ... in a Washington Post chat today , McClellan confirmed that White House officials reviewed his ' final manuscript for classification and privilege issues , ' and they found ' no issues relating to classified information . '
They did , however , ' bring up some issues ' relating to executive privilege . "
If discussions on barring McClellan are raised in the White House , Perino should be able to provide details to the press at future briefings .
Ed Gillespie , a White House counselor and one of Bush 's closest advisers , tells the Associated Press that Perino is " at the table on everything that 's done here . "
That means Oval Office access as well as participation in top - level meetings to debate and make decisions about policy , planning , legislative strategy and other matters , the AP reports .
" I do n't want for attendance or invitations , " Perino told the AP .
" And on the rare occasions I have not been `on a list , ' I 've been able to appeal . "
President Bush , in what the White House said was his first interview with online news organizations , declined to say Tuesday that he had been misled leading up to the war in Iraq five years ago .
Speaking with Mike Allen , chief political writer of Politico.com , Bush covered an eclectic collection of topics -- including the erroneous intelligence that formed part of the foundation of his case for invading Iraq , his choices for building a top - dollar baseball team , and his rating of the comedians cast as him and his father on NBC ’s “ Saturday Night Live . ”
( He chose Dana Carvey ’s George H.W. Bush over Will Ferrell ’s George W. Bush . )
The interview , a joint effort by the online and paper political journal and the Internet portal Yahoo.com , was posted in transcript , video; lang=en%27%2C%27playerWindow%27%2C%27width=792%2Cheight=666%2Cs crollbars=no%27 ) ) ;%22 and news - report formats about six hours after Bush talked with Allen at the White House .
Answering a question submitted online -- whether he thought he had been misled about Iraq -- Bush said he felt Saddam Hussein ’s regime did have weapons of mass destruction .
“ You know , ‘ mislead ’ is a strong word ; it almost connotes some kind of intentional -- I do n’t think so .
. . .
Intelligence communities all across the world shared the same assessment .
And so I was disappointed to see how flawed our intelligence was , ” Bush said .

“ Do I think somebody lied to me ?
No , I do n’t , ” he went on .
He said he thought “ they analyzed the situation and came up with the wrong conclusion . ”
Members of Congress were told , as was he , Bush said , that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction , and they voted for the resolution supporting the war .
“ And , of course , the political heat gets on , and they start to run and try to hide from their votes , ” he added .
His decision to give up golf in 2003 was a result of the war , he said .
“ I do n’t want some mom whose son may have recently died to see the commander in chief playing golf .
. . .
I think playing golf during a war just sends the wrong signal . ”
When his father ordered troops to the Persian Gulf in the summer of 1990 , he was criticized for regularly golfing .
Bush was particularly tart in response to criticism from former President Carter .
Told that Carter had said the next president could change the United States ’ image in 10 minutes by promising in the inaugural address to rule out torture of prisoners or attacks on other countries unless U.S. security was directly threatened , Bush said : “ What he really is implying is -- or some imply . . . if you want to be popular in the Middle East , just go blame Israel for every problem . ”

Responding to questions about his climate - change policies , he said that he could have signed the Kyoto Protocol , which set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions but which he described as a “ lousy treaty . ”
He added : “ I do n’t think you want your president trying to be the cool guy and not end up with policies that actually make a difference . ”
Bush offered an acknowledgment that Sen. Barack Obama , an African American , would probably be the Democratic nominee .
Asked whether the nation was facing “ a kind of ugly conversation about race this fall , ” he responded that “ race will only enter in if it ’s provoked by the press . ”
As for his baseball pick , his first choice to build a team is Chase Utley of the Philadelphia Phillies .
“ There ’s nothing better than having a good person up the middle that can hit , ” said Bush , a former part - owner of the Texas Rangers .

WHEN Raúl Castro took over the presidency of Cuba from his ailing brother , Fidel , last month his acceptance speech to the National Assembly included a teasing hint .
“ Within weeks ” , he promised , some of the restrictions that circumscribe Cubans ' daily lives would be lifted .
That set off a public guessing game .
Would an unpopular dual - currency system be modified and the local Cuban peso , in which wages are paid , be revalued ?
Long queues formed at exchange houses as Cubans rushed to swap “ convertible ” pesos for their lowlier counterpart .
Others hoped for a lifting of curbs on foreign travel , or at least for permission for Cubans to stay in tourist hotels in their own country .
But Mr Castro 's plans have so far been more modest .
According to an official memo , the government is to lift a ban on the purchase of computers , DVD players and microwaves .
Next year , air conditioners should be available .
Cubans can also look forward to the right to buy an electric toaster by 2010 .
Days later news broke that private farmers will be allowed to buy their own supplies , rather than these being assigned by the state .
The government is able to widen access to consumer electronics because Venezuelan aid has allowed it to overhaul the electricity grid .
Officials also know that the grid will not immediately be overwhelmed : monthly wages average $ 17 .
For those who do n't receive remittances from relatives abroad , electronic gadgets will remain unaffordable .
Even for those who do they will be expensive : they will only be available in state - owned shops that apply a mark - up of around 200 % .
Nevertheless , lifting the ban on buying computers came as a surprise .
Officials have long regarded the internet with suspicion .
The government has set up a Cuban intranet , which is all that is available in schools and universities .
Internet accounts are available only to foreigners , or to favoured Cubans for research purposes .
Officials blame this on a lack of bandwidth .
They have a point : the United States government has blocked plans for a fibre - optic link to an undersea cable in American waters ( so Venezuela 's Hugo Chávez is now building a similar link to his country ) .
But the official mood might be changing .
“ I think the leadership now recognises that when it comes to the internet the genie is out of the bottle , and they have to live with it , ” says a foreign diplomat in Havana .
Cubans have become remarkably inventive at getting online .
Doctors and academics with internet access rent their passwords so that others can use them after office hours .
Some entrepreneurs have smuggled in satellite receivers to connect to the internet ; they then sell accounts to their neighbours .
The digital age has opened the odd crack in the state 's information monopoly .
At a meeting in January Ricardo Alarcón , the assembly president , struggled to explain to computer - science students why Cubans should be banned from travelling abroad .
A video of the meeting was promptly posted on YouTube .
Another small sign that Raúl Castro is probably prepared to tolerate more debate than his brother did is the survival of Generación Y , a blog written in Havana by Yoani Sánchez , a young Cuban woman who posts her entries from tourist hotels or from one of Havana 's few internet cafés .
In a post this week she predicted that at the current rate of progress , by 2050 Cubans might be allowed satellite television .
We 've featured the rocket belt in the past , and even some cool footage from a jet pack convention , and now comes a new jet pack from Jet Pack International !
" These turbine jet packs are supposed to have much greater flight time and be much safer than traditional jet pack technology .
It is supposed to travel 16 km without refueling . "
Not too shabby .
The consumer model will come with all the training necessary to fly it safely and will run $ 226,000 .
Damnit !
That 's a quarter of a million dollars -- I do n't have that kind of dough .
Maybe if I tell them I do n't want the training course I can get it for cheaper .
I absolutely must have one though , I promised myself I would n't die until I 've made love with a jetpack on .
A MUST SEE VIDEO OF ONE OF THEIR EARLIER PACKS IN ACTION AFTER THE JUMP .
IT 'S AWESOME !

Back in the year 1984 , there was no Gizmodo to warn you away from lousy gadgets .
Instead , you had to take your chances on products that you saw on TV .
If you actually sent away $ 34.95 for one of these Music Vests after seeing the commercial , however , you get no sympathy from me .
Although it does look like a sweet accessory for hanging out ( read : break dancing ) .
Hit the jump for this unbelievably amazing video .

The bloody moment a matador is gored by a bull
This is the moment matador Jose Tomas was gored during a bullfight .
The crowd looked on in horror as it charged the 32 - year - old bullfighter and tossed him in the air .
Yet Tomas managed to recover and kill the bull , triumphantly showing off the ear in traditional fashion .

Jose Tomas is gored during a bullfight in Spain yesterday
The bull gores the matador as he lays on the ground
The incident happened at the ' El Coso de los Califas ' Bullring in Cordoba .
Tomas left the ring in 2002 , at the peak of his career , without saying why , and returned to the bullring a year ago .
He told the newspaper El Pais in May last year that he was coming back because “ living without bullfighting is not living ” .

Jose Tomas lies on the arena , unable to escape the bull 's charge
The bull appears to be playing with his enemy as it tosses him in the air
Success in bullfighting is a question of having a unique style , a personal flair that breaks the mould that usually makes one matador virtually indistinguishable from the next , and in this Tomas excels , said veteran critic Juan Belmonte of Canal Sur television in Seville .
Tomas gets up very close to the bull - both before luring it into a charge and as it rumbles by - and looks relaxed and natural in his bravado , showing utter disregard for all the danger , Belmonte said .
“ You realize that the guy out there gives the impression that he does not care if he dies right then , ” Belmonte said .
Spattered with blood , the matador stands and recovers himself after being tackled by the bull

" For bureaucratic reasons , we settled on one issue , weapons of mass destruction , because it was the one reason everyone could agree on , " Wolfowitz was quoted as saying in Vanity Fair magazine 's July issue .
No chemical or biological weapons have been found in Iraq despite repeated assertions by President George W Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair before the March 20 invasion that the threat posed by Saddam 's vast stocks of banned weapons warranted a war to eliminate them .
The United Nations and America 's allies were not convinced by the argument that it was justification for a war , which was launched amid protests in many world capitals .
Washington 's ties with major allies France and Germany are still strained .
Wolfowitz said another reason for the invasion had been " almost unnoticed but huge " - namely that the ousting of Saddam would allow the United States to remove its troops from Saudi Arabia , where their presence had long been a major al - Qaeda grievance .
" Just lifting that burden from the Saudis is itself going to open the door " to a more peaceful Middle East , Wolfowitz was quoted as saying .
The magazine said he made the remarks days before suicide bombings , attributed to al - Qaeda , against Western targets in Riyadh and Casablanca two weeks ago had killed 75 people .
The United States announced last month that it was ending military operations in Saudi Arabia , where they have long generated Arab resentment because of their proximity to Islam 's holiest sites .
Wolfowitz 's remarks were released a day after US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , seeking to explain why no weapons of mass destruction had been found , said Iraq may have destroyed them before the US - led invasion .
Please join the ACLU and CrooksandLiars and demand a call for an Independent Counsel to investigate the Administration ’s approval of Torture and Abuse .
In a stunning admission to ABC news Friday night , President Bush declared that he knew his top national security advisers discussed and approved specific details of the CIA ’s use of torture .
Bush reportedly told ABC , “ I ’m aware our national security team met on this issue .
And I approved . ”
Bush also defended the use of waterboarding .
“ We have always known that the CIA ’s use of torture was approved from the very top levels of the U.S. government , yet the latest revelations about knowledge from the president himself and authorization from his top advisers only confirms our worst fears , ” said Anthony D. Romero , Executive Director of the ACLU .
“ It is a very sad day when the president of the United States subverts the Constitution , the rule of law , and American values of justice . ”
The American Civil Liberties Union is calling on Congress to demand an independent prosecutor to investigate possible violations by the Bush administration of laws including the War Crimes Act , the federal Anti-Torture Act , and federal assault laws ... read on
I have n't heard so much as a peep out of the fanboys and villagers about this ?
Have you ?
Really , where is the Media on this issue .
Why are n't they running segments demanding answers to questions ?
How often did we hear that Abu Ghraib was a few bad apples ?
And as we know , John McCain approves of the CIA 's use of torture now .... I think it 's time we start a call / email / fax / letter writing project to demand an Independent Counsel on this issue from Congress and a blitz to the media asking them why they have been silent on this fact .
Many thanks to the ACLU for jumping in the middle of this .
Also , what is Hillary , Obama and McCain 's thoughts on this ?
They need to weigh in ?
Please join C&L and the ACLU in getting the word out :
Would you like a digital device embeded under your skin which would act as a phone ?
Imagine this : your phone is ringing and instead of searching your pockets or bag , you touch your arm and a digital phone tattoo appears , becoming a usable interface for talking and making calls .
Does it sound like Science Fiction ?
It should be but was actually entered into the Greener Design Competition .
This “ concept ” continues by suggesting that your blood and glucose will generate the electricity to run this digital tattoo .
Moreover , it is an actual permanent device which is embeded under your skin .
I understand that the “ Green ” Trend is a big thing and many designers flock to the need and fame , but it should deserve some kind of feasible theory … do n’t you think ?
Can we find a few immediate things that are out of the ordinary in this concept ?
– Invisible tattoo “ activated ” by a touch to your skin
– Tattoo is actually a usable phone
– Electricity is created by Blood and Glucose
I am certain we can continue the list and come up with some other reasons why this is not necessarily possible or desired .
Either way , if you had a chance to get this kind of tattoo , completely working and usable … would you ?

The British nationals , who were either visiting or living in the country as residents , have failed to make contact with friends or family in the UK in the six days since the cyclone devastated the south - east Asian country .
The Foreign Office emphasised that poor communications in the aftermath of the disaster could be the reason , saying that it had received no reports of British casualties .
I 'm jazzed to see Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull , but my anticipation is dimmed somewhat by the inevitable ensuing upturn in fedora sales .
When I go to San Diego Comic - Con this July , I fully expect to see fedoras popping up like mushrooms on the damp lawn of fandom .
It 's not the cosplayers that I 'm concerned with – at least they 're aware they 're playing dress up .
It 's the folks who say , " Wow , that hat looks so good on Indy , I 'm sure it will look just as good with my pre-faded ColecoVision T - shirt . "

I hear the Motion Picture Association of America is now rating movies higher on the adultitude scale if they feature smoking , on the grounds that onscreen cigarette puffing influences people to take up the habit themselves .
While I think movie fedoras have the same effect , I 'm not calling for anything that drastic .
I think a disclaimer in 5 - foot - tall letters at the beginning of the movie would be fine .
Something like :
" WARNING : Indiana Jones is a fictional character .
His movies are all set decades ago .
He is more physically attractive than 98 percent of humanity .
These are all reasons you should not attempt to dress like him . "
See how much that would benefit humanity ( except for the hat - selling portion of humanity ) ?
That 's not the only sartorial tragedy that could be prevented by a stern warning at the beginning of a Hollywood blockbuster .
For instance :
" WARNING :
This movie is set in a magical land with soaring dragons , powerful , reality - warping wizards and people who can wear hooded cloaks without looking like complete dorks .
None of these things exist in real life . "
" WARNING :
In this movie , black , ankle - length dusters make the main characters look mysterious .
If you wear one to the local 7 - Eleven , the only mystery will be whether you think you know karate but do n't , or whether you think you know kung fu but do n't . "
" WARNING :
The extremely cool facial hair styles the bad guys have in this movie , if worn by someone with a body mass index over 30 , will make that person look like a ' 40s - era hotel clerk . "
Come to think of it , fashion choices are n't the only problem .
Lots of movies are fine in the theater , but have an unfortunate tendency to leak all over the real world .
My solution : more warnings .
" WARNING : A character in this comedy talks about sex a lot in a funny accent .
This guarantees that most of the people who see it will immediately start quoting it in a poor imitation of the accent .
This will become incredibly tiresome before you even get to the car . "
" WARNING : This movie contains punch lines .
If you repeat these punch lines to people who have already seen the movie , they may laugh .
Do not take this as a sign that you , yourself , are funny .
This will only lead to disappointment and , in extreme cases , dismemberment . "
" WARNING : This movie takes place in space .
This means that it will be unrealistic in about 500 different ways .
While we encourage you to debate this in online forums , because such chatter translates into merchandise sales via some mechanism we do n't fully understand , we are obliged to caution you that most people you encounter will tune you out for the rest of your life once you use the phrase inertial compensators . "
" WARNING : Yes , we know many of you want to have sex with one or more actresses in this movie .
That 's why we put them in the film .
Declaring that you would be willing to sleep with them establishes nothing but your sexual orientation , and declaring that you would not be willing to sleep with them establishes nothing but your capacity for self - delusion . "
" WARNING :
The key lines from this movie will soon be attached to pictures of adorable kitties .
You will find this inexplicably funny , and this fact will make you hate yourself . "

Sad Explanations for Supernatural Phenomena
I started thinking about the problems inherent in social news sites recently due to a roundabout set of circumstances .
Jeff Atwood wrote a blog post entitled It 's Clay Shirky 's Internet , We Just Live In
It which linked to a post he made in 2005 titled A Group Is Its Own Worst Enemy which linked to my post on the issues I 'd seen with kuro5hin , an early social news site which attempted to " fix " the problems with Slashdot 's model but lost its technology focus along the way .
A key fact about online [ and offline ] communities is that the people who participate the most eventually influence the direction and culture of the community .
Kuro5hin tried to fix two problems with Slashdot , the lack of a democratic voting system and the focus on mindless link propagation instead of deeper , more analytical articles .
I mentioned how this experiment ended up in my post Jeff linked to which is excerpted below
Now five years later , I still read Slashdot every day but only check K5 out every couple of months out of morbid curiosity .
The democracy of K5 caused two things to happen that tended to drive away the original audience .
The first was that the focus of the site ended up not being about technology mainly because it is harder for people to write technology articles than write about everyday topics that are nearer and dearer to their hearts .
Another was that there was a steady influx of malicious users who eventually drove away a significant proportion of K5's original community , many of whom migrated to HuSi .
This issue is lamented all the time on K5 in comments such as an exercise for rusty and the editors .
and You do n't understand the nature of what happened .
Besides the malicious users one of the other interesting problems we had on K5 was that the number of people who actually did things like rate comments was very small relative to the number of users on the site .
Anytime proposals came up for ways to fix these issues , there would often be someone who disregarded the idea by stating that we were " seeking a technical solution to a social problem " .
This interaction between technology and social behavior was the first time I really thought about social software .
The common theme underscoring both problems that hit the site is that they are all due to the cost of participation .
It is easier to participate if you are writing about politics during an election year than if you have to write some technical article about the feasibility of adding garbage collection to C++ or analysis of distributed computing technologies .
So users followed the path of least resistance .
Similarly , cliques of malicious users and trolls have lots of time on their hands by definition and Kuro5hin never found a good way to blunt their influence .
Slashdot 's system of strong editorial control and meta-moderation of comment ratings actually turned out to be strengths compared to kuro5 hin 's more democratic and libertarian approach .
This line of thinking leads me to Giles Bowkett very interesting thoughts about social news sites like Slashdot , Digg and Reddit in his post Summon Monsters ?
Open Door ?
Heal ?
Or Die ?
where he wrote
A funny thing about these sites is that they know about this problem .
Hacker News is very concerned about not turning into the next Reddit ; Reddit was created as a better Digg ; and Digg 's corporate mission statement is " at least we 're not Slashdot . "
None of them seem to realize that the order from least to most horrible is identical to the order from youngest to oldest , or that every one of them was good once and is n't any longer .
...
When you build a system where you get points for the number of people who agree with you , you are building a popularity contest for ideas .
However , your popularity contest for ideas will not be dominated by the people with the best ideas , but the people with the most time to spend on your web site .
Votes appear to be free , like contribution is with Wikipedia , but in reality you have to register to vote , and you have to be there frequently for your votes to make much difference .
So the votes are n't really free - they cost time .
If you do the math , it 's actually quite obvious that if your popularity contest for ideas inherently , by its structure , favors people who waste their own time , then your contest will produce winners which are actually losers .
The most popular ideas will not be the best ideas , since the people who have the best ideas , and the ability to recognize them , also have better things to do and better places to be .
Even if you did n't know about the long tail , you 'd look for the best ideas on Hacker News ( for example ) not in its top 10 but in its bottom 1000 , because any reasonable person would expect this effect - that people who waste their own time have , in effect , more votes than people who value it - to elevate bad but popular ideas and irretrievably sink independent thinking .
And you would be right .
TechCrunch is frequently in HN 's top ten .
I agree with everything excerpted above except for the implication that all of these sites want to be " better " than their predecessors .
I believe that Digg simply wants to be more popular ( i.e. garner more page views ) than its predecessors and competitors .
If the goal of a site is to generate page views then a there is nothing wrong with a popularity contest .
However the most popular ideas are hardly ever the best ideas , they are often simply the most palatable to the target audience .
As a user , being popular in such online communities requires two things ; being prolific and knowing your audience .
If you know your audience , it is n't hard to always generate ideas that will be popular with them .
And once you start generating content on a regular basis , you eventually become an authority .
This is what happened with MrBabyMan of Digg ( and all the other Top Diggers ) who has submitted thousands of articles to the site and voted on tens of thousands of articles .
This is also what happened with Signal 11 of Slashdot almost a decade ago ( damn , I 'm getting old ) .
In both the case of MrBabyMan ( plus other Top Diggers ) and Signal 11 , some segment of the user base eventually cottoned on to the fact that participation in a social news site is a game and rallied against the users who are " winning " the game .
Similarly in both cases , the managers of the community tried to blunt the rewards of being a high scorer - in Slashdot 's case it was with the institution of the karma cap while Digg did it by getting rid of the list of top Diggers .
Although turning participation in your online community into a game complete with points and a high score table is a good tactic to gain an initial set of active users , it does not lead to a healthy or diverse community in the long run .
Digg and Slashdot both eventually learned this and have attempted to fix it in their own ways .
Social news sites like Reddit & Digg also have to contend with the fact that the broader their audience gets the less controversial and original their content will be since the goal of such sites is to publish the most broadly popular content on the front page .
Additionally , ideas that foster group think will gain in popularity as the culture and audience of the site congeals .
Once that occurs , two things will often happen to the site ( i ) growth will flatten out since there is now a set audience and culture for the site and ( ii ) the original crop of active users will long for the old days and gripe a lot about how things have changed .
This has happened to Slashdot , Kuro5hin , Reddit and every other online community I 've watched over time .
This is cycle and fundamental flaw of social news sites will always happen because A Group Is Its Own Worst Enemy .
Now Playing : Notorious B.I.G. - You 're Nobody ( Til Somebody Kills You )
OSLO ( Reuters ) - A hoax scientific study pointing to ocean bacteria as the overwhelming cause of global warming fooled some skeptics on Thursday who doubt growing evidence that human activities are to blame .
Laden with scientific jargon and published online in the previously unknown “ Journal of Geoclimatic Studies ” based in Japan , the report suggested the findings could be “ the death of manmade global warming theory . ”
Skeptics jumped on the report .
A British scientist e-mailed the report to 2,000 colleagues before spotting it was a spoof .
Another from the U.S. called it a “ blockbuster . ”
Blogger skeptic Neil Craig wrote : “ This could not be more damaging to manmade global warming theory ... I somehow doubt if this is going to be on the BBC news . ”
It was not clear who was behind the report , which said bacteria in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans emitted at least 300 times more carbon dioxide than industrial activity -- a finding that , if true , would overturn the widely held view of scientists that burning fossil fuels are the main cause of warming .
But scientists knocked the report down .
“ The whole story is a hoax , ” Deliang Chen , professor of Meteorology at Gothenburg University in Sweden , told Reuters .
He said two “ authors ” listed as from his University were unknown .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
A small plane crashed into several homes in a neighborhood outside London Sunday afternoon , killing all five on board , Scotland Yard reported .
The private aircraft , with a two - person crew and three passengers on board , apparently hit the roof of a residential building in the town of Farnborough , about 25 km ( 15 miles ) southeast of London .
One house was destroyed and part of a neighboring property was damaged , said the London Fire Brigade , which sent eight fire engines and 40 firefighters to battle the blaze .
The identities of the dead had not been released late Sunday .
Watch witnesses describe the ball of fire »
There were no serious injuries reported on the ground .
Ian Todd , assistant director of operations for London Ambulance Services , said one person who suffered an asthma attack and another who suffered shock as a result of the crash were treated at a nearby hospital .
The homeowners of the destroyed residence were away on vacation , neighbors said .
Gary Wallcraft said he was playing soccer nearby when he saw " a white thing coming towards me . "
The aircraft pulled up and appeared to clip some trees , he said .
" All I heard was a big explosion , " Wallcraft said .
" Everyone was running around and panicking . "
A spokeswoman for Biggin Hill airport in Kent said a Cessna Citation Jet reported difficulty shortly after leaving the airport .
The pilot contacted air traffic control at Biggin Hill and asked to return , she said -- but before he could make it back , the aircraft hit the houses in Farnborough .
Britain's Air Accident Investigation
Unit has been informed of the crash , she said .
Scotland Yard said the aircraft went down at about 2:37 p.m. ( 9:37 a.m. ET ) .
According to Todd , fire services were unable to approach the wreckage for three hours because of the safety concerns .
" The prime consideration is safety , " Todd said .
" There is aviation fuel involved , and also gas canisters have been located at the scene of the incident which are currently being cooled to make it safe to approach . "

I think it 's pretty obvious what each method is doing .
There is now an " ActiveRecord : : Dirty " : https://caboo.se/doc/classes/ActiveRecord/Dirty.html module that was added to the ActiveRecord : : Base class .
Now there are ways to ask the model itself ( # changed ? , # changes ) or ask each attribute individually by just appending the _changed ? , _was and so forth .
This all looks fine and dandy , but remember : we addressed the first bullet in my list .
There is a second problem : * data consistency * .
The problem arises when we consider that 2 users could be updating the same model at the same time !!
In the older version , this could also happen and the strategy was : _" the last one to update wins . " _
Which could not be the best way but at least we could be assured that every attributed in the model would make sense at least from the point of view of one of the users .
With this new feature , User A updates 1 attribute. , then User B updates 2 different attributes in the same row , and now we have 3 potentially inconsistent columns merged into the same row .
This can get out of hand very fast .
Database concurrency is not a novel thing .
We know at least 2 tricks to make this work , one is " * Pessimistic Locking * " : https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Locking/Pessimistic.html, where the first user acquires a lock from the database and avoids any other user to edit the same row at once .
But in a web based system , this is obviously not recommended .
The second option is " * Optimistic Locking * " : https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Locking/Optimistic.html.
The way to enable it is to add a column named ' lock_version ' of type integer and with the default initial value of ' 0 ' .
Now : * User A and User B loads the same row .
* User A finished his work first and then updates the row .
* The ' lock_version ' column is incremented to 1 . * Then User B finishes and tries to update , but his operation will fail because the generated SQL update command will search for ' lock_version = 0 ' , but it now changed to ' 1 ' .
That way we effectively block undesired updates and we give the user a second chance to reload User A's changes and re-evaluate his own changes .
This is something to be used sparingly only when it makes sense .
Do n't go adding ' lock_version ' columns at every single table like crazy .
Another thing , if for some good particular reason you do n't like this new Partial Updates , you can disable it at environment.rb like this : --- ruby ActiveRecord :: Base .
partial_updates = false # the default is true
I want to spend some more time talking about Kan extensions , composition of Kan extensions , and the relationship between a monad and the monad generated by a monad .
But first , I want to take a moment to recall adjunctions and show how they relate to some standard ( co ) monads , before tying them back to Kan extensions .
Adjunctions 101
An adjunction between categories and consists of a pair of functors , and and a natural isomorphism :
We call the left adjoint functor , and the right adjoint functor and an adjoint pair , and write this relationship as
Borrowing a Haskell definition from Dave Menendez , an adjunction from the category of Haskell types ( Hask ) to Hask given by a pair of Haskell Functor instances can be defined as follows , where phi is witnessed by = leftAdjunct and = right Adjunct .
[ haddock ]
class ( Functor f , Functor g ) =>
Adjunction f g | f -> g , g -> f where unit :: a -> g ( f a ) counit :: f ( g a ) -> a leftAdjunct :: ( f a -> b ) -> a -> g b rightAdjunct :: ( a -> g b ) -> f a -> b unit = leftAdjunct id counit = rightAdjunct id leftAdjunct f = fmap f . unit right
Adjunct f = counit .
fmap f
Currying and Uncurrying
The most well known adjunction to a Haskell programmer is between the functors given by ( ( , ) e ) and ( ( - > ) e ) .
( Recall that you can read ( ( , ) e ) as ( e , ) and ( ( - > ) e ) as ( e -> ) ; however , the latter syntax is n't valid Haskell as you are n't allowed to make ( , ) and ( -> ) sections .
We use this adjunction most every day in the form of the functions curry and uncurry .
curry :: ( ( a , b ) -> c ) -> a -> b -> c curry f x y = f ( x , y ) uncurry :: ( a -> b -> c ) -> ( a , b ) -> c uncurry f ~ ( x , y ) = f x y
However the arguments are unfortunately slightly flipped around when we go to define this as an adjunction .
instance Adjunction ( ( , ) e ) ( ( -> ) e ) where leftAdjunct f a e = f ( e , a ) right Adjunct f ~ ( e , a ) = f a e
This adjunction defines the relationship between the anonymous reader monad and the anonymous reader comonad ( aka the product comonad ) .
All Readers are the Same
As an aside , if you look at the reader arrow , reader monad and reader comonad all side by side you can see that they are all basically the same thing .
Kleisli arrows for the anonymous reader monad have the form a -> e -> b .
The Reader arrow takes the form arr ( a , e ) b , which when arr is ( -> ) this reads as ( a, e ) -> b , which is just a curried Kleisli arrow for the Reader monad .
On the other hand the reader comonad is ( ( , ) e ) , and its CoKleisli arrows have the form ( e , a ) -> b .
So , putting these side by side :
a -> e -> b ( a , e ) -> b ( e , a ) -> b
You can clearly see these are all the same thing !
State and Composing Adjunctions
Once we define functor composition :
newtype O f g a = Compose { decompose :: f ( g a ) } instance ( Functor f , Functor g ) =>
Functor ( f ` O` g ) where fmap f = Compose .
fmap ( fmap f ) .
decompose
We can see that every adjunction gives rise to a monad :
instance Adjunction f g =>
Monad ( g ` O` f ) where return = Compose .
unit m >>= f = Compose . fmap ( rightAdjunct ( decompose . f ) ) $ decompose m
and if you happen to have a Comonad typeclass lying around , a comonad :
class Comonad w where extract :: w a -> a duplicate :: w a -> w ( w a ) extend :: ( w a -> b ) -> w a -> w b extend f = fmap f . duplicate duplicate = extend id instance Adjunction f g =>
Comonad ( f ` O` g ) where extract = counit .
decompose extend f = Compose . fmap ( leftAdjunct ( f . Compose ) ) . decompose
In reality , adjunction composition is of course not the only way you could form a monad by composition , so in practice a single composition constructor leads to ambiguity .
Hence why in category - extras there is a base CompF functor , and specialized variations for different desired instances .
For simplicity , I 'll stick to ` O` here .
We can compose adjunctions , yielding an adjunction , so long as we are careful to place things in the right order :
instance ( Adjunction f1 g1 , Adjunction f2 g2 ) =>
Adjunction ( f2 ` O` f1 ) ( g1 ` O` g2 ) where counit = counit .
fmap ( counit . fmap decompose ) .
decompose unit = Compose . fmap ( fmap Compose . unit ) .
unit
In fact , if we use the adjunction defined above , we can see that its just the State monad !
instance MonadState e ( ( -> ) e ` O` ( , ) e ) where get = compose $ \s -> ( s , s ) put s = compose $ const ( s , ( ) )
Not that I 'd be prone to consider using that representation , but we can also see that we get the context comonad this way :
class Comonad w => ComonadContext s w | w -> s where getC :: w a -> s modifyC :: ( s -> s ) -> w a -> a instance ComonadContext e ( ( , ) e `O` ( -> ) e ) where getC = fst .
decompose modifyC f = uncurry ( flip id . f ) . decompose
Adjunctions as Kan Extensions
Unsurprisingly , since pretty much all of category theory comes around to being an observation about Kan extensions in the end , we can find some laws relating left - and right - Kan extensions to adjunctions .
Recall the definitions for right and left Kan extensions over Hask :
newtype Ran g h a = Ran { runRan :: forall b. ( a -> g b ) -> h b } data Lan g h a = forall b. Lan ( g b -> a ) ( h b )
Formally , if and only if the right Kan extension exists and is preserved by .
( Saunders Mac Lane , Categories for the Working Mathematician p248 ) .
We can use this in Haskell to define a natural isomorphism between f and Ran g Identity witnessed by adjointToRan and ranToAdjoint below :
adjointToRan :: Adjunction f g => f a ->
Ran g Identity a adjointToRan f = Ran ( \a ->
Identity $ rightAdjunct a f ) ranToAdjoint :: Adjunction f g => Ran g Identity a -> f a ranToAdjoint r = runIdentity ( runRan r unit )
We can construct a similar natural isomorphism for the right adjoint g of a Functor f and Lan f Identity :
adjointToLan :: Adjunction f g => g a ->
Lan f Identity a adjointToLan = Lan counit .
Identity lanToAdjoint :: Adjunction f g => Lan f Identity a -> g a lanToAdjoint ( Lan f v ) = leftAdjunct f ( runIdentity v )
So , with that in hand we can see that Ran f Identity -| f -| Lan f Identity , presuming Ran f Identity and Lan f Identity exist .
A More General Connection
Now , the first isomorphism above can be seen as a special case of a more general law relating functor composition and Kan extensions , where h = Identity in the composition below :
ranToComposedAdjoint :: Adjunction f g => Ran g h a -> ( h ` O` f ) a ranToComposed Adjoint r = Compose ( runRan r unit ) composedAdjointToRan :: ( Functor h , Adjunction f g ) => ( h ` O` f ) a ->
Ran g h a composed AdjointToRan f = Ran ( \a -> fmap ( rightAdjunct a ) ( decompose f ) )
Similarly , we get the more generalize relationship for Lan :
lanToComposedAdjoint :: ( Functor h , Adjunction f g ) =>
Lan f h a -> ( h ` O` g ) a lanToComposed Adjoint ( Lan f v ) = Compose ( fmap ( leftAdjunct f ) v ) composedAdjointToLan :: Adjunction f g => ( h ` O` g ) a ->
Lan f h a composed AdjointToLan =
Lan counit .
decompose
Composing Kan Extensions
Using the above with the laws for composing right Kan extensions :
composeRan :: Ran f ( Ran g h ) a ->
Ran ( f ` O` g ) h a composeRan r = Ran ( \f -> runRan ( runRan r ( decompose . f ) ) id ) decomposeRan :: Functor f => Ran ( f ` O` g ) h a ->
Ran f ( Ran g h ) a decomposeRan r = Ran ( \f -> Ran ( \g -> runRan r ( Compose . fmap g . f ) ) )
or the laws for composing left Kan extensions :
composeLan :: Functor f => Lan f ( Lan g h ) a ->
Lan ( f ` O` g ) h a composeLan ( Lan f ( Lan g h ) ) = Lan ( f . fmap g . decompose ) h decomposeLan :: Lan ( f ` O` g ) h a ->
Lan f ( Lan g h ) a decomposeLan ( Lan f h ) = Lan ( f . compose ) ( Lan id h )
can give you a lot of ways to construct monads :
Right Kan Extension as ( almost ) a Monad Transformer
You can lift many of operations from a monad m to the codensity monad of m .
Unfortunately , we do n't have quite the right type signature for an instance of MonadTrans , so we 'll have to make do with our own methods :
[ Edit : this has been since factored out into Control .
Monad .
Codensity to allow Codensity to actually be an instance of MonadTrans ]
liftRan :: Monad m => m a ->
Ran m m a liftRan m = Ran ( m >>= ) lowerRan :: Monad m =>
Ran m m a -> m a lowerRan a = runRan a return instance MonadReader r m =>
MonadReader r ( Ran m m ) where ask = liftRan ask local f m = Ran ( \c -> ask >>= \r -> local f ( runRan m ( local ( const r ) . c ) ) ) instance MonadIO m =>
MonadIO ( Ran m m ) where liftIO = liftRan .
liftIO instance MonadState s m =>
MonadState s ( Ran m m ) where get = liftRan get put = liftRan .
put
In fact the list of things you can lift is pretty much the same as what you can lift over the ContT monad transformer due to the similarity in the types .
However , just because you lifted the operation into the right or left Kan extension , does n't mean that it has the same asymptotic performance .
Similarly we can lift many comonadic operations to the Density comonad of a comonad using Lan .
[ Edit : Refactored out into Control.
Comonad .
Density ]
Changing Representation
Given a f -| g , g ` O` f is a monad , and Ran ( g ` O` f ) ( g ` O` f ) is the monad generated by ( g ` O` f ) , described in the previous post .
We showed above that this monad can do many of the same things that the original monad could do .
From there you can decomposeRan to get Ran g ( Ran f ( g ` O` f ) ) , which you can show to be yet another monad , and you can continue on from there .
Each of these monads may have different operational characteristics and performance tradeoffs .
For instance the codensity monad of a monad can offer better asymptotic performance in some usage scenarios .
Similarly the left Kan extension can be used to manipulate the representation of a comonad .
All of this code is encapsulated in category - extras [ docs ] [ darcs ] as of release 0.51.0
If I made a list of all the things that annoy me every day , somewhere in the top would be the way image hosts handle hotlinking .
When image gets popular on social bookmarking websites like Digg or Reddit , it shortly gets pulled down .
Everyone who wants to view the image , will only get to see something like this :
Ok , I know this is being done mainly to :
1 . Make members use ad supported URL ’s instead of hotlinking
2 . Make members upgrade their accounts
3 . Brand the name of image hosting service .
It just does n’t work that way with social bookmarking websites .
Instead , you get a bunch of people ( actually thousands , maybe hundreds of thousands ) taking note never to use your service in the future .
I ’d like to suggest a couple of ideas how to avoid this .
1. Inspect traffic , redirect
If visitors are coming directly from social bookmarking websites , there ’s really no need to pull down the image – visitors will see the URL , and that should help you brand your image hosting service .
If you really can’t afford this , at least redirect this traffic to your ad supported page .
That way visitors will be able to see the image and you ’ll earn some bucks .
Win -win .
2. Include original pic in “ bandwidth limit exceeded ” image
When you really need to send the “ bandwidth limit exceeded ” message , there ’s no need to remove the original pic .
Let visitors see the image and let your user know he needs to upgrade his account in the same time .
Just like this for example :
Of course , this image should be the same size of the original pic .
Original pic should be scaled to fit in .
Now everybody visiting the site will still be able to see the image , but your user will be encouraged to upgrade his account .
Another win-win .
Without a doubt , the higher prices at the pump can really be felt in more ways than one .
It not only directly costs more to fill up your tank , but the overall higher cost of oil and gas trickles down to increase the cost of almost everything we buy .
These higher prices can even indirectly depress the stock market and economy as well .
So , in 2007 , just how much did the price of gasoline increase ?
2007 Average US Gas Prices
As most of us remember , early on in 2007 we saw a very rapid increase in gas prices .
The jump of an average of $ 2.20 / gallon to $ 3.25 / gallon in just five months was significant .
This translates into around a 48 % increase during that time .
In the second half of the year , gas prices cooled off a bit but still remained well above the starting point on the year .
For the entire calendar year , the US average gas price was roughly 39 % higher .
What Does This Mean for the Average Driver ?
If we strictly look at the effect of higher oil and gas prices on our immediate bottom line when filling up our vehicles , in terms of dollars , how much more are we paying ?
We ’ll stick with averages , but the average person drives around 12,000 miles per year .
As of 2004 , the average passenger vehicle got an annual average of around 23 miles per gallon .
Basic math then tells us that for a typical person with a typical car , they use roughly 522 gallons of gas per year .
522 gallons of gas at the January 1st price of around $ 2.20 would come out to $ 1,148 .
Those same 522 gallons of gas purchased on December 31st would have cost $ 1,592 , or an increase of $ 444 .
Keep in mind that this is a worst - case scenario and does not at all represent what happens in the real world , because obviously nobody buys a year ’s supply of gas just once a year .
Since most people will fill up at regular intervals , this is the same as dollar cost averaging .
So the actual effect of the annual price increase is diminished a bit .
But How Can I Make Money When Gas Prices Are Increasing 40 % Annually ?
I know what you ’re thinking , and trying to find a way to make 40 % on any type of investment a year is not easy to do .
Well , you ’re right , but you do n’t have to be a stock picking guru to pull this off when the answer is right under your nose .
Why do gas prices generally go up ?
Because oil prices are going up or supply is reduced .
So , would n’t it seem like a reasonable idea to invest a few dollars in oil so that you can minimize the effect on your bottom line ?
Let ’s take a look at some of the best options .
Powershares DB Oil Fund ( DBO )
We ’ll start right at the root of the problem , and that is crude oil itself .
This ETF is designed to track the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index – Optimum Yield Oil Excess Return .
Yes , that is a mouthful , but it basically means it tries to accurately reflect the changes in the light sweet crude oil sector , which is the type of oil used to produce gasoline .
As you can see , in 2007 this ETF did very well .
In fact , it returned just over 42 % in 2007 .
Powershares Dynamic Oil Service Portfolio ( PXJ )
This ETF is a little different in that it corresponds to the Dynamic Oil Services Intellidex Index .
What this really means is that it tracks companies in the oil services industry , not oil itself .
But generally speaking , the more a commodity costs , the more the companies that deal in the commodity can profit from .
In 2007 , it saw an almost identical overall increase to that of the price of gasoline at just over 39 % .
SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Equipment & Services ( XES )
Here we have a similar ETF offered through a SPDR compared to Powershares , and this fund directly tracks performance of the S&P Oil and Gas Equipment and Services Industry .
Many of the same holdings as PXJ , but some slightly different weighting .
Again , this fund saw a 2007 return of 35.6 % .
Again , very close to keeping pace with the price of gasoline .
SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ( XOP )
And I throw this one in there even though it is less dependent on the actual price of gas and more on the exploration and production , but again , since these companies deal with the commodity , they are generally going to be able to make more money as it increases in price .
Much of the same here with an annual return of over 35 % .
A Two - Fold Opportunity
So , how can this really benefit you ?
Well , by investing in a little bit of oil , you have two primary opportunities :
Offset gasoline prices .
Long - term appreciation of a limited resource .
As you can see from above , with any of the major oil - related ETF options , you can almost completely offset or possibly make money on rising oil prices relative to what comes out of your pocket at the pump .
So , if you plan to spend $ 1,500 on gas this coming year , you could put $ 1,500 into an oil investment , and if prices continue to increase , you end up breaking even or possibly coming out ahead ( all dependent on actual market performance and whether or not your money is in a taxable account ) .
Not only can it directly hedge against the prices at the pump , but think of this commodity as a long - term investment .
All you have to do is consider the law of supply and demand .
Oil is a very limited resource , and if our demand continues to increase or even stay the same , the supply continues to dwindle , what happens to the price ?
It goes up .
Until we begin to make a major push towards alternative fuel sources , this classic case of supply and demand will continue , and if you have the opportunity to , you might as well make some money from it .
It ’s a Start , but Not the Solution
This does n’t mean you should go out and invest a bunch of money in oil or that it will completely offset any losses you see from increased gas prices , but it is a start .
Consider that if you would have invested just $ 2,000 into DBO in early 2007 , you would have probably made more money on that return than what you lost in higher prices at the pump .
While you do n’t want to go too heavy on any single investment , you may want to consider what effect adding just a small portion of an oil investment has on your overall diversified portfolio .
And while the increase in oil prices may not directly go into your pocket if you ’re investing it , you can at least rest a little easier knowing that while it might cost you $ 5.00 more each time you fill your tank , you ’re getting that back in your investment .

While former Clover devs showed off three games at last night 's Platinum / Sega announcement , it was Madworld that hands - down stole the show .
The stark , black , white and blood title has gamers playing through a third - person maze of carnage , trying to rack up points for an off - screen audience through over - the - top dismemberment .

Director Shigenori Nishikawa took up the white Wii remote and nunchuk at last night 's event to play through a short portion of the game for the audience .

While the attention was most certainly focused on the large screen showing the highly - stylized game , I could still make out some of the controls Nishikawa used to move and perform attacks .
It looks like , at least for now , the character , Jack , is controlled by the thumbstick , while attacks are started typically by pressing a button .
Some of the attacks , like pounding a person 's body into a wall of spikes , or ripping out a heart , were performed with Wii remote motions .
The heart ripping specifically , was performed by pressing a button and flicking the remote up .
The enemy AI , this early in the game , did n't really seem to do much to defend itself , though I would assume that would change by the time the game ships .
All of the attacks were amazingly gruesome , but the art style helped prevent the game from being grotesque .

Jack 's right hand is a chainsaw , and bodies cut vertically in half fell to either side in a splash of vibrant red blood .
When a heart was torn from a ribcage , the bad guy would fall back with Jack still clutching the muscle , before crushing it in his hand .
Impaled black and white bodies oozed red in great rivulets of blood .
While the bad guys and background are all drawn in bold black and white imagery , the things you can use to decapitate , pulverize and generally kill your enemy all seemed to be marked with small splashes of blood .

The game also appears to have a number of mini- games ; one shown last night was called " Man Darts . "
Jack pulled a giant lever to activate the game , turning a nearby wall into a giant dartboard .
Next Jack pulled out a bat and started smacking hapless enemies onto the board .
The blood that splashed to mark their impact helped score points for Jack .
All the while a team of in - game , but off - screen commentators kept up a line of jokes that included the enthusiastic use of the phrase " man juice . "
Madworld has , so far , many of the elements to make it a great game : Amazing art direction and a distinct look , an over - the - top and risky premise and a fun sense of humor , but what will push this game from cherished , but financially unsuccessful , to blow - out success will be how all of these elements come together .

The Bernanke Monetary Policy Conundrum Heading for a Crash
The Bernanke Monetary Policy Conundrum Heading for a Crash
With the US Federal Reserve cutting its Fed Fund Rate to 2 % , presumably to aid the cost of borrowing and allow an expansion of lending that will lift the US economy from the doldrums you would expect to see an expansion of bank business .
Not so according to the latest Fed 's Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey which shows that banks are now actively avoiding the expansion of credit and it can be shown are deliberately causing a credit contraction .
This has profound meaning for the US and the wider global economy .
Let 's look at the evidence .
The following 3 charts show the Bernanke Conundrum as it applies to business .
Yes , business - its not just consumers getting squeezed :
This is for all business sizes in the April survey , conditions have been tightened , rates have been further increased above the cost that banks incur to borrow and here is the crunch , demand is increasing from business .
How important is this ?
Very , I mean crash imminent ( Q2/3 ) very important .
It is clear to see that borrowing conditions for business have not improved even with the Fed liquidity / solvency actions and the cutting of rates .
Around 60 % of domestic banks are making it difficult or impossible ( likely the latter for all but the highest quality of business ) to borrow .
In fact conditions for business requiring credit have deteriorated substantially even in the face of a higher demand since the last survey .
Why am I worried about a crash ?
Simply this , notice the increase in demand for loans ( third chart above ) is a good leading indicator of the direction of the economy and the markets .
This is probably a function of using credit to expand business / productivity in anticipation of an acceleration of growth overall .
Having said that and looking at the chart above you are probably wondering why I am not saying the good times are just around the next quarter or 2 .
It would seem foolish to say its different this time .
Yes , you guessed it :
This is the same information up to Q1 2003 , just before the last Bull market took off .
Notice the striking difference ?
Rising demand for loans occurred in a benign environment of looser lending standards and cheap credit as priced by the banks over their borrowing costs ( Low risk ) .
Q2 '03 is even more benign .
The problem for Bernanke is made no easier by the same predicament facing consumers :
So as consumer demand picks up do the banks take the business ?
No , they do not .
Loans and credit cards have tightening standards and there is no willingness to allow consumer instalment loans .
The bottom of the consumer barrel has been scraped and there is no wish to return for the crumbs .
When compared to the last downturn and recession ( '00 - '03 ) you can see how much more difficult it is for consumers to borrow now , compared to then .
No consumer and no business borrowing .
What 's a Fed chairman to do eh ?
Am I saying its different this time ?
Oh yes , without a doubt .
Look again at the charts above , focussing on the last quarter of ' 99 .
Look how lending standards and costs rise as we tipped over into the weakening economy and eventual recession to come , yet lending demand from business contracted .
This is the " natural " state of affairs , even back in '90/91 when demand for loans and the price above the banks borrowing costs rose , standards were dropping rapidly , business could borrow , it just cost more .
This is clearly not happening now .
We have an environment were business needs to borrow but banks are unwilling or unable to lend .
Bernanke 's conundrum is simple to see , after all the easing of rates and invention of facilities to enable credit markets to continue and even with the de facto underwriting of the whole fiat monetary system , banks will not lend .
How big a problem is this ?
Unless business can borrow ( either to offset costs , rollover previous borrowing or get ready for expansion ) then 1929 - 33 looms large .
This though is not the final state we have achieved .
By now all market participants know that the Fed will go to extraordinary lengths to keep the current system operating .
The conundrum for Bernanke is what can he do to make banks loosen standards and lower costs ?
You see , For Ben Bernanke the current situation is n't " news "
Bernanke has already studied the conundrum .
I quote from " Non-Monetary Effects of the Financial Crisis in the Propagation of the Great Depression " as used in " New Keynsian Economics " ( Mankiw and Romer Ch 29 ) :
" An interesting aspect of the general financial crises - most clearly , of the bank failures - was their coincidence in timing with adverse developments in the macroeconomy "
The present paper builds on the Friedman - Schwartz work by considering a third way in which the financial crises ( in which we include debtor bankrupties as well as failures of banks and other lenders ) may have affected output " . " ..... because markets for financial claims are incomplete , intermediation between ... borrowers and .... lenders required nontrivial market making and information gathering " .
Bernanke then goes on to state that as the real costs of intermediation rose some borrowers found credit to be expensive and difficult to obtain .
He then states :
" The effect of this credit squeeze on aggregate demand helped convert the severe ..... downturn of 1929 - 1930 into a protracted depression "
Bernanke goes on to identify various problems from the ' 20s that made the 29 - 30 downturn , which included the expansion of debt and in 1930 the move by banks out of the loan markets into more liquid instruments .
Indeed the 1932 National Industrial Conference Board survey of credit conditions reported that the shrinkage of commercial loans in 1931 and the first half of 1932 represented pressure from the banks on customers for repayment and refusal by banks to grant new loans .
The worry is that the Fed Chairman saw no cure better than the one used in the '30s New Deal and the large scale intervention of the federal Govt :
" home mortgage market ... function .... was largely due to the direct involvement of the ferderal government .... establishing ... FSLIC ... federally chartered savings and loans .... government " readjusted " existing debts .... and substituted for recalcitrant private institutions in the provision of direct credit .
In 1934 ..... Home Owners ' Loan Corporation made 71 percent of all mortgage loans extended "
It looks to me that Bernanke has already instituted the measures he believes will help avoid a repeat of ' 29 - '33 by delivering the medicine now rather than later .
As we have seen earlier in this article , the medicine does not seem to be affecting the patient .
Credit availability continues to contract due to the policies of banks .
Ben Bernanke now finds himself in a situation where he has delivered all he can to no avail .
Does he sit back and wait for a change in credit conditions to become apparent or is there more that he can do ?
Whatever he does , unless lending conditions change markedly and rapidly in this quarter , it will be ineffective .
Bernanke will no longer have to refer to history to see a deflationary depression , he will be living it .

The Progressive
March 1 , 2008
The FBI ’s Cyber Division Assistant Director Shawn Henry said , “ The article ’s claims are patently false . ”
I ’ve got the FBI on my case .
Three weeks ago The Progressive published my story on InfraGard , a secretive but large group of business executives that works hand in glove with the FBI .
The article was called “ The FBI Deputizes Business . ” and we posted it February 8 on our website , and then on the cover of The Progressive ’s March issue .
In the story , I reported on a whistleblower , himself a member of InfraGard , who told me that InfraGard members had been given permission by the FBI and Homeland Security to “ shoot to kill ” in the event of martial law .
Well , on February 15 , the FBI issued a press release denouncing the article .
The FBI ’s Cyber Division Assistant Director Shawn Henry said , “ The article ’s claims are patently false . ”
First ,
Henry nitpicked the headline of the article , saying : “ The title , however catchy , is a complete fabrication . ”
Is it really ?
FBI Director Mueller himself called InfraGard members “ partners in our mission to protect America , ” adding that they were his “ first line of defense . ”
As to the most serious claim , Henry said that “ InfraGard members have no extraordinary powers and have no greater right to ‘ shoot to kill ’ than other civilians . ”
“ No greater right ” ?
That ’s odd language , is n’t it ?
And it reminded me of a quote from my article from Curt Haugen , CEO of S’Curo Group , and a proud InfraGard member .
When I asked him about whether the FBI or Homeland Security agents had told InfraGard members they could use lethal force in an emergency , he said : “ That much I can not comment on .
But as a private citizen , you have the right to use force if you feel threatened . ”
Note that the FBI did not deny that it ever told InfraGard members that they could “ shoot to kill . ”
All that Henry said was that InfraGard members “ have no greater right . ”
That does n’t exactly blow a hole in my story .
The FBI seemed put out that I did not give enough information about the meeting the whistleblower attended .
“ Unfortunately , the author of the Progressive article refused even to identify when or where the claimed ‘ small meeting ’ occurred in which issues of martial law were discussed , ” Henry said in the press release .
“ If we get that information , the FBI certainly will follow up and clarify any possible misunderstandings . ”
Students at an Infrgard computer security summer camp learning how to stop terrorists on dialysis machines in remote caves from breaking into corporate and government networks and shutting down America .
The reason I did n’t identify where or when the meeting took place is obvious : I did n’t want to reveal anything that would expose my whistleblower .
The press release fails to mention , however , that I received confirmation about discussions of “ lethal force ” from another member of InfraGard , whom I did name .
Nor did the press release dispute any other facts in the article , such as that InfraGard members ( more than 23,000 of them ) “ receive secret warnings of terrorist threats before the public does — and , at least on one occasion , before elected officials . ”
Nor did it deny that FBI Director Mueller said that InfraGard members could contact the FBI about “ disgruntled employees . ”
Nor did it respond to the ACLU ’s concern that InfraGard “ may be closer to a corporate TIPS program , turning private sector corporations . . . into surrogate eyes and ears for the FBI . ”
Nor did it dispel another ACLU concern that InfraGard members have special numbers to call and easier access to telecommunications than other citizens in times of an emergency .
“ There ’s no ‘ business class ’ in law enforcement , ” said the ACLU ’s Jay Stanley in the original story .
“ This bears a disturbing resemblance to the FBI ’s handing out ‘ goodies ’ to corporations in return for folding them into its domestic surveillance machinery . ”
I stick by every single word of my story .
And I call on Congress to investigate InfraGard and to inspect the plans that the FBI may have in store not only for InfraGard but for all of us in times of an emergency .
( Note to researchers and other concerned citizens :
The official InfraGard website is at www.infragard.net.
But also go to www.infragardmembers.org, and click on “ Chapters , ” and you can find out who is the private sector president of your local chapter , and who the FBI agent assigned to that chapter is . )

Just some more detail from the WSJ : Mortgage Securities Back Fed Loan to Bear Stearns
The securities backing a $ 29 billion Federal Reserve loan to Bear Stearns Cos. consist primarily of " mortgage - backed securities and related hedge investments , " the Treasury Department said .
...
The Fed has declined to provide any underlying detail so far .
JPMorgan will take the first $ 1 billion in losses on the $ 30 billion portfolio , and the U.S. taxpayers will pay for the remaining losses ( if any ) .
Wally Hassan was one of the finest mechanics at Bentley , and in the 1930s he was retained by former chairman and Le Mans winner Woolf Barnato to work on his personal cars .
He had Hassan build him an 8 liter Bentley single seater in order to win the record at Brooklands .
This car was to become known as the Barnato - Hassan .
Bill Pacey asked Barnato if Hassan could build him a 4.5 liter version , and the Pacey - Hassan was born .
This is a tribute to Dragonball which i have been fascinated with since young .
This sculpt has been my personal project for learning Zbrush 3 , and the experience was FUN !
My goal was to create an authentic looking sculpt that could rival the ones professionally produced .
Its base mesh was created in Max , then sculpted in detail with Zbrush , Zapplinked with PS , and finally brought back to Max for rendering with Vray .

** 05 feb update - added some wip on page 2
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Pharmaceutical companies need to be more responsible in touting products to consumers or else face tighter controls from Congress , a top U.S. Democratic lawmaker said on Thursday .
A lab worker displays a handful of pills in an undated file photo .
REUTERS / File
Rep. Bart Stupak , at a hearing to discuss specific ads by Pfizer Inc , Johnson & Johnson , Merck & Co Inc and Schering - Plough Corp , said television commercials in particular use deceptive techniques to push products to potential patients and increase sales .
“ It appears that we need to enforce significant restrictions on DTC ( direct - to - consumer ) ads to protect American consumers from manipulative commercials designed to mislead and deceive for the profit of pharmaceutical companies , ” said Stupak , head of the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce investigative panel .
The Michigan Democrat said Congress should consider whether ads promoting medicines should be allowed to continue to target consumers in the United States , the only country that allows such marketing except for New Zealand .
“ Pharmaceutical companies should consider it a privilege to be allowed to air DTC ads in this country , ” he said .
“ We should make sure that pharmaceuticals companies conduct themselves responsibly . ”
Ruth Day , head of Duke University ’s Medical Cognition Laboratory , told lawmakers that drug companies use a variety of tactics to highlight a drug ’s benefits and downplay risks , including fast speech to visual effects .
For example , an ad for Schering - Plough ’s allergy drug Nasonex featured a bumble bee that flew around as side effects were listed , but simply hovered when benefits were discussed .
“ All of these wing flaps and wing flashes and sparkly things essentially divided the attention of the viewers ... and thus led to decreased knowledge ” of possible risks , Day said .
At the hearing , lawmakers focused on TV ads for Merck and Schering - Plough ’s controversial Vytorin cholesterol drug , citing “ food and family ” as sources of cholesterol and urged patients to consider medication if diet changes alone did not help .
Deepak Khanna , senior vice president and general manager of the companies ’ joint venture , defended the spots , saying they were reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and backed by research .
“ Our consumer research has consistently shown that the information about the two sources of cholesterol is getting through , ” Khanna said .
Merck and Schering - Plough ran the spots from September 2004 until January , when a study found Vytorin failed to keep neck arteries any clearer than Zocor , which is available as a cheaper generic .
Stupak ’s panel is also investigating whether the companies withheld data from the Vytorin study .
Lawmakers also looked at ads for Pfizer ’s cholesterol drug Lipitor featuring artificial heart inventor Robert Jarvik , who had prompted some concern for appearing to be offering medical advice without being a practicing physician .
James Sage , a Pfizer senior director , said ads are necessary because companies cannot sell prescription products directly to consumers .
Such patient - targeted spots “ motivate them to seek additional information ... consult their physicians ... and follow treatment plans , ” he said .
Although ads for both drugs were suspended , several Republicans agreed with the companies , saying commercials prompt patients to seek therapy for their high cholesterol , a widespread chronic condition that can cause heart disease .
Ranking Republican John Shimkus of Illinois said it was too soon for lawmakers to intervene , citing new FDA powers to crack down on drug ads that went into effect earlier this year .
“ We gave the FDA power to act and we have n’t really given them time to really impose civil fines on false and misleading ads , ” said Shimkus , noting ads by the four drugmakers ran before the agency could use its new tools .
Thursday ’s hearing comes a week before the FDA holds its own meeting on direct - to - consumer ads .
The FDA reviews print and television ads and can send warnings or impose fines for false or misleading claims .
Staff is limited , however , and the agency cannot review all ads .
A report by the Government Accountability Office released at the hearing found the agency still does not have a system in place to prioritize materials that need FDA review or keep track of which ads it had already reviewed .
Kim Taylor , president of Johnson & Johnson ’s Ortho Biotech Inc unit , which makes Procrit , told lawmakers the company worked with the FDA to develop ads for its anemia therapy that were “ true , responsible and substantiated by scientific studies . ”
The ads ran from 1998 to 2005 .
Among other uses , Procrit is approved to treat anemia in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , but Stupak said commercials featuring healthy - looking , energetic patients did not reflect the reality cancer patients face , including hair - loss and fatigue .
In late 2006 , Congress revised the Posse Comitatus Act and the Insurrection Act to make it far easier for a president to declare martial law .
Those changes were repealed at the end of this January as part of Public Law 110 - 181 ( HR 4986 ) , the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 ( signed into law by President Bush on January 28 , 2008 ) .
Senator Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt ) , who championed the opposition to the original law , was also the hero of the repeal .
It helped that all the nationâ€™s governors opposed the 2006 law .
Boise State Professor Charlotte
Twight , the author of the excellent Dependent on DC , alerted me to the change last night .
I checked on Nexis and the only news coverage I found regarding the repeal was a 322 - word Gannett News wire story from February 1 that focused on how the repeal made governors happy .
I first wrote about the Posse / Insurrection peril for American Conservative a year ago .
My most recent piece on the subject was an article for the January issue of the Future of Freedom Foundationâ€™s ( FFF ) Freedom Daily .
The law was changed between the time the piece was published and when FFF posted the January article online on April 9 .
WASHINGTON -- Forget government corruption or corporate fraud .
Three members of Congress want the Justice Department to investigate whether college football 's Bowl Championship Series is an illegal enterprise .
Reps . Neil Abercrombie ( D - Hawaii ) , Lynn Westmoreland ( R - Ga. ) and Mike Simpson ( R - Idaho ) are introducing a resolution rejecting the oft - criticized bowl system as an illegal restriction on trade because only the largest universities compete in most of the major bowl games .
The resolution would require Justice 's antitrust division to investigate whether the system violates federal law .
The measure would also put Congress on record as supporting a college football playoff .
" Who elected these NCAA people ?
Who are they to decide who competes for the championship ? "
Abercrombie said at a press conference Thursday on Capitol Hill , gripping a souvenir Hawaii football .
Abercrombie said the matter is worthy of federal review because college football is big business with hundreds of millions of dollars at stake .
" It 's money .
That 's what this is all about , " he said .
But it 's no coincidence that all three lawmakers have home - state schools with recent beefs against the bowl system .
Hawaii and Boise State University in Idaho each had an undefeated season in recent years but were denied a shot at the championship .
And Westmoreland said he is still smarting about his Georgia Bulldogs being passed over for the national championship game last year .
Georgia instead was matched up against undefeated Hawaii in the Allstate Sugar Bowl , winning 41 - 10 .
Westmoreland and Abercrombie said they started talking about the resolution after that game , as Abercrombie was paying off a bet with chocolate - covered macadamia nuts .
The lawmakers say the bowl system is rigid and blocks all but the largest universities from competing in postseason bowls , denying dozens of others not just the opportunity to compete but also a shot at the big payoffs and national exposure that come with bowl appearances .
Abercrombie maintained that television markets are one factor in selecting which teams go to high - profile bowls .
" We should n't have to argue about who the champion is , " Westmoreland said , citing the excitement and unpredictability of the NCAA college basketball tournament .
" That should be decided on the field . "
The BCS was created in 1998 by the six most powerful conferences .
It relies on polls and computer ratings to determine which teams qualify for the top bowls .
Congress held a hearing on the BCS in 2005 , but no legislation came of it .
In a statement , ACC commissioner and current BCS administrator John Swofford said the BCS allows all qualified teams to participate and is beneficial for student - athletes , universities and fans .
" This issue has been looked at before , " Swofford said .
" We 're confident that it complies with the law . "
Britain will maintain a garrison of 4,000 troops at Basra airport for the forseeable future , whatever the pressures on the armed forces , defence officials said last night .
They described the British garrison as being there " for the long term " after talks in London yesterday between General David Petraeus , commander of US forces in Iraq , Des Browne , the defence secretary , and Sir Jock Stirrup , chief of the defence staff .
It was said that the troops were needed to continue their task of training Iraqi forces and also to maintain what officials called " political credence " with the US .
After an hour 's meeting at Downing Street with Gordon Brown , Petraeus said British forces had been " invaluable " in providing intelligence , air and logistics support for Iraq troops engaged in the recent Charge of the Knights operation against Mahdi army militia elements supporting the Shia cleric Moqtada al - Sadr .
Asked how long the US wanted 4,000 British troops stationed outside Basra , Petraeus responded : " The answer right now is we do n't know ...
We need to work [ it ] out in the next month or two as we look at the so - called troop - to - task analysis . "
British defence sources said that did not mean a decision would be taken then to reduce the number of UK troops in Iraq .
The hope expressed by Gordon Brown late last year that the number could be reduced to 2,500 this spring clearly has been dashed .
Petraeus said the immediate focus was on helping Iraqi forces in their operation against Mahdi army and criminal elements in Basra .
He said more than 1,000 Iranian - made mortar and artillery rounds as well as rockets had been found in the city .
British officials said that though private polls suggested the people of Basra were relatively optimistic about the future , the situation in Basra remained " fragile " .
About 800 US troops , including special forces , are helping a combined force of 30,000 Iraqi army and police .
About 150 British troops are involved .
The British and US military troops involved were advisers , officials said .
Petraeus , who was accompanied by Ryan Crocker , US ambassador to Iraq , said the supplies of Iranian weapons into Iraq were a " huge concern " .
British forces are not getting involved in these disputes in what ministers call their " overwatch " role , providing air support , including helicopter supplies and surveillance , to Iraqi forces in the city .
They are also training the Iraqi army 's 14th division based in Basra .
British military planners and commanders hoped that by now they could have substantially reduced the number of British troops in Iraq , and are frustrated by the time it has taken the Iraqi army to develop into an effective force .
Petraeus admitted that Iraqi forces in the recent operation in Basra had got off to a " shaky start .
Some were not equal to the task , " he said .
Iraq 's interior ministry said yesterday that more than 1,000 Iraqis had been killed in April , 968 of them civilians .
The president 's daughter is a strong voice for gay and transsexual Cubans
Cuba has authorised sex - change operations and will offer them free to qualifying citizens , officials say .
The move is the latest in a series of policy changes implemented by President Raul Castro since he succeeded his elder brother , Fidel , in February .
Raul Castro's daughter , who heads the National Centre for Sex Education , spearheaded the changes in a country renowned for sexual conservatism .
So far 28 transsexuals in the country have requested the operation .
Vibrant and discreet
Last month , for only the second time , the Cuban authorities joined events to marking International Day against Homophobia .
Raul Castro 's daughter , Mariela , has also pushed for the state to recognise same sex unions and inheritance rights .
If adopted the reforms would give Cuba the most liberal gay rights in Latin America , says the BBC's Michael Voss in Havana .
Since becoming Cuba 's first new president since the 1959 revolution , Raul Castro has also done away with bans that kept most Cubans from owning mobile phones in their own names and renting hotel rooms and cars .
His government also has decentralised the floundering state agricultural sector , raised pensions and salaries for some state employees .

THIS week the death - knell sounded for America 's love affair with pick - up trucks and sport-utility vehicles ( SUVs ) .
General Motors ( GM ) announced a 30 % fall in car sales in May , compared with a year earlier , as high fuel prices prompted Americans to shun its gas - guzzlers for smaller , more frugal vehicles .
Ford posted a 19 % drop , and sales of its F - 150 pick - up fell behind Toyota 's Camry and Corolla for the first time .
Most telling was the 62 % fall in sales of Hummers , GM 's hulking military - style SUVs .
GM announced plans to close four truck factories and a “ strategic review ” of the Hummer brand .
Total car sales fell for the third month in a row .
But there is one country where the high oil price is powering the expansion of the market , rather than painful restructuring .
Thanks to abundant natural resources , Russia 's economy has grown by an average of 7 % a year for the past decade .
Real disposable income has nearly doubled in the past five years and is growing by more than 10 % a year .
That means a lot of Russians can suddenly afford to buy cars .
Car ownership , at about 200 per 1,000 people , is still very low by developed - world standards .
( In most of western Europe it is over 500 , and in America it is around 800 . )
And although average incomes are lower than in the West , so is consumer debt .
Heidi McCormack , GM 's head of business development in Russia , says that compared with other markets , burdened by debt and oil prices , “ Russia is still magically isolated . ”
The growth and size of the Russian market has confounded every forecast .
In 2007 sales of new cars grew 36 % by volume and , reflecting the steadily increasing buying power of customers , 57 % by value .
Sales of passenger vehicles exceeded 2.7 m .
Eduard Faritov , an analyst at Renaissance Capital , an investment bank , thinks Russia could outstrip Germany as Europe 's biggest market this year , with sales reaching around 3.3 m .
By 2012 Russians will be buying more than 5 m new cars a year , of which nearly 90 % will be foreign brands , predicts Ernst & Young , a consultancy .
Sales of Russian brands have stayed flat for the past few years — hovering between 750,000 and 800,000 .
All the growth has been met by the foreigners , observes Nigel Brackenbury , head of Russian operations at Ford , the first foreign carmaker to set up its own factories in the country .
With its big dealer network , it has done well : a decade ago Ford sold fewer cars in Russia in a year than it now sells in a week .
Foreign cars are sold through glitzy showrooms such as those at Major City , a “ dealer village ” on Moscow 's outskirts .
While waiting for their new cars , customers can pop into the on - site cinemas , check e-mail on a bank of computers , munch freshly made snacks or get their hair done .
Russian brands have been left in the dust .
As one of the dealership 's managers puts it : “ Selling Russian cars is different .
You just need someone to count the money . ”
Domestic producers have found it hard to compete , first with imported second - hand cars and more recently with new imports and foreign brands made in Russia .
In 2002 nearly 500,000 cars sold were used imports — mostly brought in from Germany and Japan .
That represented 44 % of the market by value .
Even quite elderly Volkswagens and Toyotas offered far superior quality to the locally produced Ladas , made by AvtoVAZ , or the Volgas , made by GAZ .
In an attempt to help the domestic carmakers , in late 2002 the government slapped a 25 % duty on imported used cars .
But the local firms failed to take advantage of the breathing space .
As the sale of used imports fell , new imports took their place , amounting to 48 % of the market by value in 2005 .
The government 's response was not to raise import duties again , but to pass a measure intended to persuade foreign makers to revive the Russian car industry by setting up local assembly plants .
The terms were simple : to qualify for relief from import duty , foreign carmakers had to build a factory with a capacity of more than 25,000 vehicles a year — a minimum investment of at least $ 100 m .
Within five years of production starting , the local content in each car had to reach 30 % .
Unlike in China , firms did not have to establish partnerships with local producers .
This triggered a scramble by ten of the world 's biggest car firms to build factories in Russia .
Investment plans already announced suggest that new capacity could reach 1.6 m units by 2012 .
Renault is building Logans near Moscow at a revived Moskvitch facility , and Volkswagen is constructing a factory in Kaluga , 110 miles south - west of Moscow .
But most firms are setting up around St Petersburg , following the lead of Toyota and Ford , which has just announced an increase in capacity to 125,000 cars a year .
They will soon be joined by General Motors , Nissan , Suzuki and Hyundai .
St Petersburg 's popularity is down to its ice - free port , rail links and well - educated workforce — and the can - do approach of the governor , Valentina Matviyenko , Russia 's leading female politician .
Where does all this leave the domestic carmakers ?
In 1990 they built 1.2 m passenger vehicles , but last year they sold just 756,000 .
AvtoVAZ , which makes more than 90 % of the Russian - brand passenger cars , is the most exposed .
Its Ladas still sell in provincial Russia because there are lots of dealers , the cars are cheap and there are few alternatives .
The main threat to Lada comes from very cheap Chinese cars .
So far the authorities have refused the likes of Chery and Great Wall permission to set up in Russia , but such discrimination may not be sustainable .
A further threat is that the dynamics of the used - car business are about to change again .
If , as expected , the 18 % VAT on used cars sold by dealers is abolished , Lada 's price advantage will vanish .
AvtoVAZ 's main hope lies in the 25 % stake recently acquired by Renault for $ 1 billion .
Renault 's managers started arriving in March , and its boss , Carlos Ghosn , will be one of three Renault executives on the AvtoVAZ board .
With its experience in turning round Nissan and making automotive alliances work , Renault is the ideal partner for AvtoVAZ .
Yann Vincent , the newly installed operations chief , says the priority is to bring new Ladas to market , based on Renault platforms , by 2010 .
Another local producer , Severstal - Auto , has sensibly decided that rather than taking on foreign car brands , it will instead specialise in small vans and trucks , demand for which will be driven by the fast - growing retail sector .
Severstal already has a joint venture with Fiat to produce its Albea and Linea saloons , and in May Vladimir Putin , the prime minister , drove the first Fiat Ducato van off the firm 's new production line in Elabuga , a “ free economic zone ” in Tatarstan .
Severstal also makes small and medium - sized Isuzu trucks .
Nikolay Sobolev , Severstal 's finance chief , adds that a further twist to the strategy is for Severstal to build a dealer network to sell high - margin services , such as adapting its vehicles for school and hospitals , providing full - service leasing arrangements and offering credit terms with local banks .
Domestic firms that understand their customers and identify profitable niches can still prosper .
But when it comes to car - buying , normally chauvinistic Russians seem only too happy to leave their patriotism at the showroom door .

CHARLESTON , W.Va . ( AP ) 
When Danielle Davis attended school in Rapid City , S.D. , her mother did n't worry much about her being exposed to peanuts , a food that could kill the severely allergic teenager .
Danielle 's high school had a food allergy policy , and she had no problems during her nine months there .
But when the two moved to Charleston in 2006 , everything changed .
" Every day I send her out I never know whether or not I 'm going to have to go and get her , whether I 'm going to be called and told that she 's in the emergency room or if she 's going to make it that day , " said Jennifer Davis .
These are common worries for the parents of children with food allergies when they move to a new school , according to Anne Munoz - Furlong , founder and chief executive officer of the Food Allergies & Anaphylaxis Network .
The Alexandria , Va. - based nonprofit is pushing for a federal law to create uniform guidelines for schools to follow to protect the estimated 2 million school - age children with food allergies .
" Some schools have very comprehensive plans — they 've been working with food allergies for a long time — and others are just getting started and they do n't know what to do , " Munoz - Furlong said .
When Danielle 's peanut and tree nut allergies first developed , she was attending a U.S. Department of Defense school in Landstuhl , Germany .
Her mother worked with officials to create a policy there to handle food allergies in schools , but the Davises left for South Dakota shortly after it was implemented .
Davis said she had to start from square one in Charleston — meeting with , and providing food allergy literature to , Capital High School 's principal , teachers , cooks , nurses and the county 's schools superintendent .
Even though Capital High now has a policy that bans nut products , Danielle said it is n't vigorously enforced .
Danielle is terrified to attend school on the days following big candy holidays like Halloween and Easter because students bring peanut butter cups and other goodies with them .
Her nut allergy is so severe that she can go into shock if a child across a table or a school bus aisle eats peanut butter candy .
She takes four allergy medications every morning and carries two pens of self - injectable epinephrine , a form of adrenaline , everywhere she goes in case she starts to have a reaction .
" Having peanuts in my face is like having a loaded gun held to your head , " said Danielle , who estimates that during the past school year she suffered 20 reactions that landed her in the emergency room or a clinic for breathing treatments .
Many schools and school districts in the U.S. have allergy policies , but only Connecticut , New York , Rhode Island and Tennessee have statewide plans , according to the National Association of State Boards of Education .
While several other states have developed guidelines , U.S. Sen .
Chris Dodd , who introduced the legislation , told a Senate panel last month that " without federal guidance , a child 's health and safety may be protected in one school but not in another . "
The Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Management Act passed the House in April and is pending in the Senate .
The Connecticut Democrat knows firsthand about the problem .
His 6 - year - old daughter Grace is allergic to peanuts , tree nuts , shell fish , sesame and tropical fruits and has gone into shock four times .
Like Davis , Dodd and his wife have had to educate Grace 's school and her teachers about food allergies .
A Duke University Medical Center study released in 2007 says children are developing food allergies at younger ages .
The number of children under age 5 suffering from peanut allergy alone has doubled in the past decade , said Dr. Wesley Burks , the study 's senior author .
Researchers can't say why food allergies have increased , but one theory is that society has become too hygienic , which deprives children 's immune systems from building up their defenses , Burks said .
An estimated 12 million Americans have food allergies , which occur when the immune system identifies a food as harmful and triggers antibodies to attack it .
Eight foods account for 90 % of all allergic reactions — peanuts , tree nuts , milk , eggs , fish , shellfish , soy and wheat .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration 's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition says food allergies lead to 150 deaths , 30,000 emergency room visits and 2,000 hospitalizations each year .
Country singer Trace Adkins is using his celebrity status to raise awareness and lobby for the federal bill .
His 6 - year - old daughter Brianna suffers from nut , dairy and egg allergies .
" When I was a kid , I did n't know anybody that had any food allergies , " said Adkins .
" We 're doing something to our babies that are causing them to develop these allergies . "

If every teacher gave this kind of advice to their students , students would be more motivated to learn .
The problem is that most teachers do n’t understand their purpose , or they just do n’t care enough to give it any attention .
If a teacher only answers one question correctly in their entire career , it should go something like this :
Student : “ When am I ever going to use this information ?
I ’m never going to have to do this stuff in the real world !
These exercises are useless outside of this classroom ! ”
Teacher : “ You are correct .
It is quite likely that you will never directly apply any of these exercises outside of this classroom .
Their purpose is to coach your mind ’s thought process .
These exercises make you think , and over time they will train your mind to think more efficiently .
The only purpose is to build your problem solving capabilities .
You may never be asked to solve a complex factorial in the real world , but if your mind understands how to solve these problems , it will be more equipped to deal with the complex problems that do exist in the real world .
And believe me , the real world is filled with problems that need to be solved . ”
Update :
The people who feel that indirect education is pointless miss out on the fundamental concept .
While students may not use the specifics of every lesson they learn in school , every lesson does expand the core thought process of the student ’s mind .
Over time they develop problem solving skills that are universally applicable .
No single lesson can teach this , and no single lesson is more important .
France 's " three strikes " copyright enforcement law has gotten the backing of the country 's Cabinet , putting it on track to be implemented next January .
Under the plan , ISPs will be forced to heavily monitor Internet traffic for illegal activity , and enforcement will be overseen by a new state agency called HADOPI ( High Authority for Copyright Protection and Dissemination of Works on the Internet ) .
The plan , announced last November by President Nicolas Sarkozy , will yank the Internet access of those caught sharing copyrighted content via P2P after they 've been caught three times ( the first two times would involve warnings at various levels ) .
Their access would be cut off for up to a year , which lawmakers hope will be enough to dissuade other would - be downloaders from hopping on the pirate ship .
" It takes a preventive and educational approach , " France 's Culture Minister , Christine Albanel , told the Times Online .
The IFPI has long praised France 's plans to turn ISPs into copyright police .
" This is the single most important initiative to help win the war on online piracy that we have seen so far , " said IFPI CEO John Kennedy when the plan was first announced .
" By requiring ISPs to play a role in the fight against piracy , President Sarkozy has set an example to others of how to ensure that the creative industries remain strong in difficult markets so that they can remain major economic and cultural contributors to society . "
France has indeed set an example , as a number of other countries are now considering implementing similar laws .
Lawmakers in the UK began considering the country 's own three - strikes law in February of this year , closely followed by Australia .
Each time , the IFPI praised the moves , reiterating that " ISP cooperation " has been top priority for the recording industry for a number of years now .
ISPs are n't all that thrilled about the prospect of being held responsible for monitoring all content passing through their pipes , though .
Deep - packet inspection is extremely costly , argue industry groups , in addition to still being somewhat ineffective .
" ISPs are no more able to inspect and filter every single packet passing across their network than the Post Office is able to open every envelope , " said UK trade group Internet Service Provider Association in February .
Even without legislation , the record industry has already begun pressuring ISPs into complying with its requests .
For example , Virgin Media , one of the UK's largest ISPs , recently agreed to forward British music industry nastygrams to subscribers suspected of illegal file - swapping .
Of course , aside from the intense labor and costs involved in implementing such a policy , users will also lose much of the privacy they have come to expect from using the Internet , especially while at home .
With all the infrastructure set up to monitor Internet traffic for P2P infractions , France wo n't have to reach much further if it ever wants to enact a sweeping surveillance bill like the one recently approved in Sweden .

( Bernd Debusmann is a Reuters columnist .
The opinions expressed are his own )
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
It was the diplomatic equivalent of showing a stiff middle finger to the Iraqi government : the U.S. Department of State ’s extension of a contract with the private security firm Blackwater to protect American diplomats in Baghdad .
The contract was set to lapse on May 7 and its renewal came against the background of a pending FBI investigation into the killing of 17 Iraqi civilians by Blackwater operatives in a chaotic incident in a busy Baghdad square last September .
Blackwater says its motorcade came under fire and it acted in self - defense .
In the wake of the shooting , condemned as unprovoked and indiscriminate by the Iraqis , Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki said Blackwater should leave the country because “ the abundance of evidence against it makes it unfit to stay in Iraq . ”
He backed down later and agreed to await the result of investigations into the killings .
The State Department extended the contract ahead of the FBI ’s conclusions and this week a furious Maliki went on CNN to complain that his government had not even been consulted on the matter .
Blackwater ’s presence is an extremely sore point for many Iraqis who hate the high - speed , get - out - of the - way - or - die motorcades in which American officials and visiting VIPs under the company ’s protection have been ferried around Baghdad .
Prior advice or consultation on an issue as sensitive as Blackwater is a reasonable expectation - Iraq officially became a sovereign nation in June 2004 and the U.S. is portraying itself as a partner rather than an occupation power .
It is easy to see why Maliki , who is not held in high esteem by much of official Washington , would feel undermined and disrespected .
TRIBUTE TO BLACKWATER’S PROFESSIONALISM
The State Department ’s assessment of Blackwater differs greatly from the bleak Iraqi views of the company .
That comes through loud and clear in a just - published report by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security , the unit which signed the contract with Blackwater and is responsible for its activities in Iraq .
The foreword to the report is signed by Gregory Starr , acting head of the little - known bureau which has 1,450 agents scattered around the world .
He succeeded Richard Griffin , so far the only bureaucratic casualty of the September 16 shooting .
Griffin resigned last October in the face of sharp criticism from Congress over his handling of the affair .
The account of the Bureau ’s activities last year makes no mention of the September 16 shootings but pays tribute to Blackwater ’s professionalism .
“ Just three weeks into 2007 , Diplomatic Security suffered a tragic loss .
On January 23 , five of our highly valued professional security colleagues lost their lives in service to our nation .
“ These brave men , employees of Blackwater ... were killed when their helicopters came under attack while supporting a U.S. Embassy ground convoy traveling down a Baghdad street .
“ Their daily duty entailed sacrifice , service , commitment , and danger .
They now take their place among the 33 private security professionals who have lost their lives protecting the State Department since 2003 .
These men understood the enormous risk in their mission .
But they put the safety and security of others above their own . ”
The U.S. officials traveling in the convoy escaped unharmed .
Blackwater ’s CEO , Erik Prince , has often stressed that no U.S. official under his company ’s protection has been killed or wounded .
“ Success 100 percent of the time ” in his words .
JUSTICE SYSTEM
Along with the rest of the globe - spanning private security industry , Blackwater executives resent the widespread popular image of private military contractors as trigger - happy mercenaries driven by greed and adrenaline , accountable to no one and overseen by nobody .
Such perceptions have been nourished by a series of incidents , including a much - publicized case involving the bodyguard of Iraqi Vice President Adel Abdul - Mahdi , Raheem Khalif .
He was shot dead by a drunken Blackwater contractor on Christmas Eve , 2006 .
The contractor was fired and whisked home to the U.S. but never charged with a crime .
Blackwater and other security companies in Iraq have operated in a legal fog .
They were exempted from Iraq ’s fledgling judicial system under the infamous Coalition Provisional Authority order number 17 , decreed just before the U.S. handed over sovereignty .
“ Contractors shall be immune from Iraqi legal process with respects to acts performed pursuant to the terms and conditions of a contract ... ” it said .
Private security contractors in Iraq outnumber U.S. military personnel - 180,000 to 160,000 - but in five years of war , not a single contractor has been charged with a crime involving Iraqi civilians .
In contrast , there have been more than 60 courts martial of U.S. soldiers .
That skewed picture is supposed to change with new legislation , including a 2006 amendment to the Uniform Code of Military Justice , which allows civilian contractors to be tried by military courts .
Will that be used to cover cases like the Baghdad square shooting ?
Possibly .
But there is reason to be skeptical .
The first person to face criminal charges since the amendment passed ( and the first such prosecution since the Vietnam war ) involves an Iraqi - born translator , Alaa Mohammed Ali , who is accused of having stabbed another contractor .
He is scheduled to have his first pre-trial hearing this week .
It is a case of the U.S. military trying a non-American civilian for assaulting another non-American .
Whether that will be followed by a military court trying an American civilian for killing Iraqi civilians remains to be seen .

I ’m in the midst of the biggest gamble of my career .
The thing is , every chance you take feels like your biggest gamble while you ’re taking it .
When I left salaried employment for consulting in 2006 it felt like a big gamble .
When I left consulting for product in 2008 with a wife , kid and a mortgage , it felt like a huge gamble .
When I spent most of the money I had in the bank on a broken - down SaaS app few people had heard of , called HitTail , I was downright scared .
It ’s hard to put years of work and savings on the line , based on nothing more than confidence that you will execute .
Upside
But every one of the above gambles worked out , and I wound up far better off than if I ’d never taken them .
And here ’s the thing …
The more gambles you take , the better you become at reading the tea leaves and figuring out if your next gamble is going to work .
You also gain confidence in your ability to execute when your back is to the wall .
This means you do n’t crumble under the stress of the decision .
Instead , you start to become addicted to drawing yourself out of your comfort zone .
This is a good thing .
You start to embrace the immense amounts of learning that happen when you ’re doing something that terrifies you .
Pushing on Drip
When we launched Drip last November the first month was solid – over $ 7 k in recurring revenue .
I was pleased with that result and was looking forward to growth in the months that followed .
Except growth did n’t come .
Second month revenue ( granted , it was December ) was $ 7 k .
Third month revenue was the same .
And worse yet , I started to see a trend …
Many of the new subscribers I was adding through my tried - and - true marketing efforts were churning out after a few months of use .
It ’s an expression I used to call “ leaking out of the bottom of the funnel . ”
Now we just call it churn .
A high churn rate means you have n’t found a market that really needs your product , or , worse yet , that you ’ve built something no market wants ( yet ) .
And if you ’re paying attention this is the learning phase that happens between building and scaling ( I talked about it in my 2013 MicroConf talk ) .
The learning phase is , in my opinion , the most painful part .
So while the percentage of new users who completed onboarding was high for an app of this complexity ( close to 60 % ) , they were not sticking around like I would hope , which meant we had n’t hit the nail on the head and solved the problem I came to solve .
Namely : fixing email marketing for startups .
Obvious
So it was back to work .
We had more than a dozen requests for “ marketing automation ” features – basically , features that allow you to send subscribers personalized emails based on their behavior .
So if they read a lot of SEO articles on your website , you can tag them with “ SEO ” and move them into your SEO crash course .
And that ’s the tip of the iceberg ; you can tag people based on links they click , URLs they visit , or things they buy .
Tracking customers from website visitor to marketing subscriber to trial user to customer , and being able to tailor communications the entire time is insanely powerful .
In fact , it ’s the future of email marketing .
But I did n’t want to build a behavioral email / marketing automation platform .
It would be a ton of work to build , and the space has been crowded for years .
It ’s not a typical bootstrapper play , it ’s the kind for which you raise funding .
But the more founders I spoke with , the more I realized this was the real problem they were facing .
Most founders have either outgrown their first email marketing app ( think of a static email newsletter service like MailChimp or AWeber ) , or they ’ve tried a beefy tool like Infusionsoft and it has n’t worked out due to high price and low usability .
Contrary to my plans , founders did n’t need a little help with email marketing , they were telling me they needed a massive step up from the tools on the market .
Perhaps fixing email marketing for startups was a much bigger problem than I had originally thought .
And perhaps this new approach was the one that I came here to solve .
Best Laid Plans
We planned for 1 month of development to build email marketing automation focused on the Saas , WP plugin and info product use cases .
It took almost 5 .
We rolled it out in batches – a new feature every few weeks .
And the strangest thing happened as we did …
Revenue started moving up .
First a few hundred .
Then a thousand .
Churn plummeted .
By more than 50 % .
Revenue rose almost 50 % in a couple months .
All during a time when I was heads down , not doing a lick of marketing .
I had a feeling we were on to something .
The Gamble
I ’ve invested a year ’s worth of company profits into Drip .
Funds that could buy a house in most cities in the world .
And I ’ve invested the bulk of my waking hours for a year .
We ’re entering a competitive market with massive upside and players who have raised millions of dollars .
And here I sit , on the eve of unleashing Drip 2.0 realizing that this is , once again , the biggest gamble of my career .
The thing is , every chance you take feels like your biggest gamble while you ’re taking it .
And most of the time choosing the gamble is the right choice .
Wish me luck .
We 've already seen plenty of Guitar Hero World Tour 's drums , but while we 've heard rumblings of a touchpad for the new guitar , this is the first time we 've seen it in the flesh .
IGN has a preview of all the new gear , and says the strip will be used for fiddling around with notes during sustains , tapping to play notes , and for interfacing with the new music creator .
The guitar is also larger than its other toy guitar predecessors .
In other news , the drums are pressure sensitive , the mic is pretty plain , and the music creation software is completely off the chain .
Unfortunately , you wo n't be allowed to record vocals for songs , but otherwise you can pretty much build anything you 'd want with the software .
In even better news , the Wii version of World Tour will share all these features , and while we promised ourselves we would n't install two full sets of fake band gear in our living room , we 're starting to get some serious cravings here .

South African police managed to extinguish the flames however the man died later in hospital
A man was attacked and set alight during ongoing xenophobic attacks in Ramaphosa squatter camp east of Johannesburg , South Africa .
The man died later in hospital
WARNING -
This article contains images which some readers may find disturbing - Heavily armed police patrol the townships in Johannesburg
THE images recall the worst days of apartheid .
A hunched figure on his knees in the middle of a township street , the human form barely visible through flames and smoke , while an angry crowd whistles and jeers as policemen try to extinguish the blaze .
The picture of a man being burnt alive made the front pages of most newspapers in South Africa yesterday after a week - long outbreak of xenophobic violence reached new levels of horror .
It led to calls for tough action by the authorities to bring the situation under control and more criticism of the lame - duck government of President Mbeki , which is fighting to maintain its credibility .
The victim in the pictures , a Zimbabwean , is believed to have died later in hospital .
The wrath of the country 's teeming townships is not directed at apartheid agents or informers , but at foreigners -- fellow blacks mainly from Zimbabwe and Mozambique -- who are accused of stealing locals ' jobs and adding to the high crime rates .
At least 22 people have been killed since the violence began last Tuesday in the northern - Johannesburg township of Alexandra .
It has since spread , forcing immigrants in townships to run for their lives .
Many are ordered to leave their meagre possessions behind .
The violence has focused attention on the failure of the ruling African National Congress ( ANC ) to improve life for those at the bottom of the country 's social pyramid .
Unemployment in the townships is well above the national average of 25 pc and basic services are in short supply .
Yesterday , crowds of foreigners sought refuge at packed community centres and police stations on the edge of townships across Gauteng province , where Johannesburg is located .
Police fired rubber bullets and teargas at gangs of men who threatened to burn down foreigners ' shacks .
In Reiger Park , a slum area outside East Rand , Johannesburg , at least two people were burnt and dozens of residents were forced to flee .
The violence spread to downtown Johannesburg , where hundreds of foreign families squat in buildings , which were vacated by South Africans who abandoned the area because of crime and prostitution .
" People are having to find scapegoats , this is about competition for diminishing resources . . .
Mbeki has tried to de-racialise the economy but only a very small number at the top have really benefited , " Sipho Seephe , the president of the South Africa Institute of Race Relations , said .
The government of Mr Mbeki has overseen economic growth , which created an emerging black middle class , but about 40 pc of the population -- 80 pc of which is black -- is little better off than at the end of apartheid in 1994 .
It is the return of necklacing -- when alleged traitors had rubber tyres put over their necks and set on fire -- that has most appalled liberal commentators and many ordinary citizens .
Derided
Once again Mr Mbeki -- who is derided at home and abroad because of his " quiet diplomacy " towards Robert Mugabe -- finds himself in the line of fire .
For years the government was warned that the influx of Zimbabweans into the country was straining relations among the poorest sections of the community .
An estimated three - million exiles from Zimbabwe , most of them illegal immigrants , are now competing along with large numbers of Malawians , Somalis and Mozambicans for scarce jobs .
Poor South Africans accuse them of jumping housing queues by paying bribes to corrupt officials .
The economic policies of Mr Mbeki created a booming black middle class but have done little to help the country 's poorest .
This contributed to him losing the ANC presidency to Jacob Zuma , a populist , last year .
His reaction to the current crisis -- to call an inquiry -- is dismissed as typical " Mbeki fudging " .
one political commentator said : " People want action , on jobs , on Zimbabwe , on crime -- instead we get reviews and inquiries .
We know the causes of these problems , it is a failure of leadership . "
A radio talk show host accused Mr Mbeki and his denialist cabinet of not having the faintest idea about what is happening in the townships .
Mathews Phosa , the ANC treasurer - general , called for Mr Mbeki to step down early -- a call from which the ANC leadership later distanced itself .
The government is blamed for failing to grant many of the Zimbabweans refugee status , leaving them few options but to work as illegal immigrants .

A highly controversial San Antonio evangelical pastor has endorsed John McCain .
Notice in Elisabeth Bumiller 's piece --- she fails to bring up anything about Hagee 's core beliefs .
I guess they are all the same to her .
McCain : I was pleased to have the endorsement of pastor John Hagee yesterday .
McCain is happy as a clam .
Looks like the pastor had a bit of a problem with the IRS and Hagee 's not too fond of the Catholic church either .
From his book Jerusalem Countdown : ...
Adolf Hitler attended a Catholic school as a child and heard all the fiery anti-Semitic rantings from Chrysostom to Martin Luther .
When Hitler became a global demonic monster , the Catholic Church and Pope Pius XII never , ever slightly criticized him .
Pope Pius XII , called by historians ' Hitler 's Pope , ' joined Hitler in the infamous Concordat of Collaboration , which turned the youth of Germany over to Nazism , and the churches became the stage background for the bloodthirsty cry , ' Pereat Judea ' ....
In all of his [ Hitler 's ] years of absolute brutality , he was never denounced or even scolded by Pope Pius XII or any Catholic leader in the world .
To those Christians who believe that Jewish hearts will be warmed by the sight of the cross , please be informed — to them it's an electric chair .
This is the kind of hate that permeates the extreme wing of the religious right .
Bill Donohue is freaking out over Hagee and McCain .
Glenn Greenwald interviewed him today :
The Catholic League demanded that McCain repudiate Hagee and his endorsement , just as Barack Obama did earlier this week with Louis Farrakhan ( despite the fact that Obama , unlike McCain with Hagee , never sought out or accepted Farrakhan 's endorsement )
In the interview , Donohue made some extraordinary statements .
He compared Hagee both to Louis Farrakhan and Bob Jones , but noted : " Hagee is far more powerful than Farrakhan is today .
. . .
Hagee is a major player .
There 's no end to his money .
He has an empire down there . "
Regarding the intense 2000 media controversy when then - Gov. George Bush spoke at Bob Jones University , Donohue said :
Why were they so exercised about Bob Jones ?
This is worse .
. . .
If someone said to me : who is the biggest anti-Catholic bigot in the evangelical community , I would say : hands down , John Hagee .
The entire podcast interview , which lasted roughly 15 minutes , can be heard here .

When a Mexican press aide scooped up the BlackBerrys of several US officials this week and attempted to take them out of the country , Secret Service agents intercepted him before he could get on his plane and demanded the devices be returned .
BlackBerrys and other portable electronics now carry so much information that they can be a gold mine to those who have a chance to look through them .
But it 's not just Mexican diplomatic officials who would like a peek inside such devices ; the US Border Patrol has been exercising its right to search the contents of any laptop or electronic device entering or leaving the country , and that has some civil liberties groups alarmed .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation sent a letter today on behalf of 40 civil liberties organizations to the head of the House Committee on Homeland Security .
The groups want Congress to hold hearings on border searches of laptops and other electronics , searches which the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals recently affirmed could proceed without any form of probable cause .
The next time you enter the US , Customs and Border Patrol agents legally have the right to take your laptop and rifle through it , and they do n't need to give you a reason why .
The letter argues that these sorts of searches can easily become " abusive " without oversight , and the Department of Homeland Security has refused to release any information about its policies and procedures relating to such searches .
Worries about such searches are n't merely hypothetical ; laptop searches are happening now ( hence the court case ) and have been for years .
In fact , the Ninth Circuit considered a similar case back in 2006 and came to the same conclusion .
" In a free society , the government cannot have unlimited power to read , sees , store and use all information on any electronic device carried by any traveler entering or leaving the nation , " says the letter .
" Therefore , Congress must exercise oversight to ensure that border searches are not overly invasive or discriminatory , and establish appropriate safeguards to protect any information collected and maintained by the government . "
This also is not a case where you do n't have to worry if you 're not a child - porn toting pedophile .
All sorts of information could be at risk , including proprietary corporate databases and confidential personnel and financial information carried by executives on their laptops .
In fact , the Association of Corporate Travel Executives has even taken to warning its members about the issue , and this is not a group generally known for absurd , scare - mongering black helicopter - type claims .
The rest of the signatories are just as interesting .
The usual suspects are present in force : the EFF , the Center for Democracy and Technology , the Center for Digital Democracy , etc .
Also on the list are groups like the National Center for Transgender Equality , Feminists for Free Expression , the American Association of University Professors , and the ACLU .
More conservative groups like the Republican Liberty Caucus and the Rutherford Institute are also present , showing that questions of privacy and civil rights are n't being asked only by one side of the political spectrum .
With the increasing amount of data stored not just on laptops but on even more common devices like cellular phones , now is certainly the time for Congress to look into the issue and for us as a society to think about how we are comfortable with such searches being conducted .

From an AP report :
The widespread use of ethanol from corn could result in nearly twice the greenhouse gas emissions
as the gasoline it would replace because of expected land - use changes ,
researchers concluded Thursday .
The study challenges the rush to
biofuels as a response to global warming .
The researchers said that past studies showing the benefits of ethanol in combating climate change
have not taken into account almost certain changes in land use
worldwide if ethanol from corn " ” and in the future from other
feedstocks such as switchgrass " ” become a prized commodity .
" Using good cropland to expand biofuels will probably exacerbate
global warming , " concludes the study published in Science magazine .
Promoters of biofuels often hold up Brazil as an example of a model ethanol mandate .
Forget for a moment that in fact ethanol still makes up only a small percentage of the transportation fuel market in Brazil .
Think of all those satellite photos we used to see of farmers burning the Amazon to expand cropland :
I know that correlation is not equal to causation , but the fact is that this land clearing , which has always one on , really accelerated after the Brazilian ethanol mandates and subsidies .
My prediction is that careful academic work in the coming years will pin the blame for a lot of the destruction of the Amazon on ethanol .
Moonbattery has a fitting conclusion :
This Presidents ' Day , if you 're an American , you can thank George W. Bush for at least one thing : on Friday , the President signed into law new legislation which will make the national Do Not Call registry even better .
No one likes phone spam , and the DNCR is doing a great job of curtailing it .
Yet , the DNCR did have some flaws , and in a rare case of Washington harmony , all parties came together to fix the most pressing problems .
The big kahuna was a ticking clock on original DNCR registrations from users like you and me .
When the DNCR was launched in 2003 , it was launched with a five - year " reset " policy for any registered number .
This meant that , according to the original rules , had you signed up in 2003 , sometime in 2008 you'd be removed from the list whether you liked it or not .
You could always sign up again , but it 's a hassle that no one ( save perhaps telemarketers ) thought was fair .
Reacting to consumer and congressional concern that a " reset " was both unnecessary and unfair to consumers , the FTC already agreed to suspend the removal of any registered users until Congress and the President could consider the matter .
It did n't make sense to start resetting user 's registry entries if there was a chance the policy would be chucked out the window .
The House and the Senate approved their own versions of DNCR bills last month ( S.781 and H.R. 3541 ) , which were combined for the President 's signature .
In particular , it was the Do-Not - Call Improvement Act of 2007 ( H.R. 3541 , the Senate counterpart was S.2096 ) that did away with the automatically - expiring registrations .
To appease telemarketers , the new law requires that the FTC " periodically check telephone numbers registered " on the list and remove any that have been disconnected or have been reassigned .
The FTC is tasked with working with phone companies in particular to make sure that the only numbers active in the list are those which belong to the person who submitted them .
After a nine - month examination period , the FTC is to report to Congress on the effectiveness of such efforts to increase the " accuracy " of the DNCR .
Addendum : why I love the DNCR
My family recently moved into a new home , and with it , we received a new phone number ( I did n't want a new one , but in Massachusetts they can be strict about towns and their exchanges ) .
At our old house we had been covered by the DNCR , but at the new home , we were n't because we had a new number .
It took one week , at most , before the unsolicited calls started .
When they started , they were frequent and annoying .
Life " off " the DNCR was horrible .
After about another week of putting up with it ( it just sat on a long " to do list " as we attended to other move - in crises ) , we finally got around to signing up our new number , and even though the Registry gives ample time for opt - out information to be followed by telemarketers , in reality we were spam - call - free within a week .
In short , the DNCR works , it 's fast , and telemarketers are by and large obeying it when expected .

Office workers wanting to get on , shop assistants trying to sell and call centre workers ordered to be friendly all suffer higher stress levels if they regularly have to put on a grin , German scientist Professor Dieter Zapf said .
StumbleUpon is an amazing phenomenon which has become a very important source of traffic for those website owners who understand what it is and how it works .
I personally know how big the impact can be because over the last few weeks we have befitted twice from StumbleUpon traffic surges :
This article will provide a quick guide to getting your site picked up by StumbleUpon , giving you the potential for attracting thousands of extra visitors .
StumbleUpon , which is often referred to as SU , is a service that allows users to surf the internet randomly to find great sites , videos and photos all with a common theme .
For example
, if I ’m interested in model trains , I can use StumbleUpon to randomly show me lots of different sites related to model trains .
What makes StumbleUpon special is that all the sites it displays have been chosen by its users , who can rate the sites as good or bad .
This voting process means the quality of sites displayed continually improves .
The only way to really understand how it works is to sign up for a free account and start using it .
It ’s a great service which is fun to use .
Go to
From a website owner ’s point of view , if your pages get indexed by StumbleUpon and then get lots of “ thumbs up ” votes from SU users , you can suddenly find thousands of extra people visiting your site .
Simply because it can drive huge numbers of new visitors to your website .
Others will decide to link to your site from their own , giving you valuable inbound links .
Our success with SU , has meant that we have learned what types of content they like , and just as importantly , what they do n’t like .
The first things to understand is how StumbleUpon works from a website owners point of view .
StumbleUpon users add a toolbar to their browser .
This has a button that reads “ Stumble ” and two more buttons ; one a thumbs up and the other a thumbs down .
Stumblers click the Stumble button , which takes them to a random page from the subject channel that they have chosen .
When they arrive on the page they can give it a thumbs up or thumbs
down depending on whether they like it or not .
The more thumbs up a page gets the more frequently it is displayed to other Stumblers .
If a page gets lots of thumbs down it is de-listed .
It follows that
as a website owner you have two objectives .
OBJECTIVE # 2 – Encourage lots of Stumblers to give your page additional thumbs up so that it continues to get displayed to other Stumblers .
This is what drives the traffic to your site
Creating
StumbleUpon Friendly Content
I studied a lot of pages on StumbleUpon and c
reated a list of common themes .
I then created some pages on the SubHub website which included all these elements .
The result was one out of the three articles I created got picked up .
This single page drove thousands of extra visitors to our site .
It ’s a wonderful feeling opening Google Analytics and seeing thousands of extra people have visited your site .
Some of these people will love what you do and bookmark your site or sign - up to your newsletter .
Be warned ( but do n’t be put off ) most Stumblers spend less than 10 seconds on a site , but amongst these shooting stars there will be prospects who hang around … and return . –
Get the first few thumbs up so your page gets indexed ( why not suggest to friends who may be interested , that they visit your site / page and give it a thumbs up on their SU toolbar if they like it ) .
Christmas Readings - 2018
It 's Tuesday - December 25th , 2018 and it's time to celebrate Christmas .
That means it 's time for parties filled with presents along with good food and drink .
It 's a time for being with family and friends , showing kindness to strangers and doing all those other things we just do n't seem to have time enough to do during the rest of the year .
And it 's a time for tales of the supernatural .
Authors like Charles Dickens , Jerome K. Jerome , John Kendrick Bangs and many others have used the Christmas season as an inspiration for ghost stories that do n't so much scare us as fill us with wonder or make us laugh .
And so Hour 25 will continue its long running tradition of reading you holiday stories with a twist of the supernatural to go along with your holiday celebrations .
We 've got ghosts in castles , restless mummies in boxes and who knows what else .
So light up your Christmas tree , pour yourself some egg nog and grab some Christmas cookies .
Get comfortable because you 're on a journey to the worlds of Christmas imagination with Mike Hodel 's Hour 25 - The Hour That Stretches .
The Transplanted Ghost by Wallace Irwin
Americans with money can be sorta strange .
After they have amassed their fortune they seek class and respectability and if they can't earn those things ... well ... they try and buy them .
One thing they have done in this pursuit is to go over to England or Europe and buy titles or old mansions or even castles and then have them dismantled and sent home to America .
Our first story for tonight tells of the misadventures of a man who thought he had bought a haunted castle - because he thought that would make it even more valuable and classy - but for the life of him the ghost just wo n't appear .
And along with that he has a beautiful daughter whom he keeps locked away because he 's afraid that young adventurers will want to marry her for her money .
The protagonist of our story is set up for more than a few misadventures when he is invited to spend a night in that castle ... on Christmas Eve .
Enjoy .
A Christmas Mummy by Richard Marsh
Christmas is a time when boxes can contain mysteries that might be toys or some other wonderful item .
As a result a child 's imagination can become overstimulated when presented with a large box on Christmas Eve - especially when told that the box contains a real mummy .
Who could blame a child for wanting to take a peek into such a box ?
But later - when mysterious scrapings and bumpings are heard coming from the room containing the box - that same child might be wishing she had less curiosity or at least less imagination .
Tonight 's story brings you mysterious happenings on Christmas Eve when two young girls discover The Christmas Mummy .
Christmas Greetings from the Moon
I 'll never forget Christmas Eve 1968 - when I went outside on a cold winter 's night and looked up at the Moon , shining over snow and Christmas lights , and realized that at that very moment three men from Earth were circling that world .
This proved that the Moon was not just a place for science fiction dreams but a real place just waiting to be explored .
For a young man who had been dreaming of spaceflight for his whole life the inescapable reality of that moment was a dream come true .
So let us remember that as the crew of Apollo 8 orbited above our lifeless
Moon that night , they looked back to see the Earth - a blue and green oasis floating against star filled blackness - and sent the world a Christmas greeting ...
The first ever from another world .
A Science Fictional Christmas
Back in the 1950's Galaxy Magazine had a tradition of publishing Christmas themed covers for their holiday season issues .
{ And now Hour 25 has something of a tradition of reprinting those covers for our Christmas show .}
While looking at them I was struck by the similarities between what Santa does and what engineers do when designing and flying missions to other planets .
First you must establish your mission requirements ...
Next you must plan your mission ...
Then you must travel through space whilst being careful to account for any mid-course encounters with other objects or spacecraft ...
Upon reaching your destination you must carefully deploy your payloads ...
And when your mission is completed you can sit down with friends and give a toast to a job well done .
From all of us here at Hour 25 , we wish you the very best for this holiday season whether you celebrate Christmas , Chanukah , Kwanzaa , or any other Solstice holiday .
During this season celebrating Peace on Earth and Good Will To All be sure to spend some time with your family and friends .
They are an island of peace in a world filled with stress and strife and should be treasured .
And remember , when happiness comes to your party be sure to give it a comfortable seat .
Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you all .
The Hour 25 Broadcast
Never underestimate the power of Hillary Clinton to say anything — anything — even if it abets the Republican party .
Today , she launched an attack on Obama that could have come right from the RNC .
Ben Smith has Clinton ’s quote and notes :
Now , this is more a general election wedge than a Democratic primary one , and Hillary Clinton may not be the world ’s best messenger on the Second Amendment .
But it ’s a preview of things to come .
“ General election wedge ” from Hillary Clinton .
Thanks ,
Hill .
And , there will be more to come .
Her mission is to destroy Obama .
Also unbelievable :
In Indianapolis , Clinton says that she does n’t think most Americans are “ bitter , ” says “ what I hear are real concerns about unfair trade practices that cost people jobs . ”
Would those “ unfair trade practices ” include NAFTA , which was supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton ?
And , how about the Colombia trade agreement supported by Bill Clinton and Mark Penn ?
Will anyone in the punditry note the hypocrisy in that attack ?
And , if Hillary does n’t think people are bitter , she might talk to some of the creditors owed large sums by her campaign .
I imagine some of them are bitter since they ’re now talking about taking Hillary ’s campaign to collections .
But for Hillary to talk to real people means she would have to step out of the overly - scripted , focus group tested , elitist , out - of - touch bubble that she ’s lived in for 16 years .
Instead , she ’s just delivering GOP talking points in order to hurt our chances of beating McCain in the fall .
France has about 1,500 soldiers in Afghanistan French President Nicolas Sarkozy has said France will send more troops to bolster Nato 's mission in Afghanistan , subject to certain conditions .
Mr Sarkozy , who is on a state visit to Britain , said he would make the offer at next week 's Nato summit in the Romanian capital , Bucharest .
Britain and the US have frequently called on other Nato members to send more soldiers to fight the Taleban .
The Nato - led force , Isaf , currently has over 43,000 personnel in Afghanistan .
In a speech to the British parliament in London , Mr Sarkozy said the Taleban could not be allowed to regain power .
" In Afghanistan something essential is being played out , " he said .
" France has proposed a strategy to its allies in the Atlantic alliance to enable the Afghan people and their legitimate government to build peace .
The speech was a good start to the ' entente amicale ' that Mr Sarkozy wants
Sarkozy woos the British France , UK 'at their closest '
" If these proposals are accepted , during the summit in Bucharest , France will propose reinforcing its military presence . "
The BBC 's political correspondent , Jon Devitt , says Mr Sarkozy wants guarantees from the alliance that Afghans will be given more responsibility , and that non-military aspects of the mission will be better co-ordinated .
He did not say how many soldiers he was thinking of sending - according to Nato figures , France currently has 1,515 soldiers in Afghanistan .
The BBC 's diplomatic correspondent , Jonathan Marcus , says there have always been suspicions in London and Washington that France wants to undermine Nato and the trans -Atlantic partnership , but , he says , President Sarkozy is in the process of changing that impression .

Star -system explosion could threaten life on Earth .
The clear dust spiral shows that a beam from this star would be aimed at Earth .
Courtesy of the researchers
Astronomers have spotted a binary star system that could collapse to produce a massive gamma-ray burst at any point during the next few hundred thousand years — and it is pointing at Earth .
The binary star system WR 104 , some 8,000 light - years from Earth in the Sagittarius constellation , is made up of two stars that complete an orbit of one another every 8 months .
Both stars are massive and have strong solar winds that spew out material , resulting in a spiralling trail of hot gas and dust .
Peter Tuthill at the University of Sydney in Australia and his colleagues watched WR 104 for 6 years , during which time they saw 10 full orbits and captured them on camera using the Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea , Hawaii .
The research is published in the Astrophysical Journal1 .
The resulting pictures show the spiralling dust in all its glory , and reveal a potentially devastating fact : Earth looks down the axis of the system .
“ It is pointing at us within a range of about 0 – 16 º , ” says Tuthill , who estimates it is most likely 12 º off - centre .
“ It would take on a different appearance , looking foreshortened , if we were looking at it from a wider angle . ”
The massive stars are certain to explode , and soon , astronomically speaking .
The question is whether this will happen in a supernova that bursts in all directions , spreading out the damage , or whether the stars are spinning fast enough for this explosion to be directed in a gamma-ray burst .
If so , the angle of the system means that we are in the firing line for one half of the burst jet .
It is unclear how direct the burst would have to be to have an effect , says Tuthill .
It has been variously postulated that a burst angle of 2 – 20 º might put us outside the danger zone , but Tuthill says that even a miss of 12 º would be dangerous for life on Earth .
Caught in the beam
A mass -extinction event on Earth some 450 million years ago might have been triggered by a gamma-ray burst .
Adrian Melott at the University of Kansas in Lawrence , who suggested this in 2003 , says that the new observations of WR 104 are big news because this is the first candidate system spotted that could produce a similar Earth - walloping gamma - ray burst in the future .
“ If it were a full gamma - ray burst and we were caught in the beam , the effects would be pretty severe , ” says Melott .
“ My guess is that there would be a lot of death from it , rather like a small - scale nuclear war . ”
A gamma-ray beam might not kill us all immediately .
First there would be a bright flash , possibly blinding people , says Melott , then after a few hours the effects would begin in earnest .
The gamma rays would break up molecules in the atmosphere , producing particular oxides of nitrogen that would start to eat up the ozone layer after a few hours , says Melott .
Within a few days a quarter of the ozone layer would be destroyed , he suggests .
The ozone destruction would allow through enough ultraviolet light to cause severe radiation damage to plants and people .
The nitrogen oxides would also cause acid rain that could kill off plants and algae .
In a spin
But it is impossible to predict whether WR 104 will produce a gamma-ray burst , or when it might happen .
For it to occur , the star has to be spinning fast enough to make an axis for the gamma -ray beam to emerge .
“ Here is where things get a bit more complicated and murky , ” says Tuthill , who says he does n’t know whether WR104 is spinning fast enough .
ADVERTISEMENT
The fact that this is a binary system could mean that the spin is high , says gamma-ray expert Craig Wheeler at the University of Texas at Austin .
“ In a binary system the two stars yank each other around and spin each other up , ” he says .
But Wheeler says he is n't yet scared of what is rapidly becoming known as the Death Star .
“ I ’m not going to worry about it at all . ”
There are , certainly , more concrete dangers to worry about , and many questions to answer before we all duck for cover .
“ WR 104 is now in the last - known stable phase of a massive star .
It should explode as a supernova within a few hundred thousand years .
Of course , this could mean tomorrow , we have no way of telling , ” says Tuthill .
Watch a video of the spinning star system .
According to Entrepreneur.com , " [ n ] aming a business is a lot like laying the cornerstone of a building .
Once it 's in place , the entire foundation and structure is aligned to that original stone . "
For example , Smucker 's , famous for its jams and jellies , skillfully capitalized on its unusual name with the slogan , " With a name like Smucker 's , it has to be good . "
The jury 's out , though , on the following establishments :
1. Yeah , it 's a liquor store ; we get it .
The modern day connotation is difficult , at least for our juvenile minds , to get past , however .
2. Bubba , you 're not running a bait shop .
You have a last name .

A new law being considered in the U.S. Congress would attempt to prevent postpartum depression in new moms by drugging them with SSRI antidepressant drugs while they ’re still pregnant .
This legislation is being aggressively pushed by pro-pharma front groups in an effort to expand the customer base for SSRI drugs by targeting pregnant women as new " customers " for the chemicals .
It ’s an example of the latest insanity from Big Pharma , whose drugs are already killing over 100,000 Americans each year while inciting violence and suicides in teens .
Every single shooting massacre we ’ve seen in the last ten years has been carried out by a person taking SSRI antidepressant drugs .
The mainstream media pays no attention to this link , and the FDA ignores the reports in order to keep these drugs on the market .
SSRI drugs have never been approved for use on newborns , yet this new MOTHERS
Act will effectively drug unborn babies and newborns with drugs like Prozac .
This will certainly have an impact on their developing brains , and the bulk of the research available today shows that the impact will be negative .
Will these children be more prone to violent thoughts and behavior ?
Will they contemplate suicide at younger ages ?
And what will be the impact of the drugs on the mother ?
For one mother who was drugged with antidepressants — Amy Philo — the drugs caused her to experience thoughts of violence against her own newborn babies .
After taking antidepressants prescribed by her doctor , she had visions of killing them ( and herself ) .
Upon returning to her doctor , Amy was told to increase the dosage !
Eventually , Amy realized the drugs were wrecking her own brain chemistry , and she stopped taking the pills entirely , causing the thoughts of violence and suicide to subside .
Now , Amy is leading a campaign to stop the MOTHERS Act .
She ’s posted a heart - wrenching 5 - minute video on YouTube that tells her story ( with pictures of her babies , too ! ) :
http://youtube.com/watch?v=LQW23XCmOCw
A local news station also covered her story , and that report can be viewed here :
http://youtube.com/watch?v=W4B8I_8wz6I
An article explaining more about the effort to stop the MOTHERS
Act is found here :
http://birthfriend.wordpress.com/2008/0…
As you ’ll learn from these videos and articles , the real purpose of the MOTHERS
Act is to drug the mothers .
Thus , it should really be called the Drug the MOTHERS Act !
It ’s being pushed by drug companies , of course , and backed by psychiatrists and corrupt government officials who have close ties to the pharmaceutical industry .
The whole point of this act is not to protect mothers from depression , but to recruit mothers as patients and , by doing so , also expose newborns to psychiatric drugs that will destroy their normal brain function and turn them into lifelong customers requiring ongoing chemical treatment .
We must stop the MOTHERS Act .
It is a dangerous law created for marketing purposes , not medical purposes .
Treating pregnant women with antidepressant drugs ( and thereby exposing their unborn babies to those drugs ) is one of the most outrageous pro-pharma ideas to come along in many years .
It ’s not enough to drug the teenagers and children with these dangerous pharmaceuticals , now Big Pharma wants to start drugging children before they ’re even born !
If this law is passed and implemented , I fear for the future of our babies .
Imbalanced by these dangerous pharmaceuticals , mothers are likely to commit acts of extreme violence against their children .
Then they will be thrown into the prison system , of course , where they will be drugged with yet more psychiatric drugs ( generating yet more profits for Big Pharma ) .
Their children , meanwhile , will be taken away by Child Protective Services and treated with psychiatric drugs under the care of a " psychiatric doctors " who , of course , will poison that child ’s brain with a never - ending regimen of Big Pharma ’s chemicals .
Do you see the scam here ?
By " screening " pregnant women for depression , they can create TWO new patients for psychiatric drugs , even though a family is destroyed in the process .
This is precisely the aim of Big Pharma :
Sell more drugs , create more markets , and earn more profits regardless of the cost in human suffering .
Big Pharma has zero concern for families and zero compassion for human beings .
It only seeks to poison the minds of the people through television advertising and psychiatric drugs , all while maximizing its own profits .
What you can do to stop the MOTHERS Act
We must work together to stop this dangerous act that would recruit mothers to be treated with dangerous psychiatric drugs ( while exposing their unborn babies to those same drugs ) .

By the way , this is not an article about pro-life vs. pro-choice on the issue of unborn babies , and I use the term " unborn babies " in a purely humanitarian sense , because a child that ’s in the womb and about to be born is clearly an " unborn baby " whose health must be protected .
I am opposed to the drugging of mothers during any trimester .
Pharmaceuticals simply do not belong in expectant mothers .
Those pharmaceuticals pass straight through to the blood of the fetus .
Regardless of whether you ’re pro-life or pro-choice on the issue of abortion , I hope you agree that pregnant women should not be drugged with antidepressants !
Press release from UNITE / CHAADA
UNITE / CHAADA / ICFDA / COPES Foundation Objection to the Proposed MOTHERS Act – Bill before Senate Puts Young Children and Mothers in Serious Danger
To the HELP Committee of the United States Senate :
For years , the March of Dimes has warned not to use meds while pregnant .
Why now encourage mothers to take drugs ?
Please register this extreme objection to the proposed MOTHERS Act ( S. 1375 ) which is now before you in committee .
It is my earnest hope that you will immediately defeat this bill in committee .
The bill has been brought to you under the guise of ensuring safety or support for new mothers ; however , nothing could be further from the truth .
The bill was originally proposed in response to the death by suicide of Melanie Stokes , a pharmaceutical rep .
who took her own life by leaping from a balcony several stories off of the ground .
Contrary to popular understanding it was not post - partum depression that killed Melanie , but the numerous antidepressant drugs she was taking , which the FDA confirmed double the suicide risk .
Nobody is suggesting that new moms do not ever experience mood swings , depression , or even psychotic episodes .
The more important issue is what the effect of this bill will be and why nobody is addressing potential methods of prevention .
Everyone knows how many young moms experience gestational diabetes , but who is addressing the even higher rate of gestational hypoglycemia , which often initially manifests as depression ?
This is a physical condition that is treated with diet and is exacerbated by antidepressants ( which list hypoglycemia as a side effect ) .
To simply screen women for post - partum mood disorders and ensure that they get " treatment , " we would be setting families up for the expectation of tragedy and increasing the chances of that actually happening when we refer them to medical " professionals " who are oblivious to the negative mind - altering effects of psychiatric drugs .
A popular opinion among medical caregivers these days is that " post - partum mood disorders " must be a sign of an underlying biochemical imbalance and would be corrected with drugs .
Current drugs used on post - partum women include SSRIs , atypical antidepressants , and even antipsychotic drugs .
These pose a significant risk to the immediate safety and health of women as well as their children and families .
SSRIs carry a black box warning for suicide and the most popular one , Effexor ( the same medication Andrea Yates was taking when she drowned her 5 children ) , has the words “ homicidal ideation ” listed as a side effect .
Nearly every recent case of infanticide which has made news can be clearly linked back to a psychiatric drug .
These drugs endanger babies and mothers .
Additionally , the drugs can be extremely addictive and also pose a risk to nurslings or babies exposed in subsequent pregnancies .
Some babies have died from SIDS linked to exposure from pregnancy or nursing ; others have experienced coma , seizures , GI bleeding , heart defects , lung problems , and many babies died before reaching full term or soon after birth .
The bill does not address the fact that studies show that biological agents ( antidepressants for example ) cited in the bill and already prescribed to pregnant women can cause congenital heart birth defects where children have had to undergo open - heart surgeries to correct this .
Also , some babies are being born with organs outside their bodies , requiring immediate surgery .
In closing I want to re-emphasize the total lack of any real answer to post - partum depression posed by this bill .
If we can prevent post - partum depression or support moms through it , or offer proven SAFE and EFFECTIVE natural alternatives to dangerous drugs , then we should .
However we should never , ever become party to a pharmaceutical campaign to push drugs on the public .
We will set ourselves up for disaster if we allow an invasion into the privacy of every family in the country and suggest to our most vulnerable citizens that they might be mentally ill .
We must do everything in our power to protect innocent children , and giving their mothers addictive drugs which pose a significant risk of causing suicide and violence does not protect anyone .
It does cause the child to become addicted while still in the womb and sets up drug dependence which can be lifelong .
We still have no idea what effect most drugs have on developing brains .
It might take decades for the impact on the developing brain to become apparent .
For information on the research pertaining to the risks of antidepressants and other treatments for new moms and their babies , details about the Melanie Stokes case ( or you can read the letter by Dr. Ann Blake Tracy at http://uniteforlife.org/MOTHERSact.htm#…), as well as information on prevention strategies and safe , effective treatments for post - partum mood disorders , please contact us .

This summer seems to be shaping up as a key time for ultraportables with new powerful and power - optimized processors coming to market , the highest - profile of which is Intel 's Atom .
However , the first real consumer test for these products will be this fall , when the key target market of students see them as a price - competitive alternative to the 15 - inch budget notebook .
Compared to the Eee , HP 's Mini-Note is positioned much more closely to a traditional PC with a $ 599 starting point for a version with Windows and a 120 GB hard drive .
HP offers a version with Linux for $ 100 less , but even somewhat tailored standard desktop Linux operating systems can't match Windows for ease of use or application support .
In a $ 500 device , Linux has a hard time competing powering a consumer PC .
At less than $ 300 , though , the 2GB version of the Eee becomes more interesting as a mobile productivity appliance .
ASUS created a friendly , tabbed interface with big watery icons for the Eee , but launching applications takes consumers into mostly off - the - shelf Linux applications , some of which struggle on the device 's original 7 - inch screen -- key to its low cost .
Any illusion of a unified design dissolves quickly .
Some obvious tasks , like simply changing the taskbar clock to display 12 - hour instead of 24 - hour time , can't be done with default graphical controls .
To maximize this opportunity , manufacturers should take a page from leading - edge specialized Linux devices and create an integrated and engaging platform optimized for this form factor .
Of course , internet appliances have a miserable history , but times have changed .
These products are now aimed at savvy , mobile , tech - savvy consumers , not the grandparents keeping MSN TV alive .
Initiatives such as Adobe AIR and Google Gears are laying the groundwork for online lifestyle applications to invade the desktop .
A patchwork national WiFi infrastructure courtesy of Starbucks is a forerunner of WiMAX and LTE networks .
And even the 7 - inch Eee has shown the aptitude of Firefox under Linux for average consumers .
It is no coincidence that , mirroring Microsoft 's product gap between Windows Mobile and Windows Vista , the historically hazy and suddenly hot device space between the cellphone and the notebook is emerging as the best shot yet for the Linux desktop .
President Chavez has nationalised a number of foreign - owned companies
President Hugo Chavez has signed a decree to nationalise Venezuela 's biggest steelmaker , Ternium - Sidor .
Argentina 's Techint , which owns 60 % of it , has been given until the end of June to hand it over .
In the past two years the Venezuelan state has taken over foreign - controlled companies including cement , telecoms , oil , gas and electricity firms .
President Chavez threatened to nationalise the steelmaker after trade union talks broke down last month .
The workers wanted better pay and benefits .
Talks between the government and Techint broke down earlier this month when a price for the controlling stake could not be agreed .
Rodolfo Sanz , minister of basic industries and mining , has been appointed as the new president of Ternium - Sidor .
The government already owned 20 % of the shares and had first threatened to take control of the company last year unless its owners agreed to sell more of its steel in Venezuela .

I have to paint fast on television because of the limited time , but I do n't want people to see what I 'm showing them as work , something to worry and fret over .
This is supposed to be fun .
Judi Hunt ( November 23 , 1991 ) " Disciples of The Bob Ross Technique Find Joy in Learning They Can Paint " , The Seattle Post - Intelligencer , p. C1 .
Traditionally , art has been for the select few .
We have been brainwashed to believe that Michaelangelo had to pat you on the head at birth .
Well , we show people that anybody can paint a picture that they 're proud of .
It may never hang in the Smithsonian , but it will certainly be something that they 'll hang in their home and be proud of .
And that 's what it 's all about .
Linda Shrieves ( July 7 , 1990 ) " Bob Ross Uses His Brush to Spread Paint and Joy " , The Orlando Sentinel , p. E1 .
I 've never claimed that this is investment art .
When we first started out , all the art colleges and universities across the country would sort of badmouth what we were doing .
It 's funny that a lot of them now are sending us letters saying , ' We may not totally agree with the way you paint , but we appreciate what you 're doing , because you 're sending literally thousands of people into art colleges .

Talent is a pursued interest .
In other words , anything that you 're willing to practice , you can do .

A Mantis shrimp ( Gonodactylus smithii ) is seen in this undated handout photograph released in London May 14 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Roy Caldwell / Handout
LONDON ( Reuters ) - A giant shrimp living on Australia ’s Great Barrier Reef can see a world beyond the rainbow that is invisible to other animals , scientists said on Wednesday .
Mantis shrimps , dubbed “ thumb splitters ” by divers because of their vicious claws , have the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom , capable of seeing colors from the ultraviolet to the infrared , as well as detecting other subtle variations in light .
They view the world in up to 12 primary colors -- four times as many as humans -- and can measure six different kinds of light polarization , Swiss and Australian researchers reported .
polarization is the direction of oscillation in light waves .
Just why Gonodactylus smithii needs this level of rarefied vision is unclear , although the researchers suspect it is to do with food and sex .
“ Some of the animals they like to eat are transparent and quite hard to see in sea-water , except they ’re packed full of polarizing sugars .
I suspect they light up like Christmas trees as far as these shrimp are concerned , ” said Andrew White of the University of Queensland .
And the shrimps probably use tiny changes in color and polarization to send sexual signals between males and females , the researchers believe .
Their findings were published online in the Public Library of Science journal PLoS ONE , here
Picking up the Rudy slack
A reader notes that Hillary has brought up 9/11 , more or less unprompted , three times so far in the debate , a level not seen since Rudy Giuliani dropped out in January .
" For Pastor Wright to have given his first sermon after 9/11 and to have blamed the United States for the attack , which happened in my city of New York , would have been just intolerable for me . "
And :
" If I 'm not mistaken , that relationship with Mr. Ayers on this board continued after 9/11 and after his reported comments , which were deeply hurtful to people in New York and , I would hope , to every American , because they were published on 9/11 , and he said that he was just sorry they had n't done more . "
And :
" I certainly would not meet with Ahmadinejad , because even again today , he made light of 9/11 , and said that he's not even sure it happened and that people actually died . "

( Adds nuclear plant ’s CEO )
LJUBLJANA , June 5 ( Reuters ) - Slovenia ’s only nuclear plant , which was shut down on Wednesday because of a water leak , is expected to start operating again next week , the plant ’s chief executive told Reuters on Thursday .
“ We will replace the valve that was leaking tomorrow and then start testing the plant and prepare it to safely resume operations on Tuesday or Wednesday , ” Stane Rozman said .
“ The leakage had no influence on the environment and there will be no radioactive radiation , ” Rozman said .
Economy Minister Andrej Vizjak told a news conference in Ljubljana the leakage occurred on a valve that was part of a system that measures the water temperature , adding the leaked water was caught in appropriate containers .
“ This was an entirely non -dangerous event for people , employees , the environment , nature , ” Vizjak said .
Andrej Stritar , the head of the Slovenian Nuclear Safety Administration , said some 10 to 15 cubic metres of water had leaked from a cooling system that held a total of 150 cubic metres .
“ The water level did not fall as water was constantly being added to the system , ” Stritar told a separate news conference .
The European Commission was informed of the malfunction on Wednesday and passed a precautionary alert to other EU countries through its emergency response system .
Rozman said the plant produces some 16 million kilowatt hours of electricity per day to the value of some 1 million euros ( $ 1.54 million ) , adding the production is equally divided between Slovenia and Croatia which jointly own the plant .
He said both countries had found other electricity supply sources to avoid disruption while the Krsko plant is shut down .
The plant , in southeastern Slovenia near the border with Croatia , opened in 1983 and is due to close in 2023 .
The plant was built in cooperation with Westinghouse Electric Corporation .
Slovenia is considering building a second reactor in Krsko which could start operating in 2017 .

The US has said Syria 's reactor was similar to a North Korean one The UN nuclear agency has said that Syria is to allow inspectors to visit the country to investigate allegations that it was building a nuclear reactor .
The International Atomic Energy Agency says its inspectors are due in Syria between the 22 and 24 June .
The alleged nuclear site was bombed by Israeli jets in September 2007 .
In April , the United States accused North Korea of helping Syria build a nuclear reactor that " was not intended for peaceful purposes " .

Nuclear power in Middle East US claims raise wider doubts
Full text : US allegations Syria has repeatedly denied it has any nuclear weapons programme , or any such agreement with North Korea .
Officials have said the site that was bombed by Israel unused military facility under construction .
Building on the site had stopped some time before the air strike , the Syrians said .
" I look forward to Syria 's full co-operation in this matter , " IAEA director general Mohamed ElBaradei told the agency 's 35 - nation board of governors on Monday .
In April this year , Mr ElBaradei criticised both what he saw as a US delay in releasing information on the Syrian site and Israel 's bombing of the site before the IAEA could inspect it .
He repeated this on Monday without naming Israel or the US .
" It is deeply regrettable that information concerning this installation was not provided to the agency in a timely manner and that force was resorted to unilaterally before the agency was given an opportunity to establish the facts , " Mr ElBaradei said .
" Nonetheless , I should emphasise that Syria , like all states with comprehensive [ nuclear ] safeguards agreements , has an obligation to report the planning and construction of any nuclear facility to the agency , " he added .
" We are therefore treating this information with the seriousness it deserves and have been in discussions with the Syrian authorities ... to verify , to the extent possible at this stage , the veracity of the information available . "
The initial criticism followed a briefing by American security officials to members of the US Congress which showed evidence they said proved Syria was building a nuclear reactor with North Korean assistance .
This included pictures - said to have been obtained by Israel - allegedly taken inside the facility showing the reactor core being built .
The images showed striking similarities between the Syrian facility and the North Korean reactor at Yongbyon , the US said .
However , the facility was not yet operational and there was no fuel for the reactor , officials said .

Indecision 2008 - West Virginia
Hillary Clinton crushes Barack Obama in West Virginia , while Chris Matthews and Terry McAuliffe have a good old - fashioned douche - off .
Feb. 19 , 2008  -- Carly Fleischmann has severe autism and is unable to speak a word .
But thanks to years of expensive and intensive therapy , this 13 - year - old has made a remarkable breakthrough .
CLICK HERE TO READ CARLY'S ANSWERS TO VIEWERS ' QUESTIONS .
Two years ago , working with pictures and symbols on a computer keyboard , she started typing and spelling out words .
The computer became her voice .
" All of a sudden these words started to pour out of her , and it was an exciting moment because we did n't realize she had all these words , " said speech pathologist Barbara Nash .
" It was one of those moments in my career that I 'll never forget . "
Then Carly began opening up , describing what it was like to have autism and why she makes odd noises or why she hits herself .
" It feels like my legs are on first and a million ants are crawling up my arms , " Carly said through the computer .
Carly writes about her frustrations with her siblings , how she understands their jokes and asks when can she go on a date .
" We were stunned , " Carly 's father Arthur Fleischmann said .
" We realized inside was an articulate , intelligent , emotive person that we had never met .
This was unbelievable because it opened up a whole new way of looking at her . "
This is what Carly wants people to know about autism .
" It is hard to be autistic because no one understands me .
People look at me and assume I am dumb because I can't talk or I act differently than them .
I think people get scared with things that look or seem different than them . "
" Laypeople would have assumed she was mentally retarded or cognitively impaired .
Even professionals labelled her as moderately to severely cognitively impaired .
In the old days you would say mentally retarded , which means low IQ and low promise and low potential , " Arthur Fleischman said .
Therapists say the key lesson from Carly 's story is for families to never give up and to be ever creative in helping children with autism find their voice .
" If we had done what so many people told us to do years ago , we would n't have the child we have today .
We would have written her off .
We would have assumed the worst .
We would have never seen how she could write these things — how articulate she is , how intelligent she is , " the grateful father added .
" I asked Carly to come to my work to talk to speech pathologists and other therapists about autism , " said Nash .
" What would you like to tell them ?
She wrote , ' I would tell them never to give up on the children that they work with . '
That kind of summed it up . "
Carly had another message for people who do n't understand autism .
" Autism is hard because you want to act one way , but you can't always do that .
It 's sad that sometimes people do n't know that sometimes I can't stop myself and they get mad at me .
If I could tell people one thing about autism it would be that I do n't want to be this way .
But I am , so do n't be mad .
Be understanding . "

A lot of companies point fingers when something goes wrong .
So it ’s impressive when a company asks , “ Even though it ’s not our fault , what can we do to make this situation better ? ”
“ Believe It or Not , Someone ’s Listening ” discusses Travelocity ’s devotion to the entirety of the customer experience and gives this example :
After discovering a pattern of dropped reservations at certain hotels , Travelocity hired a company in India to call the hotels ahead of customer stays to make sure they were prepared for the guests .
The company says this has reduced the incidence of dropped reservations in two years to less than 1 percent from as high as 20 percent .
Increasingly , said Ms. Peluso , “ We are taking accountability for things we otherwise would n’t take accountability for . ”
In the end , the customer does n’t care whose fault it is .
They just want the problem fixed .
And if it ’s not fixed , the entire chain of companies involved suffers .
So it ’s neat when a company takes responsibility for something that ’s normally considered out of scope .
Some other examples : Amazon replaced a stolen package even though it had been delivered to the right apartment building days earlier and signed for by a neighbor .
Amazon knows a disgruntled customer is a disgruntled customer , regardless of where the fault actually lies .
This attitude can extend to manufacturing too .
Threadless knew customers were dissatisfied with the existing options for blank tees , so it decided to start manufacturing its own .
One more example :
Most tech hardware companies buy off the shelf stuff , which means things look and feel the same .
Apple discovers new materials and production processes so they can build things no one else can build .
Of course , you ca n’t take responsibility for everything .
Sometimes you ’re better off letting a customer go than promising the world ( e.g. a web app writing off IE5 people ) .
But , when done thoughtfully , redefining the scope of what you ’re accountable for is a great way to 1 ) differentiate yourself from competitors and 2 ) take ownership of more of the customer experience .
No column this week , sorry about that , I forgot that Jesus died for our sins yesterday so I could n’t give the company I was writing about a fair chance to respond .
The story will pop up later as a bigger feature .
In the meantime , no matter how hard I try to be bored of quackery , the email inbox keeps defeating me .
This video is beyond parody , and it would be a genuine crime to deprive you of its pleasures .

Pictured : Son of millionaire clothing tycoon who used family fortune to fund gangland arms racket
To his neighbours , Kaleem Akhtar was nothing more than a ' rich kid ' with a taste for flashy jewellery and expensive cars .
Even his relatives regarded him as a dutiful son with an arranged marriage , who held down a job in his millionaire family 's respectable retail clothing business .
But Akhtar 's image of Asian middleclass respectability was a facade .
Kaleem Akhtar , centre , poses with a pistol in his trousers and flanked by two men carrying AK47 assault rifles
A court has heard that the 29 - year - old was a key figure in a gun-running network which supplied ' assassin armouries ' to gangland hitmen across the UK .
His secret activities - also funded by £ 1,000 a month in state benefits - helped rebuild the arsenals of some of Britain 's most violent gangs .
Seduced by the thrill and glamour of the underworld , Akhtar lived a double life .
Known as ' Big K ' , he had two secret mistresses and behaved like a mobster , hanging out in nightclubs and arrogantly posing for photos with weapons .
In one picture , seen here , he stands with a handgun stuffed into his trousers , flanked by two men brandishing assault rifles .
Akhtar was behind bars awaiting sentence after being found guilty at Manchester Crown Court of gun-running for gangsters .
The successful police operation ended with the seizure of a substantial haul of weapons .
Officers believe they have saved many lives by exposing Akhtar and his associates .
Gun runners : Kaleem Akhtar ( left ) and Asaid Saleem
Akhtar arrived in Britain from Pakistan at the age of three .
His family ran a chain of shops in Liverpool and a wholesale business in Manchester .
He had ' everything money could buy ' but chose to sell ' assassin kits ' of a handgun , silencer and bullets to criminals for £ 2,500 .
While he was peddling handguns , ammunition , silencers and other firearms , Akhtar returned home to his wife and the £ 350,000 marble - floored semi in Chorlton , Manchester , which his parents gave them as a wedding present .
Akhtar counted doctors and politicians among his friends .
He flaunted his family 's wealth , driving around the respectable suburban neighbourhood in a £ 50,000 Range Rover and dripping with gold jewellery .
The house in Chorlton , Manchester his parents gave him as a wedding gift
Although many neighbours may have regarded him as arrogant and distasteful , no one realised how evil he was .
All the weapons were Russian - made Baikal self - loading gas handguns , converted to fire real bullets by a gunsmith based in Lithuania .
They were sold by Akhtar to gangsters who then used them in a string of gun battles between rival underworld gangs in Manchester and Yorkshire .
A member of Manchester 's infamous Gooch Close mob was caught in possession of one of Akhtar 's guns after being named as prime suspect in the unsolved murder of schoolboy Jesse James , 15 , in September 2006 .
The weapons were also used in a £ 90,000 armed robbery on a security van in which a guard was held at gunpoint and sprayed with petrol .
An undated picture of one of the weapons seized by police
In total , 56 guns and 856 bullets supplied by the gang , and bought from two Lithuanian dealers in Essex , were seized during raids by police in Bradford , West Yorkshire , Leeds , Manchester , Liverpool , Sheffield and Scotland .
Nick Clarke QC , prosecuting , told the court : ' Overall , this operation uncovered the largest network of illegally held weapons ever seen in this country and included the second largest single seizure of firearms in Greater Manchester . '
That particular raid , in May last year , netted 13 guns with silencers , 379 bullets and a bulletproof vest .
Yet within 24 hours Akhtar and the gang had arranged for another consignment to sell on .
The guns were brought north in batches from Essex by Lithuanian brothers Agnus and Edgaras Malcevas to be sold to Akhtar 's accomplice and gang ' linchpin ' Mudasser Ali , 30 .
Right hand man : Asaid Saleem
They were repackaged and sold on by Akhtar and others .
Police had the gang under surveillance by January 2007 in an operation codenamed Tumbler .
Over the next nine months officers carried out a series of raids to seize the Baikal guns and arrest those involved .
In July , armed officers swooped on the Lithuanian brothers as they drove to Manchester in their BMW and found guns , silencers and bullets in a sports bag .
The court heard Akhtar 's fingerprints were found on a drawstring bag containing a pistol , hidden under the passenger seat of a car they stopped on the M62 .
When Akhtar was finally arrested last September , they found £ 50,000 , a bulletproof vest and an incriminatingletter from an accomplice in prison .
He showed no emotion yesterday as he was found guilty of conspiracy to possess firearms and ammunition with intent to enable another to endanger life after a two - week trial .
In his defence , his barrister Dorian Lovell - Pank QC said his client was a ' night owl ' but told the jury there was insufficient evidence to conclude he was a gun-runner .
Adjourning sentencing for reports , Judge Clement Goldstone warned Akhtar : ' You will receive a very substantial sentence indeed . '
Ali , of Bradford , both Malcevas brothers , Asaid Salim , of Trafford , Manchester , Michael Peake , of Liverpool , and cage fighter Paul Wilson , of Southport , have already pleaded guilty to either conspiracy to possess firearms or other firearms offences .
They all await sentence .
Outside court , Detective Inspector Chris Packer of Greater Manchester Police said Akhtar and his ' stooges ' were ' driven by greed and criminal status , and did not care about what these guns can do ' .
' The removal of these men from the streets , not to mention all the guns and ammunition , is a brilliant result and one that without a doubt has made us all safer , ' he said .

Among the debts reported this month by Hillary Clinton ’s struggling presidential campaign , the $ 292,000 in unpaid health insurance premiums for her campaign staff stands out .
Clinton did n't pay health insurance bills
Among the debts reported this month by Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s struggling presidential campaign , the $ 292,000 in unpaid health insurance premiums for her campaign staff stands out .
Clinton , who is being pressured to end her campaign against Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination , has made her plan for universal health care a centerpiece of her agenda .
Advertisement
The campaign provides health insurance to all its employees , their spouses , partners and children — and that was n’t interrupted by any lag in payments to insurance providers , said Jay Carson , a Clinton campaign spokesman .
He said the campaign this month paid off all outstanding bills to Aetna Healthcare and CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield .
Those payments will be reflected on a report the campaign will file this month with the Federal Election Commission , which Carson said will show “ zero debt owed to both vendors . ”
“ Sometimes invoices are not paid immediately because we need additional information for our records , or to verify expenses , ” Carson said in a statement e-mailed to Politico .
“ Sometimes invoices arrive at the very end of the month at the cutoff of the reporting period , which means that we are required to report them as a debt on the current FEC report , even where they are paid in regular course during the next month . ”
But the unpaid bills to Aetna were at least two months old , according to FEC filings .
They show the campaign ended last year owing Aetna more than $ 213,000 for “ employee benefits . ”
During the first two months of the year , the campaign did not pay down any of that debt .
In fact , it accrued another $ 16,000 in unpaid bills last month , and it finished the month owing Aetna $ 229,000 .
Though the campaign reported owing $ 63,000 to Carefirst at the end of February for employee benefits , it appears Clinton paid that company on a more frequent basis .
The New York senator ’s presidential campaign began the month owing $ 299,000 to Carefirst , but paid that amount in its entirety , and the $ 63,000 it owed at the end of the month appears to be from services rendered last month .
Campaigns resemble businesses in many ways .
Like businesses , one of their biggest costs is salaries , payroll taxes and the benefits of their employees .
Also like businesses , they tend to carry unpaid bills as debt from week - to - week or even month - to - month .
But Arizona Sen . John McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee , did not report any unpaid bills to insurance providers at the end of February .
And the only insurance - related debt reported by Obama , an Illinois senator , was $ 908 to AIG American International Group for “ insurance . ”
Their campaigns also reported substantially less debt overall than Clinton ’s , which owed $ 8.7 million at the end of February .
Obama owed $ 625,000 and McCain $ 4.3 million , though most of his debt was from a bank loan , and only $ 1.3 million was in the form of unpaid bills to a dozen vendors .
Carson stressed that Clinton ’s campaign pays all its bills “ regularly and in the normal course of business . ”

John and Joe invited me to podcast again with them today , and we addressed the issue of sexism and misogyny in the current Democratic primary .
I personally have n’t seen or heard of any , and if there ’s been some , it certainly has n’t made a difference in the places you would most likely first suspect – the “ more traditional ” ( read : less forward - thinking ) communities in states like West Virginia and Kentucky which voted overwhelmingly in favor of the white candidate Hillary Clinton .
Today , Hillary Rosen ’s got a piece up on Huffington explaining why she continues to stand behind Clinton , and loyalty ’s one of her reasons .
You ca n’t argue with that .
Good for her .
Fine by me .
She ’s also forthcoming in admitting the Clinton campaign sunk itself :
[ T ] his campaign is losing because of choices and strategies of it ’s own making .
Articles and books will be written after the fact about the lost opportunities , the mixed messages , the insular in - fighting , the financial recklessness and the lack of focus on delegates .
She has never caught up in the delegate hunt from those early mistakes .
It ’s the sentence preceding this admission where we start to disagree .
It reads ( emphasis mine )
I do n’t really buy into this notion of the campaign is faltering because Hillary is a victim of sexism .
I may part company with some of the Hillary sisterhood on this point .
There has been lots of sexism in this race , but this campaign is losing because …
Give me an example .
Like I said , I ca n’t think of any time that Clinton ’s being female has come up in conversation as a reason to vote against her .
Where ’s this sexism taking place ?
Not on TV .
Not online where I read and communicate .
Point it out .
I ’ll be happy to speak up against it .
Then there ’s this , which I buy even less ( again , emphasis mine ) :
Women who have felt powerless to change or even complain about their own lives because they are just too damn busy keeping it together for everyone around them .
And they certainly have n’t had time for politics .
From the waitress in the diner to the school teacher to the executive on wall street , women feel the daily slights that are often invisible to others .
Yes , many of her supporters need real and immediate help from the government , but so many more are just grateful to be noticed .
Sure there are lots of women in this country who do n’t feel this way .
And for all of you who are going to write comments saying as much you do n’t have to .
I am happy for you .
Genuinely .
But Hillary ’s campaign is still going for every woman who has spoken up in a meeting and was greeted with silence only to have a man say the same thing and be praised .
It endures for the mothers who are taking care of their children and their parents and their home and has no time to take care of herself .
It endures for women who are so scared to see her fail because of what it may say about their chances in life .
And yes folks , it resonates for all the women who have seen the younger guy come along and get the promotion even though she has worked in the company loyally for years .
It ’s not that I do n’t think there ’s sexism in everyday life .
It ’s not that I have n’t experienced it firsthand .
I was the lone woman in a 12 - man sports department at a Miami TV station .
Guess who did n’t get invited to bonding golf outings ?
When extra Stanley Cup tickets freed up , guess who did n’t get ’em even though she ’d asked early and often ?
Who was n’t on the plane for the day trip to the Bahamas for gambling and debauchery with the boys ?
And that ’s just one gig .
There have been plenty of similar incidents along the way in various stages of my professional career .
But …
Just because Clinton ’s a woman does not engender blind allegiance .
I do n’t think her campaign is about girl power .
It has n’t been from the beginning .
It sure is n’t about that now .
Some women are passionate about her campaign , and I wo n’t deny she has done well amongst some female voters .
But I think her campaign has done more to downplay her gender in an effort to prove she ’s strong enough to be Commander - in - Chief than emphasize it as an asset .
The women I admire are honest and trustworthy and powerful because they honor their promises and play by the rules and still come out on top .
I was all for a female President until Clinton started playing dirty .
Female President ?
Yes .
This female ?
Not so much .
This campaign is not – nor has it ever been – primarily about women .
If it were , I would have been on board with bells on .
To say that ’s why Clinton hangs on – for all those suppressed victims of sexism who need her now more than ever – is a crock .
This campaign is about a woman .
One woman .
Hillary Clinton .
And she certainly does not speak for me .
Facebook is about to spend big on upgrading its infrastructure .
According to Business
Week , the social network has closed a deal to take a $ 100 million loan ( “ venture lending ” ) , all of which will be spent on new servers .
Facebook gives up no equity as part of the deal .
Business
Week explains how this type of loan works :
“ Venture lending peaked during the dot - com bubble of the late 1990s and early part of this decade , but is making a comeback as startups use debt to pay for computer servers , telecom gear , and software … The TriplePoint lease has a degree of flexibility not offered by a traditional loan .
For instance , Facebook can exchange or replace equipment during the term of the lease . ”
Essentially , it ’s a really , really huge credit card , with very favorable terms .
In all , Facebook has now raised in excess of $ 300 million , including $ 240 million from Microsoft , $ 100 million from Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing , and an undisclosed amount from the Samwer brothers .
As for the servers , Business Week estimates the $ 100 M will be used to buy roughly 50,000 servers .
Last month , Data Center Knowledge published a report estimating that the social network currently has around 10,000 servers in operation .
The new money comes from TriplePoint Capital , and is the firm ’s largest deal to date .
President Bush is set to win a huge victory in the controversy over warrantless wiretapping , as the House Democratic leadership agreed to telecom immunity and expanded spying powers .
* Photo : AP / Haraz N. Ghanbari
* Breaking months of acrimonious deadlock , House and Senate leaders from both parties have agreed to a bill that gives the nation 's spy agencies the power to turn a wide swath of domestic communication companies into intelligence - gathering operations , and that puts an end to court challenges to telecoms such as AT&T that aided the government 's secret , five - year warrantless wiretapping program .
Civil liberties proponents quickly blasted the deal .
" The proposed FISA deal is not a compromise ; it is a capitulation , " said Wisconsin Democratic Senator Russ Feingold , the only senator who voted against the Patriot Act in 2001 .
" The House and Senate should not be taking up this bill , which effectively guarantees immunity for telecom companies alleged to have participated in the President ’s illegal program , and which fails to protect the privacy of law - abiding Americans at home . "
The deal marks a huge , though belated , victory for a lame - duck White House , which fought a pitched , hyperbolic battle to expand its legal wiretapping powers after being busted targeting Americans without warrants .
Despite that desire for expanded spying powers , the president threatened to veto any bill that did not give amnesty to the telecoms that helped with program , which has been declared illegal by a secretive U.S. surveillance court .
The bill ( .pdf ) could be voted on as soon as Friday in the House , given its backing by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , who in February organized a high - stakes showdown with the president over a substantially similar bill .
The Senate would likely also quickly pass the bill , despite already vocal opposition from the ACLU , left - leaning bloggers , as well as Sens. Christopher Dodd ( D - Connecticut ) and Patrick Leahy ( D - Vermont ) .
Under the proposal , the intelligence community will be able to issue broad orders to U.S. ISPs , phone companies and online communications services like Hotmail and Skype to turn over all communications that are reasonably believed to involve a non-American who is outside the country .
The spy agencies will not have to name their targets or get prior court approval for the surveillance .
Under the longstanding rules of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , the government was free to engage in dragnet wiretapping outside the United States , but in order to tap communications inside the country , the government needed court approval and individualized warrants if an American 's communications would be caught .
Additionally , the bill grants amnesty to the nation 's telecoms that are being sued for allegedly breaking federal wiretapping laws by turning over billions of Americans ' call records to government data - mining programs and giving the government access to internet and phone infrastructure inside the country .
The bill strips the right of a federal district court to decide whether the companies violated federal laws prohibiting wiretapping without a court order .
Instead , the attorney general would need only certify to the court either that a sued company did not participate , or that the government provided some sort of written request to the companies that said that the president authorized the program and that his lawyers deemed it to be legal .
That would be presented to federal district court Judge Vaughn Walker , who is overseeing the more than 40 consolidated cases against the telecoms .
Walker 's authority would be limited to judging whether the preponderance of the evidence is that the companies did get a written request , and if he finds that to be true – as the Senate Intelligence Committee has already publicly stated – he must dismiss the cases .
That 's immunity , and it 's unconstitutional , according to the ACLU 's Caroline Fredrickson .
" The telecom companies simply have to produce a piece of paper we already know exists , resulting in immediate dismissal , " Fredrickson said in a written statement .
" That 's not accountability .
Loopholes and judicial theater do n't do our Fourth Amendment rights justice . "
Hoyer , under pressure from so - called Blue Dog Democrats wanting to avoid being labeled soft on terrorism in the fall campaigns , justified the bill as a necessary compromise .
" It is the result of compromise , and like any compromise is not perfect , but I believe it strikes a sound balance , " Hoyer said in a press release announcing the deal .
That 's a significant change for Hoyer , who in March in a House floor speech opposed blanket immunity , saying " I submit that a reasonable – responsible – Congress would not seek to immunize conduct without knowing what conduct or misconduct it is immunizing . "
The bill itself oddly admits that the government 's surveillance activities included more than the previously admitted " Terrorist Surveillance Program . "
That program , admitted by the president after The* New York Times * revealed it in December 2005 , targeted Americans to intercept their international phone calls and e-mails without getting court approval .
In a provision authorizing an oversight investigation , the bill refers to the " President 's Surveillance Program , " of which the so - called TSP was just one part .
That all but confirms what many have reported and suspected : that there was much more unilateral surveillance than the president or his lawyers have ever admitted .
The current immunity language differs very little from the proposal that was debated in February and March , according to Kevin Bankston , a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation – which is arguing the leading case against the nation 's telecoms .
" The current proposal is the exact same blanket immunity that the Senate passed in February and that the House rejected in March , only with a few new bells and whistles so that political spinsters can claim that it actually provides meaningful court review , " Bankston said .
The top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee – a longtime immunity proponent – sounded a more upbeat note .
" Today we reached a bipartisan solution that will put the intelligence community back in business , protect American families from attack and protect our civil liberties , " said Sen. Kit Bond of Missouri .
That 's despite a provision in the bill that orders the inspectors general of the Justice Department and various intelligence agencies to spend a year working on a report about what the extent of the government 's secret surveillance programs were , and what their legal rationale was .
That report would not be delivered to Congress until well after the White House has a new inhabitant .

The * Times * in London is reporting this week on a proposal for a massive government database in the UK that would hold " details of every phone call , e-mail and time spent on the internet by the public " for a year .
Britain's Home Office has already discussed its wish for such a database with telecoms and ISPs and aims to get the requirement in a data communications bill .
The companies are already required to keep records of phone calls and text messages for 12 months but the proposal would extend the requirement to internet , e-mail and VoIP records and place the records in government hands , rather than being maintained by the companies .
As expected , not everyone is pleased by the prospect .
David Davis , Conservative member of Parliament , said , “ Given [ ministers ’ ] appalling record at maintaining the integrity of databases holding people ’s sensitive data , this could well be more of a threat to our security , than a support . ”

The Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center last week removed a Roger Clemens jersey from an exhibit about the Yankee renaissance that started in the mid-1990s .
“ We ’re trying to project the positive virtues of baseball , ” said David Kaplan , the director of the museum , which has an educational mission .
“ And we have a lot of kids coming through here who are asking questions we ’re not prepared to answer . ”
He added that Clemens ’s “ jersey was raising too many issues ” because of his “ notoriety . ”
Clemens is defending himself against accusations by his former personal trainer Brian McNamee that McNamee injected him with steroids and human growth hormone .
Clemens and McNamee testified Wednesday at a hearing of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform .
Kaplan said that he and Art Berke , the chief operating officer of the museum , which is on the campus of Montclair State University in Little Falls , N.J. , decided to remove the jersey .
South Africa : Anti-immigrant violence subsides but leaves humanitarian crisis
By Ann Talbot
7 June 2008
An uneasy calm has descended on the South African townships and squatter camps after three weeks of anti-foreigner violence that left more than 50 dead , 650 seriously injured and an estimated 80,000 displaced .
Tens of thousands are thought to have fled the country .
Others are housed in temporary shelters , unable to return to their homes in South Africa for fear of further attacks or to their country of origin .
Those who have been displaced are still housed in churches , community halls and police stations that opened their doors to them at the height of the attacks .
Conditions in these makeshift facilities are appalling .
Many people are sleeping outside in winter conditions .
“ It ’s very cold at night , ” said Muriel Cornelis of Medecin sans Frontieres .
“ It ’s almost like one or two degrees .
It ’s been raining in the last few days .
” “ We have problems with sanitation , ” said Francoise Le Goff of the International Red Cross .
“ It ’s cold ; people are getting sick . ”
A camp at Onderstepoort , north of Pretoria , was described as being like “ a pigsty . ”
It houses 2,000 people including babies and pregnant women but has only two portable toilets .
There is no electricity or running water .
Cases of diarrhoea and chest infections are already being reported .
The Western Cape government has appealed to the central government for disaster area status and has asked the United Nations for help .
The African National Congress government has evinced complete indifference to the fate of the thousands of men , women and children who have been terrorised and displaced .
It was individuals and community groups that responded to the crisis by supplying shelter , food , blankets and clothes .
Charities set up for other purposes have stepped into the breach .
Near Johannesburg , the Village Safe Haven , a foster home and feeding scheme , has taken in displaced people and is preparing 9,000 meals a day for those who took refuge at Alexandra police station .
“ People have been coming by until nine in the evening , and not all of it has been big donations , ” said Susan Harris who runs the charity .
“ Sometimes it ’s just someone with a blanket and a grocery store carrier bag , and as soon as it comes in , it goes out . ”
The Treatment Action Campaign ( TAC ) has been coordinating relief efforts in Cape Town .
TAC was set up to campaign for HIV / AIDS treatment .
“ We have basically stepped in and fulfilled the role of the state over the last three days , ” Nathan Geffen of TAC told the UN news service IRIN , “ and the state has utterly failed in its duty , particularly at the provincial and national level .
But all three tiers — city , province and nation — have failed to work together appropriately .
Last night we informed the city and province that they have until Wednesday afternoon [ May 28 ] to take over the functions that we ’ve been providing here , because this is not sustainable .
We are not a disaster response unit . ”
Zonke Majodina of the South African Human Rights Commission said , “ Government is not charting a course of action .
Political leaders have made very few statements , and have not come up with a coordinated response .
” At one point , the government said that it would set up seven camps for the displaced people , but this was almost immediately denied by other government sources .
International aid agencies have expressed fears that such camps would themselves become the focus of conflicts and be insecure for women and children .
Those who have been displaced have also voiced their concerns about being sent to camps .
“ When they put you in a camp , they have control over you , ” John Mazambi , a spokesman for a group of Somalis who took refuge at Caledon Square police station in Cape Town told IRIN .
“ I ca n’t afford to be put in a jail for I do n’t know how long .
From today , we have stopped accepting food .
We are not here for people to feed us ; so , from today we will refuse all food until we get some answers . ”
Helen Hacksley , a volunteer from Rondebosch United Church in suburban Cape Town , told IRIN “ A lot of these guys [ displaced people ] are the sole breadwinner for 12 people back home and ca n’t afford not to work , so for them it ’s not an option to go 50 kilometres up the west coast to sit in a camp .
They are n’t here to sit and be fed ; they came here to support a dozen people back home . ”
The failure to respond to the humanitarian crisis has seriously undermined the political credibility of the ANC at home and abroad .
President Thabo Mbeki only appeared on television to make a statement after the violence had gone on for two weeks .
“ Shocked citizens have been pouring onto the streets to express their disgust and offer what comfort they can , ” wrote the Sowetan .
“ But where are our leaders ? ”
Newspapers all over the continent have been critical of Mbeki’s “ apathy ” towards the fate of their nationals .
The Nigerian newspaper This Day described his government ’s response as “ inexplicably slow , ponderous , and inadequate . ”
Unfavourable comparisons were drawn between the way in which ANC members were given refuge in other African countries during the apartheid years and the way in which the ANC government has allowed nationals of those countries to be treated .
African papers drew attention to the very different treatment that is meted out to South Africa businesses that are behaving like corporate criminals in the rest of Africa and other Africans who attempt to set up businesses in South Africa .
Mbeki identified himself with Pan - Africanism in his “ I am an African ” speech in 1996 when the new South African constitution was adopted .
The following year , he put forward the concept of an African Renaissance , which , he said , marked the third moment in the post - colonial history of Africa when Africa would emerge as a significant geo-political player on the basis of economic development and social cohesion .
It was to be based on the spirit of ubuntu — which Mbeki said comprised humanism , compassion and solidarity .
“ As the basis of African unity , ‘ African Renaissance ’ drew heavily from philosophical ideas of pan-Africanism , negritude , ubuntu and black consciousness as the basis of African unity , dignity and pride , ” wrote Dr. Peter Kagwanja in the Nairobi - based Nation .
The spectacle of black South Africans attacking and even killing other Africans , looting their possessions and burning their homes has destroyed whatever credibility Mbeki ’s rhetoric had .
Nonetheless , he returned to it , speaking of the debt that South Africa owned the rest of the continent when he eventually appeared on television to condemn the violence .
Mbeki did not visit any of the townships .
Instead , he went to Japan .
A spokesman said that he was too busy .
Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo - Ngcuka went to the township of Orange Farm in Gauteng province near Johannesburg to speak to local residents .
This visit turned into a fiasco that served only to demonstrate how out of touch the leadership of the ANC is with the grassroots .
Cyril Ramaphosa had to be introduced when he turned up at the Thetha Secondary School in Orange Farm .
Once a trade union leader , Ramaphosa is now a multimillionaire businessman who sits on the boards of Coca Cola and Unilever .
He remains a leader of the ANC , but was unknown to the local people who turned out to meet the delegation .
The ignorance of this top - level ANC delegation was demonstrated by the fact that few foreigners actually live in Orange Farm .
The residents were angry about the lack of services .
The politicians had only turned up now , they said , because they were concerned about how the xenophobic violence looked to the outside world .
There have been many reasons cited for the outbreak of anti-immigrant violence in South Africa .
Economic growth has hit a six - year low .
The mines have been scaling back production , bringing their output to the lowest level in four decades .
This is in large part due to the breakdown of the electricity supply system , which has forced mines to close .
There is deep anger over the failure of the government to deliver even the most basic services such as electricity and water .
And there is intense competition for jobs , so foreigners have come to be seen as rivals .
Crime is a major problem , and immigrants are often blamed for it .
Food prices are rising , hitting the poor hardest .
The gap between rich and poor is growing .
South Africa is the most unequal country in the world next to Brazil .
Many of these social problems have been fuelling xenophobic violence for several years .
The scale of the latest outbreak , however , is new .
Some commentators have pointed to a mysterious third force , to organised crime , or have blamed the Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party .
But the real political responsibility lies with the ANC itself .
There has been considerable criticism of Mbeki .
His handling of Zimbabwe has been cited as one of the causes of the present crisis in South Africa .
Thousands of Zimbabweans have fled economic meltdown and political repression to South Africa .
An estimated 3 million Zimbabweans are now in South Africa .
The South African Sunday Times called on Mbeki to step down from office .
Mbeki has “ shown himself to be not only uncaring but utterly incompetent , ” a front - page editorial declared .
Nelson Mandela would have gone to the townships , Mbeki ’s critics have said .
But even if the former president would have acted differently , the recent violence is as much the outcome of Mandela ’s political perspective as it is of Mbeki’s .
From its inception , the ANC supported capitalism .
Before it came to power , it planned to nationalise the main industries and had aspirations to social welfare measures .
But that was no more than many capitalist governments had done in the post - war period .
Even these reformist measures were dropped prior to the ANC assuming power in 1994 .
As the hand - over from the apartheid regime was being discussed , the leaders of the ANC , according to Mandela ’s biographer Anthony Sampson , agreed to a secret letter of intent that “ committed them to reducing the deficit , to high interest rates and to an open economy , in return for access to an IMF loan of $ 850 million , if required . ”
This agreement was entirely in keeping with the principles of the Freedom Charter , which had committed the ANC to a capitalist programme in 1955 .
Mandela reiterated the capitalist perspective of the ANC the following year , stating : “ The breaking up and democratisation of these monopolies will open up fresh fields for the development of a prosperous non-European bourgeois class .
For the first time in the history of this country the non-European bourgeoisie will have the opportunity to own in their own name and right mills and factories and trade and private enterprise will boom and flourish as never before . ”
That is exactly what the ANC has done since it came to power .
The “ non-European bourgeois class ” of which Mandela spoke so enthusiastically takes the form of men like Cyril Ramaphosa , who have profited from power and amassed personal fortunes worth millions of dollars .
South African industry depends on migrant labour .
The government has encouraged migration while refusing migrants the legal status that would offer them the same protection as citizens .
As a result , migrants are open to the most blatant forms of exploitation and serve as a reserve army of cheap labour .
It is estimated that one third of the workforce in the mines are from other African countries .
The influx of migrants into South Africa reflects the fact that South Africa accounts for one third of the economy of sub-Saharan Africa .
In pursuing an explicitly national economic policy , the ANC government has confirmed the division between South Africa and the rest of Africa that was created under direct colonial rule .
The call for Mbeki to go reflects the depth of the political crisis in South Africa , but it is not a sufficient response to a situation that has a long history rooted in the very nature of ANC .
Changing the personnel at the top will resolve nothing .
Mbeki ’s rival for the presidency , Jacob Zuma , who is now president of the ANC , and Winnie Madikizela - Mandela have both visited areas hit by violence .
They lay claim to the more radical grassroots traditions of the ANC .
But neither of these politicians has an alternative to the perspective Mbeki has followed .
Zuma is backed by the South African Communist Party ( SACP ) and the Confederation of South African Trade Unions ( COSATU ) .
The SACP has called for Mbeki to go .
COSATU does not endorse this call but has said that the South African people have lost confidence in Mbeki ’s ability to govern .
Their support gives Zuma a certain left - wing appearance .
But both these organisations have been vital props of the ANC government since it came to power .
It was the SACP that drafted the Freedom Charter , with its commitment to private enterprise .
Neither the SACP nor COSATU can distance itself from the present crisis in which they have had so great a hand .
The population of the working class districts has no political means of expressing their discontent .
After almost a decade and a half , nobody any longer expects the ANC to resolve the social and economic problems that they face in the townships and squatter camps .
Under these circumstances , the most reactionary political tendencies have found expression in the xenophobic attacks .
Some members of the ANC youth are thought to have been directly involved .
They were seen using the name of the party and singing revolutionary songs as they carried out their attacks .
For the majority of the population who took no part in the attacks , and those who expressed their hostility to them by offering assistance to the victims , the ANC is an entirely alien political entity .
It no longer enjoys the mass support it had in the first elections after apartheid , when it became the vehicle for hopes of social progress .
In the interim , the implications of the perspective of the ANC have become all too apparent .
Those who looked to it in the past need a new political perspective that is based on socialist internationalism and production for need not profit , rather than nationalism and the preservation of the profit system .
DALLAS - Southwest Airlines says a passenger who refused to get off his cell phone during a flight found Dallas police waiting for him .
The Dallas Morning News reports that police were summoned by Southwest officials and met the jet Monday when the plane arrived at Love Field from Austin .
Southwest spokeswoman Brandy King says flight attendants had repeatedly asked the man to get off the phone while airborne .
Police say the passenger was cited for disorderly conduct .
His name was not immediately released .
The Federal Aviation Administration bars use of mobile phones when planes are flying due to concerns about interference with navigation systems .
King says airlines can be fined up to $ 25,000 for allowing cell phone use , and passengers also can be fined .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
When 53 - year - old Don Cressman was struggling financially , he charged a bit more than usual on his card , but carefully watched his balance to make sure he did n't go over his limit .
When he opened his credit card statement , he was shocked to find a $ 29 over - the - limit fee added to his bill .
" I was charged an over - limit fee when the interest charge kicked my account over my limit , " said Cressman .
When he called his credit card issuer to complain , they refunded the charge .
" I was told that in the future I would ' just have to watch my balance , ' " he recalled .
Over - the - limit fees are n't the only tactic in the credit card companies ' bag of tricks .
There are a slew of penalties , fees and other billing practices that can cause consumers to find themselves drowning in debt .
Americans hold $ 850 billion in credit card debt , and the average balance per card - holding household is $ 8,568 , according to the Consumer Federation of America .
But even borrowers who pay their bills on time can fall victim to deceptive practices used by the card issuers and get slammed with rising interest and hidden fees , which have become the industry norm in recent years .
" The issuers have gotten a lot more trigger happy over the last few years , " according to Curtis Arnold , founder of CardRatings.com , a consumer advocacy group .
Consumers are n't the only ones who are fed up .
Regulators are starting to take notice too .
The credit card industry has been under fire lately by various government agencies .
Members of Congress have proposed new legislation and the Federal Reserve is moving ahead on new regulations that might force lenders to rein in some of their deceptive billing tactics and make their fees more transparent to customers .
Credit card sleight of hand
Most credit card holders are well aware that missing a payment can result in a hefty late fee , which ranges from $ 15 to $ 39 .
But meeting a payment deadline is n't always easy .
Credit card companies reserve the right to change the date of your deadline with little notice or specify an exact time of day that payment is due .
Trying to stay on top of an early morning deadline or due dates that change unexpectedly often leave even the most responsible customers saddled with charges .
Those that have never exceeded their spending limit may also be unaware that going above your credit limit will result in an over - the - limit fee ( up to $ 39 ) without warning .
Like Don Cressman , many consumers who stopped charging when they neared their limit find that the interest rate and additional charges are what pushed their account over the line .
As if the late fees , over - the - limit fees and the interest charges themselves were n't steep enough , there are also a slew of sneaky tactics that credit card companies can use to make sure you keep paying additional charges , even when you pay off your bill .
For example , many banks calculate finance charges using what 's called double - cycle billing , a confusing practice that averages out the balance from your previous two bills .
So if you carry a balance and pay a finance charge one month , you 'll get hit with a finance charge on your next bill as well , even if you 've paid off the balance .
Then , there 's a practice known as " trailing interest " - another " gotcha " to watch out for , Arnold said .
If you send in a payment according to the full amount on your statement , you may find that you still owe a small balance next month .
That 's because you accrued interest between the time you sent the payment and when it was posted to your account .
And all it takes is one delinquent payment to cause the credit card company to up your interest rate , often substantially .
But thanks to a widely - used practice called universal default , you could end up with a higher interest rate , even if you pay on time .
Credit card issuers can increase your interest rate - even if you have a perfect payment history - just because you missed a payment on another card or bill .
Pushing back
Because of the scrutiny , some card issuers are beginning to lighten up on their fee structures and billing practices .
For example , in spring of 2007 Citigroup announced it would stop using universal default and JPMorgan Chase followed suit in November .
But until sweeping legislation is passed , there are a few things consumers can do to avoid getting hit the next time .
For starters , Chris Viale , president and CEO of Cambridge Credit Corp. , a nonprofit credit counseling agency based in Agawam , Mass. , suggests calling each credit card company to nail down your credit limit , due date and interest rate .
Card - issuing companies , such as American Express ( AXP , Fortune 500 ) , Capital One ( COF , Fortune 500 ) , Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) and JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) also disclose all of this information either online , under the terms and conditions for each card , or in the account disclosure statement you receive when you first open an account .
The important point is to " get familiar of the terms of each of your cards and get them down on paper , " Viale said .
If you are having problems call customer service .
" There is so much spotlight on this industry right now [ credit card companies ] are being a lot more careful about negative publicity , " Arnold said , referring to the practices lawmakers like Sen.
Christopher Dodd , D - Conn. , dub unfair and deceptive .
" Use the publicity as leverage . "
Many card companies are willing to lower your interest rate , raise your limit or waive a fee as a one - time courtesy if you ask nicely .
" We strongly encourage our customers to engage with us directly " said a representative from CitiCards .
" Particularly if they have questions about their card , payments or credit limit . "
Once the terms are established , make them work for you .
Though the credit card company decides the due date , you can request to change the payment deadline to a time that 's more convenient - at the beginning of the month , for example , if you have more cash on hand then .
Then set up online bill pay so your payment gets posted to your account immediately .

Visit Lobelog.com for the latest news analysis and commentary from Inter Press News Service ’s Washington bureau chief Jim Lobe .
While hard - line neo-conservatives associated with the American Enterprise Institute ( AEI ) , Commentary , and the Wall Street Journal editorial page ( See Bret Stephens column , â€ œThe NIE Fantasyâ€ ) continue to rage against last weekâ€™s National Intelligence Estimate on Iran , two key â€ ” if more pragmatic â€ ” movement leaders appear to now be resigned to the fact that , barring a particularly provocative move by Tehran , the Bush administration is highly unlikely to carry out an attack against Iran before its term expires .
I hope to write an article about this development for IPS in the coming days , but Robert Kaganâ€™s column , â€ œTime to talk to Iran , â€ which appeared in the Washington Post last Wednesday ( but which I read only over the weekend as I was catching up with a two - week accumulation of newspapers ) , marks a major turning point in the debate over Iran policy .
Not only does he state flatly , â€ œ[t ] he Bush administration cannot take military action against Iran during its remaining time in office , or credibly threaten to do so , unless it is in response to an extremely provocative Iranian action , ’â€ ™ but he goes on to argue that there is now â€˜â€ ™a good case for negotiationsâ€ on a range of issues , including those which Iran offered to talk about in April - May , 2003 ( to which , however , he does not allude ) .
In other words , Robert Kagan , co-founder of the Project for the New American Century , believes itâ€™s worth testing the notion that a â€œgrand bargainâ€ is possible .
Heâ€™s not happy about it , but thatâ€™s his conclusion .
While his PNAC co-founder , Bill Kristol , doesnâ€™t go nearly as far in embracing the notion of negotiations with Tehran , his lead editorial in the latest edition of the Weekly Standard , â€ œWhat Happened in 2003 ?â€ , offers a mixture both of indignation against the NIE and resignation that it marks the end of the chances for a U.S. attack on Iran before Bushâ€™s term expires .
Bushâ€™s task over the next year , he argues , is to try to restore U.S. credibility â€ ” including military credibility â€ ” by achieving â€œvictoryâ€ in Iraq .
Hereâ€™s the last paragraph :
â€ œThe complete and unequivocal defeat of al Qaeda and of Iranian - backed proxies in Iraq is the best way to show Iran that the United States is a serious power to be reckoned with in the region .
Resisting the temptation to throw away success in Iraq by drawing down too fast or too deep is the greatest service this president can render his successor .
Only if Bush wins in Iraq will the next president have a reasonable chance to defeat the threat of a nuclear - weapons - seeking Islamic Republic of Iran.â€ 
So Kristol appears to have given up â€ ” however reluctantly ( Remember , it was his publication which featured Kimberley Kaganâ€™s piece late last summer that lay the groundwork for a military attack on Iran based on its alleged interference in Iraq ) â€ ” on the idea of a military attack on Iran in the next year .
Kristol and Kagan have obviously been the leading lights of the â€ ” for lack of a better word â€ ” â€œmoderateâ€ wing of the neo- conservative movement since the mid-1990s when they co-authored their influential article , â€ œToward a Neo-Reaganite Foreign Policyâ€ in Foreign Affairs and went on to found PNAC the following year .
Unlike neo-con hardliners like Norman Podhoretz or Richard Perle and his numerous proteges â€ ” some of whom , like Danielle Pletka and Frank Gaffney and Podhoretz himself , have all but accused the NIEâ€™s authors of deliberate deception â€ ” scattered around Washington , the two have generally been less wedded to the views of former Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu .
For example , while the hardliners opposed former Prime Minister Ariel Sharonâ€™s disengagement from Gaza , Kristol and Kagan lined up behind Sharon , even when he deserted Likud to form Kadima .
Of the two columns , Kaganâ€™s is , of course , the more notable , simply because he believes Washington has no choice at this point but to engage with Iran in a way that the administration until now has never considered .
That Kagan has been close to Elliott Abrams since they worked together in the State Department back in the 1980s makes his latest position â€ ” which now approaches that of Americans for Peace Now ( which called this week for unconditional U.S. engagement with Iran ) â€ ” all the more remarkable .
Kaganâ€™s advice has also been echoed in recent days by two other influential voices identified with or previously embraced by the neo-conservative movement .
In a column in the Washington Times today .
Roll Call columnist Morton Kondracke called for Bush to â€œdrop his objections to direct talks with the Iranians , â€ even while he insisted that Washington should continue to push for more sanctions against Tehran .
He still sounds very hawkish on Iran but appears to have given up on the idea that Bush will take military action against Iran , arguing , â€˜â€ ™the question of whether to go to war â€¦is gone .â€ 
Over the weekend , British historian Niall Ferguson , whose neo-imperial views have long been embraced by the neo- conservatives , explicitly agreed in his Financial Times column with Kaganâ€™s analysis â€ ” that â€ œthe time may well have arrived to rethink US policy towards Iran , â€ although he thinks â€œit just is not in this presidentâ€™s nature to beat his sword into a plowshareâ€  and that , in any event , â€œit seems doubtful the Iranians would take such a volte - face seriously .â€ 
He goes on to call for Bushâ€™s successor to offer Tehran â€œa grand bargainâ€ â€ ” economic assistance and diplomatic rapprochement for a renunciation of nuclear weapons and terrorism.â€ 
He thinks John McCain is the candidate who could best pull that off .

Fuel from Trash Will Power California Garbage Trucks
May 8th , 2008 by Sarah Lozanova
300 garbage collection trucks in California will soon be fueled by the same trash that they haul .
Landfill gas will be purified and liquefied , producing up to 13,000 gallons of liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) daily .
This facility at Waste Management ’s ( WMI : NYSE ) Altamont Landfill in Livermore , California will begin operation in 2009 .
It comes with a price tag of $ 15.5 million , with grants providing $ 1.4 million .
Cleaner Fuel
Waste Management is the largest waste management company in North America and operates the largest US fleet of heavy - duty collection trucks .
The company has a goal to reduce fleet emissions by 15 % by 2020 .
The new facility will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 30,000 tons per year , according to Linde North America .
LNG is a cleaner burning transportation fuel that emits less nitrogen oxide , carbon dioxide and particulates than diesel - fueled vehicles .
Duane Woods , senior vice president , Western group of Waste Management , said , “ This will be the largest plant of its kind and we hope to break new ground by producing commercial quantities .
Natural gas is already the cleanest burning fuel available for our collection trucks , and the opportunity to use recovered landfill gas offers enormous environmental benefits to the communities we serve . ”
Demand for Low - carbon Fuels
California passed a law to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 % by 2020 and other states may follow .
Demand for low - carbon fuels is expected to increase significantly in California as the state starts requiring a decrease in carbon emissions .
Waste Management will be ahead of the curve by having plants like this in operation , creating lucrative business opportunities .

The first ( and biggest ) Star Destroyer project
The first time I tried this project was 1981 .
It involved a lot of cardboard , masking tape and several precariously wired 60 watt light bulbs .
Probably a good thing it did n't make it too far .
Just a few short years later , I was ready to try it again .
Although I 've recently played around modifying models , this is my first serious attempt at a scratch build .
Project started in the Summer of 2004
The basic frame was initially scaled and tested using poster board .
Once I was happy with the shape , the poster board was used as templates to cut out the wood .
This would have been around early November , 2004
More support added to the ribs and a piece of styrene cut and laid out .
( I bought two 4x8 sheets of styrene for the project )
The underside roughed in
Once the bottom was glued to the frame , the Main Hanger was the first section I started to detail
I started adding the lights , the Main Hanger has eight LED 's providing indirect light .
The rest are fiber optics .
A closer look
I then roughed in the engine area and did a lighting test .
The smaller thrusters are LED 's and will always be lit .
The primary thrusters are made out of flashlight parts , using the reflector base to provide a wide and bright spill .
These can be turned on and off while leaving the rest of the ship lit .
Inside wiring and fiber runs .
The side panels are made up of battleship parts , I built a 12 " master , struck a mold then cast resin duplicates .
After gluing the resin pieces in place , I was able to super detail and disguise the replicating pattern .
A closer look at the side panel .
Another detail shot , the launch bay was later detailed and tiny TIE fighters added ( 8 hanging from above , two on deck and ready to go )
The underside with side panels attached .
Starting on the top
Starting to rough in the super structure .
( March 14 , 2005 )
The Super Structure finally in place ... just a tiny bit of detailing left to do ...!
... and about a thousand more fiber stands .
I 've had a few requests to see the tiny TIE fighters .
After a few busy weeks I 've been able to get back to work .
Starting to detail the Super Structure has only proven how daunting this stage is going to be .
It 's also become clear that I 'm going to need to make adjustments to the scale of the upper two levels .
I 've spent the last week building the cannons .
I created a master , molded it then made eight duplicates .
To prevent breakage , the cannon barrels are metal .
I snipped off the ends of needles and placed them in the mold before pouring the resin .
The studio model has four barrels on each cannon , I reduced it to three due to the smaller scale .
( It should be noted that the actual cannons are not glued down yet , they should sit straighter once I 'm ready to affix them . )
September 2007
Finally back to work !
I spent about a week looking her over , trying to figure out where I left off and how to get back into it .
This project started off as my first scratch build , but now that I have three 24 " versions under my belt , it will finish as my fourth .
I 've found quite a few things that I did that I would do drastically different now .
I 've gone back and corrected whatever I could , but will need to live with a few things .
Mostly issues with symmetry .
Live and learn .
I chose to start with the engine area .
I rebuilt the secondary engines and the housings , have rebuilt the outer ring of the primary engines to get a more true circle .
Once the rest of the engine area structures were complete I start adding the detail layers .
So far , the center engine is as far as I 've gotten
( Had to use those MPC Falcon Landing Pads somewhere ! )
I finally completed the rear engine area and am ready to start back into the super structure .
The main engines are n't aligned yet , I 've decided to replace the tungsten bulbs with LEDs .
September 30 , 2007
After doing the three 24 " versions and coming back to this project , I decided that the proportions of my super structure were off .
I spent much of the week correcting and rebuilding each level .
The Bridge still looks a little too big , but once the " shelving " is added to the super structure , it will widen it out and hopefully bring the bridge down to scale .
Starting to pencil in the panel lines to be scribed .
i slow and tedious process that will probably make up most of the progress this coming week .
It 's a boring chore , but it really pays off .
Finally finished the hull etching .
Tedious , but it 's done !
November 18 , 2007
Progress has been slow , I 've had a few " real life " distractions in past few weeks .
The LED 's have n't been color corrected yet , so are still burning too bright and too blue .
Detailing
Little squares and shapes glued all over the surface , more them probably ended up lost in the carpet , but the upper hull should be just about complete , now on to the super structure .
Government wealth distribution report
Germany :
The growing gulf between rich and poor
By Dietmar Henning
24 May 2008
Social polarisation in Germany is continuing apace .
This is clear from the draft of the third report by the German government on wealth distribution presented by Labour Minister Olaf Scholz ( Social Democratic Party , SPD ) on Monday , May 19 .
Scholz ’s appearance before the press was not entirely voluntary .
As has been the case with similar reports in previous years , the draft report on wealth distribution had been sitting in his ministry for some time where it was due to be revised in order to present its contents in a better light .
However , following publication of figures featured in the draft by several newspapers , Scholz decided to go on the offensive .
The report begins with the sentence : “ Poverty is a social phenomenon with many faces .
On that basis , it is therefore difficult to measure exactly . ”
In line with this statement , Scholz goes on to use a different database than that used in the last two wealth distribution reports , citing the data of the EU - SILC ( European Union Statistics on Income and Living conditions ) instead of the Socio - Economic Panel ( SOEP ) .
Officially , this shift to the EU - SILC database is justified on the basis that it permits a better comparison with other countries .
With the help of this new criterion , Scholz could report that in 2005 , 13 percent of the German population , or 10.7 million citizens , were officially regarded as poor .
Since 2003 , this represents a rise of “ only ” 1 percent , a rise that Scholz seeks to play down by declaring that the current economic upswing in Germany only began in 2006 .
According to Scholz , the upswing will benefit all sections of the population , but this is not “ reflected ” in the figures of the current report .
By employing the new database , Scholz has been able to clearly reduce the threshold for the definition of poverty : from €935 to € 781 per month for single citizens .
This in turn puts the poverty threshold for families below the subsistence level granted by Germany ’s current standard unemployment and welfare payment — Hartz IV .
If one proceeds from the old database — which is hidden away in an appendix to the 413 - page draft under the chapter “ core indicators ” — then the poverty ratio is much higher : i.e. , 18 percent in 2005 and — despite the economic upswing — 18.3 percent in 2006 .
The differences in statistics are even more pronounced when it comes to child poverty .
According to the SOEP , child poverty in 2005 averaged 26 percent , while the EU SILC statistics put this figure at 12 percent .
According to the SOEP data , child poverty increased by around 3 percent between 2003 and 2005 , while the EU data registers a decline over the same period of 3 percent .
The latter estimate contradicts all of the latest studies dealing with child poverty , which conclude that one in six children in Germany — i.e. , a total of 2 million — are dependent on Hartz IV payments .
A similar picture emerges with regard to single - parent families and low - paid workers in east Germany .
According to Scholz ’s EU statistics , the rate of poverty in east Germany declined between 2003 and 2005 from 19 to 15 percent ; according to the SOEP , it rose from 20 to 22 percent .
According to Scholz , 24 percent of all single parents are poor , 12 percent (! ) lower than two years previously ; according to the SOEP , the figure has remained the same for the past seven years — i.e. , around 36 percent .
Scholz concludes that the ratio of so - called “ working poor ” — those in work but with an insufficient income — is 6 percent of the population ; the SOEP calculates this figure at 12 percent .
Scholz does admit there has been “ an increase in the low - wage sector . ”
In 2005 , more than a third of all workers were employed in cheap - wage jobs .
At the start of the 1990s , this figure was slightly more than one in four .
Scholz ’s sleight of hand is clearly aimed at diverting attention away from the disastrous consequences of the policies introduced by the former SPD - Green Party government led by Gerhard Schröder ( SPD ) , which opened the way for a massive low - wage sector in the German economy and growing poverty through the introduction of its so - called Agenda 2010 and Hartz IV laws .
Despite all attempts by the government to present the findings of its draft in the best light , the labour minister was unable to hide the fact that the gulf between rich and poor in Germany has widened considerably .
“ There is an increase of persons at both the lower and top end of the [ income ] spectrum , ” the draft concludes , with a corresponding shrinkage of the “ middle class . ”
The wealthy elite who earn at least 200 percent of the middle - income level , or € 3,268 net per month , constitute 6.4 percent of the total population .
If one includes property and shares ( persons with more than € 3,418 net per month ) , this proportion rises to 8.8 percent .
This income refers only to single households .
A couple with two children under 14 years must receive net incomes of € 6,863 to be considered wealthy .
The decline in incomes for the poorest layer of society is made clear by the following statistic : in 2002 , 30.4 percent of all net income was shared by the poorest 50 percent of the population .
Just three years later , in 2005 , this share had shrunk to 28.7 percent .
Those to profit from this redistribution are the wealthiest 10 percent .
They were the only group to increase their share of social wealth , by around 1.6 percent between 2004 and 2005 alone .
This redistribution went hand in hand with declining wages and salaries .
Between 2002 and 2005 , wages declined from an average € 24,873 to € 23,684—i.e. , around 4.7 percent — according to the government report .
Net wages also declined under conditions where inflation is increasing — in particular , for food and energy .
The report charts that the price for energy alone in Germany rose between 2002 and 2006 by 7.3 percent per year .
The report remains sketchy on the issue of Germany ’s wealthy elite .
It records that the total assets of all private households at the end of 2002 approximated € 7.8 trillion .
The wealthiest 10 percent control 56 percent of this total , while the poorest 50 percent possess just 2 percent .
The wealth distribution report unleashed a host of political reactions .
Politicians and parties have resurrected old demands for cuts in tax and social security contributions for the middle class ( Christian Democratic Union , CDU ) and tax increases for the rich ( the Left Party ) , as well as calls for the introduction of a minimum wage ( SPD , German Trade Union Federation — DGB ) .
But it would be a mistake to conclude that the parties will undertake any measures aimed at the fairer distribution of social wealth based on the findings of the draft .
The main parties in the current “ grand coalition ” government , the SPD and CDU , have so far reacted to any pressure from below with a swing to the right .
In its introduction , the wealth distribution report makes clear that the existing policy of redistributing wealth should be continued : “ However the financial room for manoeuvre for investment , and active and preventive measures to avoid poverty , is limited by the indebtedness of the public budget .
The federal budget of 2008 has allocated approximately 15 percent of all expenditures ( €283 billion ) exclusively for interest payments .
The continuation of the process of budget consolidation remains necessary as before , ” the report declares .
In line with this policy priority , German Finance Minister Peer Steinbruck ( SPD ) has ruled out any proposals for tax cuts :
“ If this is meant seriously , it would question the reliability and stability of the coalition government , ” he warned .
Any official reactions will be strictly limited to measures of a cosmetic nature under conditions where the governing parties are increasingly aware of the extent of public hostility to their policies .
According to a recent poll by the British Financial Times , 87 percent of the German population regard the social inequality gap to be unacceptable .
The issue is also addressed — notably for the first time — in the wealth distribution draft .
“ Social acceptance of wealth strongly depends on the extent to which it is possible to fairly arrange the distribution mechanisms from the standpoint of the citizen , ” the report declares .
“ Should the differences between rich and poor be perceived as too large and too difficult to surmount , this could place the acceptance of the social free - market economy and democracy in question . ”
And further : “ A large proportion of the population is of the view that one can only become rich if one has the right connections and initial conditions . ”
Eighty percent of those asked regarded these as the two most important reasons for becoming rich .
Far fewer are of the opinion that “ hard work ” is an important criterion for acquiring wealth .
More important is “ dishonesty . ”
The report warns : “ This estimation , however , is incompatible with the general understanding of equal chances for all . ”
At the same time , there is a growing chorus of those appealing for the government to ignore and defy popular sentiment .
This was clear in connection with reactions to the recently agreed decision to cancel plans for increased salaries for members of the German Bundestag ( parliament ) .
Following a storm of popular protest at the plans to increase deputies ’ salaries by € 1,100 per month , the chairmen of the party fractions —
Peter Struck for the SPD and Volker Kauder for the CDU — agreed to postpone the measure .
Struck and Kauder were immediately criticised for backing down to “ pressure from the streets . ” Education Minister Annette Schavan ( CDU ) told German television : “ It has never paid off to back down under pressure . ” CDU politician Jürgen Gehb declared that the decision represented a “ poor mark for political reliability ” and accused the SPD of “ populism . ”
Newspaper commentaries went on to attack the “ absence of authority ” on the part of the CDU and SPD , together with their “ lack of courage , ” “ clumsiness ” and “ cowardice . ”
Growing mass poverty and social polarisation are seen by the government solely as factors threatening the status quo .
It has no qualms about the fate of those affected by its policies .
Rather than take any effective measures to deal with poverty , it will inevitably respond by beefing up the apparatus of the state in order to prepare for future mass protests .
Obviously , John McCain ’s intention to move the Supreme Court even further to the right and overturn Roe is high on the list of concerns regarding women 's issues , but Scott Lemieux had a good item this week reminding us that Roe is just part of a bigger picture .
Yes , it ’s true that replacing John Paul Stevens and / or Ruth Bader Ginsburg with a Republican appointee will be bad for abortion rights , although this is likely to occur by further draining content from Casey rather than overturning Roe outright .
But even when it comes to women ’s rights , this is just the tip of the iceberg .
The enforcement of civil rights protections for women is likely to be much less in a Republican administration , for example .
The global gag order will remain firmly in place .
And in general , four more years of a tax - cut - supporting , massive - defense - spending GOP president will not only make any kind of serious progressive reform ( much of which disproportionately benefits women even if not specifically targeted to do so ) virtually impossible for four more years but will also make it more difficult in the future .
A McCain presidency would be very , very bad for women even if not a single Supreme Court vacancy opens up during his tenure .
Quite right .
We ’re not just talking about esoteric issues like Supreme Court cases and speculative high court retirements ; this is about the kind of impact McCain policies can and would have on women ’s lives every day .
As St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman , an enthusiastic Clinton backer , said this week , “ You do n’t spend your life fighting for women ’s rights and then vote for Sen. McCain . ”
As it turns out , we can even go further on this point .
David Greenberg , the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood in Oregon , had an especially good item this week on the subject .
John McCain is one of only a few Senators to earn a Zero percent lifetime rating from Planned Parenthood ’s Action Fund , and he only scored that high because the organization does n’t have a lower rating ….
Let ’s look at his record :
He voted against requiring health care plans to cover birth control ( 3/22/03 ) .
He voted against comprehensive , medically accurate sex education ( 7/25/06 ) .
He voted against international family planning funding ( 3/14/96 ) .
He voted against funding to prevent teen and unintended pregnancies ( 3/17/05 ) .
He voted against public education for emergency contraception ( 3/17/05 ) .
And he voted against restoring Medicaid funding that could be used for family planning for low - income women ( 3/17/05 ) .
NPR reported ( 2/2/08 ) that , “ Many Republican voters seem to believe , incorrectly , that the current Republican front - runner , Arizona Senator John McCain , supports abortion rights . ”
John McCain wants us to believe that he ’s a moderate who supports improving the health of women in the United States , but in fact he ’s among the most extreme members of Congress who voted against common sense measures on family planning , sex education and access to basic healthcare .
In contrast , Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton agree on all of these issues .

Penelope Cruz & Javier Bardem Outed by Harrelson ( Photos )
andfirst met in 1992 when they both had roles in the Spanish film Jamon Jamon .
The two have been pulled together once again in afilm Vicky Cristina Barcelona .
The couple had not responded to rumors of a renewed relationship until Woody Harrelson let the cat out of the bag while presenting The Montecito award to Bardem for his supporting role in No Country for Old Men at the Santa Barbara Film Festival on Tuesday .
The actor also won a Golden Globe Award for the movie , and is up for an Oscar .
Harrelson remarked :
" I can't believe the luck Javier has .
If you look at his biography - one page is just describing his journey and then the second page is all of the awards he 's won .
And not to mention , I found this out last night too - he 's going out with Penelope Cruz ! "
The audience cheered at Harrelson 's remarks and the embarrassed Bardem hung his head and covered his face with his hands .
The couple are set to begin production on another Woody Allen film Nine .
We 've included a photo of Cruz from the movie the couple have just finished , Vicky Cristina Barcelona .
There is also a tabloid cover showing the couple in the Maldives last Fall .
ARIVACA , Ariz . -- Censored Blog reported this summer that Elbit Systems , an Israeli defense contractor working on the Apartheid Wall in Palestine , was subcontracted by Boeing to provide security systems for the spy towers at the Arizona / Mexico border .
Those nine spy towers located on Tohono O'odham tribal land and around the towns of Arivaca and Sasabe , still are n't functioning .
Now , Magal Security Systems , a private company which grew out of Israeli government security , is receiving contracts to secure nuclear power plants and other sensitive areas of the U.S. Also , Magal markets border security as among its specialties .
On Sept. 19 , Magal received a $ 1.5 million contract for U.S. security , but is n't revealing for what .
Further , the buses waiting to deport migrants at the US / Mexico border are not owned by a US company either .
Wackenhut Transportation , whose drivers deport migrants , is owned by G4S global security , traded on the stock exchanges in England and Denmark .
With all the jargon in Washington about " securing the nation 's borders " against foreigners , you would think those corporations carrying out border security and deportation would be US companies .
Read from the news - Sept 19 , 2007 NEW YORK - Magal Security Systems Ltd. , an Israeli maker of computerized security systems , said Wednesday that its U.S. - based subsidiary received a $ 1.5 million order from an unidentified customer to upgrade existing equipment .
" Anti-Terror , Inc. " MSN ( 2001 Newsweek ) < http://www.mafhoum.com/press2/71T41.htm>http://www.mafhoum.com/press2/71T41.htm
While others experienced financial losses after 9/11 , " Magal Security Systems , an Israeli company , saw its share price double that day .
Best known for its ' smart ' fences , the company was created in the 1960s in response to an Israel Defense Forces request for a method of securing the country 's borders .
Founded as a unit of Israel Aircraft Industries , it was spun off and now has a market cap of $ 70 million and 2001 revenues estimated at $ 40 million .
Israel 's borders with its Arab neighbors are secured with Magal fencing - though not the West Bank , because of uncertainty about where to draw the borders .
The company installed security systems at Buckingham Palace , is just completing work at Chicago 's O'Hare airport and has installed equipment at more than 400 U.S. correctional facilities .
...
They can track an interloper 's movements , using such sensing systems as motion detectors , vibration detectors and microphonic cable disturbance .
Magal also builds night - vision systems and offers fences that can secure waterways and sewer pipes . "
http://www.mafhoum.com/press2/71T41.htm
U.S. Nuclear Weapons Being " Guarded " by Israel " Magal 's American outreach is expected to increase substantially , especially now that firm has set up a Washington , D.C. office which will promote its products to federal agencies and to the members of Congress who provide funding for federally - supervised security projects across the country at all levels : local , state and national .
And with current U.S. Homeland Security Chief , Michael Chertoff , not only a strong supporter of Israel but also the son of a woman who has strong Israeli ties - even including service with El Al , the national airline of Israel - Magal , owned in party by Israeli Aircraft Industries - will be a clear - cut favorite in the eyes of the power brokers in official Washington who have the power to grant lucrative security contracts .
At the moment , Magal has four U.S. - based subsidiaries : two in California , Stellar Security Products , Inc. and Perimeter Products Inc. , as well as the New York - based Smart Interactive Systems , Inc. , and the Virginia - based Dominion Wireless , Inc .
All told , the Israeli company holds a 40 % share in the worldwide market in perimeter intrusion detection systems and is working to expand its business in the protection of oil pipelines .
Magal is also said to be quite interested in guarding water lines around the globe , particularly in the United States .
In fact , Magal may have an inside shot at getting a monopoly in guarding America 's water supplies .
On July 19 , the Bush administration 's Environmental Protection Agency announced a " partnership " with the Israeli Ministry of National Infrastructures to improve what they called " water supply system security in the United States and Israel . "
Since Magal is so highly respected in Israel , it 's an even bet that Magal will soon be guarding the U.S. water supply . " http://kavkazcenter.com/eng/content/2007/09/26/8910.shtml
Magal Reports the Acquisition of a European Security Systems Integration Company Acquisition Expected to Contribute to Improved Revenues and Income September 05 , 2007 : 07:00 AM EST YAHUD , Israel , September 5 / PRNewswire -FirstCall / -- Magal Security Systems , Ltd. ( TASE : MAGS ) , today announced the acquisition of a European company involved in the installation and integration of security systems .

A feature of Plasma is the ability to theme desktop elements using Scalable Vector Graphics ( SVGs ) .
This means there is no need for theme authors to know C++ or any other programming language to create a great looking theme .
They need only use common graphics tools many are already familiar with ( e.g. Krita , Inkscape , The GIMP , Karbon , etc. ) .
Depending on your prowess with such tools , a great looking plasma theme can be created in under an hour .
See also Plasma Theme Details .
Creating a Plasma Theme in 7 Easy Steps
Copy and rename an existing plasma theme folder .
The new folder name can be the name of the theme .
Installed themes are stored in share / apps / desktoptheme / in either your . kde directory or your kde installation directory .
You can also find Plasma themes on KDE - Look .
Edit the metadata .
desktop file in the theme folder to match your theme name .
See Theme Storage if you need help .
Open the SVG file associated with the plasma element you would like to theme ( panel background , clock , etc. ) in an SVG editor ( e.g. Inkscape , Karbon ) .
See Current Theme Elements if you need help understand what each SVG file does .
Each SVG file may have several elements ( e.g. objects with element id = left , right , top , topright , center , clock face , etc. ) .
Modify existing elements OR delete and create replacement elements .
Elements can be any SVG primitive or object group .
Hint :
You can embed raster images as SVG elements if you creatively prefer raster editors like Krita , the GIMP , etc .
Remember to embed , instead of link , each image ( inkscape : effects -> images - > embed all images ) .
To make renaming of the theme elements easier is possible to use an Inkscape extension located at this address Check to make sure that the element id for each new element is correctly set .
Hint :
In Inkscape you can check the element id for each object by right - clicking on the object and choosing Object Properties .
Add or remove any hint element you desire .
It does n't matter how these look , just that objects with the element ids matching the hint elements either exist or do n't exist .
See Backgrounds format for a description of available hint elements .
Save the SVG file .
Repeat steps 3 - 6 for any other plasma element for which you would like to create a new theme .
Testing the Theme
If you have not already done so , copy your new theme folder to the share / apps / desktoptheme directory in either your . kde folder or your kde install folder .
directory in either your . kde folder or your kde install folder .
Choose the theme from the Configure Desktop dialog ( may require kde restart ) or edit your plasmarc file to point to the new theme .
file to point to the new theme .
Carefully check the appearance of all new theme elements .
If you created separate non-composite themes ( SVGs in the opaque folder ) , remember to test your theme with compositing ( Desktop Effects ) turned off .
Theme Colors
You can provide a plasma color scheme that will allow text , selected backgrounds and other items to blend well with your theme by supplying a colors file in your theme folder .
See the colors file in the default theme for an example .
file in your theme folder .
See the file in the default theme for an example .
If the colors file is omitted , plasma will take on the current KDE system colors .
Note :
Theme SVGs will not be colorized unless they contain the ' hint - apply - color - scheme ' element . )
Hints and Tips
( CNN ) -- Democrats on Sunday cheered a weekend special election in Louisiana , where a Democratic congressional candidate won a seat that has been held by Republicans for decades .
Democratic state Rep. Don Cazayoux on Saturday won a congressional seat that was long held by a Republican .
Democratic State Rep. Don Cazayoux beat Republican Woody Jenkins in the state 's 6th Congressional District on Saturday , with Cazayoux winning 49 percent of the vote to Jenkins ' 46 percent .
Both parties viewed the race as a potential bellwether of November 's congressional races .
The national GOP poured more than $ 1 million into the contest in an attempt to tie Cazayoux to national Democrats such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois .
" Don Cazayoux 's victory this evening proves once again that Americans across our country want real solutions and reject Republicans ' negative attacks , " Pelosi said in a written statement hailing the win .
National Democrats spent more than $ 1 million as well , airing television ads that questioned whether Jenkins -- a newspaper publisher , former state legislator and well - known conservative activist -- had paid all his taxes on time .
The contest was to replace U.S. Rep. Richard Baker , an 11 - term Republican who resigned in February to become a lobbyist .
The district , which includes capital city Baton Rouge and its surrounding parishes , has been held by the GOP since 1974 .
Do n't Miss GOP uses Obama as bad guy in ads
Democrats viewed a victory there as an indication of just how vulnerable Republicans will be in November , while Republicans viewed the race as an early glimpse of how a possible Obama candidacy could affect races down the ticket .
Cazayoux 's win comes two months after Democrat Bill Foster won a special election in Illinois to replace former House Speaker Dennis Hastert , and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Chris Van Hollen quickly sought to link the two races .

" For the second time this cycle , Republicans were reminded that ' All politics is local , ' " Van Hollen said in a statement .
" House Republicans tried to nationalize this election , illegally coordinated with Freedom 's Watch ; used false and deceptive special interest smears and funneled nearly a million dollars into a district that Republicans held for more than three decades . "
Freedom's Watch , a conservative group formed by former Bush administration officials , got involved in the race by financing anti-Cazayoux television ads -- a move Democrats said violated election laws .
But the National Republican Congressional Committee countered that their attempts to link Cazayoux to Pelosi and Obama helped Jenkins make up " substantial ground " in the race .
" When Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi were introduced into this campaign , Don Cazayoux was leading by a large margin in the polls , " an NRCC memo stated .
" Since then , Republicans saturated the Baton Rouge airwaves in an effort to nationalize this contest and make the election about the real - life consequences of a Barack Obama presidency and a continued Pelosi- run Democratic Congress . "
Republicans held on to a second House seat up for grabs Saturday in Louisiana as state Sen .
Steve Scalise handily defeated Democrat Gilda Reed , 75 percent to 22 percent , in a heavily Republican district in the New Orleans suburbs .
The seat was last held by Bobby Jindal , who became Louisiana 's governor in January .
Since Scalise was heavily favored , the race drew little attention from the national parties .

It tastes sweet , like a cross between lamb and duck .
And it 's selling as fast as butchers can get it
It 's low in fat , low in food miles and completely free range .
In fact , some claim that Sciurus carolinensis - the grey squirrel - is about as ethical a dish as it is possible to serve on a dinner plate .
The grey squirrel , the American cousin of Britain 's endangered red variety , is flying off the shelves faster than hunters can shoot them , with game butchers struggling to keep up with demand .
' We put it on the shelf and it sells .
It can be a dozen squirrels a day - and they all go , ' said David Simpson , the director of Kingsley Village shopping centre in Fraddon , Cornwall , whose game counter began selling grey squirrel meat two months ago .
At Ridley 's Fish and Game shop in Corbridge , Northumberland , the owner David Ridley says he has sold 1,000 - at £ 3.50 a squirrel - since he tested the market at the beginning of the year .
' I was n't sure at first , and wondered would people really eat it .
Now I take every squirrel I can get my hands on .
I 've had days when I have managed to get 60 and they 've all sold straight away . '
Simpson likens the taste to wild boar .
Ridley thinks it is more a cross between duck and lamb .
' It 's moist and sweet because , basically , its diet has been berries and nuts , ' he said .
Both believe its new - found popularity is partly due to its green credentials .
' People like the fact it is wild meat , low in fat and local - so no food miles , ' says Simpson .
Ridley reckons that patriotism also plays a part : ' Eat a grey and save a red .
That 's the message . '
A glut of back - to - the - wild TV programmes featuring celebrity chefs such as Hugh Fearnley - Whittingstall has also tickled the public 's palate , but squirrel is still unlikely to be found in the family fridge .
The Observer 's restaurant critic , Jay Rayner , said he had never tasted squirrel , but if he did have it for dinner ' it would have to be a big , fat country squirrel and not one of the mangy urban ones you see in cities ' .
' People may say they are buying it because it 's green and environmentally friendly , but really they 're doing it out of curiosity and because of the novelty value .
If they can say , " Darling , tonight we 're having squirrel " , then that takes care of the first 30 minutes of any dinner party conversation .
I see it remaining a niche .
There 's not much meat on a squirrel , so I 'd be surprised if farming squirrel takes off anywhere some time soon . '
Kevin Viner , former chef - proprietor of Pennypots , the first Michelin - starred restaurant in Cornwall , who now runs Viners bar and restaurant at Summercourt , believes it will remain a niche market .
But with a plentiful supply of meat - there are estimated to be almost five million grey squirrels in Britain - there is room for the market to expand .
Viner - who comes from a rural ' if you shot it , you ate it ' background - said the trick was to serve squirrel fresh and not to leave it hanging like other game .
' It looks a lot like rabbit , though it is a drier meat and slightly firmer .
Most of the meat comes off the rear leg .
The loins are so thin they need much shorter cooking time , ' he said .
' A large squirrel would be enough for one - and - a - half people .
The public really are being drawn to it .
I think that it 's because it is being perceived as a healthy meat .
Southern fried squirrel is good .
And tandoori style works .
It is especially tasty fricasséed with Cornish cream and walnuts .
But the one everyone seems to like is the Cornish squirrel pasty . '
And his own favourite recipe ?
' I must admit , I 'm a beef man myself , ' he said .
' But my huntsman swears by squirrel with sausage meat and bacon . '
How to make squirrel pasties
Kevin Viner 's recipe for two pasties
140g squirrel meat cut into 1 cm cubes ;
100g sliced potato ; 100g sliced swede ; 50g diced onion ; 30g smoked bacon ;
15g chopped hazelnuts ; 75g butter ;
5g chopped parsley ; a good pinch of salt and pepper
Method
· Egg wash edges of pastry circles .
· Place the potato , swede , hazelnuts , parsley and seasoning on to each circle followed by the bacon , squirrel meat and , finally , the onion .
· Place butter in each pasty , then fold over the pastry and crimp the edges .
· Put the pasties on to a greaseproof baking tray , egg wash both pasties well , place in a pre-heated oven at 180C or gas mark 5 .
· Bake for 45 - 50 minutes .
The juices should start to boil and the pasties should be able to move on the tray with ease .

There have been virtual fences , real fences , increased patrols and night - vision cameras .
Now the latest initiative by the US to seal its increasingly porous border with Mexico harks back to one of the oldest approaches : dig a moat .
City officials in Yuma , in south - western Arizona , have come up with a scheme to create a " security channel " along the nearby border by reviving a derelict two - mile stretch of the Colorado river .
" The moats that I 've seen circled the castle and allowed you to protect yourself , and that 's kind of what we 're looking at here , " Yuma county sheriff Ralph Ogden told Reuters .
The scheme would see engineers dig out a two - mile stretch of a 180 - hectare ( 440 - acre ) wetland known as Hunters Hole .
Once a haven to anglers , ducks and the Cocopah Indians , the area is now a thicket of tamarisk , forgotten shoes and old cars providing cover for smugglers and border crossers .
But under the plan , all that would change .
The banks of the river would be replanted with native cattail , bulrush and mesquite , and wells would supply water to the wetlands as well as to a 20 - metre - wide , three - metre - deep channel that would run the length of Hunters Hole .
With the replenished river marking the frontier , would - be border crossers would have to scale a 4.5 - metre levee - built with the earth excavated from the riverbed - cross a 120 - metre - wide marsh and then ascend another levee on the northern side of the wetlands .
" In order to restore Hunters Hole , we 're going to have to secure it , " a border patrol agent , Carlos Dominguez , told the High Country News .
The moat plan has won broad local backing , unlike other border security schemes which have angered environmentalists and land - owners .
In Texas , more than 100 landowners have resisted government efforts to build a fence across their land .
Environmentalists also launched a lawsuit to block fence construction on the border in Naco , in eastern Arizona .
However , the department of homeland security is under a strict timetable to build 670 miles of new fencing by the end of the year .
With failed efforts to build a virtual or electronic barrier , attention has again focused on a physical barrier .
As well as illegal immigration , the desolation of many border areas has attracted criminal activity .
The 23 - mile stretch of the Colorado river that runs along the Mexican border near Yuma has seen two murders since 2004 and 250 armed robberies in the last two years .
" It 's in the United States , but it 's become a no - man 's - land , an area where bodies were dumped , where people and drugs were smuggled over the border , " said Ogden .
Backers of the Yuma plan - more than 30 local groups , including the border patrol and the city 's elected officials - hope that Hunters Hole will mimic the model of another local wetland that was rescued from dereliction and crime and now provides bicycle paths and fishing .
" What you are building is a moat , but it 's bringing the life and the wildlife back , " said Ogden .
" It does n't take much brainpower to build a 12 - foot high fence around something , but this is unique . "

Yuma county sheriff Ralph Ogden , quoted in the article above , spoke to the Reuters news agency and not to Associated Press .
This has been corrected .
At this point , I think the only chance oil has of reaching $ 100 this year is if OPEC comes out of the meeting next week and really spooks the market .
Of course every time I say that , oil runs up $ 8 .
But I do expect it to drop into the $ 80 's pretty soon .
Activity at the Cushing terminal is studied closely by oil traders because it is the physical delivery point for Nymex crude .
Falling supplies there are seen as a symptom of a tight market , and those concerns ease when Cushing inventories rise .
Overall crude supplies fell during the week ended Nov. 23 by 400,000 barrels , in line with the 500,000 barrel decrease analysts had expected .
But that decline was overshadowed by a 600,000 barrel increase in inventories in Cushing , Okla .
Cushing inventories are up 13.4 percent in two weeks .
NEW YORK ( AP ) —
Oil 's rise to $ 100 a barrel , which seemed a done deal as recently as two days ago , was dealt a severe blow Wednesday when the government reported an increase in supplies at the Nymex delivery terminal in Cushing , Okla . , which is closely watched by traders as a benchmark of oil inventory tightness .
Updated following the release
Crude inventories fell less than expected , but mostly in line with expectations .
Refinery utilization is picking back up .
The one thing to note is that crude imports are now up over the same period last year , and with the reports of more OPEC shipments headed this way , this trend is likely to continue .
This is the first time in a long while that I recall imports being up year over year .
Summary of Weekly Petroleum Data for the Week Ending November 23 , 2007
Some excerpts :
U.S. crude oil refinery inputs averaged nearly 15.5 million barrels per day during the week ending November 23 , up 573,000 barrels per day from the previous week 's average .
Refineries operated at 89.4 percent of their operable capacity last week .
U.S. crude oil imports averaged nearly 10.4 million barrels per day last week , up 534,000 barrels per day from the previous week .
Over the last four weeks , crude oil imports have averaged 10.1 million barrels per day , or 144,000 barrels per day more than averaged over the same four - week period last year .
U.S. commercial crude oil inventories ( excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve ) dropped by 0.4 million barrels compared to the previous week .
At 313.2 million barrels , U.S. crude oil inventories are in the upper half of the average range for this time of year .
Total motor gasoline inventories increased by 1.4 million barrels last week , and are below the lower end of the average range .
Nothing earth - shattering in this report .
I think now it 's a waiting game until OPEC 's meeting next week .
------------------------------------
Here is the expectation for this week 's report :
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. crude oil stocks probably fell last week on lower imports , a preliminary Reuters poll of nine industry analysts showed on Monday .
Analysts called for an average draw of 800,000 barrels for crude oil stocks , a 1.4 million barrel drop in distillates , which include heating oil and diesel fuel , and a 1.0 million barrel increase in gasoline stocks .
However , the estimates were all over the place :
Phil Flynn of Alaron Trading in Chicago , however , predicted that crude stocks rose on higher imports .
Crude imports had fallen 667,000 barrels per day to 9.8 million bpd in the week to Nov. 16 .
Imports last week could have fallen about 300,000 bpd to 9.5 million bpd , according to an estimate by Tim Evans , analyst at Citigroup Global Markets in New York .
But Peter Beutel , president of Cameron Hanover in New Canaan , Connecticut , estimated crude imports could have risen between 250,000 to 750,000 bpd last week .
Generally , you would expect that a draw this week should push prices back toward $ 100 .
However , there are other factors pulling crude in the other direction .
Given that one of the major factors that pushed oil up has been a widely held belief that OPEC had nothing more to give ( or could n't back up their promised 500,000 bpd increase ) , news like this should give traders pause in the short term :
OPEC oil exports , excluding Angola , will rise by 720,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) in the four weeks to December 8 , according to Roy Mason of tanker tracker Oil Movements .
The increase will be the biggest this year , with most of the extra supply heading to Western refiners .
Mason estimated that seaborne exports from the 11 OPEC countries would rise to 24.54 million bpd from 23.82 million bpd to November 10 .
Based on these observations , I think it is very likely that a new all - liquids peak will be set in November .
In fact the IEA 's new production numbers for October ( the full report is now available for free ) show a ( preliminary ) new record .
The total liquids production rate in October was reported to be 86.43 million bpd ( see Table 3 ) .
That is up almost 2 million bpd over August , and 300,000 bpd above the previous July 2006 record of 86.13 million bpd ( thanks to Stuart Staniford for providing that number ) .
The IEA does n't break out just crude + condensate , but with all - liquids in that neighborhood , C+C should be near record territory as well .
The other big question is the upcoming OPEC meeting .
All year I have been in the ( lonely ) camp that OPEC is setting on some spare capacity .
I think that question has been answered , although they were certainly slow to open the taps .
The questions now are 1 ) .
How much more capacity do they have ? ; and 2 ) .
Can Saudi get the production increase that they reportedly desire ?
I think there is a lot of risk out there for short - term bulls .
Supply appears to be increasing , there are projections that demand will soften at these prices , and OPEC is about to discuss another production increase .
Yesterday 's OPIS Report also had a blurb on this :
The list of market watchers predicting $ 100 / bbl oil is growing , putting more pressure on OPEC to boost production at its Dec. 5 meeting .
" The market is still not pricing in production increases .
I would have thought today would have been a little more give - back , " said one trader who expects OPEC will boost supply .
Oil has certainly run up higher than I thought it would this year .
However , the factors that helped with the price run-up are starting to shift .
The long - term bullish factors remain .
Short - term , I would heed the signs pointing to a more favorable supply / demand situation .

Now PlayStation
Home has been pushed back even further , with Sony Computer Entertainment today announcing that the service 's closed beta would be extended , with the open beta now not expected to begin until Fall 2008 .
Home -- Sony's Second Life - like online service for the PlayStation 3 - - was first unveiled in March 2007 .
In a statement , Sony Computer Entertainment president and group CEO Kaz Hirai said the company needed more time to complete Home .
" We understand that we are asking PS3 and prospective PS3 users to wait a bit longer , but we have come to the conclusion that we need more time to refine the service to ensure a more focused gaming entertainment experience than what it is today , " he said .
" Our overarching objective is to provide users with new gaming experiences that are available only on PlayStation Home .
Spending more time on the development and on the closed beta testing reaffirms our commitment to bringing a quality service , maintaining the PlayStation tradition . "
According to the press statement , an open beta for Home will begin in fall 2008 , while the closed beta would be expanded with more participants throughout summer 2008 .
There was no tentative date scheduled for a full release .
Neoconservative Lawrence Kaplan on Iraq ' I Don't See Anything Good That Has Come from this War '
In 2003 , Lawrence Kaplan , a leading neoconservative , helped deliver arguments that justified the invasion of Iraq .
Afterwards , he traveled repeatedly to the war zone over the course of two years .
It changed his view : " You can't help but be much more cautious with the ideas you put on the table , " he tells SPIEGEL ONLINE in an interview .
Although we 've already seen the NHTSA crash tests and the leaked IIHS test video , the official Insurance Institute …
DR . PAUL D. THOMPSON , a 60 - year - old marathon runner and chief of cardiology at Hartford Hospital , stood in front of a medical audience recently and began his talk with a story about himself .
“ I ’ve been lifting weights since I was 12 years old and look at me , ” he said .
Dr. Thompson is small and wiry with not a bulging muscle on him .
He speculated that he must have a genetic inability to build muscles , no matter how hard he works at it .
But are his muscles healthy ?
It is not the kind of question most people ask themselves .
But muscle researchers say it is important because muscle health is emerging as an important part of overall health .
And , they say , when it comes to muscles , bulk does not matter .
How big they can become depends on your sex as well as genetics .
What matters for health is whether , like Dr. Thompson , you use them .
Healthy muscles , researchers say , are those that have been worked , stressed and pushed to their limit so that they have enough power and strength to get you through life , especially as you grow older .
And keeping muscles fit takes effort , which means regular training with weight lifting and cardiovascular exercise even if the results are not a sculptured look , these experts add .

In their eagerness to visit justice on a 49 - year - old woman involved in the Megan Meier MySpace suicide tragedy , federal prosecutors in Los Angeles are resorting to a novel and dangerous interpretation of a decades - old computer crime law – potentially making a felon out of anybody who violates the terms of service of any website , experts say .
Lori Drew is charged with violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act " This is a novel and extreme reading of what [ the law ] prohibits , " says Jennifer Granick , civil liberties director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
" To say that you 're violating a criminal law by registering to speak under a false name is highly problematic .
It 's probably an unconstitutional reading of the statute . "
Lori Drew , of O'Fallon , Missouri , is charged ( .pdf ) with one count of conspiracy and three violations of the anti-hacking Computer Fraud and Abuse Act , in a case involving cyberbullying through a fake MySpace profile .
Drew is one of three people who helped set up and maintain a phony MySpace account in 2006 under the identity of a nonexistent 16 - year - old boy named Josh Evans .
The Evans account was used to flirt with and befriend 13 - year - old Megan Meier , who'd had a falling - out with Drew 's daughter .
The fake " Josh " ultimately turned on Meier and told the girl that the world would be a better place without her .
Meier already suffered from clinical depression , and shortly after that final message she hanged herself in her bedroom .
A nationwide community backlash ensued , after a news story published last year revealed Drew 's role in the cyberbullying , and pressure was placed on Missouri authorities to charge Drew with a crime .
But after investigating the incident , local prosecutors concluded last December that they could find no law under which to charge Drew .
That 's when federal prosecutors began working to build a case – a difficult task , given that there is no federal law against cyberbullying .
On Thursday , the U.S. Attorney 's Office in Los Angeles unveiled its solution by charging Drew with " unauthorized access " to MySpace 's computers , for allegedly violating the site 's terms of service .
MySpace 's user agreement requires registrants , among other things , to provide factual information about themselves and to refrain from soliciting personal information from minors or using information obtained from MySpace services to harass or harm other people .
By allegedly violating that click - to - agree contract , Drew committed the same crime as any hacker .
That sets a potentially troubling precedent , given that terms - of - service agreements sometimes contain onerous provisions , and are rarely read by users .
" Empowering terms of use to be key pieces of evidence in criminal matters – when terms of use are generally thought of by the people who are entering into them as purely contract or civil matters – is something that should be done carefully , " says Andrea Matwyshyn , law professor at the University of Pennsylvania 's Wharton Business
School .
" I think you 're going to have strong disagreement as to whether this is an advisable course to take . "
In a statement , MySpace says it supports the prosecution .
" MySpace does not tolerate cyberbullying and is cooperating fully with the U.S. attorney in this matter , " a company spokeswoman said .
The company declined to say what the precedent would mean for otherwise innocent users who , for example , misstate their age or ZIP code when setting up their MySpace profiles .
" Theoretically , it applies to any use of a service in violation of the terms of service , " says EFF 's Granick , who says the impact of the Drew prosecution could be far - reaching .
By way of example , Granick notes that some terms - of - use contracts prohibit users from making negative comments about the company .
" If you write on a blog something disparaging about that company , are you in violation of criminal law ? "
Other contracts have prohibited visitors to a website from linking to that site .
Matwyshyn says the Drew case is an especially creative use of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act , given that the aggrieved party in this case is not really MySpace , the putative victim , but Meier .
The case is being prosecuted only because there is so much pressure to see justice done in the Meier tragedy , but existing law does n't provide an immediate solution , she says .
Matwyshyn says she understands the impulse , but is concerned that if successfully prosecuted the case could set a bad precedent for turning breach - of - contract civil cases into criminal ones .
" Terms of use have been progressively getting more Draconian and restrictive , " she notes .
" So as these provisions get drafted and users agree to them , we may find ourselves in a situation where a company that drafts one may try to leverage this kind of case law to take a breach - of - contract action and turn it into a computer - intrusion [ case ] . "
Granick agrees .
" The real problem is that something tragic happened , but the harm that occurred does n't have anything to do with the way they 've charged the offense , " she says .
" Normally you charge tax evasion because someone did n't pay taxes , " says Granick .
" Or you charge a computer intrusion because someone broke into a computer ....
By overreaching legally the indictment makes some very extreme leaps . "
When asked if this is the kind of case Granick would want to litigate , she said , " If [ Drew ] calls me I 'd be very interested in talking with her about this case .
I think there is such an extreme reading here , and I do think it 's dangerously flawed for other cases .
I think it 's scary and it 's wrong and something should be done about it . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A quick shock from a Taser may have zapped a man ’s fluttering heart back into a healthy rhythm , doctors reported on Tuesday .
They cited the incident as evidence that the devices , which are used by police who want to use less - than - deadly force to incapacitate people but are condemned by some civil rights groups as dangerous , may affect the heart as critics allege .
In this case , the outcome was a happy one , the doctors reported in the Annals of Emergency Medicine .
Several lawsuits in the United States and Canada contend the devices , which use an electric charge to subdue an attacker , can stop the heart .
The 28 - year - old patient was fleeing police and jumped into a lake in April , when the water was still very cold .
“ I do n’t know exactly what he had done but he fled capture from them and he hid in a lake , ” said Dr. Kyle Richards , a cardiologist at Hartford Hospital in Connecticut , who treated the man when he was taken to an emergency room .
Richards said the patient was experiencing an irregular heart rhythm known as atrial fibrillation , possibly as a result of the cold and shock .
After treatment , the patient was eager to leave .
“ He got very combative and started yelling in my face and that ’s when I left the room and got security , ” Richards said .
Police and security used a Taser stun gun , which shoots out a lead connected to two barbs that can deliver up to 50,000 volts .
They used a low - voltage charge meant to cause pain rather than a longer , higher - voltage jolt meant to incapacitate .
The patient calmed down and another electrocardiogram showed his heart rhythm was normal .
“ This is the first report of a patient receiving a shock of this kind and having a positive outcome , ” Richards said .
Amnesty International says that since 2001 more than 290 people have died in North America in incidents involving the weapon .
Taser International says there is no evidence the gun directly caused the deaths .
Richards said studies done in pigs show the weapon can affect the heart muscle .
This case provided a controlled situation , with almost continuous monitoring of the patient ’s heart .
Richards noted that the patient was not hooked up to the electrocardiogram at the precise moment of being shocked .
“ People can spontaneously go from atrial fibrillation into a normal rhythm without any intervention at all .
You cannot conclusively say that the Taser did it , ” he said .
But he said he believed it did .
“ It ’s just one more thing that says , hey , Tasers can actually affect the heart . ”

Sexual Abuse of Boys
Menstuff® has compiled the following information on the sexual abuse of boys .
Reporting Abuse
Females Represent 40 % of the Sexual Abuse of Boys
Are Gays Abusing Children ?
Females Represent 40 % of the Sexual Abuse of Boys
Women fared even worse , with one in four reporting childhood molestation , in almost all cases perpetrated by males .
Both male and female victims had higher rates of substance abuse , mental illness and troubled marriages .
The findings are contained in a study of more than 17,000 California residents that appears in the June , 2005 issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine .
" Children of both genders are vulnerable to childhood sexual abuse , " said study lead author Shanta Dube , an epidemiologist with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
" And the long - term effects are similar , regardless of the gender of the victim . "
Child molestation has been in the public eye since the 1970s .
But much of the focus has been on female victims because awareness of the problem first sprang from the women 's movement and rape - crisis centers , explained Kathleen Kendall - Tackett , a research associate professor of psychology at the University of New Hampshire who has studied child sex abuse .
Consequently , the treatment of the health effects of childhood abuse also focused on women .
" I do n't think they were trying to exclude men , it 's just that so many of the patients were women , " she said .
In the last few years , the Catholic Church abuse scandal has focused more attention on males who were molested as children .
But studies of male sexual abuse have tended to focus on those men who have sought psychological help , Dube said .
In the new study , researchers examined the results of a survey of 17,337 San Diego - area members of the Kaiser Permanente Health Plan between 1995 and 1997 .
Twenty - five percent of females reported being molested , as did 16 percent of males .
Among female victims , males were responsible for the abuse 94 percent of the time .
Among male victims , females made up 38 percent of perpetrators , according to the study .
The high percentage of female perpetrators is unusual in abuse research , Kendall - Tackett said .
Other research has suggested higher numbers of male molesters of girls .
" But maybe that 's changing , maybe we 're finding out more about it , " she said .
The molestation victims were more than twice as likely to have tried to commit suicide as the other people surveyed .
They were also 40 percent to 50 percent more likely to have marital problems .
Dube said the study results should boost awareness of sexual abuse of males and the role of female perpetrators .
" The findings will definitely help increase the understanding that child sexual abuse is common , " she said .
Kendall - Tackett added that the research could help doctors do a better job of questioning patients , especially men , whose adult response to childhood sexual abuse has n't been well studied .
" It 's going to expand physicians ' understanding in terms of knowing risk factors and what to ask about . "

Are Gays Abusing Children ?
When men molest little girls , they re called pedophiles  or sexual predators ; heterosexuality is never blamed for the abuse .
But when men molest little boys , they re simply called homosexuals , as though sexual orientation were responsible for driving these men to their crimes .
Gays are singled out for suspicion of molesting children in numbers far out of proportion to their presence in the general population .
Child sexual abuse has a profound impact on victims and their families .
Because we want to protect our children , we must ask :
Are gays disproportionately abusing children ?

Back : Common Theist Arguments
The argument from design , also known as the Teleological Argument , claims that every creation requires a creator .
The more dramatic or complex ( or least understood , a scientist might say ) the more likely this is evidence of some supernatural designer , so say theists .
The problem with this argument is that it is basically playing God of the gaps and reasoning that since we do n't understand how complicated things can form , Godidit !.
Since we see some complex designs that we know were created by man , theists argue other complex designs must also have a creator .
History
The argument from design has been used for millenia , and is probably one of the main origins of religion .
It was codified in Aquinas ' Quinque viae as one - or perhaps three - of the ' proofs ' .
It was later taken by William Paley and formulated into the Watchmaker argument , affectionately known as the ' Argument from Bananas ' by Internet evolutionists .
Examples
The following is a shortened version of the classic Watchmaker argument by William Paley .
Imagine you 're walking along the beach and you find a watch .
You know there was a watch - maker .
Something so beautiful and functional must have been designed by someone .
Look around at our world , and how exquisite and symbiotic it is .
Surely this is the work of ..
God !
Here , Ray Comfort demonstrates a classic example of the Argument From Design as well as Argument from improbability utilizing a coke can and a painting :
Problems with the Argument from design
" Every creation needs a creator " does not reconcile with reality .
Is there a " rainbow factory ? "
Our improved knowledge of science continues to explain what was previously unknown , and we have natural explanations for things previously attributed to the supernatural .
Life reproduces and mutates by itself .
The same can not be said of an inanimate object like a watch .
This introduces an uneasy complexity to any discussion about Creation , and can lead a theist to put forward the deist position : that the universe was set in motion by a creator and left to run without further interference .
Supposing every creation needed a creator , then Who created god ?
You can't have it both ways .
If complexity is a sign of intelligent design , surely god is the most complex entity of them all , and thus requires a designer himself .
Introducing god as a cause merely creates more questions and is not an acceptable solution .
Note , that this often leads to Special Pleading , where the theist attempts to exempt his god from this rule .
Who created the creator ?
Nobody .
What was before the " Big Bang ? " -
This double standard negates any logic the theist may employ to claim to prove god exists .
When pressed on this issue , many theists turn into amateur theoretical physicists or cosmologists and start picking - and - choosing little pieces of scientific gobbly - gook to justify their contention that god is the beginning .
A favorite argument involves referencing parts of big bang or quantum theory involving some theory of the " creation " of the universe or something outside of " time . "
The problem is , theists have no idea what they 're talking about and cannot explain how such concepts work .
They take snippets of scientific theory out of context and try to shoehorn them into their preconceived notion that Godidit !.
There 's an entire movie that rides on this goofy construct called What the bleep do we know ?.
For issues where we know there is a creator even though we have n't seen the item created , there exists empirical evidence to recognize a creator existed .
Theists often argue , How do you know Shakespeare or Socrates was real if he supposedly died years before you were born ?
We know because we have hard evidence of his existence and contemporaneous reports of him and his accomplishments .
There is not nearly as convincing evidence of the same degree for god .
The scientific method also helps explain how this argument is false .
During our lifetime we observe that paintings come from painters , therefore we know all paintings come from painters .
If we grew up never having seen or been told that paintings come from painters , we might assume otherwise .
But we do not observe any evidence of a higher power creating life , earth , etc .
However , by examining our world and environment , we can find evidence to indicate how life , earth , etc. could have come about .
If we are so " perfectly suited " to our environment that we must have been specifically designed by a creator , how come there are so many defective parts ?
Human beings have a broken gene when it comes to being able to produce vitamin C Wisdom teeth , tonsils , and prostate glands are problematic and often cause further harm
There are numerous other vestiges and organs that are badly designed or obsolete
The human skeletal structure is not at all ' perfectly ' suited to an upright walking animal , leading to widespread back , hip knee and foot problems .
The sheer volume ( approx . 80 % ) of ' junk DNA ' in our genome indicates the evolutionary false starts our ancestors experienced .
There are four fundamental forces .
Gravity , the weak nuclear force , the strong nuclear force , and Electromagnetism .
Interestingly there is an article that disproves that we need the weak force at all , in fact with or without it the universe would remain pretty much the same .
For more details : slac.stanford.edu/cgi-wrap/getdoc/slac-pub-11795.pdf another force is gravity , however at the microscopic scale ( Quantum Physics ) no calculations of Gravity are needed at all .
Gravity is a very weak force , in fact gravity is a thousand billion billion billion billion times weaker than the EM force .
And in the field of chemistry known as molecular dynamics Gravity is irrelevant , although it has simulations that are routinely used and are useful for the interpretation of experimental results and predictions of microscopic behavior
This claim ignores the huge size of the Universe and that it is in fact much better at being a black hole generator than for life&humans :
life ( on earth ) : 75km^3
earth : 1 trillion km^3
By volume the earth is 1/1000000000 % is life .
That 's design ? , it 's just the Earth and we are already insignificant .
Yet it gets better , the volume between us and the nearest galaxy is 10^58 km ^ 3 .
ie what the creationists are really saying is that 1/1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 means that this world is fine tuned for a certain object .
It 's like taking a million earths and finding a single land atom on one of them and then concluding they we are specifically made for that atom .

I hate speed bumps .
Even a normal speeds , they always make me spill whatever I am drinking ...
I would like to propose the following solution ; a custard - filled , speed - sensitive speed bump .
This bump would allow safe passage to all law - abiding vehicles .
However , when a fast moving vehicle hits the bump , the magical properties of custard spring into life .
Custard contains finely ground cornflour and is a ' dilatant ' mixture , changing from liquid to solid when pressure is applied .
Thus , a benign , rather flaccid bump encountered at low speeds becomes an unforgiving , hardened lump when hit at speed .
For blatant speeding > 70 MPH , the hump would burst showering the offending vehicle with incriminating custard .
Military installations , could take a different tack , filling their bumps with custard powder .
This takes advantage of custard 's , better known , explosive properties ...
Researchers use a modified off - the - shelf tattoo gun to increase the effectiveness of DNA vaccines in mice .

The best defense against fast - moving diseases like bird flu may one day be a DNA vaccine tattoo under your skin .
Researchers are experimenting with slightly modified tattoo guns to deliver DNA vaccines – a potent form of vaccine that is easily engineered in vast quantities to protect against diseases like flu , HIV and malaria .
DNA vaccines are not new , but scientists have struggled to devise an effective way to get them into the body .
The tattoo gun , which implants the DNA vaccine as " ink " under the surface of the skin , could prove the ideal delivery mechanism , making DNA vaccines viable for the first time .
" Tattooing could lead to more commercial uses of DNA vaccines , " said Martin Müller , a researcher at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg , who devised the method .
DNA vaccines have long promised " programmable " vaccines that can be quickly genetically engineered to mimic any emerging virus and grown quickly inside bacteria .
But unlike the disarmed viruses used in standard vaccines , DNA injected into the body does n't naturally give rise to immunity .
But Müller claims his technique does the trick , getting an immune system response comparable to regular vaccines .
" We get about 200 - fold higher responses compared to conventional injection ( of a DNA vaccine ) , " he said .
Using a modified tattoo gun , Müller tattooed mice with DNA programmed to create human papillomavirus proteins , which generated high levels of antibodies and white blood cells tuned to those antigens .
But the technique comes at a cost – pain – that could limit its application .
And there 's no easy way around it because the injury associated with tattooing , Mülller said , is likely a key ingredient in generating an effective immune response .
The trauma is probably required , he said , because the disturbance to the skin naturally draws extra immune system cells to the area .
The increased number of cells encountering the viral proteins provokes a more potent immune system response .
Standard vaccines are made of disarmed versions of viruses that are often grown inside chicken eggs .
DNA vaccines are a simpler version , made of just the virus ' genes placed into a circular DNA structure called a plasmid , then grown in bacteria .
The technique makes producing commercial quantities of DNA vaccines much faster than current vaccine technologies .
" It 's possible to make huge quantities of plasmid DNA , " said Bob Belshe , director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Saint Louis University .
Once injected into the patient 's body , the plasmids enter cells and begin to produce proteins , which generate an immune response .
The immune response is more complete with DNA vaccines than with standard vaccines because they also stimulate the production of killer T cells , which are important in controlling some types of infection , Belshe said .
However , Belshe pointed out that vaccine - making can take several decades .
" It 's an exciting technology with a ways to go , " he said .
DNA vaccines have rekindled interest in developing new vaccines , which traditionally have not been lucrative .
In late 2006 , Pfizer bought DNA vaccine company PowerMed for its needleless injection techniques .
With interest in DNA vaccines growing , the German group is not alone in looking into tattooing as a means of vaccine delivery .
A Danish team led by Adriaan Bins also published a paper on the technique in Nature Medicine .
Müller 's team used an off - the - shelf tattoo gun ( sans colored ink ) for their work , which is published online in the open- access journal , Genetic Vaccines and Therapy .

Ask any Dublin Dr Pepper bootlegger what the fuss is all about .
They 'll tell you that the top - shelf , premier cru of Texas soda pop is selling for eight bucks a six - pack in some stores — when you can find it .
Back in the 1970s , when soft drink bottlers across the country began sweetening their sodas with high - fructose corn syrup , the oldest Dr Pepper bottling plant , which is located in Dublin , about 20 miles south of Stephenville , refused to make the switch .
Each bottle of Dublin Dr Pepper proudly bears the logo of Imperial Pure Cane Sugar .
But under their franchise agreement , the Dublin plant is only authorized to supply stores in the 40 - square - mile area between Stephenville and Hico .
The loophole is that individuals who visit the plant are allowed to purchase up to 20 cases for their private use .
So diehards who are fixated on the flavor of old - fashioned cane sugar - sweetened Dr Pepper drive to Dublin to pick up their fix .
Info Dublin Dr Pepper
If driving across the state for soft drinks sounds a little obsessive , you need to consider how important a role Dr Pepper plays in some people 's lives .
In cold climates , coffee is the favored caffeine delivery system , and when people talk about being addicted to the stuff , they are n't kidding .
Caffeine is habit - forming , regardless of how you imbibe it .
In the warmer climate of the South , the bottomless iced tea glass is taken for granted at restaurants .
But for other Southerners , the caffeinated beverage of choice is a carbonated soft drink — Coca - Cola in Georgia and Dr Pepper in Texas .
Roughly speaking , a 20 - ounce bottle of Coke or Dr Pepper contains as much caffeine as a five - ounce cup of coffee .
Of course , some people drink Dr Pepper by the liter .
" It 's an addiction , " says Houston journalist Bobette Riner , who grew up drinking Dr Pepper in West Texas .
She says she tries to keep her habit under control by only drinking two a day .
But she is a discerning consumer .
Just as Starbucks fans turn up their nose at inferior coffee , Riner prefers the taste of Dublin Dr Pepper to the " nasty corn syrup flavor " of the conventional stuff .
She picks some up when she travels north to visit her family .
Riner sometimes shares a few bottles from her private stash when she needs a favor from the Dr Pepper - obsessed computer guys at work , where the soft drink is referred to as " crack . "
One IT guy decorated his office with empty Dr Pepper bottles , Riner said .
The computer guys have reported having problems when they tried to quit drinking the stuff .
( Yes , there are several Dr Pepper addiction support groups . )
Since the demand for Dublin Dr Pepper exceeds the supply , a thriving black market has sprung up .
Driving around the state this spring , I noticed little paper signs in the front windows of small - town drugstores and mom-and - pop restaurants advertising the availability of Dublin Dr Pepper .
I never really gave much thought to where they were getting the stuff .
That 's where the bootleggers come in .
At a cooking demonstration I gave this spring at the Dallas Museum of Art , I told the audience that the Dr Pepper - ­marinated tenderloin recipe that I included in my The Texas Cowboy Cookbook worked a lot better if you used Dublin Dr Pepper .
The cane sugar caramelizes better on the grill .
After the event , a bootlegger introduced herself .
The wisecracking lady said she kept a group of small shops in her Dallas suburb supplied .
It was all very hush - hush , because the bootleggers are going around the distribution rules of the bottling franchise .
Each franchisee is supposed to supply its own area .
I was fascinated : Smuggling addictive soft drinks across county lines is the sort of aberrant behavior I have dedicated my life to investigating .
_____________________
It cost six bucks to get into the Dr Pepper Museum in downtown Waco .
The first floor was devoted to historical information about the invention and early days of bottling and distributing the product .
There was an eerie talking dummy that was supposed to look like the German pharmacist named Charles Alderton , who formulated Dr Pepper at the soda fountain of Waco 's Old Corner Drug store in 1885 , one year before Coca - Cola was invented .
His formula is alleged to contain 23 flavors , including natural fruit and spice essences , though the company is notoriously secretive about the actual ingredients ( except to say that prune juice is not among them ) .
Alderton 's customers called the drink a " Waco " soda , and it became quite popular at the soda fountain .
The pharmacist gave the recipe to the owner of the drugstore , Wade Morrison , and the base syrup began to be made in larger quantities .
When he began marketing the syrup to area drugstores , Morrison renamed the drink after Dr. Charles T. Pepper of Virginia .
Some versions of the story say the real Dr. Pepper was Morrison 's girlfriend 's father ; others say he was a former employer .
If such details matter to you , there 's a Web site you can visit where the Dr Pepper catechism is carefully parsed by a fanatic named Christopher Flaherty on his Web site , Dr Pepper FAQ .
You will also find stories there connecting Dr Pepper to various conspiracy theories .
Lee Harvey Oswald was evidently a Dr Pepper lover .
The upper floor of the Dr Pepper Museum holds a lot of advertising materials .
I sang along silently as I read the words to the " I 'm a pepper , you 're a pepper , " jingle .
And I dimly recalled the 10 - 2 - 4 campaign , which advocated the consumption of three Dr Peppers a day , at 10 a.m. , 2 p.m. and 4 p.m .
But I had never heard the oldest Dr Pepper slogan : " Drink a bite to eat . "
I also learned that the period in Dr. was dropped from the name in a logo redesign in the 1950s .
With oil reaching $ 135 / barrel , Oil Drum readership exceeding 30,000 unique visitors per day and many wild stories circulating in the MSM as to why oil prices are so high this post strives to explain why oil prices are rising exponentially :
Production and demand
The most significant feature of the chart up top is the dog leg in production growth in 2004 .
Prior to then the flow of new oil field projects combined with increasing utilisation of spare capacity allowed global oil production to grow and to meet much of the growth in demand .
In 2004 , OPEC spare capacity fell close to zero ( see below ) and the world struggled for a number of reasons to bring on new supply to compensate for decline ( see below ) .
The slowing of production growth has meant new supplies are insufficient to meet growing demand and the price has gone up to balance the books .
Higher prices stimulate conservation that may take the form of fuel efficiency ( driving a smaller car ) or abstinence ( poor people being priced out of the energy market ) .
Every year a large number of new oil fields are brought on line .
However , this does not directly translate to growth in supplies since amongst other things the production decline in existing fields needs to be replaced first :
new annual production capacity = consumption growth + annual decline + spare capacity growth
Decline
All oil wells , oil fields and oil provinces are exposed to a phenomenon called decline .
Producing oil depressurises the sub - surface reservoirs and uses up the reserves .
With time the proportion of water to oil that is produced in any well increases ( increasing water cut ) and this combined with depressurisation leads to declining oil flow rates .
Combined , these processes result in naturally declining production .
It has been estimated that the global average decline rate is 4.5 % per annum .
( personal communication , Peter Jackson , CERA ) .
What this means is that every year the global oil industry must bring on stream 3.8 million barrels per day new production just to compensate for decline ( 4.5 % of 85 mmbpd ) .
If less than 3.8 million bpd are commissioned then global oil production will fall and vice versa .
The higher global oil production rises , so rises the amount of new annual capacity required to compensate for decline .
As global oil production has risen , the annual new capacity required to offset decline has gone up too .
Bearing in mind that all the best fields have already been produced , annual decline must be offset using second and third class oil fields .
This task eventually becomes impossible and a production plateau is attained .
That is where we are right now .
Net energy and energy density
The world has already used up a large proportion of its best oil reserves .
These are the light sweet crude oil reserves produced on shore from first class reservoirs .
The proportion of low ERoEI liquids and low energy density liquids is growing exponentially .
Source EIA and Oil Watch Monthly .
This chart shows that a growing proportion of world total liquid fuels production comprises second generation liquids - e.g. natural gas liquids , syncrude from tar sands and biofuels ..
These are essentially synthetic liquids that need to be created and the process of creation uses energy .
The term used to describe this concept is Energy Return on Energy Invested ( ERoEI ) and while historic oil production may have had large ERoEI numbers greater than 100 , these synthetic liquids have low ERoEI .
Around 1.2 in the case of temperate latitude ethanol and 5.0 in the case of syncrude produced from tar sand .
The main point is that a steadily growing proportion of the global total liquids production is being used to produce these liquids leaving less for society to use than the bare figures may suggest .
ERoEI = ( energy contained in fuel ) / ( energy used to produce fuel )
When the energy used to produce a fuel is larger than the fuel itself contains the ERoEI will be less than 1 and the whole exercise is rather pointless apart from in exceptional circumstances where energy quality is very important , e.g. in food production .
A second and equally serious issue lies in the energy density of the new liquids being produced .
In energy terms , 1 barrel of ethanol or a barrel of liquefied natural gas is not the same as a barrel of crude oil .
The latter contains significantly more energy .
Hence measuring energy production by the volumes produced ( barrels ) is misleading and presents an over - optimistic picture .
As a rough approximation , the energy equivalence by volume of ethanol and LNG are as follows :
1 barrel of ethanol = 0.61 barrels of crude oil
1 barrel of LNG = 0.73 barrels of crude oil
In summary , the picture of rising liquids volume production up top is deceptive .
With the passage of time the energy content of those liquids is falling steadily and the amount of energy used to produce them is rising .
This means less energy for society to use at a higher cost .
31.8 billion barrels per year
The world now consumes 31.8 billion barrels of oil per year .
1978 was the last year that this volume of oil was discovered and more recently discovery has been running at less than 10 billion barrels per year .
It is an utterly forlorn hope that exploration and new discoveries may alleviate the current supply crisis .
Mega projects
The inventory of past discoveries has not yet been used up and a list of new oil mega- projects first complied by Chris Skrebowski has been expanded and maintained by The OIl Drum in Wiki format .
Global crude + condensate + NGL + syncrude scenario based on TOD mega - projects database as of 27 May 2008 .
This is not a definitive forecast since there is uncertainty over decline rate , project slippage and there is no allowance made for small projects .
Beyond 2012 there is a planning horizon for projects and so beyond that date is pure speculation based on 10 % per annum decline in new production capacity - and this may contribute to the apparent peak at that time .
The 4.5 % per annum decline rate is based on a personal communication with Peter Jackson ( CERA ) who conducted a comprehensive study of oil field decline last year .
This decline is applied also to new production .
At face value , these mega - projects should be sufficient to ensure some production growth in the coming years .
However , the pattern of recent years has been project slippage owing to global shortages of materials , manpower and rampant oil service sector inflation .
The pattern of slippage may continue and the promise of an increase in new supplies may remain just that – a promise .
Spare production capacity and OPEC
It is a feature of natural resource depletion that there is either a glut or a shortage .
Managing this during the early years of resource exploitation causes all sorts of problems .
On planet Earth we need to be thankful to OPEC for trying to manage this problem via their production - sharing cartel .
For much of the period since OPEC formed in 1960 , the world had excess productive capacity , i.e. production potential was higher than was utilised .
Withholding this reserve capacity helped bolster prices and reduce demand .
But with erratic additions of non-OPEC supply and a tendency for certain OPEC members to cheat on their quota , oil prices tended to swing in an unpredictable manner through the period 1960 to 2000 .
Since 2000 this situation has changed .
Global demand for oil has continued to increase and to meet this demand much of the OPEC spare capacity has been switched on so that all but Saudi Arabia are now producing flat out .
Global spare production capacity from this presentation by Lawrence Eagles of the IEA ( link lost ) .
Note how 8 mmbpd spare capacity in 2002 had all but disappeared by 2004 .
It has since then grown slightly but is once again in decline .
This more detailed and up - to - date picture from Rembrandt Koppelaar 's excellent May edition of oil watch monthly shows spare capacity in sharp decline .
Despite a healthy inventory of mega - projects , the world is quite simply not managing to bring on new supply fast enough to compensate for decline .
In order to grow spare capacity , the world each year must commission new capacity to compensate for decline and to accommodate increased demand :
spare capacity growth = new annual production capacity - ( annual decline + consumption growth )
As demand continues to rise against static supply , the only solution is for prices to rise and to price poor people out of the oil consuming economy .
Much of the spare capacity held in Saudi Arabia is heavy sour crude oil and the world currently lacks capacity in specialised refineries to handle this crude .
Peak exports
Another important concept is to consider is oil exports as described here by Westexas and Khebab .
Oil exporting countries have increasing wealth and are attracting massive inward investment and migration resulting in steadily rising oil consumption .
Indonesia provides a classic example of a former export land whose rising consumption has totally consumed their oil exports .
Indonesia , once part of the oil supply solution has become part of the oil demand problem and has just left OPEC .
Rising demand and falling production has totally consumed Indonesia 's oil exports in the space of 40 years .
Indonesia 's passion for bio-fuels is explained by this chart .
In 2006 Luis de Sousa produced this analysis of global oil exports .
Those seeking an explanation for why oil now costs over $ 120 per barrel need look no further than this chart .
Luis de Sousa 's analysis of net oil exports shows a peak in global oil exports in 2004 / 5 followed by a period of gradual decline until 2010 .
Net export decline then accelerates .
If this analysis is correct then the current oil price / oil supply crisis will shortly get much worse .
However , note that 4 important exporting countries - Iraq , Nigeria , Azebaijan and Kazakhstan - are not yet included in this analysis .
Oil is still cheap
At $ 2 per liter bottled spring water costs $ 318 per barrel .
Subsidies and taxation distort the market
Oil is still very cheap .
Bottled spring water at $ 2 per litre works out at $ 318 per barrel .
Oil is fundamental to our lives for transportation and a myriad products ranging from plastic to pesticides .
Unlike spring water , oil is finite and costs significantly more to find and produce .
The price of oil will continue to rise until the world as a whole decides it can do with less or until meaningful volumes of energy substitution take root .
Many of the world ’s oil consumers do not pay the market price paid by the OECD .
In Russia , the Middle East and China and many other countries oil and gasoline prices are subsidised .
So the thirst of those consumers is not abated by current high spot price .
Taxation in Europe and Japan also de-gears the impact of high oil price in those regions where high tax means that gasoline is already expensive .
The impact of rising prices is felt less in these countries - though it is now beginning to bite .
Secondary factors and excuses
There are a range of secondary factors impacting the day to day fluctuations in oil price such as :
Speculation
Political unrest in producing countries
The depreciation of the $ US
Prime exploration acreage that is off limits to OECD corporations
Speculation
Financial speculation in oil futures is being offered increasingly as the reason for high oil prices .
True , speculation is rife .
However , the futures market is a zero sum game .
For every long position there is a short position and the price is ultimately struck by the individual who takes delivery of the oil - which is then refined and purchased by a consumer .
For so long as consumers keep demanding oil at ever higher prices , the price will continue to rise .
The only way speculation could impact the oil price is under accumulation .
Inventories of crude oil and refined products have been falling for a year ( see figures 14 to 17 ) .
Political unrest
True , political unrest in exporting countries such as Iraq and Nigeria means that less oil is being produced .
But this situation has prevailed for many years now and is likely to get worse as energy poverty begins to bite .
The depreciation of the $ US
True , the depreciation of the US $ has contributed to the rise in oil prices .
But the oil price has risen in € too .
Off limits exploration
True , there are vast tracts of the USA that are under - explored in the ANWR and off the east and west coasts where the US has placed a high price on protecting their own environment .
But it is not true that the Middle East and Russia are under - explored and that greater access to these areas by OECD companies would transform the current situation .
In summary these secondary factors touted by the MSM , politicians and oil companies are nothing more than an excuse and a distraction from the core problem which is demand growth running ahead of supply growth for over three years now .
If the USA , Russia or Saudi Arabia could turn on the taps and produce an additional 3 mmbpd , the oil price would fall tomorrow .
But they can't and the only way the oil price will come down is by reduced demand brought about by pricing poor people out of the energy market and by deepening recession .
Conclusion
We are now in the early stages of a full blown energy crisis that was predictable if not wholly avoidable .
Politicians are awaking to the crisis now that escalating energy costs make its existence plain to see .
It is highly unlikely that politicians will now grasp the gravity of the situation that the OECD and rest of the world faces and the responses will likely be ineffectual and too little too late .
The principal reason for current high oil price is the proximity of a peak in global oil production .
Politicians must understand this and then grasp that natural gas and coal supplies will follow oil down by mid century .
Reducing taxes on energy consumption right now is the wrong thing to do .
Taxation structure needs to be adjusted to oblige energy producing companies to re-invest wind fall profits in alternative energy sources on a truly massive scale .
Energy efficiency should be the guiding beacon of all policy decisions and this must apply equally to energy production and energy consumption .

It may not have been the first time that she said it on the campaign trail , but Hillary Clinton ’s remark about staying in the race because Barack Obama could be assassinated like Robert F. Kennedy was in 1968 was wrong on many different levels .
In a meeting with editorial board of the Sioux Falls Argus - Leader , Clinton was asked if she bought the argument of many people in the Democratic Party that she should get out of the race in the name of party unity .
“ My husband did not wrap up the nomination in 1992 until he won the California primary somewhere in the middle of June , right ?
We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California .
I do n’t understand it .
There ’s lots of speculation about why it is , ” Clinton answered .
The first level of wrong in Clinton ’s statement is her comparison with her husband .
If I remember 1992 correctly , Bill Clinton was the delegate leader .
He was not the person in second place who stayed in the race , even though he trailed in delegates and had no chance of catching up .
Her comparison to 1992 is completely bogus .

The second level of wrong was bringing up the RFK assassination on the same week that Ted Kennedy was diagnosed with brain cancer .
At least Clinton apologized for that , “ The Kennedys have been much on my mind the last days because of Senator Kennedy and I regret that if my referencing that moment of trauma for our entire nation , and particularly for the Kennedy family was in any way offensive .
I certainly had no intention of that , whatsoever . ”
The third , and most important , level of wrong is the idea that she needs to stay in the race in case somebody kills Barack Obama .
Being that Obama is the first African - American presidential candidate to be poised to become the nominee from a major party , this is a very touchy subject .
Clinton ’s remark was demeaning to the American people by saying in effect , that she better stand by , and be ready in case somebody takes a shot at the black guy .
She is implying her belief that America is n’t ready for a black president .
She should apologize to both Obama and the American people for thinking so little of both of them .
There are a lot of fair reasons that Hillary Clinton could have cited for staying in this race until the end .
She could have said something like she feels that she owes it to the millions of people who voted for her to stay in the race until the end .
She could have even said that sometimes things happen in long primary seasons so she wants to stick around until the Party has a nominee , but instead she chose to make a remark that revealed a great deal about the way she views the world .
The one element of Hillary Clinton that turned a lot of Democrats off was that she tends to view the political spectrum in negative terms .
This is why she was never able to offer Democratic voters a message of hope .
Hillary Clinton is a tactical politician who along with her husband has always had success by running on negativity .
The Bush / Cheney years have been negative to the extreme .
Americans were ready for a positive message , but Hillary Clinton is hard wired to negative campaign , and this reason maybe more than any other is why Barack Obama will be the Democratic nominee .

Here ’s some black history you never heard about in school .
Many of the great African - American leaders of the early 20th century were not religious people !
This was surprising to me when I heard it considering the level of religiosity you see in the black community now .
Mike Estes , a wonderful speaker , goes into detail about this history using the leaders ’ own words and writings in this episode ( mp3 ) of the Infidel Guy radio show .
Go listen !

WATFORD ( Reuters ) - Centre - left leaders from around the world called on Saturday for urgent reform of global financial institutions to prevent a recurrence of the credit crisis .

About a dozen leaders , brought together by Prime Minister Gordon Brown , issued a communique urging the International Monetary Fund to help develop an effective early warning system to guard against financial risks to the global economy .
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said the world had to learn the lessons from the credit crisis , sparked eight months ago by massive default on U.S. sub -prime mortgage debt .
“ Too often in the past when these sorts of events have occurred ... the lessons are lost .
The lessons must be learned and applied , otherwise we will face a very rocky future indeed , ” Rudd told a news conference after the “ Progressive Governance ” conference outside London .
The leaders , also including South African President Thabo Mbeki , New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark and Austrian Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer , gathered just before key Group of Seven and IMF meetings in Washington next week which will discuss the financial turbulence .
Also attending were the heads of the IMF , World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) , the African Development Bank and several U.N. agencies .
The leaders heard a gloomy economic update from IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss - Kahn , who said most of the downside risks to the world economy feared six months ago had now become a reality .
“ The forecasts we are going to release in a few days are not really improving , ” Strauss - Kahn said .
DARKER OUTLOOK
The IMF is due to release its twice - yearly World Economic Outlook next week .
Earlier in the week , the IMF cut its 2008 outlook for world economic growth for the second time this year -- a move that acknowledged housing and credit problems in the United States were exacting a heavy toll on the global economy .
The IMF now expects global growth to slow to 3.7 percent this year , down from its January forecast of 4.1 percent .
Brown said there was general agreement among the leaders on the need for new rules for disclosure and transparency for financial institutions .
Brown is pressing for global , rather than national supervision of financial markets and for banks to come clean on the losses they have suffered due to the sub - prime crisis .
Developing country leaders said rising food and energy prices were hitting poor countries hard .
Donald Kaberuka , president of the African Development Bank , warned that many African governments were straining their budgets by handing out food subsidies to help their populations cope with rising prices .
One bright spot was talk of improving prospects for a breakthrough in the long - running talks on world trade liberalisation .
WTO chief Pascal Lamy said the Doha round of talks were “ inevitably long and complex ” .
“ My feeling is that we are now reaching a stage where it ( an agreement ) could happen , ” he said .

My Addiction
It started out innocently enough .
I began to think at parties now and then to loosen up .
Inevitably though , one thought led to another , and soon I was more than just a social thinker .
I began to think alone - " to relax , " I told myself - but I knew it was n't true .
Thinking became more and more important to me , and finally I was thinking all the time .
I began to think on the job .
I knew that thinking and employment do n't mix , but I could n't stop myself .
I began to avoid friends at lunchtime so I could read Thoreau and Kafka .
I would return to the office dizzied and confused , asking , " What is it exactly we are doing here ? "
Things were n't going so great at home either .
One evening I had turned off the TV and asked my wife about the meaning of life .
She spent that night at her mother's .
I soon had a reputation as a heavy thinker .
One day the boss called me in .
He said , " Skippy , I like you , and it hurts me to say this , but your thinking has become a real problem .
If you do n't stop thinking on the job , you 'll have to find another job . "
This gave me a lot to think about .
I came home early after my conversation with the boss .
" Honey , " I confessed , " I 've been thinking ... "
" I know you 've been thinking , " she said , " and I want a divorce ! "
" But Honey , surely it 's not that serious . "
" It is serious , " she said , lower lip aquiver .
" You think as much as college professors , and college professors do n't make any money , so if you keep on thinking we wo n't have any money ! "
" That 's a faulty syllogism , " I said impatiently , and she began to cry .
I 'd had enough .
" I 'm going to the library , " I snarled as I stomped out the door .
I headed for the library , in the mood for some Nietzsche , with a PBS station on the radio .
I roared into the parking lot and ran up to the big glass doors ... they did n't open .
The library was closed .
To this day , I believe that a Higher Power was looking out for me that night .
As I sank to the ground clawing at the unfeeling glass , whimpering for Zarathustra , a poster caught my eye .
" Friend , is heavy thinking ruining your life ? " it asked .
You probably recognize that line .
It comes from the standard Thinker 's Anonymous poster .
Which is why I am what I am today : a recovering thinker .
I never miss a TA meeting .
At each meeting we watch a non-educational video ; last week it was " Porky's . "
Then we share experiences about how we avoided thinking since the last meeting .
I still have my job , and things are a lot better at home .
Life just seemed ... easier , somehow , as soon as I stopped thinking .

Cheney Aide Subpoenaed to Testify to Congress
Reuters
Washington – U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney ’s chief of staff was subpoenaed on Wednesday to testify in a congressional probe of the administrations treatment and possible torture of enemy combatants .
House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , a Michigan Democrat , issued the subpoena to David Addington a day after it was authorized by a House panel .
The administration contends its aides can not be forced to testify .
But Addington has indicated he may do so if subpoenaed , congressional staffers said .
Megan Mitchell , spokeswoman for the vice president 's office , said , " I can confirm that we have received the subpoena .
We are reviewing it and will respond accordingly . "
The subpoena orders Addington to appear on June 26 before the House Judiciary 's subcommittee on the Constitution , Civil Rights and Civil Liberties , which is examining the administration 's treatment of detainees .
Addington reportedly played a key role in drafting U.S. strategies to combat terrorism after the September 11 attacks on the United States .
Bush maintains the United States does not torture , but he has refused to discuss interrogation techniques , saying he does not want to tip off the enemy .
The CIA has acknowledged using a simulated drowning technique known as waterboarding on three terrorism suspects , but says it stopped using that method in 2003 .
Waterboarding has been condemned by human rights groups , foreign countries and many U.S. lawmakers as torture .
Former Attorney General John Ashcroft and John Yoo , a former deputy assistant attorney general , have agreed to testify before the Judiciary subcommittee .
Bush has invoked executive privilege in rejecting congressional subpoenas for a number of current and former aides , many sought in a probe of the firing in 2006 of nine federal prosecutors .
In March , the House Judiciary Committee filed suit in U.S. District Court asking it to direct White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten to produce subpoenaed documents and order former White House counsel Harriet Miers to comply with a subpoena and testify about the ousted prosecutors .
A ruling is not expected for at least several months .

THE mind of the wine consumer is a woolly place , packed with odd and arcane information fascinating to few .
Like the pants pocket of a 7 - year - old boy , it ’s full of bits of string , bottle caps and shiny rocks collected while making the daily rounds of wine shops , restaurants , periodicals and the wine - soaked back alleys of the Internet .
It ’s harmless stuff , really , except to those within earshot when a wine lover finds it necessary to elaborate on the nose , legs and body of a new infatuation .
Yet in recent months American wine drinkers have taken their turn as pop culture ’s punching bags .
In press accounts of two studies on wine psychology , consumers have been portrayed as dupes and twits , subject to the manipulations of marketers , critics and charlatan producers who have cloaked wine in mystique and sham sophistication in hopes of better separating the public from its money .
One of the studies was devised by Robin Goldstein , a food writer , to try to isolate consumers from outside influence so they could simply judge wine by what ’s in the glass .
He had 500 volunteers sample and rate 540 unidentified wines priced from $ 1.50 to $ 150 a bottle .
The results are described in a new book , “ The Wine Trials , ” to be published this month by Fearless Critic Media .
The book wraps the results in a discussion of marketing manipulations and statistical validity , but a brief article in the April 7 issue of Newsweek magazine , naturally , seized on the book ’s populist triumphs : a $ 10 bottle of bubbly from Washington state outscored Dom Pérignon , which sells for $ 150 a bottle , while Two - Buck Chuck , the cheap Charles Shaw California cabernet sauvignon , topped a $ 55 bottle of Napa Valley cabernet .

A coalition of American Muslim groups is demanding that Sen. John McCain stop using the adjective “ Islamic ” to describe terrorists and extremist enemies of the United States .
Muneer Fareed , who heads the Islamic Society of North America ( ISNA ) , told The Washington Times that his group is beginning a campaign to persuade Mr. McCain to rephrase his descriptions of the enemy .
“ We ’ve tried to contact his office , contact his spokesperson to have them rethink word usage that is more acceptable to the Muslim community , ” Mr. Fareed said .
“ If it ’s not our intent to paint everyone with the same brush , then certainly we should think seriously about just characterizing them as criminals , because that is what they are . ”
An aide to Mr. McCain , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee who is counting on his pro-Iraq war stance to attract conservative voters , said the senator from Arizona will not drop the word .
Steve Schmidt , a former Bush White House aide who is now a McCain media strategist , told The Times that the use of the word is appropriate and that the candidate will continue to define the enemy that way .
“ Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda represent a perverted strain of Islam at odds with the great many peaceful Muslims who practice their great faith peacefully , ” Mr. Schmidt said .
“ But the reality is , the hateful ideology which underpins bin Ladenism is properly described as radical Islamic extremism .
Senator McCain refers to it that way because that is what it is . ”
Mr. McCain often uses the term “ Islamic ” to describe terrorist enemies .
The two remaining Democrats in the presidential field , Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York , generally shun such word usage .
President Bush also avoids the term , prompting criticism from some conservative pundits , who say the White - House - coined phrase “ war on terror ” does not sufficiently identify the enemy .
Mr. Bush used the term “ Islamic fascists ” several times in 2006 and was criticized by Muslims .
Mr. McCain , an ex-Navy fighter pilot and leading hawk on the Iraq war , regularly uses the term “ Islamic ” in major foreign - policy speeches and in news conferences .
In a speech last month to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council , Mr. McCain said the formation of an international coalition “ will strengthen us to confront the transcendent challenge of our time : the threat of radical Islamic terrorism . ”
In a Republican debate in January , Mr. McCain turned to then - rival Mitt Romney and said , “ I raised it many times , as to whether you have the experience and the judgment to lead this country in the war against radical Islamic extremism . ”
In a July speech to Christians United for Israel , Mr. McCain said , “ Violent Islamic extremists would have us believe that there is only one acceptable religious practice , and that those who diverge from it are not entitled to life or liberty .
They are wrong ; very , very wrong . ”
Mr. Fareed , who is ISNA ’s secretary - general , said such usages are wrong .
“ My own take on this is that we tried and failed to stylize this particular onslaught against the United States as one that has religious connotations and regional connotations , ” said Mr. Fareed , a former associate professor of Islamic studies at Wayne State University .
“ I think this is just criminality , fair and square .
We should just call them criminals .
You want to call them terrorist criminals , fine , ” he said .
“ But adding the word ‘ Muslim ’ or ‘ Islamic ’ certainly does n’t help our cause as Americans .
It ’s counterproductive .
It paints an entire community of believers , 1.2 billion in total , in a very negative way .
And certainly that ’s not something that we want to do . ”
ISNA promotes itself as a voice of moderation that seeks Muslim - Jewish reconciliation and campaigns against what it calls “ Islamophobia . ”
The publication Jewish Week , in an April 2 article , quoted a rabbi as praising ISNA for reaching out to the Jewish community in the United States .
“ They feel strongly it is time to move forward , ” the rabbi said .
Some counterterrorism specialists criticize ISNA for failing to condemn terrorist attacks on Israel .
Steven Emerson , who directs the Investigative Project on Terrorism , recently wrote that the silence of ISNA and other Muslim groups after Hamas killed eight Israeli students “ shows their unwillingness to condemn the terrorist act and its glorification . ”
Michael Ledeen , a terrorism analyst at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research , backed Mr. McCain ’s definition of the enemy .
“ Islamic terrorism is purely descriptive , ” he said .
“ It does n’t group the enemy under the Islamic brush stroke because there are plenty of terrorists and extremists who are not Islamic .
So it ’s just a way of specifying who they are . ”
Of ISNA ’s criticism , Mr. Ledeen said , “ They ’re just silly .
What a silly thing to say .
I talk of Marxist extremists and nationalist extremists .
They just do n’t want people to say there are Islamic terrorists , which there are .
Too bad . ”

0.2.9.0 - July 31th , 2020
We never intended to release a 0.2.9 version , instead the plan was to go directly to 0.4 .
But 0.4 got stalled , badly .
And we had continued improving the source on the 0.2.8 branch little by little .
Then Covid - 19 came around , forcing a lot of people to stay at home , which gave us the motivation to release the game on Steam and itch.io .
That ’s basically why this version exists , so we did not have to publish a 0.2.8.3 based version there .
But of course , we have to make 0.2.9.0 available for everyone .
Enjoy !
Get it from downloads or , if you 're reading this later , the archives .
Major changes since 0.2.8.3 on the game client are better readability for the console output , text input and ingame menu , better initial configuration , keyboard layout reminders and an initial , slightly easier match against an AI .
Major addition on the server are external scripts ; they get fed the ladderlog output and their output is parsed as console input .
The ladderlog output has been expanded to make that feature more useful .
Since these scripts are launched as external processes , they can be written in any language .
We will continue to publish security updates and adaptions to new compilers and Linux versions for the 0.2.8.3 series .
Linux distributions with a focus on feature stability should stick to that for the time being .
We transition softly into a more continuous delivery model with this release , further 0.2.9. X will bring more changes .
PS , August 14th : An update to 0.2.9.0.1 fixes the AppImage for several Linux distributions .
Armagetron Advanced about to hit Steam - July 9th , 2020

Users of 0.2.8.3.3 binary builds do not need to hurry .
0.2.8.3.3 - February 28th , 2015

Let us all hope for 0.4.x .
It 's in the pipeline .
Head over to downloads to get 0.2.8.3.3 in the meantime .

0.2.8.3.2 - New Version ! - September 21st , 2011
Purely fixes for security issues , easy bugs and compilation problems for GCC 4.6 users .
Download Now !
New bots !
- April 1st , 2011
One of the oldest and most annoying features of Armagetron Advanced has been upgraded at last .
The reason why no one really played until there was a master server .
Yes , it 's the bots .
They 've been rewritten , from scratch .
The bots are now powered by a new self - learning algorithm .
As you play against them they learn from their mistakes and grow .
Introducing gLATIS
gLATIS - Learning Artifical Tron Intelligence System .
( The g comes from the class name . )
It describes what it does .
In the situation where the bot dies it records what was around it when it died .
Everytime there after when gLATIS reaches a decision point it compares it to it 's past - or what it 's learned - and makes the decision for the best possible outcome .
If it still dies , well , that 's experience for it !
( Nothing can go wrong . )
Check out this video hilighting gLATIS :
Now head to the forums to discuss !

It 's been recently pointed out that the site here 's a bit out of date generally , and never has much news .
So we 've updated the site , and I 'll point out these two neat things I saw on the forums .
Graphic artist sinewav came up with the rather brilliant idea of dressing out the light cycle as a train engine , and the walls as carriages .
Wrtlprnft added in a floor with tracks , and Jonathan put together a cool video showing it off .
Match Winner ed has also chimed in to show us Armagetron on his homemade retro console .
It looks like it'd be awesome to play .
I wonder if the coin loader works ?
( And is that sombrero standard equipment ? )
Check it out !

Take a couple of dozen Nobel prize winners , an Arab monarch and a famous Jewish writer and Holocaust survivor .
Put them in a beautiful setting , ply them with fine food and magnificent hospitality , organise brainstorming sessions - and you get a memorable opportunity to chew over some of the gravest problems on the planet .
Petra , the Nabataean city " half as old as time , " is the rose - red jewel in the crown of Jordan 's heritage sites - and one of the wonders of the world .
It also hosts an annual conference of Nobel laureates launched by King Abdullah and Elie Wiesel : the big issues being discussed this week included the global food and energy crises , economic development , scientific research and youth empowerment – a hot topic in a region where half the population is under 18 .
Woven into the clubby atmosphere , civilised discussion and endless networking possibilities is the theme of Arab - Jewish and Jordanian - Israeli cooperation - one of the fruits of the peace treaty between these old enemies and neighbours .
Theory and practice do n't always match .
Last year 's conference was dominated by ill - tempered exchanges between Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian president and Israel 's prime minister , Ehud Olmert – and that was before the now - faltering negotiations were launched at Annapolis in November .
The Petra agenda this time was supposed to be strictly non-political .
Laureates as different as the Dalai Lama and Northern Ireland 's David Trimble were on hand to offer leadership and insights .
Yet it still proved impossible to escape the shadow of the conflict across the river Jordan .
Shimon Peres , Israel 's president ( and Nobel peace prizewinner ) , was ambushed at the opening session by Amr Musa , the secretary - general of the Arab League , who questioned whether continuing settlement activity in the West Bank and a refusal to accept the 2002 Arab peace initiative meant that Israel was sincere .
" You are a great speaker , Mr President , " Musa told the veteran Israeli politician , " but please do n't take us for granted . "
Peres retorted that Israel had given Egypt and Jordan " everything " they had wanted in exchange for the peace agreements they had signed - and attacked the Islamists of Hamas for carrying on shooting after Israel withdrew unilaterally from the Gaza Strip three years ago .
The sudden , unscripted spat sent a ripple of unease through the audience , some of whom felt this raw political discord was inappropriate .
Others , including senior Jordanians , welcomed Musa 's acerbic intervention , which made headlines in the Arab and Israeli media .
For the record , King Abdullah also made some anodyne remarks about the urgency of creating a Palestinian state - but diplomatically refrained from criticising Israel .
" It would be a serious mistake to miss the opportunities we have this year to establish , finally , a sovereign , independent and viable Palestinian state along with a secure and recognized Israel , " he warned .
It is a speech he has made many times before .
Palestine just kept coming up : a young Palestinian scientist complained that Israeli settlers in the West Bank consumed four times as much water as their Palestinian neighbours , and pointed to the problems caused by the " apartheid wall " – what the Israelis call their " security barrier " .
In a session on culture another Palestinian insisted it was impossible to keep art and politics separate when living under occupation .
Breakfast for university professors was marred when an Israeli who talked about academic cooperation was rebuffed by an Arab insisting that freedom had to come first .
When it came to energy conservation someone observed that Palestinians wasted vast amounts by being forced to wait at Israeli army checkpoints .
And so it went on .
In a media panel the al - Hayat columnist Jihad al - Khazen brandished the latest casualty figures to demonstrate that Israel was seven times more " terrorist " than the Palestinians .
Several Arabs protested that Israel was not content with occupying Palestinian land but had even appropriated Palestinian food , billing dishes such as hummus , falafel and tabbouleh as " authentically Israeli " .
Leon Wieseltier , a leading American Jewish literary figure , suggested gently that this was in fact an example of the " levantinisation " of Israel – " a way of living in this region . "
Noone responded .
" It reminded me of a couple going through the early stages of divorce proceedings , " mused another participant .
" Every time they began to discuss something one side would start complaining furiously about something unrelated that the other had done . "
It all highlighted the awkward position that Jordan has been in since Abdullah 's father , Hussein ( memorably described by Peres as " his royal shyness " ) made his peace with Israel .
Jordan annexed the West Bank in 1950 , ruled it until the 1967 war but relinquished its claim in 1988 .
The two countries had long been " the best of enemies " in secret but it was only after Yasser Arafat led the PLO into the ill - fated Oslo agreement with Israel that they went public and signed their treaty in 1994 .
Hussein famously wept when Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by an Israeli extremist a year later .
The commitment to dialogue lives on : thus the Petra partnership with Wiesel , whose stock - in - trade is the Nazi Holocaust and human suffering .
The presence of other American Jews and Israelis was on a scale that would be inconceivable in Egypt , which pioneered Arab acceptance of Israel when Anwar Sadat signed his treaty in 1979 .
It is the way of such conferences that the event itself matters more than any outcome – though this year saw the launch of a $ 10 m ( £ 5 m ) Middle East Scientific
Fund to promote graduate research .
The inspiring educational success of the Nobel laureates , argued the king , " is the strongest answer to those who preach destruction , isolation and cynicism . "
Wiesel had the last word : " Whatever brings Palestinians and Israelis together , I am for , " he said .
" Whatever brings Arabs and Jews together , I am for .
I am a matchmaker .
That 's my privilege and my vocation . "
These are noble sentiments but ones that still struggle to overcome the region 's great divide .
You take a deep breath , rub your tired eyes and prepare to push away from your personal computer after a lengthy instant message exchange , video viewing or analysis of your monthly budget — maybe all three .
But before you exit cyberspace , a decision must be made :
Should you shut the machine down , place it into " sleep " mode or do nothing at all ?
How you end a computer session depends on how often you use the computer , your views on energy conservation ( the amount of juice it uses while sitting idle ) , and what you have been told about how your decision will affect your investment 's longevity :
Will frequent starting and stopping cause its circuits to burn out sooner ?
Rest easy , your computer is more likely to be damaged by a virus picked up from the Internet than by being turned off and on too much .
They are also energy efficient :
Such efficiency has reached the point where most PCs place themselves in sleep mode if they remain idle for a certain period of time .
So your PC will likely slip into sleep mode anyway , even if you leave it on overnight .
Sleep mode itself , once a pretty unreliable option — you never knew if you would be able to wake your PC without having to reboot it — has been vastly improved with newer operating systems .
If you want your PC to consume as little energy as possible when not in use , shut it down .
If you want it to consume zero energy , you 're going to have to unplug it .
Your PC can be in only three states : on , sleep or off ( also called standby ) — each of which draws some level of electric current .
A PC that is " on " will either be actively processing information or sitting idle , depending on whether the user is typing a document , reading e-mail or has stepped away briefly .
The amount of wattage drawn when the computer is on varies greatly depending on whether it is a laptop or a desktop PC .
( The latter uses more energy because desktop power supplies are less efficient and require a separate and often larger , power - hungry monitor . )
It also varies based on the type of work being done : Complex calculations requiring intensive processing are more power hungry , whereas writing or Web browsing consume far less electricity .
When a computer goes into sleep mode , it shuts down everything but its random access memory ( RAM ) , a group of memory cells ( which represent bits of data ) that retains short - term data for easy access , thus preserving the computer 's last active state — the running software , used log -ons and other settings — so that the user does not have to reboot when active use resumes .
Sleep mode has gotten a bad rap in the past because , " with Windows operating systems prior to Vista [ which debuted in late January 2007 ] the ' resume from sleep ' mode has not been that reliable , " says Ken Bosley , Hewlett - Packard brand manager for consumer desktop PCs .
" Sometimes the resume fails and you have to reboot anyway . "
" The usability benefits of leaving a desktop on appear to be growing as indicated in our focus groups , " says Glenn Jystad , senior manager for desktop products at PC - maker Gateway , Inc. , which in October 2007 was bought by Taiwan - based computer company Acer , Inc .
" Nevertheless , it is prudent for home owners to manage their PCs power settings so as to not unnecessarily draw too much power and grow their electric bills . "
One trick Microsoft Windows Vista users can try is to select the " balanced " power setting , which causes the PC to go into sleep mode with one hour of nonuse , he adds .
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) confirms that putting desktop PCs in a low - power sleep mode after a period of inactivity can lead to annual energy savings of $ 15 to $ 45 per computer .
The EPA breaks sleep mode down into two categories : " system standby " and " hibernate . "
System standby wakes up faster than hibernate ( five to 10 seconds compared with 20 or more seconds ) but does not save work in the event power is interrupted or lost .
This is because in system standby the PC saves work to RAM , whereas in hibernate it saves to the hard disk , which records data magnetically , thereby retaining it even when the power is cut .
If the EPA 's projected cost savings fail to dazzle , there are other incentives for using computers more efficiently .
The EPA says that PCs adhering to its latest Energy Star specifications are expected to save consumers and businesses more than $ 1.8 billion in energy costs over the next five years and prevent greenhouse gas emissions equal to the annual output of 2.7 million vehicles .
Desktop PCs meet Energy Star qualifications if they use two watts or less of electricity in system standby mode , five watts or less in sleep mode and no more than 60 watts in active mode .
Laptops qualify under Energy Star if they use 0.5 watt or less in standby , five watts or less in sleep and 15 watts or less in active mode .
When it comes to judging whether sleep or standby causes more wear and tear on your computer , pick your poison .
Whereas disk hard drives are most likely to crash during the process of turning off the computer , leaving the PC on causes the microprocessor to generate heat — more heat than if the system is shut down — that will wear down the electronics over time .
" Some components will last longer if you shut down your computer , others won't , " Bosley says .
As a general rule of thumb , he says , most electronics have some failure rate linked to the amount of hours they 're in use .
A few hundred dollars will buy you either a blazing - fast new microprocessor or a spacious , terabyte - size hard drive , so the replacement cost differences are negligible .
Of course , the importance of whether to power down or put your computer to sleep depends a lot on how much you use it .
If you spend 20 minutes each night reviewing your e-mail , it 's a waste of energy to leave your PC on all day .
If you 're continually on your computer , or go back several times a day , it 's best to leave it in sleep mode between sessions .
Another variable is the efficiency of the PC 's processor .
Slower ones use less energy but have to work longer and harder than more powerful CPUs .
" It 's like a car , " Bosley says , " you ca n't talk about gas mileage without talking about the vehicle 's performance . "
Ultimately , if you want to leave your PC on most of the time , your best move is to buy one that meets the EPA 's Energy Star efficiency standards —
Energy Star–approved
PCs consume less than half the amount of energy as products without this designation — and also to make sure your computer defaults into sleep mode if it is inactive for any length of time .
That sort of compromise will make sure your computer is ready for action on a moment 's notice without padding your utility bills .
A new report , Vitamin D Deficiency Puts 40 % of U.S. Infants and Toddlers At Risk , just came out today with surprising , perhaps shocking news .
At least 40 percent of American infants and toddlers are n’t getting enough vitamin D , according to researchers from Children ’s Hospital in Boston .
The study made particular note of the fact that breast feed children may be at a higher risk and recommends both mother and child take vitamin D supplements .
Breast - feeding is a known risk factor for low vitamin D levels in infants , which is why many pediatricians routinely recommend vitamin D supplementation for breast - fed infants .
Other factors that may contribute to low levels of vitamin D include not drinking enough vitamin D - fortified milk ( for toddlers ) , staying out of the sun or using sunscreen .
This may or may not be a good idea .
Perhaps , as Dr. Sears “ humbly suggests ” children should simply spend more time out of doors to benefit from the best possible source of Vitamin D…sunshine .
The study methodology , it turns out , actually would lead me to that conclusion .
The current study included 380 children between 8 and 24 months old .
About 80 percent were from urban areas .
… which , at least in my part of the world means with limited yards , constant traffic and possible predators means … spending a lot of time indoors .
Granted , going outside can be challenging in our large , comfortable homes stuffed with toys and televisions and with the hazards listed above but , fortunately , there are indoor activities that can be moved outdoors easily and give you both time to soak up a few more rays .
1. Story Time – Drag a lawn chair to the front yard or just sit on the stoop to read .
Often you ’ll end up with a gaggle of neighborhood kids eager to listen too .
2 . Nap Time – Bring out the bouncy chair , the exersaucer or baby carrier during nap time .
Put it beside you while you read YOUR book 3 .
Art Time – make like the great masters and pull out the easel and paints .
Let your child paint a landscape or what passes for one .
4 . Messy stuff – now that warmer weather is hear it ’s a great time to do all of those messy things you did n’t want to do in your house all winter – finger paint , blow bubbles , do science experiments or paper mache .
5 . Dig in the dirt – bring out the Hot wheels , the Tonka toys , wooden cars and trucks and find a small patch of dirt .
Make roads .
Bring out some wood and make ramps .
Create a town in miniature .
6 . Bring out a wash tub of water or a baby pool if you have room .
Let everyone get really wet .
7 . Pull out the instruments and have a marching band .
Kids love to march around the neighborhood with whistles and drums or pots and pans .
Give them some silks or hats or dress up items or make some flags with fabric scraps and tomato stakes .
Whatever you do , do it outdoors , maybe not in the hottest part of the day , perhaps in the shade but think about keeping the kids outdoors instead of in this summer .

Councils are clamping down on overfilled bins A father - of - four has been left with a criminal record for overfilling his wheelie bin by four inches .
Gareth Corkhill , 26 , of Whitehaven , Cumbria , received a £ 110 fixed penalty notice after Copeland Council staff photographed his raised bin lid .
When he refused to pay he was taken to court where magistrates added a further £ 115 to the fixed penalty .
Copeland Council has defended its actions and pledged to continue to take action against overfilled wheelie bins .
Mr Corkhill , said : " First I heard of it was from a neighbour who said someone had taken a picture of my wheelie bin , but I thought nothing of it .
Fortnightly collections " Two days later two enforcement officers turn up on my doorstep wearing stab vests , read my rights and then issued me with an on - the - spot fine .
" I recycle and all my boxes are always full . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Mr Corkhill , who shares a house with his partner and three children and also has a child from a previous relationship , said the authority recently switched from weekly to fortnightly refuse collections , but added that the supplied bins were not big enough to cope .
He added : " I could not believe I had been fined for putting rubbish in a bin .
" I tell my kids not to throw rubbish away and always use a bin . "
Whitehaven magistrates convicted Mr Corkhill in his absence of overfilling a receptacle used for waste .
In a statement the council said : " Copeland Borough Council will continue to crack down on the problem of overflowing bins , which cause problems for local residents and in the battle to reduce waste .
" It is important that we all reduce the amount of waste we send to landfill .
" We can do this by recycling more of what is in our bins , and we would advise anyone who has a problem with too much waste to look at what can be recycled . "

The process of normalization often confuses newcomers to digital audio production .
The word itself , “ normalize , ” has various meanings , and this certainly contributes to the confusion .
However , beginners and experts alike are also tripped up by the myths and misinformation that abound on the topic .
I address the 10 most common myths , and the truth behind each , below .
Peak Normalization
First , some background :
While “ normalize ” can mean several things ( see below ) , the myths below primarily involve peak normalization .
Peak normalization is an automated process that changes the level of each sample in a digital audio signal by the same amount , such that the loudest sample reaches a specified level .
Traditionally , the process is used to ensure that the signal peaks at 0dBfs , the loudest level allowed in a digital system .
Normalizing is indistinguishable from moving a volume knob or fader .
The entire signal changes by the same fixed amount , up or down , as required .
But the process is automated :
The digital audio system scans the entire signal to find the loudest peak , then adjusts each sample accordingly .
Some of the myths below reflect nothing more than a misunderstanding of this process .
As usual with common misconceptions , though , some of the myths also stem from a more fundamental misunderstanding – in this case , about sound , mixing , and digital audio .
Myths and misinformation
Myth # 1 : Normalizing makes each track the same volume
Normalizing a set of tracks to a common level ensures only that the loudest peak in each track is the same .
However , our perception of loudness depends on many factors , including sound intensity , duration , and frequency .
While the peak signal level is important , it has no consistent relationship to the overall loudness of a track – think of the cannon blasts in the 1812 Overture .
Myth # 2 : Normalizing makes a track as loud as it can be
Consider these two mp3 files , each normalized to - 3dB :
The second is , by any subjective standard , “ louder ” than the first .
And while the normalized level of the first file obviously depends on a single peak , the snare drum hit at 0:04 , this serves to better illustrate the point :
Our perception of loudness is largely unrelated to the peaks in a track , and much more dependent on the average level throughout the track .
Myth # 3 : Normalizing makes mixing easier
I suspect this myth stems from a desire to remove some mystery from the mixing process .
Especially for beginners , the challenge of learning to mix can seem insurmountable , and the promise of a “ trick ” to simplify the process is compelling .
In this case , unfortunately , there are no short cuts .
A track ’s level pre-fader has no bearing on how that track will sit in a mix .
With the audio files above , for example , the guitar must come down in level at least 12 dB to mix properly with the drums .
Simply put , there is no “ correct ” track volume – let alone a correct track peak level .
Myth # 4 : Normalizing increases ( or decreases ) the dynamic range
A normalized track can sound as though it has more punch .
However , this is an illusion dependent on our tendency to mistake “ louder ” for “ better . ”
By definition , the dynamic range of a recording is the difference between the loudest and softest parts .
Peak normalization affects these equally , and as such leaves the difference between them unchanged .
You can affect a recording ’s dynamics with fader moves & volume automation , or with processors like compressors and limiters .
But a simple volume change that moves everything up or down in level by the same amount does n’t alter the dynamic range .
Myth # 5 : Normalized tracks “ use all the bits ”
With the relationship between bit depth and dynamic range , each bit in a digital audio sample represents 6 dB of dynamic range .
An 8 - bit sample can capture a maximum range of 48 dB between silence and the loudest sound , where a 16 - bit sample can capture a 96 dB range .
In a 16 - bit system , a signal peaking at - 36 d Bfs has a maximum dynamic range of 60dB .
So in effect , this signal does n’t use the top 6 bits of each sample * .
The thinking goes , then , that by normalizing the signal peak to 0dBfs , we “ reclaim ” those bits and make use of the full 96 dB dynamic range .
But as shown above , normalization does n’t affect the dynamic range of a recording .
Normalizing may increase the range of sample values used , but the actual dynamic range of the encoded audio does n’t change .
To the extent it even makes sense to think of a signal in these terms * , normalization only changes which bits are used to represent the signal .
* NOTE : This myth also rests on a fundamental misunderstanding of digital audio , and perhaps binary numbering .
Every sample in a digital ( PCM ) audio stream uses all the bits , all the time .
Some bits may be set to 0 , or “ turned off , ” but they still carry information .
Myth # 6 : Normalizing can’t hurt the audio , so why not just do it ?
Best mixing practices dictate that you never apply processing “ just because . ”
But even setting that aside , there are at least 3 reasons NOT to normalize :
Normalizing raises the signal level , but also raises the noise level .
Louder tracks inevitably mean louder noise .
You can turn the level of a normalized track down to lower the noise , of course , but then why normalize in the first place ?
Louder tracks leave less headroom before clipping occurs .
Tracks that peak near 0dBfs are more likely to clip when processed with EQ and effects .
Normalizing to near 0dbfs can introduce inter sample peaks .
Myth # 7 : One should always normalize
As mixing and recording engineers , “ always ” and “ never ” are the closest we have to dirty words .
Every mixing decision depends on the mix itself , and since every mix is different , no single technique will be correct 100 % of the time .
And so it goes with normalization .
Normalizing has valid applications , but you should decide on a track - by - track basis whether or not the process is required .
Myth # 8 : Normalizing is a complete waste of time .
There are at least 2 instances when your DAW ’s ‘ normalize ’ feature is a great tool :
When a track ’s level is so low that you ca n’t use gain and volume faders to make the track loud enough for your mix .
This points to an issue with the recording , and ideally you ’d re-record the track at a more appropriate level .
But at times when that ’s not possible , normalizing can salvage an otherwise unusable take .
When you explicitly need to set a track ’s peak level without regard to its perceived loudness .
For example , when working with test tones , white noise , and other non-musical content .
You can set the peak level manually – play through the track once , note the peak , and raise the track ’s level accordingly – but the normalize feature does the work for you .
Myth # 9 : Normalizing ensures a track wo n’t clip
A single track normalized to 0dBfs wo n’t clip .
However , that track may be processed or filtered ( e.g. an EQ boost , ) causing it to clip .
And if the track is part of a mix that includes other tracks , all normalized to 0dB , it ’s virtually guaranteed that the sum of all the tracks will exceed the loudest peak in any single track .
In other words , normalizing only protects you against clipping in the simplest possible case .
Myth # 10 : Normalizing requires an extra dithering step
( Note : Please read Adam ’s comment below for a great description of how I oversimplified this myth . )
This last myth is a little esoteric , but it pops up sporadically in online recording discussions .
Usually , in the form of a claim , “ it ’s OK to normalize in 24 bits but not in 16 bits , because … ” followed by an explanation that betrays a misunderstanding of digital audio .
Simply put : A digital system dithers when changing bit depth .
( i.e. Converting from 24 - bits to 16 - bits . )
Normalizing operates independent of bit depth , changing only the level of each sample .
Since no bit -rate conversion takes place , no dithering is required .
Normalizing can mean a few other things .
In the context of mastering an album , engineers often normalize the album ’s tracks to the same level .
This refers to the perceived level , though , as judged by the mastering engineer , and bears no relationship to the peak level of each track .
Some systems ( e.g. Sound Forge ) also offer “ RMS Normalization , ” designed to adjust a track based on its average , rather than peak , level .
This approach closer matches how we interpret loudness .
However , as with peak normalization , it ultimately still requires human judgment to confirm that the change works as intended .

LUXEMBOURG ( Reuters ) – EU states agreed on Friday on tight laws against incitement to terrorism in order to clamp down on militant groups ’ use of the Internet .
EU justice and interior ministers also agreed in Luxembourg on an action plan to try to stop groups getting explosives .
Police say the Internet has taken on huge importance for militants , enabling them to share know - how , plan operations and spread propaganda to a mass audience .
“ The Internet is used to inspire and mobilize local terrorists … functioning as a virtual training camp , ” a text agreed by ministers said .
“ Each member state shall take the necessary measures to ensure that terrorist - linked offences include … public provocation to commit a terrorist offence , recruitment for terrorism , training for terrorism . ”

Nepali police have been quick to quash anti-China protests
Nepal says it is prepared to use force - including gunfire - to prevent anti-Beijing protests during the Olympic torch relay up Mount Everest .
The torch is scheduled to be brought up the peak from the northern , Chinese Tibetan side in early May .
Nepal is determined to prevent protests which may damage relations with China , says the BBC's Charles Haviland in Kathmandu .
The torch has attracted protests in some cities on the relay route .
The Olympic Torch is not being taken anywhere near the Nepalese base camp .
But Nepal 's military and police have been deployed in extra numbers on the southern flank of the mountain because of sensitivities over the torch .
Nepal does not want to alienate China , one of its two neighbours and a country it depends on for foreign aid and diplomatic support , reports our correspondent .
Climbers watched A home ministry spokesman , Mod Raj Dotel , told the BBC that extra members of the army and police were to build a special checkpoint well above Everest Base Camp , at an altitude of about 6,700 m ( 22,000 feet ) , to monitor all teams climbing the mountain .
He said authorities would initially attempt to negotiate an end to any attempts to use violent means to pursue what he called " anti-Chinese activities " .
But he said that if this failed , force could be used , including gunfire .
Mr Dotel said similar measures might even be taken at base camp , which is also accessible to amateur trekkers .
This season the government liaison officers who accompany each climbing team are members of the army or police .
No teams will be allowed to camp above 7,500 m between 1 May and 10 May .
That means climbers , including the British adventurer Sir Ranulph Fiennes , will probably wait out the time at base camp , our correspondent says .
Nepal has also brought in rules to stop summiteers carrying items such as including cameras and electronic devices beyond base camp before 10 May .
Protests quashed
For the past six weeks Tibetan exiles in the Nepalese capital , Kathmandu , have staged regular protests against Chinese rule of Tibet .
Each time police have broken up the demonstrations , usually arresting scores of people and sometimes using batons to beat them .
The Olympic torch relay attracted some high - profile protests as it passed through certain cities on its route - notably London , Paris and San Francisco .
However , it has also made peaceful progress through other cities including Bangkok in Thailand , Dar es Salaam in Tanzania , and the Argentine capital , Buenos Aires .
The torch is currently in a secret location in Malaysia , ahead of its relay through Kuala Lumpur on Monday .

What are these ?
She said that President Bush was told of some of the excerpts but would not be commenting on them because “ he has more pressing matters than to spend time commenting on books by former staffers . ”
But Karl Rove , a principal target of many of Mr. McClellan ’s charges and the former deputy chief of staff for President Bush , reacted immediately on Tuesday night .
Speaking on Fox News , where he is now a commentator , Mr. Rove said Mr. McClellan was not even present at many of the meetings he describes and suggested that he was not writing truthfully .
“ First of all , this does n’t sound like Scott .
It really does n’t , ” he said .
“ Not the Scott McClellan I ’ve known for a long time .
Second of all , it sounds like somebody else .
It sounds like a left - wing blogger .
“ If he had these moral qualms , ” he added , “ he should have spoken up about them . ”
Mr. McClellan ’s book , “ What Happened : Inside the Bush White House and Washington ’s Culture of Deception , ” is the first negative account by a member of the tight circle of Texans around Mr. Bush .
Mr. McClellan , 40 , went to work for Mr. Bush when he was governor of Texas and was the White House press secretary from 2003 to 2006 .
The revelations in the book , to be published by PublicAffairs next Monday , were first reported Tuesday on Politico.com by Mike Allen .
Mr. Allen wrote that he bought the book at a Washington store .
The New York Times also obtained an advance copy .

Mr. McClellan writes that top
White House officials deceived him about the administration ’s involvement in the leaking of the identity of a C.I.A. operative , Valerie Wilson .
He says he did not know for almost two years that his statements from the press room that Karl Rove and I .
Lewis Libby Jr. were not involved in the leak were a lie .
Texas group sues to stop construction of border fence
WASHINGTON — A drive by the Bush administration to build 70 miles of fencing along the Texas - Mexico border before leaving office could be sidetracked by a lawsuit filed by 19 border communities on Friday .
The Texas Border Coalition , citing what it called lawless conduct by Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff , asked a U.S. District Court judge here to force the federal government to halt construction of the barrier and land acquisition .
The lawsuit accused Chertoff and others of failing to notify landowners of their rights ; failing to negotiate a reasonable price for access to their lands , and of exempting some wealthy owners from having the fence built across their properties .
Chertoff " has gone too far in his zeal to build this feel - good , yet ineffective Great Wall of Texas , " said Eagle Pass Mayor Chad Foster , the chairman of the border coalition , which represents cities from Brownsville to El Paso .
Brownsville Mayor Patricio M. Ahumada Jr. charged that federal officials " are determined to build a wall to appease mid-America . "
Peter Schey , lead counsel in the case and executive director of the Los Angeles - based Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law , said Friday 's lawsuit would be followed within days by a request for a temporary restraining order to block land seizures and fence construction .
The case is handled by U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton , named to the federal bench by President Bush in 2001 .
The Bush administration is pressing to complete construction of 670 miles of physical barriers and high - tech virtual fencing along the 1,972 - mile U.S. - Mexico border .
But the legal wrangling could delay construction of the fence in Texas , pushing decisions on completion of the barriers into next year when a new president and a new Congress will take office .
Laura Keehner , a Homeland Security spokeswoman , called the lawsuit a delaying tactic and said construction will continue .
" There should be no uncertainty about our commitment to border security , and we 've made no secret that fencing is a key part of our efforts at the border , " Keehner said .
" We 're building 670 miles of fencing by the end of this year and are well on our way to meeting this goal . "
The lawsuit was designed to force federal officials to restart a protracted survey process as a first step to federal purchase .
Chertoff has run " roughshod over the rights of property owners to build a border wall on a foundation of lawlessness , " Schey said .
" We hope that we are able to bring this lawless conduct to build this wall into conformity with federal statutes and the United States Constitution . "
Federal officials intimidated some landowners along the border by sending Homeland Security officials and agents of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Border Patrol to try to arrange access to survey their properties , Schey contended .
The suit also noted that fence construction would bypass the River Bend Resort and golf course , in Brownsville , and border lands owned by Dallas billionaire Ray Hunt and his relatives .
Keehner , Chertoff 's spokesman , rejected the lawsuit 's allegations .
" We 've nearly bent over backward to work with landowners , " she said in a statement .
Keehner noted that yearlong discussions had taken place with landowners and state and local officials " about the placement of fencing . "
Federal officials , she said , contacted more than 600 landowners , held dozens of town hall meetings and mailed hundreds of letters to property owners " requesting access to private property so that we could make operational and environmental assessments of the area prior to making any decisions . "
Border fence construction has become increasingly contentious in Texas , with landowners ' resistance forcing federal authorities to file lawsuits against nearly 100 owners in four states in an effort to gain court - ordered access to the land .
A family from Los Ebanos , Texas , awaits a hearing on July 7 before the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans on its attempt to block access by federal authorities .
The Texas officials ' legal challenge is the latest high - profile effort to prevent construction of the fence .
The U.S. Supreme Court is weighing a request by environmentalists and members of Congress to hear a case challenging Chertoff 's constitutional authority to waive compliance with three dozen federal laws in order to speed construction of the barriers .

A California congresswoman has proposed yet another spectrum auction — the 2,155MHz to 2,180MHz range — with some hefty public - service requirements :
• Within two years of receiving the license , launch an " always - on " broadband with at least 200 Kbps downloads
• Service is to be free of subscription , airtime and other usage fees
• " A technology protection measure " that would keep kids from the porn
• Publication of specs and standards , royalty free , so that others can develop for the network
Let me get this straight :
You want some well - heeled for - profit corporation to pay potentially billions for the privilege of hastily launching a network that it can't charge money for , and let competitors provide devices for it , again for no extra money ?
I do n't think so .
I 'm not pro-corporation , so much as I am pro-reality .

If this becomes a legit spectrum auction , M2Z would presumably be one of the bidders ( the FCC insisted that the company play by the usual auction rules ) .
Rep .
Eshoo says that her plan will hopefully engender " a new kind of national broadband service provider . "
My instinct is that it is n't going to get very far , for assorted reasons :
• No company with enough cash to build a network like this would take the risk on a completely new business model .
• An " ad - supported " system of weak wireless broadband might be more annoying than useful , even for people who can't afford an alternative .
• The unfortunates targeted for this service would still have to buy or be given equipment that runs on the particular frequency band .
• If all you need to do is promise those low speeds , you could more cheaply create a compressed dial - up service that runs over traditional copper - wire phone lines .
• In the recently concluded 700MHz auction , the so - called D Block was left untouched because of its requirement of a nationwide public - safety network .

According to Einstein ’s theory of general relativity , black holes are regions of space where gravity is so strong that not even light can escape .
And in the 1970 ’s physicist Stephen Hawking asserted that any information sucked inside a black hole would be permanently lost .
But now , researchers at Penn State have shown that information can be recovered from black holes .
A fundamental part of quantum physics is that information cannot be lost , so Hawking ’s claim has been debated .
His idea was generally accepted by physicists until the late 1990s , when many began to doubt the assertion .
Even Hawking himself renounced the idea in 2004 .
Yet no one , until now , has been able to provide a plausible mechanism for how information might escape from a black hole .
A team of physicists led by Abhay Ashtekar , say their findings expand space - time beyond its assumed size , providing room for information to reappear .
Ashtekar used an analogy from Alice in Wonderland : “ When the Cheshire cat disappears , his grin remains , ” he said .
“ We used to think it was the same way with black holes .
Hawking ’s analysis suggested that at the end of a black hole ’s life , even after it has completely evaporated away , a singularity , or a final edge to space - time , is left behind , and this singularity serves as a sink for unrecoverable information . ”
But the Penn State team suggest that singularities do not exist in the real world .
“ Information only appears to be lost because we have been looking at a restricted part of the true quantum - mechanical space - time , ” said Ashtekar .
“ Once you consider quantum gravity , then space - time becomes much larger and there is room for information to reappear in the distant future on the other side of what was first thought to be the end of space - time . ”
According to Ashtekar , space - time is not a continuum as physicists once believed .
Instead , it is made up of individual building blocks , just as a piece of fabric , though it appears to be continuous , is made up of individual threads .
“ Once we realized that the notion of space - time as a continuum is only an approximation of reality , it became clear to us that singularities are merely artifacts of our insistence that space - time should be described as a continuum . ”
To conduct their studies , the team used a two - dimensional model of black holes to investigate the quantum nature of real black holes , which exist in four dimensions .
That ’s because two - dimensional systems are simpler to study mathematically .
But because of the close similarities between two - dimensional black holes and spherical four - dimensional black holes , the team believes that this approach is a general mechanism that can be applied in four dimensions .
The group now is pursuing methods for directly studying four - dimensional black holes .
The team ’s work will be published in the May 20 , 2008 issue of the journal Physical Review Letters .

Over the last 30 years , the number of smokers in the U.S. has steadily decreasedâ€ ” a tribute to the efforts of public - health workers everywhere .
And while this fact is unarguable , less obvious are the social and cultural forces that lead an individual to kick the habit .
In fact , when someone crumbles that last empty pack of their favorite unfiltered brand and vows to never buy another , he might not realize that he is less like the heroic individual grasping his own boot straps and more like a single bird whose sudden left turn is just one speck in the larger flock .
These are the findings of a massive longitudinal study spanning 32 years : people quit smoking in droves .
Through reconstructing the social network of 12,067 individuals , researchers from Harvard Medical School and the University of California , San Diego have discovered that smoking cessation occurs in network clusters and is hardly the isolated decision it might feel like to the individual quitter .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
â€ œWeâ€™ve found that when you analyze large social networks , entire pockets of people who might not know each other all quit smoking at once , â€ says Nicholas Christakis , a professor in Harvard Medical Schoolâ€™s Department of Health Care Policy , who , along with U.C. San Diego researcher James Fowler , authored the study .
â€ œSo if thereâ€™s a change in the zeitgeist of this social network , like a cultural shift , a whole group of people who are connected but who might not know each other all quit together.â€ 
The study , which was funded primarily by the National Institute on Aging , appears in the May 22 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine .
Over the last few years , Christakis , who is also a professor of sociology in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University , and Fowler have been analyzing data from the Framingham Heart Study ( an ongoing cardiovascular study begun in 1948 ) , recreating the social patterns contained within the study data to see how health correlates with an individualâ€™s social network .
The researchers derived information from archived , handwritten administrative tracking sheets dating back to 1971 .
All family changes for each study participant , such as birth , marriage , death , and divorce , were recorded .
In addition , participants had also listed contact information for their closest friends , as well as coworkers and neighbors .
Coincidentally , many of these friends and coworkers were also study participants .
Focusing on 5,124 individuals , Christakis and Fowler observed a total of 53,228 social , familial , and professional ties .
Last year , they reported on how obesity spreads through social networks .
Using the same data , they decided to analyze smoking cessation trends within that same population .
The first and most striking finding was the discovery that , from the larger network perspective , people quit smoking as groups and not as individuals .
â€ œWhen you look at the entire network over this 30 - year period , you see that the average size of each particular cluster of smokers remains roughly the same , â€ says Fowler .
â€ œItâ€™s just that there are fewer and fewer of these clusters as time goes on.â€ 
They were able to quantify the person - to - person effects of smoking cessation among married couples , siblings , friends , and coworkers .
In addition , they also discovered â€œquitting cascadesâ€ that advanced from person - to - person - to - person .
( See end of release for statistical chart . )
Christakis illustrates this point by describing a small network containing three individual smokers , persons A , B , and C .
The first person , A , is friends with B , and B is friends with C , but A and C do not know each other .
If C quits smoking , Aâ€™s chances of not smoking spike 30 percent , regardless of whether or not B smokes .
The middle individual , it would appear , might act as a kind of â€œcarrierâ€ for a social norm .
Education also seems to matter .
We are more influenced by the quitting behavior of others if those people are highly educated .
To add a further twist , we are also more influenced by others if we ourselves are more educated .
Says Christakis , â€ œWe see by this that the educated are not only more influential , but they are also more easily influenced .â€ 
And finally , Christakis and Fowler discovered that smokers are increasingly marginalized throughout social networks .
â€ œIf you look back at 1971 , smokers and non-smokers alike were at the centers of social networks , â€ says Fowler .
â€ œFor people running companies and having parties , smoking was irrelevant .
But during the â€˜80s and â€˜90s we saw a dramatic shift of smokers to the periphery of the social network .
Contrary to what we might have thought in high school , smoking has become a supremely bad strategy for getting popular.â€ 
This marginalization of smokers appears to occur across all educational and economic demographics .
According to the researchers , this is an additional concern .
Social marginalization leads to poor health .
Smoking then is not only bad for your physical health but for your social health as well .
â€ œWhat people need to understand is that because our lives are connected , our health is connected , â€ says Christakis .
â€ œPolicy makers have an understandable tendency to treat people as atomized individuals , and to anticipate the impact of their policies accordingly , â€ says Duncan Watts , professor of sociology at Columbia University , who was not involved with this study .
â€ œWhat this studyâ € ” like the authorsâ€™ previous study on obesityâ€ ” points out clearly , however , is that individuals do not behave as atoms , but as part of a network .
Although simple to state , the consequences of that observation are profound , and will require us to fundamentally rethink our intuition about the world .â€ 
â€ œThe culture of individualism is so strong that we sometimes forget how powerfully and silently social networks and those around us influence our health , â€ said Richard Suzman , director of National Institute on Agingâ€™s Division of Behavioral and Social Research .
â€ œIf decisions to quit cascade through social networks , then this study has provided public health campaigns a powerful new methodology with which to influence behaviors.â€ 

A couple of articles have now been written about the unpleasant behaviour that people encounter with Firefox 3 in certain Linux configurations , related to the flushing of I/O and system lag that can see if there is a lot of other disk activity at the same time .
There are a lot of moving parts to this issue , and so it ’s not surprising that there ’s a fair bit of misunderstanding , though some of it seems less well - meaning that others , which makes me a bit sad .
What ’s Firefox doing ?
Firefox uses a database called sqlite as the underpinning for many kinds of data storage in Firefox 3 , including the browsing history and bookmarks data used to provide the Awesomebar ’s awesomeness .
sqlite is an excellent piece of software , written by people who take both data integrity and performance very seriously , which makes it a great place to put this sort of data .
Lots of people use sqlite these days , and we ’re proud to be founding members of the consortium that helps support sqlite development .
Databases , perhaps obviously , usually have complex file formats , and require that different parts of their files agree about things like how many records there are , whether a transaction completed successfully , or how indexes match up with the data to which they refer .
This makes them more sensitive to data corruption than some simpler formats , like a basic text file .
If you get a chunk of a text file corrupted , you can probably edit around it and salvage the rest of the file , but if you get a chunk of a database file corrupted you can often effectively lose all of the data that ’s held there .
This is one of the tradeoffs for being able to have efficient access to large sets of data , and it ’s common to virtually all databases .
One of the things that sqlite does to ensure that the database is not corrupted in the case of a crash is call a function called fsync .
fsync tells the operating system to ensure that this file has been safely written to disk , and waits until that ’s complete .
This provides what ’s known as a “ barrier ” , and makes sure that we do n’t get mismatched parts of transactions ( groups of related database operations ) when we look at the file after a crash .
This is very effective : even if the operating system itself crashes or the computer loses power suddenly , we wo n’t see the database corrupted .
We do n’t want to lose the user ’s data , because that makes users sad , and we like to make users happy .
So up through Firefox RC1 , we set sqlite to its recommended setting of “ FULL ” synchronization .
As release - end - game luck would have it , that made some users sad , because they would find Firefox and sometimes other parts of their system would pause unpleasantly , and it was tracked down to Firefox calling fsync .
The bug in question is here , but I caution you to not read it piecemeal ; there ’s a lot of intertwined conversation there , and some comments are not as correct as they sound .
( There have been other bugs along the way that could cause this , ranging from performance problems with certain sqlite versions to bad interactions with the data set used for malware protection , but those were put behind us by RC1 .
This bug is the one that has people working weekends at this point . )
Why does that hurt so much ?
On some rather common Linux configurations , especially using the ext3 filesystem in the “ data=ordered ” mode , calling fsync does n’t just flush out the data for the file it ’s called on , but rather on all the buffered data for that filesystem .
Because writing to disk is so much slower than writing to memory , operating systems can buffer a lot of data , especially if you ’re doing something that involves a lot of I/O , like unpacking a zip file or compiling software .
It gets written out in the background , giving you vastly , vastly improved performance .
It ’s no exaggeration to say that without this sort of buffering your computer would be entirely unusable .
I think you can see where this is going : if there ’s a lot of data waiting to be written to disk , and Firefox ’s ( sqlite ’s ) request to flush the data for one file actually sends all that data out , we could be waiting for a while .
Worse , all the other applications that are writing data may end up waiting for it to complete as well .
In artificial , but not entirely impossible , test conditions , those delays can be 30 seconds or more .
That experience , to coin a phrase , kinda sucks .
Does it suck as much as file corruption wiping out your bookmarks after your computer ( not Firefox ) crashes ?
As you might imagine , opinions vary .
This problem with ext3 is well - known to Linux kernel developers , and there ’s great work underway as part of the “ ext4 ″ project to remedy it .
Other filesystems ( like reiser4 , I have heard ) have similar problems , and I presume that their developers are also working on resolving them .
Why does n’t other ( non-sqlite ) software do this ?
Actually , a lot of software that ’s concerned with data integrity does this , including the editors emacs and vim , and mail clients like mutt and Evolution , as well as bigger databases like MySQL and Postgres .
In some cases , those programs are in fact adding more calls to fsync to protect user data better .
In fact , so many programs use fsync to ensure data integrity , and actually writing to disk is so expensive , that some operating systems make fsync not be a “ real ” fsync : the data is scheduled for ( hopefully ) immediate write - out , but the call does n’t wait until it ’s all the way to the disk , so it ’s not really an effective barrier .
This may be permitted by various standards like POSIX , but it ’s certainly surprising for programs like Firefox that use it to protect against data corruption in the case of a crash !
Here ’s what Apple has to say about fsync , sqlite , and data corruption :
fsync on Mac OS X : Since on Mac OS
X the fsync command does not make the guarantee that bytes are written , SQLite sends a F_FULLFSYNC request to the kernel to ensures that the bytes are actually written through to the drive platter .
This causes the kernel to flush all buffers to the drives and causes the drives to flush their track caches .
Without this , there is a significantly large window of time within which data will reside in volatile memory — and in the event of system failure you risk data corruption .
Exciting !
If this is an operating system bug , why is Firefox being patched ?
Because we want to make users happy .
Whether Linux should have better fsync behaviour or not is n’t really going to matter to our users — we want to support Linux , which means Linux - as - she - is - shipped , not Linux - as - we - would - like - her - to - be .
That means that we need to deal with X servers , with font - selection systems , and with filesystem behaviour as we find it , because that ’s where our Linux users are .
( It ’s not like Windows and OS X do n’t have their own annoying things to work around either , though they do n’t seem to have this specific one ! )
So is it always going to be like this ?
No ! ( Yay ! )
In the immediate term , there is a patch that controls how aggressively we sync , and defaults to a slightly less - aggressive state that is equivalently safe on modern operating systems .
That patch will be in either Firefox 3.0.1 at the latest , and we ’ve been in contact with Linux distributors to make sure they ’re aware that the patch is fine to take in their builds — desirable , even .
It might be in Firefox 3.0 proper , depending on what happens with an RC2 , but either way the vast majority of affected users ( Linux users , who usually get their Firefoxes from their distributors ) will get the fix right away .
This patch also lets users , who might decide that their systems are stable enough and their backups good enough that they do n’t need the extra protection , turn off the data - integrity fsync s almost entirely .
In the medium term , we ’re going to be making our database use more asynchronous in Firefox , and batching transactions for things like history .
You ’ll likely see those effects in the major version of Firefox that follows 3 ( might be called 3.1 , might be called 3.5 , might be called Firefox Magenta , who knows ? ) .
This will keep Firefox from pausing in these states , but may not entirely keep the fsync calls from affecting other applications on the system .
The sqlite developers are also looking at adding support for a newer , Linux - only API that does n’t have the system - wide effects as fsync , which could help as well .
Longer term , as I mentioned above , the Linux filesystem situation will improve in this respect , and the work is well - underway .
It ’s probably a year at least before most Linux users are running systems with fixed fsync behaviour , but at that point application developers wo n’t have to worry about their data - integrity needs causing pain for the whole system .
I , for one , am looking forward to it .
Noted crazy person Travis Pastrana gets bored easily , and he entertains himself by doing ridiculous , usually - dangerous things at high speeds .
His latest stunt ?
The hydrojump .
It involved him " skimming his Suzuki dirtbike at 70 miles per hour for 110 feet in five - foot - deep water , and then launching off of a floating FMX ramp . "
It actually looks pretty fun in the video .
Remember , kids : do n't try this at home , unless Red Bull throws a sponsorship your way , in which case go nuts .

Hillary 's local operatives have said as much recently at BlueOregon .
But now we have express confirmation from the highest levels of the Clinton campaign .
Intricate as it is , the strategy does not depend on winning Oregon 's May 20 primary , according to Clinton 's communications director Howard Wolfson .
Asked directly , ``Can your strategy work without winning Oregon ? ''
Wolfson dodged the question .
`` It starts in West Virginia , '' he said , referring to that state 's primary on Tuesday
" Intricate " is an interesting word for it .
" Spintricate " might be more accurate .
Wolfson also noted that the growing chorus for Clinton to withdraw by election watchers can also play in her favor .
`` If voters , hearing that in West Virginia decide to affirm her candidacy ... that would say something significant about her ability to compete and win votes in a very tough environment , '' he said .
May I offer this , Mr. Wolfson ?
By the same token , if voters , hearing that in Oregon decide to affirm Obama 's candidacy ... that would say something significant about his ability to compete and win votes ...
See how it just kind of all just falls apart there , Howard ?
Unfortunately , we are all familiar with the Clinton campaign 's constant " moving goalposts " , as well as the " Clinton Rules " of which states " matter " ( only those states Hillary won ! ) .
Why is the Clinton campaign still pushing these talking points - which they know are bogus - pretending there is no difference between a primary and a general election ?
Does Hillary think we are stupid ?
I will ask it again - Why is the Clinton campaign still pushing these talking points - which they know are bogus - pretending there is no difference between a primary and a general election ?
And once more to really drive it home - Why is the Clinton campaign still pushing these talking points - which they know are bogus - pretending there is no difference between a primary and a general election ?
And then there is this :
They want the party to win and Clinton says she 's the best candidate to achieve that .
The Obama campaign , of course , strenuously disagrees , pointing to his large fundraising advantage and his ability to attract huge numbers of new voters .
Bottom line is , the Clinton campaign has come right out and said that Oregon is not a part of her plan for victory .
Even if that is true , WHY come out and say it when voting is in progress ?
I thought every vote mattered , Hillary ?
I thought you wanted to be the president for all of America , " north , south , east and west " ?
If that is Hillary 's goal , how can she now out of the other side of her mouth say that only the " important " states matter ?
Does she expect us to not be infuriated by her craven hypocrisy ?
That 's fine , Hillary .
Do n't help us .
Do n't build us up .
Do n't help encourage and support our state party to do all the important work it needs to do to get Gordon Smith out of the Senate - a prime and critical pick - up opportunity .
It 's all about Hillary .
Vandals keep changing the letter ' L ' to a ' C ' on the village 's signs Residents living in a graffiti- plagued village on Merseyside are being asked to consider changing its name to tackle vandals who alter signs in the village .
Lunt , which dates back to Medieval times , has been repeatedly targeted by vandals who change the " L " to a " C " .
However , the proposal to change the name has split the village with some residents insisting the vandals should not be allowed to ruin their heritage .
One suggestion is to change it to Launt which would be pronounced the same .
However , despite the dismay that the vandalism causes , some villagers are defiant at the thought of giving in to the vandals .
Standing firm Parish councillor Steward Dobson , 84 , said : " This village is very , very old and people do n't want the name changed .
The idea would be to change the village 's name to " Launt " " The vandalism has been done for years , it 's not children who are doing it . "
David Roughley , whose family has farmed in Lunt since 1851 , added : " At the end of the day we live in Lunt and we do n't want to change because of a few yobs .
" It is the vandals who should change , not the village . "
According to the local website , the area was first documented in 1251 in the Chartulary of Cockersand Abbey where it was referred to as " de Lund " .

What are these ?
THALHEIM , Germany 
This sad stretch of eastern Germany , with its deserted coal mines and corroded factories , epitomizes post - industrial gloom .
It is a place where even the clouds rarely seem to part .
Yet the sun was shining here the other day  and nowhere more brightly than at Q - Cells , a German company that surpassed Sharp last year to become the world ’s largest maker of photovoltaic solar cells .
Q - Cells is the main tenant among a flowering cluster of solar start - ups here in an area known as Solar Valley .
Thanks to its aggressive push into renewable energies , cloud - wreathed Germany has become an unlikely leader in the race to harness the sun ’s energy .
It has by far the largest market for photovoltaic systems , which convert sunlight into electricity , with roughly half of the world ’s total installations .
And it is the third - largest producer of solar cells and modules , after China and Japan .
Now , though , with so many solar panels on so many rooftops , critics say Germany has too much of a good thing  even in a time of record oil prices .
Conservative lawmakers , in particular , want to pare back generous government incentives that support solar development .
They say solar generation is growing so fast that it threatens to overburden consumers with high electricity bills .
SAN DIEGO – Stanford law professor and internet icon Larry Lessig called on geeks Wednesday night to be " heroes " who can help Americans believe in their government again , by creating tools to help drive the influence of money out of politics .
" We have had different times in this country requiring different heroes , " Lessig said in a keynote speech at the O'Reilly Emerging Technology conference here .
" During World War II , we required soldiers as heroes , " Lessig said .
" We may be at a time when we need geeks as heroes . "
Lessig says he needs help from coders , because problems like global warming can't be solved until elected officials are freed from the corrupting effect of campaign contributions .
Lessig recently flirted with the idea of running for Congress , but instead is launching a new campaign called Change Congress .
The new project is modeled on the Creative Commons project he started to help change how copyright works , which allows people to tag their writings and photography with alternative copyright badges .
The project , to be officially announced in two weeks , will give candidates for political office three choices they can support in order to get badges for their campaign website .
Candidates who pledge not to take money from lobbyists or political action committees can claim one badge , get another for pledging to ban " earmarks " in Congress and take a third for supporting public campaign financing .
From there , Lessig wants to find ways to get individuals to funnel early money to candidates who pledge to support one or more of the principles .
That 's the carrot .
The stick approach includes possibly recruiting respected " citizen candidates " to run against politicians who do n't support the statements – a way , Lessig said , to make it cheaper for a candidate to support the principles than to ignore them .
Lessig 's new project comes after 10 years of working on what he calls the " Free Culture " project that focused on copyright reform to encourage an explosion of creative remixing of our cultural history .
Lessig says the only way for Congress to change is to have outsiders change the system , since right now the whole system is rigged .
" Congress is an incumbency machine , " Lessig said .
But he does n't think legislators are by and large crooks who are taking bribes in exchange for votes .
In fact , he says we may have the least bribery in our nation 's history .
But the money still corrupts in a number of ways .
For instance , legislators , like scientists funded by drug companies , internalize their supporters ' interests .
" Money corrupts the process of reasoning , " Lessig said .
" They get a sixth sense of how what they do might affect how they raise money . "
Lawmakers need to be free from a system that requires them to constantly raise money in order to free them to simply think about how to craft good public policy .
Lessig spared no rhetoric in making his case against the corrupting influence of campaign contributions – comparing the urgency of the financing problem to that of an alcoholic about to lose his family and job , but who has to " realize the first problem that must be solved is the alcoholism . "
Health care reform , global warming and immigration ?
" There is no way to think about solving these problems until we solve the money problem , " Lessig said .
Lessig also pointed to the Sunlight Foundation and MAPLight.org as examples of burgeoning uses for technology to show – and thus hopefully diminish – the influence of money on politicians .
The geeks in San Diego embraced Lessig 's call to keyboards , giving him a standing ovation , but wanted to know what they could do right now .
Lessig tamped down their excitement a bit , saying the project could take three or four election cycles to truly create this year 's political buzzword , " change . "
The outro music to Lessig 's speech was the Rolling Stone 's " You Ca n't Always Get What You Want . "

What if Albert Einstein could 've had a computer ?
Right now , Einstein is red hot .
He was just named Time 's person of the century , beating out tough competition such as Franklin Roosevelt , Gandhi and Britney Spears .
He 's the subject of a half - dozen books in the past year and is featured on the Albert Einstein : A Man for All Seasons 2000 calendar .
He 's still doing Apple Computer ads .
That last one is pretty darn ironic because Einstein got famous without the use of technology .
He never touched a computer .
Einstein is celebrated because he came up with several of the most difficult , groundbreaking and far - reaching scientific discoveries of the past 100 years -- discoveries that otherwise probably would n't have come until decades later .
He made all of them in an age when mechanical punch - card tabulating machines were radical information technology .
He came up with special relativity in 1905 , general relativity in 1915 and his cosmological theory in 1917 .
" Einstein did n't even use pencil and paper " in much of his work , says Amir Aczel , author of one of the current books on Einstein , God 's Equation : Einstein , Relativity , and the Expanding Universe .
" He was a thought experiment kind of guy . "
He 'd imagine objects in an elevator to devise gravitational theories .
" In his mind , ( he ) placed many clocks at various places in space and imagined them flying at different speeds , deducing that space and time were relative , " Aczel writes in his book .
Once Einstein had a theory , he 'd need an equation to describe it .
That would require doing math -- hard , grueling , blood - draining math .
Math that was so complex , even Einstein had to get help to figure it out , which means he at one time felt the same way I did in Mrs. Dodd 's AP math class .
Einstein did his math by hand .
It would take him years .
He 'd make mistakes .
One error , when calculating the deflection of a ray of light just grazing the edge of an object with the mass of the sun , took him four years to find and fix .
Today , scientists live and breathe computers .
To them , computers are the equivalent of weight - training rooms for football players .
They could do their jobs without them , but then they'd get squashed into the turf by the competition .
Computers do a lot of things for scientists , says Randy Isaac , vice president at IBM's Watson Research Labs .
Some of it is mundane .
Spreadsheets do basic arithmetic in a split second .
Equations can be manipulated , run and checked with ease .
" Theorists can much more quickly generate specific predictions of their special theory , " he says .
" Experimentalists can much more quickly gather and analyze data to tell the theorists sooner than ever that none of their theories are right and they better get back to the drawing boards . "
Those are basically time savers and error eliminators .
A step deeper is simulation .
One Maryland lab now has a complete , 3 - D simulation of the Chesapeake Bay running on a supercomputer , allowing it to test theories about how the ecosystem works and see the results as if they were real .
The University of Illinois at Champaign / Urbana developed a simulation of the galaxies that lets a scientist " fly " anywhere in the known universe and see cosmological events .
What if Einstein had that stuff ?
Think it could 've hurt his efforts ?
What made Einstein great was not that he was smarter than anyone else .
It was that he was able to break through accepted concepts of his time and think about things in brand - new ways .
Maybe computers would 've distracted him .
He could 've gotten sucked into a vortex of FreeCell and Web surfing and lost his way .
But maybe not .
" I do not believe that computers have compelled people to think less , " says Michael Levine , physics professor at Carnegie - Mellon University .
" I think of computer technology not as replacing but rather as extending and complementing our other abilities in understanding the physical universe . "
Computer technology would 've done the same for Einstein , radically leveraging his brainpower .
Einstein tended to seize mathematical tools that would help him generate his theories , so he probably would have embraced computers .
Give Einstein a supercomputer around 1905 and where might we be now ?
" I think science would 've been pushed ahead a lot , " Aczel says .
" It 's possible he would 've come up with the theory of everything . "
That would be huge indeed .
Einstein 's general theory of relativity does not jibe with quantum theory , which describes the actions of the tiniest particles .
Scientists are still struggling with the enormous task of finding a theory that applies to both .
For one thing , it seems to require 11 dimensions , which can be a problem because we are only comfortable living in four , and the Fifth Dimension never did much for anyone after Aquarius / Let the Sunshine In .
Uniting the theories would be like finding the keys to the universe .
If Einstein had computers , he might 've done that 90 years ago .
All this time , we could 've been using that equation to crack the riddles of creation and remake a better life on earth .
And maybe , sometime long ago , mankind would 've been able to take a different turn , so that we'd never have wound up today with IncrEdibles push - up Chili Mac on a stick .

Filling the void in Iraq ’s underdeveloped amusement park industry
Quick quiz : what does Iraq really need ?
If you said “ political reconciliation ” or “ a functioning infrastructure , ” you ’re not thinking with the kind of outside - the - box creativity that Llewellyn Werner is .
Llewellyn Werner admits he is facing obstacles most amusement park developers never have to deal with – insurgent attacks and looting .
When you are building an amusement park in downtown Baghdad , those risks come with the territory .
Mr Werner , chairman of C3 , a Los Angeles - based holding company for private equity firms , is pouring millions of dollars into developing the Baghdad Zoo and Entertainment Experience , a massive American - style amusement park that will feature a skateboard park , rides , a concert theatre and a museum .
It is being designed by the firm that developed Disneyland .
“ The people need this kind of positive influence .
It ’s going to have a huge psychological impact , ” Mr Werner said .
Um , yeah .
If you say so .
Baghdad ’s “ Entertainment Experience ” will reportedly occupy ( no pun intended ) 50 acres adjacent to the Green Zone .
( It is the site of the old zoo , which was “ looted , left without power and abandoned after the American - led invasion in 2003 . ” )
Werner ’s project , which includes a 50 - year lease , will cost a half - billion dollars .
Iraqis will manage the facility , and he ’ll “ retain exclusive rights to housing and hotel developments . ”
What could possibly go wrong ?
Well , Jonathan Stein did raise one concern :
Sure .
A massive Disneyland - style amusement park , operated for American profit , plunked in the middle of Baghdad — that wo n’t be a target for hostilities .
Not at all .
As for Werner , his motivation is not entirely altruistic .
He noted that the children of Sunnis and Shi’ia alike can enjoy the “ Entertainment Experience , ” but he has profit to consider .
“ I would n’t be doing this if I was n’t making money , ” he said .
“ I also have this wonderful sense that we ’re doing the right thing – we ’re going to employ thousands of Iraqis .
But mostly everything here is for profit . ”
Stein wondered whether that same quote might be attributed to officials in the Bush administration .
13 Separate Olympic Themed Targeted Trojans
The world 's athletes and hackers now share a common focus - the Beijing Olympics .
Whilst the athletes have a legitimate reason to concentrate on the Games , today 's hackers are using the 2008 Olympics for their own glory .
MessageLabs has revealed new research showing the frequency and locations of targeted Trojan attacks and the tools used to avoid detection .
In the last six months MessageLabs has intercepted 13 separate Olympic themed attacks , across several different data - rich industries .
With legitimate - sounding email subject titles such as " The Beijing 2008 Torch Relay " and " National Olympic Committee and Ticket Sales Agents " , some attacks purport to be from the International Olympic Committee , based in Lausanne Switzerland , however the reality is that all but one attack has been sent from an IP addresses within Asia Pacific .
Targeted Trojans are usually aimed at specific individuals within an organization with the purpose of infiltrating networks for corporate espionage .
Each attack is usually small in numbers and often utilizes social engineering techniques , such as personalization , to persuade the recipient to open the email and attachment .
Hackers are constantly shifting to new delivery formats to hide the sinister malware and to avoid detection by traditional anti-virus engines , as well as using harmless and common attachment types which are not blocked .
In these instances , Microsoft Office Database ( MDB ) files , usually hidden within a ZIP file , is one of the latest formats to be used .
Once the MDB file has been downloaded the MDB exploit will drop an EXE file to the disk and steal data .
MessageLabs predicts that in the coming year hackers will vary their use of formats even further with 1 Byte XOR Key , Multiple XOR keys and ROR , ROL , ADD and SUB formats to be exploited .
Alex Shipp , MessageLabs Senior Anti Virus Technologist and Imagineer , issues an ominous warning to businesses , " These attacks are highly targeted at organizations that have highly confidential and valuable data , such as military and government bodies .
Presuming that you have n't been targeted is n't proof that you have n't .
The malicious EXE file can remain undetected for several months so it may be that your organization has been penetrated and crucial information has already leaked .
Businesses need to up their game and fortify themselves against a dangerous new breed of hacker , Hacker 3.0 , who is prepared to stop at nothing to achieve their goal . "

Do you believe the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees the rights of Americans to own guns , or does it only guarantee members of state militias such as National Guard units the right to own guns ?
Right of all Americans
Only state militias All adults 73 % 20 % Gun owners 91 % 6 % Non-Gun owners 63 % 28 % Source : USA TODAY / Gallup Poll of 1,016 adults Feb. 8 - 10 .
Margin of error for all adults : ± 3 percentage points ; for gun owners : ± 6 points ; for non -gun owners : ± 4 points ; Julie Snider , USA TODAY KEY DATES IN DEBATE KEY DATES IN DEBATE - 1993 : Congress passes and President Clinton signs the Brady bill , which requires a five - day waiting period for those buying a handgun .
The measure is named for former White House press secretary James Brady , who was shot during the assassination attempt on President Reagan in 1981 .
It 's the first major gun-control legislation to clear Congress since 1968 , the year Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. were killed .
- 1994 : Congress passes a 10 - year ban on the manufacture and sale of certain semiautomatic assault weapons .
- 1995 : After gaining control of Congress , Republican leaders in the House and Senate vow to repeal the assault weapons ban .
- 2000 : Vice President Gore loses the presidential election .
Many in his party cite his support of gun control as a factor .
In 2004 , the Democratic National Convention , for the first time , adds language to its platform backing a right to bear arms .
- 2001 : President Bush 's attorney general , John Ashcroft , declares the Second Amendment protects an individual right to own guns .
The following year , Justice Department lawyers tell the Supreme Court that gun regulations should be subject to the highest level of judicial scrutiny , which would make it more difficult to enact such laws .
- 2004 : Congress rejects renewal of the assault weapons ban .
- 2007 : A federal appeals court strikes down a Washington , D.C. , ban on handguns and declares that the Second Amendment " protects an individual right to keep and bear arms … for such activities as hunting and self - defense . "
- March 18 , 2008 : The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear D.C. officials ' appeal of the federal court ruling .
The White House says the Second Amendment protects an individual right to own guns but backs a judicial standard that would allow more firearms limits than its 2002 legal position would have .
By Joan Biskupic WASHINGTON  Guns , and questions about how much power the government has to keep people from owning them , are at the core of one of the most divisive topics in American politics .
Nowhere is that divide more pronounced than in the gap between Americans ' beliefs about their rights under the Second Amendment , and how courts have interpreted the law .
Nearly three out of four Americans — 73 % — believe the Second Amendment spells out an individual right to own a firearm , according to a USA TODAY / Gallup Poll of 1,016 adults taken Feb. 8 - 10 .
Yet for decades , federal judges have seen the Constitution differently , allowing a range of gun-control measures imposed by governments seeking to curb gun violence .
Lower court judges overwhelmingly have ruled that the right " to keep and bear arms " is n't for individuals , but instead applies to state militias , such as National Guard units .
The U.S. Supreme Court repeatedly declined to hear appeals of those rulings , fueling the debate over gun control and tension between the law and public opinion .
Now , in a benchmark case that arises against a backdrop of election - year politics , the high court will take its first definitive look at the Second Amendment .
However the nine justices rule in the case , their decision will reshape the national debate over guns , a conflict that pits images of America 's history of frontier liberty against concerns about public safety .
" A Supreme Court decision has a moral , political and cultural meaning as well as a legal meaning , " says Temple University law professor David Kairys , who has long been in the thick of the debate over gun rights and firearms violence as a defender of gun restrictions .
" I think it is going to have a huge impact . "
The case tests the constitutionality of a handgun ban in Washington , D.C. , where in 1976 officials imposed one of the nation 's strictest gun-control laws in response to alarming levels of gun violence .
The justices will hear arguments on March 18 ; a ruling is likely by the end of June .
If the court decides there is an individual right to bear arms , it will be a huge victory for gun-rights advocates .
It would reverse years of legal precedent and embolden politicians and groups such as the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) that have touted gun rights .
It also likely would discourage new gun regulations and inspire challenges to other gun restrictions .
The possibility that the D.C. dispute could jeopardize a range of federal firearms laws — including those banning individuals from owning machine guns and those establishing rules for transporting weapons — has led the Bush administration to take a step back from its strong support of gun rights .
In 2001 , the administration reversed decades of Justice Department positions when then - attorney general John Ashcroft said the Second Amendment did cover an individual right to have guns .
Now , with the D.C. case before the Supreme Court , the administration is n't taking such a hard line on an individual right to own and use guns , a stance pushed by the NRA and its allies .
Instead , the White House is urging the justices to adopt a legal standard that would protect an individual right to own guns but protect federal firearms laws .
University of Texas law professor Sanford Levinson , who believes the Second Amendment provides a right to individual ownership , says the government 's new position might be easier for the court to adopt .
Many legal analysts predict that the court led by conservative Chief Justice John Roberts is ready to declare some individual right to own guns .
Moderate conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy could be a key vote on the issue , as he has been for the past two years on the divided court .
" My assumption is that there are at least five votes for the proposition that the Second Amendment protects an individual right , " says Yale University law professor Jack Balkin .
" But just because you say there is an individual right , you have n't resolved the case . …
Is it an individual right to keep and bear arms that might be useful in militia service , a right to keep and bear arms that might be useful for self - defense , or both ? "
The shifting politics on guns Gun control was a recurring issue in the 1990s and deeply divided Democrats and Republicans , as Democrats typically favored strict controls on guns and Republicans stressed that people would be safer if they were allowed to arm themselves .
That has changed somewhat .
The Democratic and GOP candidates for president have differences on gun control , but Democrats are trying to appeal to those on each side of the debate .
That 's likely a reflection of Democratic leaders ' attempts to move their party 's stance on guns closer to that of most voters .
Neither Hillary Clinton nor Barack Obama has focused on gun control in their campaigns for the Democratic nomination .
When asked specifically about it in public forums , they voice modest support for new regulations and quickly add that the Second Amendment protects people 's gun rights .
" The Clinton and Obama campaigns know the public opinion data on the issue well , " says Karlyn Bowman , a senior fellow specializing in public opinion polls at the American Enterprise Institute .
" Opinion is complex , but the right to be able to own a gun seems to be firmly held , and I think that 's why both candidates say what they say . "
At a debate in January , Clinton acknowledged that she had dropped her support for the licensing of new gun owners and registration of new guns , which she advocated in 2000 when she ran for the U.S. Senate in New York .
She endorsed reinstating an assault - weapons ban , then added : " I believe in the Second Amendment .
People have a right to bear arms .
But I also believe that we can common - sensically approach this . "
Obama also said he no longer supported broad licensing and registering of firearms , as he did when he was in the Illinois Senate .
" We essentially have two realities when it comes to guns in this country .
You 've got the tradition of lawful gun ownership . …
And it is very important for many Americans to be able to hunt , fish , take their kids out , teach them how to shoot , " he said .
" And then you 've got the reality of public school students who get shot down on the streets of Chicago . "
Republican frontrunner Sen. John McCain has needed no such finessing of the issue .
He joined a congressional " friend of the court " brief in the D.C. case that vigorously endorses an individual right to have guns .
Courts at odds with public The Second Amendment says , " A well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed . "
Until recently , judges seized on the first part , the collective " militia " right , rather than the second clause , " the right of the people . "
The last time the Supreme Court took up a major gun-rights case was in 1939 .
That dispute , United States v. Miller , involved two men who were caught transporting an illegal sawed - off shotgun across state lines .
The court did not directly address the scope of the Second Amendment .
Yet its decision rested on the notion that the Second Amendment protects a collective right to firearms , not an individual right .
In the years since , most lower federal courts interpreted the Miller decision to mean there was no individual right to have firearms .
Last year , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia set the stage for the high court to weigh in when it ruled that the Second Amendment " protects an individual right to keep and bear arms … for such activities as hunting and self - defense . "
The appeals court invalidated D.C. 's ban on handguns in the home .
Attorneys for Dick Anthony Heller , a security guard who wanted to keep a handgun in his Washington home for self - defense and who helped start the case , urged the justices to affirm that decision .
Heller 's attorneys note that in America 's early days , colonists were bitter about the British king 's disarmament of the English population .
The attorneys say " the Second Amendment 's text thus … confirms the people 's right to arms . "
Lawyers for the D.C. government echo lower courts that have rejected such a notion : " The text and history of the Second Amendment conclusively refute the notion that it entitles individuals to have guns for their own private purposes . "
D.C. officials say they banned handguns because such weapons " are disproportionately linked to violent and deadly crime . "
The Bush administration 's shifting stance on gun control has added political drama to the case .
Ashcroft 's position seven years ago made him a hero to the 4 million - member NRA , which put him on the cover of its monthly magazine and called him a " breath of fresh air to freedom - loving gun owners . "
The next year , in 2002 , Justice Department lawyers said that any government regulation of gun rights should be subject to the highest level of judicial scrutiny , which would make it harder to enact gun laws .
Now , the Bush administration is siding with Heller in a" friend of the court " brief — but with a large caveat .
Justice Departmentlawyers have backed off their earlier position and now say gun regulation should be subjected to a lesser level of scrutiny that would allow far more regulation than the 2002 stance .
The reason is explained in the first line of the administration 's court brief : " Congress has enacted numerous laws regulating firearms . "
Current laws ban private ownership of machine guns and limit possession of firearms that can go undetected by metal detectors or X - ray machines .
Laws also regulate the manufacture , sale and importation of firearms .
Vice President Cheney , a hunting enthusiast , broke with the administration and signed a brief with a majority of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives urging a high threshold for gun regulation .
Levinson believes the Justice Department 's stance could appeal to most of the high court as well as the public .
" I think laws that pass with genuine public support are likely to be upheld , " he says .
Kairys , who has helped cities sue gunmakers for the costs of firearms violence , says gun-control laws could be hurt by any court finding of an individual right .
If the court does that , he says , " It 's going to be very hard to get any ( gun control ) legislation passed . "
Adds Balkin , " There is no reason to believe the court 's decision will defuse the battle over guns .
The court rarely has the last word in major social controversies .
If the court rules for D.C. , there will be continuing agitation by gun-rights advocates .
If the court rules against D.C. , there will be new waves of litigation " over what the ruling means .
Enlarge By Dennis Cook , AP Attorney general John Aschroft in 2001 said Second Amendment covers an individual right to guns , reversing earlier Justice Department positions .

Citigroup 's sub - prime losses so far are second only to those at UBS US banking giant Citigroup has said it wants to sell $ 400 bn ( £ 205 bn ) of assets over the next three years as part of its bid to return to profit .
It has $ 500bn of " legacy assets " that it wants to reduce to $ 100bn .
Since late 2007 , Citigroup has raised more than $ 36bn in capital to fund its losses and write - downs from sub - prime mortgages and other debt .
Last week , it announced plans to sell $ 3bn worth of new shares to bolster its financial position .
That came shortly after it issued $ 6bn of preferred shares .
Further losses ?
It lost just under $ 15 bn for the six months to the end of March , and its write - downs are second only to UBS .
Legacy assets are long - held or even sleeping assets - including businesses - that have been accumulated by the group over time , but are now considered non-core .
As part of the new plan , Citigroup also hopes to achieve annual net revenue growth of 10 % from core operations , including credit card operations , consumer banking , securities and banking , and wealth management .
In an attempt to reduce costs , the firm has also announced job cuts of some 13,200 since the credit crisis struck .
Even if the bank has seen the worst of the credit crisis , many analysts say there is still likely to be more to come .
Analyst Mike Mayo of Deutsche Bank estimated on Thursday that Citigroup 's $ 29bn mortgage investments and related products could lead to a further $ 15 bn write - down .
Citigroup also said on Friday that it expected revenue over the next two to three years to grow 9 % but shares in the firm closed 2.8 % lower , reversing earlier gains .

What Can True Christians ™ Do to Help Speed Up Global Warming So Jesus Comes Back Quicker ?
Sermon by Pastor Deacon Fred
As True Bible believing Christians™ , we have a much better understanding about the fate of this planet than any Biologist , Environmentalist , or so - called scientist because we have a personal relationship with the Fellow who created this whole place to begin with !
Friends , as True Christians ™ then , being familiar with the Holy Bible gives you more authority than anyone who holds a post - graduate degree !
That 's something to be proud of - do n't wince about it !
And do n't let people call you crazy !
God 's Holy Scriptures give the poorest farmer 's servant in our congregation the power to win an argument with a Bio - Chemist , or a Nuclear Physicist - without even knowing a lick about what them folks studied in their fancy secular universities !
What these ignorant unsaved , over - educated folks do n't understand is that they can gather all the data , all the research and present all the facts they care to collect about any subject under the sun - but when you hold it next to child - like faith in the Almighty God , the most learned Evolutionist or Environmentalist , will widen their blind eyes in awe , and cower in fear at the truth of God 's Word !
Praise Jesus !
For the simple truth , we need only look to our old children 's Sunday School song , " He 's Got the Whole World in His Hands ! "
Oh , GLORY !
All this hub - bub about conserving energy , and protecting the environment is enough to make me want to pull my hair out !
How about you ?
Why should we give a lick if our thermometers are edging up a bit , when the Lord promised He is going to turn the whole dang planet into a fire ball any minute now ?
Who is going to protect the ice cubes in Greenland then , my friends ?
Satan is sending out a false anxiety , and misdirected mass - hysteria about the environment !
The roots of these phony fears are planted deeply into so - called " facts " which sprout from poisonous seeds between the hot - rocks scattered across the sandy shores of the Lake of Fire .
Its Satan 's way of slapping Jesus in the face while he still has a chance !
A-men ?
The only fact these folks should really be afraid of is the fact that if they do n't believe in Jesus Christ , that our loving God is going to roast them alive in Hell for eternity !
Now , if you ask me - I 'd be much more concerned about what is going to happen to me for eternity than I am about what 's going to happen to me in the next few years !
A-men ?
God teaches us in the Bible that " thinking " and " worrying " is an absolute waste of time !
Take no thought for your life , what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink ; nor yet for your body , what ye shall put on .
Is not the life more than meat , and the body than raiment ?
Behold the fowls of the air : for they sow not , neither do they reap , nor gather into barns ; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them .
Are ye not much better than they ?
Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature ?
- Matthew 6:25
Anyone who has read the Bible and believes every word will agree that worrying about our environment and trying to conserve energy ( among other things ) is an act of defiance against the Living God .
Friends , the Lord will take care of everything .
God made the Earth and the Heavens and if He wants to destroy it all , He will !
In fact , one of the things that makes folks True Christians ™ in the first place is that we are PRAYING for the destruction of this planet .
You see , God actually wants us to use up all the resources , because when everything is gone , it will signal the return of sweet Jesus to come kill all the Muslims , Catholics , Mormons , Hindus and Tree - Hugger - know - it - alls .
If we do n't end the world , God will just end it Himself .
We 've got to do our duty to speed up the process .
The Bible says that God has given the world and everything in it for man to use .
God wants us to do with it whatever we please !
From Genesis , Chapter 1:26 we learn that God has given us dominion over " every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth ! "
So much for endangered species !
That 's why we have an Endangered Species Dinner each year here at Landover !
To celebrate God 's love for wild game hunters !
And show that God has given us any species or plant we want to eat , even if it happens to be the last of its kind !
Amen ?
In Genesis Chapter 1:29 , the Lord continues letting us know that he has given us " every herb bearing seed , which is upon the face of the earth . "
And we just learned recently that plants create the air we breathe .
God is telling us then , that we can use up the air in any way we see fit !
Once the air is gone , it just means that Jesus will come back , so the more pollution , the better !
Glory !
In verse 30 of the same chapter , He affirms the fact that we have dominion over " every single living thing on earth , " and our environment is a living thing !
Folks , that means we can do whatever we want with anything we like !
If we use it all up , we have to have faith that the Lord will return and provide for us again .
If you follow God 's rules , supply and demand does n't mean a lick .
I think I speak for the Lord here , when I say , " use it or lose it . "
Oh , ye of little faith !
Do n't you know that God can simply sweep his robe across the clouds and create clean air again , if He wills it ?
Friends ,
I 'm going to get a little controversial now , but someone has to speak the truth .
The sissy Christians who pick and choose whatever Bible verse they like to fit their latest agenda will burn in Hell and give off just as pleasing a scent to the nostrils of the Lord as any hell bound , America hating Muslim will .
It is these pansy , false Christians whose liberal ideas are polluting the spiritual truth of God 's Word .
I 'll say it now , and I 'll say it again and again !
If you are a True Christian™ , you should n't be recycling .
True Christians ™ should n't be attending Global Warming rallies , or be celebrating Earth Day .
True Christians ™ understand that worrying about such things , or supporting such efforts is in direct conflict with the Word of God !
Friends , we can sum up our Evangelical stand on " Conservation " by making all these fancy scientifical types understand one truth :
That is if Jesus can feed five thousand people with two stinky fish and five loaves of stale bread , He can certainly turn the lights back on and make clean air by just burping !
Oh , Glory !
Glory !
I ask that you share this message with your brothers and sisters in Christ who are not blessed enough to attend our Godly church .
Rebuke them strongly for taking an interest in the fate of our planet !
Tell them you are ashamed at their lack of faith and share some of the Scriptures I 've shared with you here .
Satan has shifted his trickery into high gear during these last days .
He 'll do anything he can do to deter you from keeping on the straight and narrow path to Heaven .
He is trying everything he can to make your mind wander into worldy concerns and get you to stop warning people about the only real threat to humanity !
That threat , we know from the New Testament is God 's threat !
Friends , getting a faster tan and a little extra sunshine from Global Warming , does n't hold a candle to having the skin boiled off one 's body by bubbling lava in the Lake of Fire !
And that fact , my Godly brothers and sisters in Christ , should be more disconcerting than anything Lucifer and his army of hook - nosed liberals and pointy - tailed demons can pull out of their fancy behinds !
Tenderloin cop gets neighborhood 's attention

Two years ago , right before Halloween , San Francisco Police Captain Gary Jimenez was put in charge of the Tenderloin Station .
Was that a trick or a treat ?
Certainly , Jimenez is n't your typical cop .
He can be unconventional , blunt and offbeat .
He 's come up with some comments that left the higher - ups wincing .
He 's also got some ideas - like his recent suggestion to start a Tenderloin safe injection center where drug addicts could shoot up under medical supervision - that have residents sputtering in opposition .
Yet in a strange way , Jimenez may be perfect for this difficult assignment .
Maybe someone who thinks outside the box is just what the Tenderloin needs .
The station has certainly had plenty of other captains : Jimenez is the fifth in 10 years .
But he seems to have found the formula to make this work .
" He 's kicking butt out there , " said Elaine Zamora , a retired attorney who owns her Tenderloin home and works as district manager of the North of Market / Tenderloin Community Benefit District .
" He 's a straight shooter who goes to meetings and is n't afraid to get up and talk .
I 'll bet ( Police Chief ) Heather Fong does n't always appreciate that , but we 'd fight tooth and nail to keep him . "
Nothing speaks to his success like the range of support .
He 's received breathless praise from Randy Shaw , a firebrand blogger and executive director of the Tenderloin Housing Clinic .
And when Jimenez joined the fight to get a full service post office in the Tenderloin , even often - combative Supervisor Chris Daly became a supporter .
Most importantly , the captain has earned widespread community support because he attends all the meetings , walks the streets , and chats up nearly everyone .
" I see him everywhere , 24/7 , " said San Francisco Hilton public relations director Debbie Larkin .
" I do n't know when he goes home . "
The odd part is that Jimenez is anything but a cautious department politician .
He 's the first to admit that he sometimes starts his mouth before he engages his brain .
" Oh yeah , " he said .
" All the time . "
As proof he points to a Post - it note he 's placed under the glass on top of his desk that says , " Positive spin . "
Jimenez said he wrote that out during a phone call with central command when it was suggested that he be a little more upbeat and less blunt about some of the issues facing the Tenderloin .
Good luck with that .
Jimenez jokes that he is one of several SFPD officers who belong to the KMA club , meaning that he 's reached the point where he can retire any time .
If anybody gives him too much hassle , he can say " kiss my ass " and take off .
And that is just one example of why they call him " Crazy J . "
There are times when he comes up with some ideas that surprise some people .
For example , this week at his monthly community meeting , he drew a standing - room - only crowd of some 50 residents for his proposal to put a safe injection center in the Tenderloin .
Such a center would let drug addicts inject their drugs in a medically supervised environment without fear of arrest .
The idea is to cut down on fatal overdoses and to keep used needles off the street .
It is an interesting idea , and one that 's been proposed in other city neighborhoods , but never before by a police captain .
" I do n't know that I 'm right , " Jimenez admitted , " but I 'm creating the dialogue .
I think we need to talk about this stuff . "
Although no one is sure where the idea will lead , a proposal is being drafted , and Jimenez said he'd like to see the neighborhood give it a three - month trial .
Pending approval and funding , of course .
And , if you 've got a minute , he 'd also like to discuss crime in the Tenderloin .
You know how the residents there are committing lots of crimes ?
There 's only one thing wrong with that , Jimenez said - it 's dead wrong .
Pointing to a 3 - inch - thick stack of police reports that comprise a single day 's arrest record for drug sales , trespassing , and public nuisance , Jimenez makes a wager .
" I 'll bet not one of these people live in the Tenderloin , " he said .
" You hear about people saying someone is fresh off the boat ?
My problem is fresh off the BART . "
As it turned out , he did find a Tenderloin resident .
Just one in the stack .
As of Wednesday , Jimenez said , his team has made 2,550 arrests since the first of the year and he guesses that 90 percent of them are not Tenderloin residents .
However , that does n't mean that he is n't dealing with large numbers of people camping on the street or using the sidewalk as a rest room .
He said he promised his supervisors that he wo n't say he 's frustrated , but issuing hundreds of citations to violators , only to see them dismissed , is discouraging .
The people who get the citations usually drop them off with homeless advocates who then work to get the case dismissed , he said .
" Sometimes we write a guy up and he 'll say , ' Officer , why do you bother ? ' " Jimenez said .
" He 's right . "
But do n't get the idea that Jimenez wants to lock everyone up .
When neighbors at his Tuesday night meeting began to talk about making more arrests and cracking down on drug use , Jimenez gave them a dose of reality .
" People want to take the hard line , " he said .
" Well , I 'm the hard line .
And I have been my whole career .
One thing I do know , under the present system , arresting people is not the answer .
We do it , and we do n't have a problem with it , but it does n't seem to be the answer . "
And what is the answer ?
Jimenez is the first to admit he does n't know .
But , unlike a lot of guys who are playing it safe , he 's not afraid to ask the tough questions .

The savage travesty is unraveling Share This :

The FLDS is one of those litmus tests by which you can separate true libertarians ( who believe that rights apply to ALL individuals ) from those who believe rights apply only to the nice people of the world .
You know , OUR sort .

Law professor Eugene Volokh on The Volokh Conspiracy provides his usual invaluable legal perspective in blogging : Future Legal Action Against the Texas Polygamists ?
I should stress that many of the Texas FLDS members may still be in huge legal trouble , despite the conclusion that the raid was illegal ( and likely unconstitutional ) as to many of the children .
He proceeds to elaborate on the possible legal challenges facing the FLDS sect .
Indeed , although the appeals court ruling means that hearings on the childrens ' custody were suspended , it is not at all clear that the children will be returned .
It all depends on the next move by the State of Texas .
Damn the soul of each and every individual who collectively are known as the Texas Child Protective Services .
Meanwhile , I am disturbed to see some " libertarians " seem disappointed by the ( probably ) foiled kidnapping attempt by the state .
Yesterday , Timothy Sandefur wrote of the appeal court 's ruling ,
It looks pretty devastating , and correct .
This is really the worst possible outcome .
The clumsiness of the state 's actions has already made many members of the public sympathize with the FLDS , and see them as a persecuted , if somewhat idiosyncratic group of harmless folk .
They are in reality something much more sinister than that , but incidents like this make it harder to police their activities .
As the correspondent who brought Sandefur 's comments to my attention cynically said , " It 's always great when a self - described libertarian bemoans a defeat for the police state .
" But , for the record , I will reiterate .
I do n't like the FLDS religious sect .

The savage travesty of power that removed over 450 children from a polygamous compound in Texas is starting to unravel and be revealed as an utter , brutal sham .
The Salt Lake Tribune , which ( unsurprisingly ) has provided the most interesting accounts of the polygamist sect 's ordeal , reported on yesterday 's ruling by the 3rd Circuit appeals court .
The SLT stated ,
In its unanimous nine - page decision , the three - judge panel said the Department of Family and Protective Services ' case was legally and factually insufficient and 51st District Judge Barbara Walther acted improperly when she ordered about 450 children to stay in state custody .
The court said the state failed in a mass April 17 - 18 hearing to prove any of its key claims that the sect 's beliefs , communal households or underage marriages put every child in the community " in urgent " danger .

He was told that the military were not prepared to spend large sums of money on locating the liner , but they did want to know what had happened to the submarines .
Officials were anxious to find out how the nuclear reactors had fared after being under water for so long .
Young Catholic priests who download sermons from the internet to save themselves the trouble of writing their own have been told that they could be prosecuted for plagiarism .
The warning was issued by a leading Polish priest , and has been taken up by Catholic newspapers around the world .
Father Wieslaw Przyczyna claims that , on many Saturday evenings , there is a surge of visitors to websites offering ready - made sermons .
He believes that the users are internet - savvy young priests who cannot be bothered to compose their own work in time for Sunday service .
The trend has even been picked up by parishioners who download the same sermons and take them to church so that they can follow the priest 's words .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Other Catholics have turned their anger on Fr Przyczyna for drawing attention to the problem , accusing him of " harassing priests and exposing their weaknesses " .
He , however , is in no mood to back down .
" If a priest takes another person 's text and presents it as his own from the pulpit , without pointing out where he got it from , this is unethical and against the law protectting authorship , " he told the Catholic News Service .
" Unfortunately , the practice has become common here .
People realise priests are often not speaking for themselves but merely reading someone else 's sermon .
" Owners of sermon websites have noticed increased use on Saturday nights , suggesting some priests are trying to rescue themselves at the last moment by finding a text to read out at the next day 's Mass . "
Fr Przyczyna suggested that , even when they are not plagiarising someone else 's work , the sermons of many young priests are less than inspiring .
" People do n't want to hear patriotic , romantic speeches today – they get enough politics from the media and come to church for a break , " he said .
" But there 's also been a certain jauntiness and superficiality and a tendency for preachers to choose easy options .
The homilies are often unreal and do n't deal with issues affecting the lives of real congregations .
Priests should speak to people as they really are , not virtual people . "
Fr Przyczyna , who heads the religious communication department at the Krakow Papal Theology Academy , has co-authored a book , To Pinch or Not to Pinch with Tomasz Naganowski , a specialist in press law .
The book warns that publicly using texts without permission or acknowledgement could lead to prosecution and up to three years in jail .

Senator Barack Obama is poised to reach a milestone in the presidential race on Tuesday by capturing a majority of pledged delegates , but he said he would not declare victory against Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton or suggest the Democratic primary should end until the final three contests are finished on June 3 .
For Mr. Obama , the situation is delicate .
While eager to proceed to a general election match with Senator John McCain of Arizona , the likely Republican nominee , Mr. Obama is also trying to bring the contest to a close in a way that allows him to win over Mrs. Clinton ’s supporters and unify the party .
For her part , Mrs. Clinton is making a counterargument that she is winning the popular vote if Florida and Michigan are counted , and that the party ’s leaders should take that into consideration before deciding which candidate to support .
The results from the Kentucky and Oregon primaries on Tuesday will almost certainly allow Mr. Obama to reach a threshold that his campaign has long sought to establish as the critical measure of the will of the party : winning a majority of the delegates awarded in primaries and caucuses .
He also continues to gather support from the party leaders known as superdelegates that he still needs to secure the nomination , picking up five more endorsements on Monday .
Sweden is on the verge of passing a far - reaching wiretapping program that would greatly expand the government 's spying capabilities by permitting it to monitor all email and telephone traffic coming in and out of the country .
So far , hacks from the mainstream Swedish press seem to be on holiday , so news about the proposed law is woefully hard to come by .
That leaves us turning to this summary from the decidedly partisan Swedish Pirate Party for details .
We 'd prefer to rely on a more neutral group , but that was n't possible this time .
According to them , here 's a broad outline :
The En anpassad försvarsunderrättelseverksamhet bill ( which loosely translates to " a better adapted military intelligence gathering " ) gives Sweden 's National Defence Radio Establishment ( FRA ) direct access to the traffic passing through its borders .
Now remember , we 're talking about the internet , which frequently routes packets though multiple geographically dispersed hops before they reach their final destination .
This all but guarantees that emails and voice over IP ( VoIP ) calls between Swedes will routinely be siphoned into a massive monitoring machine .
And we would n't be surprised if traffic between parties with no tie to the country regularly passes through Sweden 's border as well , and that too would be fair game .
( For example , email sent from a BT address in London to Finland is likely to pass through Sweden first . )
Once intercepted , the data will be searched for certain keywords , and those that contain the words will be pulled aside for additional scrutiny .
A broad array of organizations will have use of the system , including the Department of Transportation , the Department of Agriculture , the police , secret service and customs , and in some cases major businesses .
The bill allows Swedes to be singled out , as well .
When the bill was introduced in early 2007 , Google was reportedly so concerned about its consequences for privacy that it threatened to limit its ties to the country if the measure passed .
" We have contacted Swedish authorities to give our view of the proposal and we have made it clear that we will never place any servers inside Sweden 's borders if the proposal goes through , " Peter Fleischer , Google 's global privacy counsel , said last year , according to this article .
" We simply cannot compromise our users ' integrity by allowing Swedish authorities access to data that may not even concern Swedish activity . "
But so far , few outside of the pro-privacy universe have bothered to discuss the bill this time around .
There have been no similar pronouncements from Google and representatives there did n't respond to a request for comment .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation has likewise been reticent about the bill .
" Surprisingly enough , there has n't been that much written about it , even in the Swedish media , " said Patrik Runald , a Swedish national and a security response manager for F - Secure who works in San Jose , California .
" The funny thing is when asked what do you want to look for , [ backers of the bill ] do n't really specify what they 're interested in , " he continued .
" It 's a very broad bill .
They basically can interpret whatever they like . "
One of the few recent press mentions of the bill came from a publication called Cellular News in London .
According to this story , Nordic and Baltic telecommunications provider TeliaSonera planned to move email servers out of Sweden to protect the privacy of its Finnish customers .
The bill is scheduled to come up for a vote on June 17 .
According to the Swedish Pirate Party , a majority of parliament currently backs the bill . ®
Two monkeys with tiny sensors in their brains have learned to control a mechanical arm with just their thoughts , using it to reach for and grab food and even to adjust for the size and stickiness of morsels when necessary , scientists reported on Wednesday .
The report , released online by the journal Nature , is the most striking demonstration to date of brain - machine interface technology .
Scientists expect that technology will eventually allow people with spinal cord injuries and other paralyzing conditions to gain more control over their lives .
The findings suggest that brain - controlled prosthetics , while not practical , are at least technically within reach .
In previous studies , researchers showed that humans who had been paralyzed for years could learn to control a cursor on a computer screen with their brain waves and that nonhuman primates could use their thoughts to move a mechanical arm , a robotic hand or a robot on a treadmill .

Some of them are buried deep in the Caucasus mountains , others are lurking in abandoned salt mines underneath forgotten villages , yet others are set up deep underwater in Lake Baikal - all are fully functional , facilitating cutting - edge research , with scientific progress routinely made on glaringly obsolete equipment .
Neutrino Detection - deep under Ukrainian village
The slightly creepy " Deep Underground Detection Facility " is located inside salt mines near the city Artemovsk ( Donbass region ) and maintained by the Russian Institute for Nuclear Research ( RAS ) :
The entry into the mines ( and caverns with a 100 - ton particle detector ) looks almost surreal - just a door in a typical Ukrainian country cottage !
One would never guess that a huge Scintillation Neutrino Telescope & Detector " hides " at the depth of 600 meters under the almost - deserted village -
Enter into the cottage , though , and you 'll see some scientific equipment and a 30 year old TV set :
The bizarre thing about this facility is that it even has a deep underground Orthodox Church in a chilly cave :
And ... some seriously creepy statues ( or remains ? ) of miners , standing along the walls -

Into the Tunnels ! - Baksan Neutrino Observatory
Danila is one of the most active members of the Russian urban exploring community .
Among his recent adventures - getting inside the tunnels and checking out Baksan Underground Scintillation Telescope , buried deep within a mountain .
With his exclusive permission , here are some photos of that fascinating facility :
Baksan Neutrino Observatory ( BNO ) is situated in the Baksan gorge in the Caucasus ( Kabardino - Balkaria Republic ) .
It 's maintained by the Russian Institute for Nuclear Research ( RAS ) and includes Baksan Underground Scintillation Telescope ( BUST ) - at a depth of more than 300 m from the surface .
Link for Google Maps - click here .
Most of it is located in two caverns connected by a tunnel system inside Andyrchi Mountain ; tunnels were dug by the Moscow Metro builders in 1978 .
Part of the huge Scintillation Telescope , with various sensor set -ups :
Upper and lower levels - they remind me of the egg - hatching room in " Aliens " -
This is the main entry -
And the secondary entry ( note the Moscow Metro symbol above ) -
The only way to the facility is across this bridge :
This is an avalanche hazard zone : check out this stone , brought by a rogue avalanche not long ago ( three people perished here ) -
Note also the Cold War Phone ( one of the models we covered in this article ) -

The facility depicted here is not even the deepest .
That honor goes to the Underground Laboratory of Gallium - Germanium Neutrino Telescope ( GGNT ) - it 's buried 3.5 kilometers deep in the mountain rock .

Large - scale Research Facility Near Moscow
Another experiment , called Troitsk Neitrino Mass Experiment is located in a facility 20 km from Moscow .
( more info here ) - it 's designed to measure the the mass of a neutrino using unique high - resolution beta - spectrometer on the basis of a large superconducting magnetic trap :

Moscow Meson Factory - ( Man , I love that name ... more info about it here ) also includes high intensity linear accelerator , and isotope production facility .
It was awarded the 2001 Russian Federation Government Prize for the work on development and construction of the accelerator :

---------------------
A Telescope In the World 's Deepest Lake
RAS also has another facility , literally inside Lake Baikal - a Deep Underwater Neutrino Telescope ( BDUNT ) - situated at a depth of 1200 m. in the lake .
It 's intended to study the high - energy muon and neutrino fluxes in the cosmic rays , which should shed the light on " magnetic monopoles and massive particles " and " dark " matter .
It 's surely one of the world 's largest high energy neutrino detectors - more than one thousand square meters detection area .

Be careful when fishing in Baikal in these parts - you just might hook up a whole building - block size antenna .

As you can see , scientific research in Russia is fraught with unexpected adventure and hidden challenges .
It also provides a fairly large exploring ground for adventurous photographers .

A new Zogby poll released today revealed that very little has changed for both Democratic candidates in North Carolina and Indiana .
In North Carolina Obama has a 16 point lead over Clinton 50 % - 34 % , but in Indiana , the candidates are still deadlocked 42 % - 42 % with 9 % not sure .
In North Carolina , Obama leads with African Americans ( 73 % - 10 % ) , men ( 57% -30 % ) , and women ( 44% - 37 % ) , while Clinton leads with white voters 47 % - 37 , but Obama leads with every age group except voters over 70 .
It is clear to see why Obama is heading for a big victory in the Tar Heel State .
Indiana is a much different story .
Holding true to form , Obama leads among younger voters and Clinton with the older crowd .
The key swing block could be middle aged votes ( 35 - 54 ) .
They currently favor Obama 48 % - 41 .
Obama leads in Northern Indiana , which is closer to Chicago , and Clinton leads in Southern Indiana which is closer to Ohio .
Advertisements
Much of the same dissatisfaction that we saw with Obama among Pennsylvania Clinton supporters is also present in Indiana , but the Obama supporters are now saying that they wo n’t vote for Clinton if she is the nominee .
20 % of Democrats surveyed said in a Clinton - McCain matchup , they would vote for McCain. 21 % of Democrats said that in a Obama - McCain matchup they would vote for McCain .
What this tells me is that the negative tone of the Democratic campaign is taking a toll on both candidates , while John McCain ’s free pass is making him look attractive to many Democrats who have grown weary of the constant negativity in the Democratic race .
It is pretty clear that on Tuesday all eyes will be on Indiana .
Obama will either finish Clinton off there , or this race will continue to drag down the Party .

SINGAPORE , April 28 ( Reuters ) -
Oil prices powered to an all - time peak near $ 120 a barrel on Monday on renewed supply fears , prompting investors to move into other commodities , such as metals and agricultural products .
However , investors may hold off taking large positions before the U.S. Federal Reserve ’s interest rates decision on Wednesday , when it is expected to cut rates by a quarter percentage point from the current 2.25 percent .
[ ID :nN27414714 ]
U.S. light crude for June delivery CLc1 struck a record of $ 119.93 a barrel , as a strike closed a major British oil pipeline and as new violence in Nigeria reignited supply fears .
[ ID:nL28561802 ]
“ Supply - side concerns underpinned the oil price , ” said David Moore , a commodity strategist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia .
Oil has risen five - fold since 2002 , as booming demand from emerging markets such as China has coincided with long - term supply constraints and a slumping U.S. dollar .
The latter has has attracted speculative fund inflows into commodities .
Reflecting the strength of commodities , the Reuters - Jefferies CRB index .CRB of 19 commodity futures , which has already climbed 16 percent this year , rose 0.7 percent by 0634 GMT .
On Monday , the dollar climbed to a two - month high against the yen , but the bounce is unlikely to signal a reversal of its long - term downward direction .
As the dollar weakens relative to the yen , euro and pound , holders of these currencies gain more purchasing power over dollar - denominated goods .
Gold XAU= rose to $ 892.30/893.30 an ounce from $ 886.90/888.30 an ounce late in New York on Friday , as surging oil boosted the metal 's appeal as a hedge against inflation .
Copper , the leading industrial metal , also jumped , recovering from wobbling prices on Friday .
The July copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange SCFN8 jumped 1.3 percent to 65,780 yuan a tonne by midday , helped by a strike in Chile and a bullish technical outlook .
[ ID :nSP170886 ]
The strike in Chile , the world ’s largest copper producer , entered its 13th day on Monday .
Codelco ’s Andina and Salvador divisions remained shut , a company source said over the weekend , but the Teniente underground mine reopened on Saturday .
[ ID :nN27485651 ]
In agriculture , corn futures CK8 rose more 2.6 percent , while soybeans Sc1 were up 0.9 percent and wheat Wc1 rose 1.1 percent .
Rice futures RRN8 rose 0.5 percent despite mixed trade in Chicago in the previous session .
Continued strong demand from Asia also helped Thai rice prices despite the CBOT sell - off .
[ ID : nBKK123091 ]
Vietnam banned rice speculation after a surge in buying over the weekend in southern Vietnam but said it had sufficient stocks for domestic consumption and exports .
[ ID : nHAN94623 ]
The ban is the latest sign of growing unease over food supplies around Asia , where some governments have been spooked by the possibility of a shortfall in staple rice and a three - fold price increase caused by export curbs by key suppliers including Vietnam .

Here are Nassim Taleb ’s top 10 life tips , all worthwhile , from this profile :
1. Skepticism is effortful and costly .
It is better to be sceptical about matters of large consequences , and be imperfect , foolish and human in the small and the aesthetic .
2 . Go to parties .
You ca n’t even start to know what you may find on the envelope of serendipity .
If you suffer from agoraphobia , send colleagues .
3 . It ’s not a good idea to take a forecast from someone wearing a tie .
If possible , tease people who take themselves and their knowledge too seriously .
4 . Wear your best for your execution and stand dignified .
Your last recourse against randomness is how you act — if you ca n’t control outcomes , you can control the elegance of your behaviour .
You will always have the last word .
5 . Do n’t disturb complicated systems that have been around for a very long time .
We do n’t understand their logic .
Do n’t pollute the planet .
Leave it the way we found it , regardless of scientific ‘ evidence ’ .
6. Learn to fail with pride — and do so fast and cleanly .
Maximise trial and error — by mastering the error part .
7. Avoid losers .
If you hear someone use the words ‘ impossible ’ , ‘ never ’ , ‘ too difficult ’ too often , drop him or her from your social network .
Never take ‘ no ’ for an answer ( conversely , take most ‘ yeses ’ as ‘ most probably ’ ) .
8 . Do n’t read newspapers for the news ( just for the gossip and , of course , profiles of authors ) .
The best filter to know if the news matters is if you hear it in cafes , restaurants … or ( again ) parties .
9 . Hard work will get you a professorship or a BMW .
You need both work and luck for a Booker , a Nobel or a private jet .
10 .
Answer e-mails from junior people before more senior ones .
Junior people have further to go and tend to remember who slighted them .

We mentioned the rumored " compromise " bill concerning telecom immunity earlier this week , and now it appears that leaders of both the House and the Senate have agreed to wording in the bill which will be brought to the floor today .
From the sound of it , it 's exactly what we feared : Congress has effectively given in to the administration , allowing it to grant immunity to any telco .
Apparently , all that talk about not allowing the worst of this bill to go through was just talk .
It 's difficult to know where to begin in reviewing this " deal . "
It 's hardly a compromise -- it 's a get out of jail free card .
To summarize : it appears quite likely that various telcos broke a very clear law in providing wiretaps to the government without a warrant ( as required under FISA ) .
Despite what you might hear , this hasto do with emergency wiretaps where there was n't time to go the warrants .
Under existing law , in such cases , it 's possible to get the wiretap and get the warrant within a few days .
However , in many cases , it appears no warrant was ever sought .
The fact that the telcos approved these wiretaps is almost certainly against the law -- and it seems that it should obviously be tried in a court of law to determine that specifically .
However , under this new law , Congress has basically given the President ( who ordered the wiretaps in the first place , and does n't want these trials to go forward since they may reveal that he broke the law too ) " get out of jail free " cards he can hand to each telco , saying that since he told them that the wiretaps were legal , the lawsuits no longer can proceed .
Basically , this puts the President above the law , lets him avoid trials that might prove that his activities broke the law and to reward telcos who broke the law at his command .
Even worse , the bill basically grants the administration the right to keep on spying without getting warrants .
Intelligence agencies will be able to demand various communications providers hand over communications without court approval and without naming the target , so long as they claim that the communications are " reasonably believed to involve a non-American who is outside the country . "
Seems rather wide open for abuse does n't it ?
This whole thing is fairly stunning , considering that it's an opposition Congress facing off against a weak administration .
Yet Congress basically gave the President exactly what he wanted , and made a mockery of the checks and balances our government was supposed to include .
This is allowing a President to say the law is whatever he says is the law , while destroying basic due process and civil liberties along the way .

Salmonella outbreak prompts FDA tomato warning CONTRA COSTA COUNTY
Health officials warned consumers Sunday about an outbreak of salmonella in raw tomatoes , after the illness of one woman in Contra Costa County and 144 other infections nationwide .
The source of the tomatoes is still unknown , but officials believe that large tomatoes , including Roma and round red , are carrying the strain , Salmonella sereotype Saintpaul , that has infected 145 people since mid-April .
Red plum tomatoes also may be affected , according to a statement by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration .
The FDA is recommending limiting raw tomato consumption to those that are not the likely source of the outbreak , including cherry tomatoes , grape tomatoes , tomatoes sold with their vine attached and homegrown tomatoes .
No one has died from the recent outbreak , though at least 23 people have been hospitalized .
The majority of the infections have occurred in New Mexico and Texas , but cases also have been reported in Arizona , Colorado , Connecticut , Idaho , Illinois , Indiana , Kansas , New Mexico , Oklahoma , Oregon , Utah , Virginia , Washington and Wisconsin .
The Contra Costa resident was not identified , but county health officials said Friday she is older than 35 , did not have to be hospitalized and has recovered .
Investigators are working to determine whether the woman contracted the illness locally or elsewhere .
She recently traveled to a state where several other cases have been reported , according a release issued by Contra Costa Health Services spokeswoman Kate Fowlie .
The department 's communicable disease program chief , Francie Wise , sought to downplay the significance of the illness in a statement released Friday , noting that the county normally averages about 123 cases every year .
Nevertheless , officials of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement Saturday that only three people were known to be infected with this particular strain of salmonella in 2007 .
Because the strain was so rare in past years , officials believe that the infected tomatoes were distributed through much of the United States , and that there are probably many more infections than the 145 reported .
Salmonella is characterized by diarrhea , fever and abdominal cramps that occur within 12 to 72 hours of infection .
The illness lasts four to seven days and is usually diagnosed by culturing a stool sample .
While most people do not need treatment , the disease can be dangerous to infants , elderly people and those with impaired immune systems .
Officials recommend consulting a health care provider if diarrhea lasts longer than two days in an adult , one day in a child younger than 4 , or eight hours in an infant .
Huckabee believes ' our heaven is duck hell , ' jokes Stewart David Edwards and Muriel Kane

Print This Email This The Daily Show 's " Cluster @#fuck to the White House " segment for Monday focused on the Republican presidential candidates ' appearances before the National Rifle Association last week .
" No candidate came with more baggage than Rudy Giuliani , " Jon Stewart said before playing an old clip of the former New York mayor criticizing the NRA 's opposition to a ban on assault weapons .
" Now that Giuliani 's running for national office , he 's pro-gun .
Hard stance to reconcile .
I only hope some event occurred between then and now that he could say caused him to rethink his position . "
" I also think that there have been subsequent intervening events , " Giuliani told the NRA , " September 11 , which cast somewhat of a different light on the Second Amendment . "
" And while what he just said does n't seem to make any sense whatsoever with regard to the events of September 11 , " commented Stewart , " it does speak to the tragedy that is 9/11 Tourette's .
' Wo n't you 9/11 help us 9/11 , because 9/11 is a terrible 9/11 to 9/11 ? ' "
Stewart 's remark was a reference to Tourette 's syndrome , a genetic disability which causes nervous tics and results in a small percentage of sufferers inserting random obscenities into their sentences .
Stewart turned next to a clip of Governor Mike Huckabee gushing enthusiastically , " I 'm pretty sure there will be duck - hunting in heaven and I can't wait ! "
" Are you saying our heaven is duck hell ? " asked Stewart .
" Is there any place a duck can go to not get shot ? ...
Governor , your mix of spiritualism and blood lust intrigues me . "
Stewart then concluded with Huckabee reminiscing , " Somehow the angels took that bullet and went right to the antelope , and my hunt was over in a wonderful way . "

With all of the negative press surrounding hip - hop music , rappers often complain about the media taking their lyrics out of context , to make them seem more violent or misogynistic than they really are .
As a journalistic institution built on a foundation of honesty and integrity , we would never stoop to such lows .

Today I had a great con­ver­sa­tion with Mar­tin Buschkuehl , one of the Uni­ver­si­ty of Michi­gan Cog­ni­tive Neu­roimag­ing Lab researchers involved in the cog­ni­tive train­ing study that has received much media atten­tion ( New York Times , Wired , Sci­ence News … ) since late April , when the study was pub­lished at the Pro­ceed­ings of the Nation­al Acad­e­my of Sci­ences .

Improv­ing Flu­id Intel­li­gence With Train­ing on Work­ing Mem­o­ry .
Pro­ceed­ings of the Nation­al Acad­e­my of Sci­ences of the Unit­ed States of Amer­i­ca , 105 ( 19 ) , 6829 –6833 ( You can read it here , with sub­scrip­tion ) .
Before you keep read­ing , let me clar­i­fy a cou­ple of terms :
- “ Work­ing Mem­o­ry ” is the abil­i­ty to hold sev­er­al units of infor­ma­tion in our minds and manip­u­late them in real time .
For exam­ple , imag­ine I ask you to remem­ber , and then say back­wards , the 7 dig­its of my phone num­ber .
- “ Flu­id intel­li­gence ” can be described as the abil­i­ty to deal with new chal­lenges and new prob­lems , those that we encounter for the first time .
Dr. Buschkuehl , nice to talk to you .
Can you first pro­vide us with some con­text on your research ?
My col­lab­o­ra­tor Susanne Jaeg­gi and I start­ed our train­ing work four years ago in the Lab of Prof. Wal­ter Per­rig at the Uni­ver­si­ty of Bern , Switzer­land .
Now we are both Post Docs in Prof. John Join­des Lab at the Uni­ver­si­ty of Michi­gan .
We devel­oped a com­plex com­put­er­ized task and have tried it in a num­ber of stud­ies .
We report­ed our results in two unpub­lished dis­ser­ta­tions , but this is the first time it has been pub­lished in a peer - reviewed jour­nal .
Could you please explain the train­ing involved in this par­tic­u­lar study ?
We recruit­ed 70 stu­dents aged around 26 years and set half of them on a chal­leng­ing com­put­er - based cog­ni­tive train­ing reg­i­men , based on the so - called “ n‑back task . ”
This is a very com­plex work­ing mem­o­ry task that involves the simul­ta­ne­ous pre­sen­ta­tion of visu­al and audi­to­ry stim­uli .
The exper­i­men­tal group watched a series of screens on their com­put­ers , where a blue square appeared in var­i­ous posi­tions on a black back­ground .
Each screen appeared for half a sec­ond , with a 2.5 sec­ond gap before the next one appeared .
While this hap­pened , the trainees also heard a series of let­ters that were read out at the same rate .
At first , stu­dents had to say if either the screen or the let­ter matched those that popped up two cycles ago .
The num­ber of cycles increased or decreased depend­ing on how well the stu­dents per­formed the task .
The stu­dents sat through about twen­ty - five min­utes of train­ing per day for either 8 , 12 , 17 or 19 days , and were test­ed on their flu­id intel­li­gence before and after the reg­i­men using the Bochumer - Matrizen Test ( this is a prob­lem - solv­ing task based on the same prin­ci­ple as the very well known Raven ’s Advanced Pro­gres­sive Matri­ces .
How­ev­er , it is more dif­fi­cult and there­fore espe­cial­ly suit­ed for aca­d­e­m­ic sam­ples ) .
What were the results ?
Par­tic­i­pants in the exper­i­men­tal group did sig­nif­i­cant­ly bet­ter on the flu­id intel­li­gence test ( which was not direct­ly trained ) than par­tic­i­pants in the con­trol group .
Those in the con­trol group had not gone through any train­ing .
The con­trol group did improve slight­ly , but real “ trainees ” out­per­formed them ( see Fig­ure Xa ) .
Fur­ther­more , we found that the improve­ment was dose - depen­dent : the more they trained , the larg­er the gain on flu­id intel­li­gence .
Images : PNAS .
We just pub­lished a mar­ket report to cov­er the grow­ing brain fit­ness soft­ware mar­ket .
A com­mon ques­tion we get is , “ How are com­put­er­ized pro­grams like the one you used fun­da­men­tal­ly dif­fer­ent from , say , sim­ply doing many cross­word puz­zles ?
First , thank you for send­ing the report along .
Fas­ci­nat­ing to see what is start­ing to hap­pen in this field .
In terms of why our pro­gram worked , I could say that the pro­gram has some inher­ent prop­er­ties that are at least in this com­bi­na­tion unique to our train­ing approach .
Our pro­gram is :
Ful­ly adap­tive in real - time :
The per­son using the pro­gram is tru­ly pushed to his or her peak lev­el all the time , there­by “ stretch­ing ” the tar­get­ed abil­i­ty .
Com­plex :
We present a very com­plex task , mix­ing dif­fer­ent forms of stim­uli ( audi­to­ry , visu­al ) under time pres­sure .
Designed for Trans­fer­abil­i­ty :
The tasks can be designed in a way that do not allow for the devel­op­ment of task - spe­cif­ic “ strate­gies ” to beat the game .
One needs to tru­ly expand capac­i­ty , and this helps ensure the trans­fer of to non-trained tasks .
This is very dif­fer­ent from enhanc­ing task - spe­cif­ic capac­i­ties , such as mem­o­riz­ing lists of 100 num­bers , which have been shown not to nec­es­sar­i­ly trans­fer to relat­ed domains .
Can you give an exam­ple of the lack of trans­fer­abil­i­ty of oth­er train­ing meth­ods ?
In Eric­sson ’s clas­sic paper ( Eric­s­son , K. A. , & Delaney , P. F. ( 1998 ) .
Work­ing mem­o­ry and expert per­for­mance .
In R. H. Logie & K. J. Gilhooly ( Eds. ) , Work­ing Mem­o­ry and Think­ing ( pp. 93–114 ) .
Hills­dale , NJ : Erl­baum ) , peo­ple who could mem­o­rize 100 num­bers , using a vari­ety of mnemotec­nic tech­niques , could not get even close to 100 let­ters .
Remem­ber­ing num­bers did­ n’t trans­late into remem­ber­ing oth­er things , so it was ­ n’t a gen­er­al mem­o­ry capac­i­ty that had been improved .
What are the par­tic­u­lar aspects of the Uni­ver­si­ty of Michi­gan study that sur­prised you the most ?
First , the clear trans­fer into flu­id intel­li­gence , that many researchers and psy­chol­o­gists take as fixed .
Sec­ond , I was sur­prised to see that the more train­ing the bet­ter the out­come .
The improve­ments did not seem to peak ear­ly .
Third , that all trained groups improved , no mat­ter their respec­tive start­ing points .
In fact , stu­dents with low­est flu­id intel­li­gence seemed to improve the most .
But that was not the main focus of our study , so we can not say much more about it .
How did par­tic­i­pants describe the expe­ri­ence , and their ben­e­fits ?
Many liked the train­ing .
They saw the chal­lenge , and tried hard to push them­selves through the train­ing to see how far they could go .
We did not ana­lyze how the flu­id intel­li­gence gains trans­ferred into real life .
But from an anec­do­tal point of view , many par­tic­i­pants have shared sto­ries of how they per­ceive a major ben­e­fit .
Now they can fol­low lec­tures more eas­i­ly , under­stand math bet­ter etc .
There is a degree of arti­fi­cial con­tro­ver­sy these days in the media and the sci­en­tif­ic com­mu­ni­ty on the respec­tive ben­e­fits of phys­i­cal or men­tal exer­cise .
Your thoughts ?
We obvi­ous­ly need both .
Phys­i­cal exer­cise keeps the body in a good shape but espe­cial­ly in old­er peo­ple also leads to cog­ni­tive ben­e­fits .
Men­tal exer­cise , like the one we used , can enhance impor­tant abil­i­ties and is most like­ly the most effi­cient way to improve a spe­cif­ic cog­ni­tive process but also gen­er­al­izes to a broad­er range of skills , as we showed .
Research will need to help clar­i­fy who needs what type of exer­cise more .
Some peo­ple may get enough men­tal exer­cise through very com­plex jobs and what they need is phys­i­cal exer­cise .
For oth­ers , it may be the oppo­site .
What are your plans now ?
First , to con­duct fol­low - up research to ana­lyze the neur­al basis of the improve­ment via neu­roimag­ing stud­ies and try to mea­sure ben­e­fits in real life .
But our main hope is to be able to inves­ti­gate and devel­op appli­ca­tions for peo­ple who need it most : chil­dren with devel­op­ment prob­lems , stroke / TBI rehab , and old­er adults .
Also , let me note that there is a cross- plat­form appli­ca­tion avail­able ( Note : Here ) , that allows to train with the dual n‑back task and sev­er­al oth­er train­ing tasks that we devel­oped for oth­er stud­ies .
Although the appli­ca­tion is avail­able in Eng­lish , the Man­u­al and the Brain­Twister Web­site are not at the moment .
We are about to release an Eng­lish ver­sion , but unfor­tu­nate­ly I can­not give you a release date right now .
If the train­ing pro­gram is used for research ( i.e. a train­ing study ) , it is pro­vid­ed free of charge .
Mar­tin , many thanks for shar­ing your time and insights with us .
Please keep us informed of new devel­op­ments .
My plea­sure .
We will .

Valued for its meat and leather , the addax has declined due to uncontrolled hunting .
The Wildlife Conservation Society has released a list of the " Rarest of the Rare , " a dozen animals most in danger of extinction .
The eclectic list includes birds , mammals , fish , reptiles , amphibians , and insects .
Some are well known , such as the northern right whale and Sumatran rhino , while others are more obscure , including Abbot 's booby , an ocean - going bird that only nests on Christmas Island .
The animals were highlighted today because it is National Endangered Species Day .
They are :
Abbott 's booby : A large black - and - white seabird that breeds on Christmas Island , a remote Australian island in the Indian Ocean .
Addax : A nocturnal antelope species with long spiral horns , found the sand dunes of the Sahara desert .
Angel shark : Bottom - dwelling , nocturnal predators once common throughout the Northeast Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean and Black seas , but now critically endangered .
Bengal florican : A large terrestrial bustard bird native to Cambodia , Nepal , Vietnam , and India .
Black - faced lion tamarin : A small primate that sleeps in tree holes dug out by woodpeckers and feeds on insects , fruit , and plants .
Discovered on the island of Superagui , Brazil , in 1990 , there are now only 400 in the wild .
Burmese roofed turtle : One of Myanmar ’s seven native turtles , once abundant in the major rivers of central and southern Burma , threatened by hunting and egg poaching .
Dragonflies of Sri Lanka :
Of the 53 endemic species of dragonfly found in Sri Lanka , at least 20 are threatened .
Golden arrow poison frog :
An amphibian native to Panama , threatened by a highly - infectious fungal disease .
North Atlantic right whale : Hunted since the 10th century , only 350 of these slow - moving , 220,000 - pound ( 100,000 kg ) cetaceans remain .
Ricord 's iguana : A reptile native to two isolated locations in the arid southwestern Dominican Republic
Pygmy hippopotamus : A small hippo from the Upper Guinean Forest of Liberia , Guinea , Ivory Coast , and Sierra Leone .
Sumatran rhino :
Also known as the hairy or Asian two - horned rhinoceros , fewer than 300 survive today in the subtropical and tropical dry forests of Indonesia and Malaysia .
Threats to each species vary widely .
In the case of Abbot ’s booby , the introduction of yellow crazy ants to Easter Island has severely altered their nesting habitat .
Meanwhile , the addax has been severely impacted by desertification of its habitat and overhunting .
Other species suffer from diseases , as in the case of the golden arrow poison frog , or poaching for the Chinese medicinal trade , which has reduced the population of Sumatran rhinos to fewer than 300 individuals .
The 2007 World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) Red List revealed a continuing rise in the number of species threatened with extinction .
Although only a fraction of all plant and animal species have been evaluated , the number of species listed as threatened stands at 16,306 , an increase of 188 species since 2006 .
" ' Rarest of the Rare ' is a snapshot of just a handful of the most critically endangered species that serves to illustrate their plight and inspire the public to join the fight for their continued survival , " said Kent Redford , director of the Wildlife Conservation Society Institute .
Clinton strategists weigh ' nuclear option ' to take out Obama at convention RAW STORY
Published : Sunday May 4 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Sen. Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign claims to have a secret weapon up their sleeve .
According to a report Sunday , Clinton 's campaign could force the Democratic National Committee to seat Florida and Michigan , thereby potentially giving her the votes she needs to secure the Democratic nomination .
The climate , however , does n't appear to be ripe .
Campaign strategists tell Thomas Edsall of the Huffington Post that " any attempt to deploy it would require a sharp ( and by no means inevitable ) shift in the political climate within Democratic circles by the end of this month . "
This " nuclear option " -- the same term applied to a Republican effort in the Senate to destroy the chamber 's filibuster -- would likely cause chaos among the party , particularly among activists .
Because Clinton has 50 percent of the party 's Rules and Bylaws committee committed to her campaign , Edsall says , her backers could try to quickly pass a motion that would seat Florida 's 210 and Michigan 's 156 delegates .
This would give Clinton some 55 more delegates than Obama .
At present , Clinton likely can't catch up in sheer delegates without those two states .
Trouble is , the Democratic party sidelined the states because they broke Democratic National Committee rules , holding their primaries ahead of their scheduled slots .
Clinton also violated a promise not to campaign in Florida , giving her a potentially unfair edge .
" Using the Rules and Bylaws Committee to force the seating of two pro-Hillary delegations would provoke a massive outcry from Obama forces , " Edsall writes .
" First ... Clinton would have to win Indiana and lose North Carolina by a very small margin .
Second ... she would have to rapidly gain traction , not only within the media , where she has experienced some success , but within the broad activist ranks of the Democratic Party . "
Given these conditions , Clinton strategists claim she could overcome " stumbling blocks , " including persuading her loyalists on the Rules Committee to back her without jeopardizing their future political careers .
If the Rules Committee backed Clinton , Obama could appeal to the Credentials Committee .
While the committee has yet to be formed , " the pattern of Clinton and Obama victories so far clearly suggests that Obama delegates on that committee will outnumber Clinton delegates , " Edsall notes , " though Obama will not , however , have a majority , according to most estimates , and the balance of power will be held by delegates appointed by DNC chair Howard Dean . "
Clinton hedges on convention question
In a discussion with women in North Carolina Saturday , however , Clinton seemed to duck her previous assertion that she'd take her fight all the way to the convention floor if Florida and Michigan 's delegates were not counted .
When asked if she would contest the nomination all the way to the convention , according to ABC , she said ,  Well , I plan on going through the next contests - West Virginia , Kentucky and others . 
" This may indicate a possible shift in thinking about how the rest of this campaign will play out , depending on what happens in the North Carolina and Indiana primaries on Tuesday , " ABC notes .

As web developers , we have a serious issue to contend with : completely all - over - the - place support for Ajax .
Prototype does a great job of abstracting the various browsers , but there are several pitfalls coming our way .
XMLHttpRef is implemented as an ActiveX control inside IE , and that means that if a user has IE set to High Security mode , it ’s not going to work - even though it 's an internal component !
Further , the new changes Microsoft is being forced to implement as a result of a lawsuit ruling would see IE users having to click a response each time ActiveX is used in the browser .
It ’s unclear how this might impact how we use Ajax in our web applications .

Refactoring is a term that has its roots in mathematics .
If you take the romantic view and choose to see math as a set of patterns designed to bring order to chaos around us , then to refactor becomes a radical concept .
It implies that you are imposing a new perspective ; that by shuffling entrenched structures and simplifying data to its most basic essence , you can make things ' better ' .
' Better ' , meaning faster , more logical , and easier to understand .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Eight out of 10 Arabs have an unfavorable view of the United States and only six percent believe the U.S. troop build - up in Iraq in the last year has worked , said a poll of six Arab countries released on Monday .

The poll by the University of Maryland and Zogby International , also found most Arabs did not see U.S. foe Iran as a threat and they sympathized more with Hamas in the Palestinian Territories than U.S. - backed Fatah .
“ There is a growing mistrust and lack of confidence in the United States , ” said Shibley Telhami , a University of Maryland professor in charge of the annual poll .
The survey canvassed the opinions of about 4,000 people over the past month in Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Morocco , Jordan , Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates .
It has a margin of error of about 1.6 percent .
Of those polled , 83 percent had an unfavorable view of the United States and 70 percent had no confidence in the superpower .
“ You see this ( mistrust ) in the number of people who are more comfortable with the US withdrawal from Iraq , ” said Telhami , noting that more people in this year ’s annual survey wanted the United States to leave Iraq .
Last year , 44 percent believed Iraqis would find a way to bridge their differences if the United States pulled out but that figure rose to 61 percent this year .
Only six percent of the respondents believed the U.S. boost of troop levels in Iraq last year by 30,000 had worked to reduce the conflict and one in three mistrusted news reports that violence had declined at all .
Eight in 10 Arabs believed that Iraqis were worse off than they were before the U.S. invasion in March 2003 , while 2 percent thought they were better off .
The biggest concern was that Iraq would remain unstable and spread instability in the region , with 59 percent voicing this worry over 42 percent last year .
In contrast to U.S. government views , most Arabs did not see Iran as a major threat and 67 percent considered Tehran had the right to a nuclear program .
PEACE DOUBTS
Over 80 percent of respondents identified the Arab - Israeli conflict as a key issue but just over half -- 55 percent -- did not believe there would ever be a lasting peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians despite U.S. efforts to broker a deal between the two by the end of this year .
The United States has sought to isolate the militant Palestinian group Hamas , which took control of the Gaza strip last June , while U.S. - backed President Mahmoud Abbas and his Fatah movement control the West Bank .
In the conflict between Hamas and Fatah , only 8 percent said they sympathized most with Fatah and 18 percent were more partial to Hamas , while 37 percent said they backed both .
In the Lebanese conflict , only 9 percent expressed sympathy with the majority governing coalition supported by Washington while 30 percent backed the opposition led by the militant group Hezbollah , which the United States opposes .
Hezbollah ’s leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah ’s popularity grew as did Syrian President Bashar al - Assad .
Asked which world leader they disliked most , U.S. President George W. Bush was at the top of the unpopularity poll with 63 percent followed by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert with 39 percent .
Looking ahead to the next U.S. president , 18 percent of respondents believed Democratic contender Barack Obama had the best chance of advancing peace in the Middle East followed by 13 percent who saw Hillary Clinton as their best hope .
Only 4 percent chose Arizona Sen. John McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee for this November ’s U.S. presidential election .
The remainder either U.S. policy would stay the same whoever won or they were not following election .
One in three respondents believed U.S. policy would remain the same , no matter who won the U.S. election and 20 percent said they were not following the U.S. election anyway .

Military Mom Says She Was Brutally Raped in Iraq Dawn Leamon told her story on Capitol Hill today .
April 9 , 2008  --
Yet another woman has come forward saying she was brutally raped in Iraq while working for the U.S. contractor Kellogg Brown Root ( KBR ) .
Dawn Leamon , who has two sons on active duty , says she was raped earlier this year by a U.S. soldier and a KBR colleague .
She will tell her horrific story to members of Congress today at a hearing of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations .
Leamon says that following her rape , she spoke with a woman at the KBR Employee Assistance Program .
" She discouraged me from reporting , saying , ' You know what will happen if you do , ' " Leamon said .
Leamon says KBR then assigned full - time security guards to her which gave her no privacy to talk about the incident , and her movements around camp were restricted , yet her attackers ' movements were unrestricted .
" KBR did little or nothing to restore my sense of safety after I reported being raped , " said Leamon .
KBR release a statement today saying , " Ms. Leamon 's allegations are currently under investigation by the appropriate law enforcement authorities .
Therefore , KBR cannot comment on specifics of the allegations or investigation .
The safety and security of all employees remains KBR 's top priority .
Any allegation of sexual harassment or assault is taken seriously and investigated thoroughly .
As such , Ms. Leamon 's allegations have been referred to law enforcement authorities and are being investigated accordingly . "
Also at today 's hearing , for the first time the Department of Justice is slated to answer questions on the investigation and prosecution of alleged sex crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan .
No one has yet been charged in Leamon 's case .
Last December , the department declined to send an official to testify before the House Judiciary Committee hearing on law enforcement efforts to protect U.S. contractors in Iraq .
The hearing featured testimony by Jamie Leigh Jones , a young Texan woman who also says she was gang - raped while working for KBR in Iraq .
Like Jamie Jones , Leamon believes she was drugged before her attack .
In January , several lawmakers pounded the Justice Department for flatly refusing to answer their questions about how sexual assault cases in Iraq involving U.S. citizens are handled .
" We still have heard nothing from your office , " complained several Democratic senators , including presidential hopeful Barack Obama , D - Ill .
Now , sources says the Justice Department has agreed to send a representative to the Senate hearing entitled , " Closing Legal Loopholes : Justice for Americans Sexually Assaulted in Iraq and Afghanistan . "
Meanwhile , Jamie Jones will receive the Susan McDaniel Public Awareness Award at the Congressional Victim 's Rights Caucus Awards ceremony .
There was a grand jury hearing in Florida concerning her case in January of this year , but no indictment has yet been filed .

This time the culprit is Tyler Cowen .
In his column for the New York Times today , Cowen argues that freer trade in food commodities such as rice would boost global supplies and help reduce prices .
He is probably right about the first , but not about the second .
The effect of freer trade on domestic food prices depends on whether a country is a food importer or exporter .
Freer trade would reduce prices of food ( relative to other prices ) only in countries that are food importers .
Food exporters would experience a rise in the relative price of food , and there is simply no way of escaping that reality .
Trade works by relieving the relative scarcity of goods .
The key here is the term " relative . "
Food importing countries are food scarce countries , and as they open up to trade , the relative price of food falls .
But if you are Thailand or Argentina , where other goods are scarce relative to food , freer trade means higher relative prices of food , not lower .
And all the induced efficiency benefits and short - vs. long - run effects that Cowen talks about have no bearing on this conclusion : in the end some countries have to be net importers , and others net exporters .
INDIANAPOLIS
In his memoir , the legendary Elia Kazan wrote about directing Vivien Leigh in “ A Streetcar Named Desire . ”
While he did not think that Leigh was a great natural actress , he was impressed that she would crawl through glass to get the role right .
Hillary Clinton may not be a great natural politician , but traveling across the country on her own Bus Named Desire , she has crawled through glass to get the role right .
She showed again with her squeaker win in Indiana that for many white working - class men , she is The Man  more tenacious and less concerned with the judgments of the tony set , economists and editorial writers .
Talking up guns , going to the Auto Racing Hall of Fame , speaking from the back of pickup trucks and doing shots of populism with a cynicism chaser , Hillary emerged from a lifetime of government limos to bask as queen of the blue - collar prom .
Nobility is for losers .
Just as Obama spent his youth trying not to be threatening , so as not to unnerve whites , Hillary spent her life learning to be threatening so she could beat back challenges to her and her husband  from Republicans and from “ bimbo eruptions ” and now from a charmed younger rival .
One of the few things about Vista that just drives me crazy is the problems with Windows Explorer .
I prefer to use Details mode for certain folders , but it seems like Vista constantly “ decides ” that the folder should show a different set of columns than what I had previously chosen .
The problem is that Vista “ Auto - Detects ” the folder type for you , but it seems to always detect it incorrectly , and then your folder just stops showing the right columns …
Manually Resetting Folder Types
Normally this happens because Vista has detected the folder as the wrong type … you had a single music file in the folder so Vista thinks that it ’s a music folder and only displays the columns for music files instead … or worse , stops displaying columns altogether .
To reset this setting manually , you can right - click in the folder and choose “ Customize This Folder … ”
Then you can change the folder type drop - down to All Items instead of whatever it was set to .
You might have to reset the view to details mode or choose the columns you want after changing this setting , but it should hopefully stick .
Manual Registry Hack to Reset Folder Views
Windows Vista stores all of the display settings for each folder in a special location in the registry .
Unfortunately these often seem to get corrupted somehow , which is the main reason everything goes haywire .
If you want to reset the folder views you can delete the keys that store the view information .
Open regedit.exe through the start menu search or run box , and then navigate down to the following key :
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell
\Bags
You ’ll see a bunch of keys with numeric names under the Bags key .
You can attempt to find the one that matches the folder you are having problems with , and just right - click on the key and delete it .
If you want , you can delete all of the settings , which will start you over with a blank slate .
Note :
You could backup that section of the registry by right - clicking on the Bags key and choosing to Export .
That way if you screw anything up , you can just restore the backup by double - clicking on it .
Using ExplorerView to Turn Off Auto - Detection
There ’s a small freeware application called ExplorerView that claims to be able to prevent auto - detection of folder types .
In my limited testing so far , it seems to work correctly , but I ’d be interested in your thoughts .
Download , install , and then launch the ExplorerView application .
Check the box for “ Disallow Explorer to Auto - Detect Folder Contents ” , and you are done .
Looks like the folder is back to normal again …

A Great Opportunity for Obesity Researchers
I walked into a Starbucks in Manhattan the other day and noticed that the food in the glass display case now lists three key facts : the name of the item , the price , and the calories .
This last fact is new .
It is the result of a recent New York City regulation that requires chain restaurants — those with 15 or more outlets in the city — to list caloric information .
Starbucks had a nice - looking ( and huge ! ) apple fritter in the glass case that went for 490 calories .
A slice of pound cake was just a bit less ; I think the bagel cost 220 calories .
When I asked the clerk about the new calorie info , she told me the signs had just gone up a few days earlier .
I asked if she ’d seen any changes .
She was n’t sure , she said , but she thought there was a bit less demand on the high - calorie items .
A few days later , the Times published an article on the subject .
It struck me that this new regulation presents a great opportunity for obesity researchers .
If you could get good data , I ’m guessing we could learn a lot about how a posted calorie count affects eating behavior , with all sorts of wrinkles :
+ How calorie - sensitive are people in general , and are they more so during different times of day , days of the week , or types of days ( holiday vs. workday , bad weather vs. good , etc. ) ?
+ If a posted calorie count does shock people into buying / eating differently , how long does that shock last ?
+ There ’s also a lot of experimentation to be done , including : altering the size of the calorie count on the signs and / or perhaps using different icons ( smiley faces ? ) to differentiate between high- , medium - , and low - calorie foods .
You could , of course , also experiment with using images like an obese person vs. a skinny person , or perhaps just a blob of fake fat to represent high - cal. , but since we are talking about companies that sell food , I doubt they ’d be interested .
Maybe Brian Wansink would be , however .
It would also be interesting to see how calorie signs affect demand for lower - calorie foods .
While on the surface , the New York City regulation might seem like bad news for restaurants , I could imagine it turning out to be good news if it stokes such demand .
Imagine that Starbucks figures out that most customers do n’t want to buy any single piece of food that has more than 250 calories .
No one is buying that delicious 490 - calorie apple fritter any more ( which , for the sake of argument , we ’ll say costs $ 3 ) .
What if Starbucks cuts the portion size by 50 percent but sells the new fritter for 80 percent of the original price — i.e. , a 245 - cal .
fritter for $ 2.40 .
That means Starbucks is taking in $ 4.80 for every 500 calories of apple fritter it sells , versus just $ 3 in the old days .
You might think that $ 2.40 is a lot for a half - size fritter — but if people turn out to be more calorie - sensitive than they are price - sensitive , Starbucks and a lot of other restaurants may be end up celebrating the day that New York City tried to rein them in .

In the recovered footage posted here , citizen journalists get a chance to question Oliver North about REX 84 and COG , the supposed plan for the continuity of government in the wake of a terrorist attack or natural disaster .
For daring to do so , these citizen journalists , bearing media credentials , were assaulted at the Kentucky Exposition Center in Louisville by thugs who stole their camera memory cards , thus refusing to honor the First Amendment , as fascist thugs are wont to do .
Questioning drug runner and convicted criminal Oliver North — not speculation , but documented historical fact — about REX 84 and and COG , members were told “ this is not a press conference , ” in other words , they had no right to ask North questions .
Again , for daring to do so they were physically assaulted and robbed .
North essentially dismissed any assertion that he was instrumental in cooking up plans to suspend the Constitution .
“ North ’s exercise , which reportedly contemplated possible suspension of the United States Constitution , led to questions being asked during the Iran - Contra Hearings .
One concern then was that North ’s plans for expanded internment and detention facilities would not be confined to ‘ refugees ’ alone , ” writes Peter Dale Scott .
As we know , North ’s treasonous plan is alive and well under the Department of Homeland Security ’s so - called ENDGAME , a plan that expands “ a mission first articulated in the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 . ”
Scott notes : “ Since 9/11 the Bush administration has implemented a number of inter-related programs , which had been planned for secretly in the 1980s under President Reagan .
These so - called ‘ Continuity of Government ’ or COG proposals included vastly expanded detention capabilities , warrantless eavesdropping and detention , and preparations for greater use of martial law , ” currently well established beyond mere proposals and fleshed out last year in PDD51 .
PDD51 , or NSPD - 51 , National Security Presidential Directive 51 ( Homeland Security Presidential Directive 20 ) was signed into law on 9 May 2007 and was kept from Congress .
“ President Bush , without so much as issuing a press statement , on May 9 signed a directive that granted near dictatorial powers to the office of the president in the event of a national emergency declared by the president , ” explains Jerome Corsi .
As James Sterngold wrote for the San Francisco Chronicle a few days later , “ senior government and military officials and other experts ” had gathered behind closed doors to take “ a step forward , ” under the aegis of the Preventive Defense Project , to plot against the Constitution and the Bill of Rights , including “ the possible suspension of some civil liberties ” under the bogus and entirely absurd prospect of “ al Qaeda or some other terrorist group producing a working nuclear weapon ” and attacking an American city .
“ It is no surprise that these policies are being hatched behind closed doors , by elites , and military - intelligence operatives and other ‘ architects of reality ’ , with no involvement from the citizenry .
It is , however , yet another ominous sign of things to come , ” writes Larry Chin .
“ Nothing has been done to undo the Patriot Act , or end such things as illegal domestic spying and surveillance of American citizens .
Nothing will be . ”
Congressman Peter DeFazio , featured in the video here , and who sits on the Homeland Security Committee , complained that he was refused access to the continuity of government plans , contrived behind closed doors .
“ I just ca n’t believe they ’re going to deny a member of Congress the right of reviewing how they plan to conduct the government of the United States after a significant terrorist attack , ” DeFazio said last July .
“ We ’re talking about the continuity of the government of the United States of America .
I would think that would be relevant to any member of Congress , let alone a member of the Homeland Security Committee . ”
In response , Bush administration spokesman Trey Bohn declined to say why DeFazio was denied access : “ We do not comment through the press on the process that this access entails .
It is important to keep in mind that much of the information related to the continuity of government is highly sensitive . ”
Indeed , the planned suspension of the Constitution and “ some civil liberties ” is so “ highly sensitive ” that journalist citizens will not be allowed to ask former government officials about it .
In doing so , they may face what We Are Change faced in Louisville — physical assault and the theft of their camera memory cards .
Such is a glimmer of what Americans can expect to face when COG , under the ludicrous pretext of al - CIA - duh attacking the “ homeland ” with a nuke , is implemented .
Of course , as we know , there is no al - Qaeda and the fascists currently in control of the government are simply building the structure required to impose martial law .

Hidden Cameras ?
Spying Scandal Widens at Deutsche Telekom
Investigators began searching Deutsche Telekom headquarters in Bonn on Thursday , looking for evidence that the firm spied on company managers and journalists .
New allegations accuse the company of spying as far back as 2000 .
New research suggests that ocean temperature and associated sea level increases between 1961 and 2003 were 50 percent larger than estimated in the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report .
An international team of researchers , including Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory climate scientist Peter Gleckler , compared climate models with improved observations that show sea levels rose by 1.5 millimeters per year in the period from 1961 - 2003 .
That equates to an approximately 2½ - inch increase in ocean levels in a 42 - year span .
The ocean warming and thermal expansion rates are more than 50 percent larger than previous estimates for the upper 300 meters of oceans .
The research corrected for small but systematic biases recently discovered in the global ocean observing system , and uses statistical techniques that “ infill ” information in data - sparse regions .
The results increase scientists ’ confidence in ocean observations and further demonstrate that climate models simulate ocean temperature variability more realistically than previously thought .
“ This is important for the climate modeling community because it demonstrates that the climate models used for assessing sea - level rise and ocean warming tie in closely with the observed results , ” Gleckler said .
The results are reported in the June 19 edition of the journal Nature .
Climate model data were analyzed from 13 different modeling groups .
All model data were obtained from the WCRP CMIP3 multi-model dataset archived at the LLNL ’s Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison ( PCMDI ) .
Although observations and models confirm that recent warming is greatest in the upper ocean , there are widespread observations of warming deeper than 700 meters .
Results were compared with recent estimates of other contributions to sea - level rise including glaciers , ice caps , Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets , and thermal expansion changes in the deep ocean .
When these independent lines of evidence are examined collectively , the story is more consistent than found in earlier studies .
The oceans store more than 90 percent of the heat in the Earth ’s climate system and act as a temporary buffer against the effects of climate change .
The ocean warming and thermal expansion rates are 50 percent larger than previous estimates for the upper 700 meters of oceans , and greater than that for the upper 300 meters .
“ This is just the tip of the iceberg , so to speak , ” Gleckler said .
“ Our ability to quantify structural uncertainties in observationally based estimates is critically important .
This study represents important progress . ”
The team involved researchers from the Centre for Australian Weather and Climate Research ( CSIRO ) , the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre and LLNL .
CHICAGO , May 11 — With primary election dates fast approaching in many states , officials in Pennsylvania and California issued urgent directives in recent days about a potential security risk in their Diebold Election Systems touch - screen voting machines , while other states with similar equipment hurried to assess the seriousness of the problem .
" It 's the most severe security flaw ever discovered in a voting system , " said Michael I. Shamos , a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University who is an examiner of electronic voting systems for Pennsylvania , where the primary is to take place on Tuesday .
Officials from Diebold and from elections ' offices in numerous states minimized the significance of the risk and emphasized that there were no signs that any touch - screen machines had been tampered with .
But computer scientists said the problem might allow someone to tamper with a machine 's software , some saying they preferred not to discuss the flaw at all for fear of offering a roadmap to a hacker .
" This is the barn door being wide open , while people were arguing over the lock on the front door , " said Douglas W. Jones , a professor of computer science at the University of Iowa , a state where the primary is June 6 .
Angry Birds developer Rovio tells TechCrunch that it expects to make over $ 1 million in monthly revenues from the free - to - play version of its popular bird - catapulting game .
" By end of year , we project earnings of over $ 1 million per month with the ad- supported version of Angry Birds , " Rovio CEO Peter Vesterbacka told TechCrunch .
The iPhone version of the game costs money , but the Android version is self - published and free .
The game makes money off ads it serves up to the user .
The Android version of the game has been downloaded over five million times from the Android Market .
Vesterbacka also told TechCrunch that the Angry Birds series has an 80 percent retention rate , based on the number of players that return to download updates .

About the author
( NewsTarget ) Erick Turner , a psychiatry professor at the Oregon State Health and Sciences University , woke up one day and realized that he was acting as a shill for pharmaceutical corporations .
Worse , he was promoting drugs that not only provide very little benefit , but also do great harm .
In spite of the benefits paid to him , including accommodations and thousands of dollars , and the ego satisfaction of being recognized as a " Very Important Person " by his fellow physicians , his conscience would n't let him continue .
So , Dr. Turner turned on his pharmaceutical masters .
He spoke out against the products he'd been promoting .
In the January 2008 issue of the , he published an article telling the truth about one class of drugs , SSRI antidepressants , such as Prozac and Paxil .
In interviews , he has spoken even more broadly , stating that the lack of efficacy of SSRIs is the " dirty little secret " of the psychiatric world .
Dr. Turner 's odyssey began in 2004 , when he started selling his reputation by giving " doctor talks " , as they 're called in the industry .
These lunches or dinners are lavish affairs , provided by pharmaceutical corporations .
A doctor who is appealing , for either his or her background or appearance and style -- preferably both -- speaks about the wonders of a particular drug .
Erick Turner 's particular appeal was having been a researcher at the National Institute of Mental Health for seven years , and then a clinical trials reviewer at the FDA .
He was trained by Eli Lilly to give talks , which required that he use only the visuals provided by the pharmaceutical firm and stay with their talking points .
Then , Turner was sent to do doctor talks .
The money he made was n't significant to him , $ 500 - 750 per talk , a small amount in terms of his total income .
However , as he put it , " In the beginning , I think I got narcissistic gratification .
They fly you somewhere else in the country and pick you up in a limo , and you stay in a nice hotel you could never afford otherwise .
" Within 18 months , though , Turner began to feel pangs of conscience .
As he put it , " I guess you could say I bit the hand that fed . "
He published a paper inthat argued for online publication of all clinical trials produced for the FDA .
Although he went from drug company advocate to critic overnight with his argument against pharmaceutical hiding of data , the article was ... well , it was ignored .
His article was met with a big yawn in the medical world .
Turner quit giving the doctor talks and started to search for hidden drug trial data .
At first , he found some in hidden - away parts of the FDA 's website .
He then looked to researchers for data , and got it from a Seattle researcher and one at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas .
" I literally went down to a Kinko's , " Turner stated , " and photocopied them .
"
The studies he'd found consisted of 74 clinical trials , with 51 % showing results that were better than placebo and 49 % with negative or mixed results .
In other words , about half the trials , though they 'd been produced for drug corporations and most likely were attempting to produce the desired results of showing benefits , did nothing of the sort .
Armed with the smoking gun proof of negative trials being hidden , Turner produced a paper , " Selective Publication of Antidepressant Trials and Its Influence on Apparent Efficacy " for the .
This time , he was n't ignored .
Daniel Carlat , assistant professor of psychiatry at Tufts University School of Medicine , himself once on the dole with Wyeth Pharmaceuticals , argues , " The fact that the negative trials can just be hidden away means that practicing doctors can get a very false notion of efficacy data for a drug .
That 's the real crisis here .
" The question that must be answered is how pervasive the pharmaceutical firms ' hiding of negative studies is .
It 's obvious from Erick Turner 's exposé that SSRIs are generally useless .
What about other drugs ?
History shows us that the same must be true .
Take , for example , Vioxx , an NSAID used for arthritis and other chronic pain .
It causes heart attacks and has killed over 60,000 people in seven years .
Could its manufacturer , Merck , have withheld information from doctors and the public ?
Did Wyeth withhold information about Fenphen , two drugs combined to act as a single weight loss drug ?
It killed people by causing pulmonary hypertension .
What information was withheld by Hoechst Marion Roussel on Seldane ?
It was a wildly popular prescription antihistamine , which was withdrawn because it caused heart arrhythmia .
The number of drugs withdrawn because of their risks , which were likely known by the manufacturers , is stunning .
The cat is now out of the bag regarding SSRIs .
If they work , it 's only rarely .
The known risks are extensive and appalling .
Most , if not all , school shootings involved the use of SSRIs , or their next - generation offshoot , SNRIs .
Suicide rates increase after starting them .
Weight gain is often a problem , indicating a potential link to diabetes .
Sleep disturbances and sexual dysfunction are fairly common .
Many people have a great deal of difficulty withdrawing from these drugs .
None of these problems were revealed during pre-approval clinical tests , but the fact that they 're common begs the question .
How many trials showing these dangers were suppressed ?
Ultimately , the real question is how many people have died or suffered irreversible harm from ingesting the products of drug manufacturers ?
How much information is being hidden by the pharmaceutical manufacturers , all in the interest of obscenely high profits ?
How innocent are doctors in all this ?
It 's quite clear that they have been deeply involved in the cover - up .
Whether they benefit from gifts or boosts to their egos from doing bogus doctor talks , or simply fall for the cute sales reps -- recruited primarily from the ranks of cheerleaders -- so that they close their eyes to pathetically weak statistics , how believable is it that they do n't know ?
When thousands of people outside the medical profession can find out the truth about pharmaceutical poisons , why do the doctors seem to be largely unaware ?
You might think that Dr. Erick Turner , the man who exposed the withholding of negative information by drug manufacturers , would have stopped prescribing the SSRI drugs that he focused on .
But that 's not the case .
Although he says that he does n't give patients false hope about their efficacy , he still prescribes them .
It 's no wonder that doctors are so disconnected from reality .
From the time they 're in medical school , they 're bombarded with pseudo - information from pharmaceutical manufacturers .
They receive gifts to such a degree that astudy found " approximately 50 % of the items that residents carry have pharmaceutical company origins " .
When doctors enter private practice , it 's hardly surprising that they often become billboards and prescription machines for pharmaceuticals .
As Dr. Jay S. Cohen wrote , " No wonder patients complain that many doctors look like walking advertisements for the drug industry .
" Pharmaceutical corporations are so pervasive that , as described by thein 2002 , " In the days leading up to the American Psychiatric Association 's meeting in Philadelphia [ 2002 ] , pharmaceutical companies mailed attendees hundreds of free phone cards , as well as invitations to museums , jazz concerts and fancy dinners ...
And in several dozen symposiums during the week long meeting , companies paid the APA about $ 50,000 per session to control which scientists and papers were presented and to help shape the presentations .
" Is it any wonder that doctors have become so utterly disconnected from their responsibility to protect their patients from harmful drugs ?
It 's no wonder that they seem to be so unable and unwilling to look at drug company reports critically .
It 's no wonder that they have become little more than drug pushers , forever pressing the latest pills on their patients , without considering the risks and the obvious suppression of information about the products they prescribe .
It 's no wonder that when , finally , after a few years of prescribing a particular poison , they 're informed that it 's been recalled , they immediately jump on the bandwagon of yet another highly - promoted , research - suppressed so - called " wonder " drug .
And then , they repeat the pattern yet again .
The pharmaceutical industry has so controlled the medical industry -- and with the doctors ' full cooperation -- that even the doctor who blew the whistle seems to have no idea how to proceed without prescribing the very medications that he knows are ineffective in most cases . *

A full review of the documents is expected to take several weeks
A senior US diplomat says North Korea appears to have handed over full details of its plutonium production programme to the Americans .
The US official , Sung Kim , returned to Washington from Pyongyang on Monday with over 18,000 pages of documents .
He said they were still being translated but appeared to be complete and described the handover as " an important first step " .
They do not cover North Korea 's alleged uranium enrichment programme .
The documents log activities at North Korea 's plutonium reactor at Yongbyon , which is thought to have produced the material for nuclear tests in October 2006 .
North Korea shut down the reactor last year , but failed to meet a December 2007 deadline to give a full account of its nuclear activities .
" These are operating and production records for the five - megawatt reactor and the reprocessing plant in Yongbyon , " Mr Kim told a press conference in Washington .
A team of experts will review the Korean - language documents which still have to be translated , he said .
North Korea reached an agreement last year with the US , China , Japan , Russia and South Korea to end its nuclear programme in return for large - scale aid and the lifting of US sanctions .
But the deal stalled because of a dispute over whether it had fully declared all its nuclear activities .
Mr Kim said it was not yet clear if that declaration would be " ready anytime soon " to be handed to China , the host of the six - party talks .
My latest column in Locus Magazine , " Think Like a Dandelion , " came out of a talk I had with Neil Gaiman about the bio-economics of giving stuff away for free .
Mammals worry about what happens to each and every one of their offspring , but dandelions only care that every crack in every sidewalk has dandelions growing out of it .
The former is a good strategy for situations in which reproduction is expensive , but the latter works best when reproduction is practically free — as on the Internet .
1 . Your work needs to be easily copied , to anywhere whence it might find its way into the right hands .
That means that the nimble text - file , HTML file , and PDF ( the preferred triumvirate of formats ) should be distributed without formality – no logins , no e-mail address collections , and with a license that allows your fans to reproduce the work on their own in order to share it with more potential fans .
Remember , copying is a cost - center – insisting that all copies must be downloaded from your site and only your site is insisting that you – and only you – will bear the cost of making those copies .
Sure , having a single , central repository for your works makes it easier to count copies and figure out where they 're going , but remember : dandelions do n't keep track of their seeds .
Once you get past the vanity of knowing exactly how many copies have been made , and find the zen of knowing that the copying will take care of itself , you 'll attain dandelionesque contentment .
2 . Once your work gets into the right hands , there needs to be an easy way to consummate the relationship .
A friend who runs a small press recently wrote to me to ask if I thought he should release his next book as a Creative Commons free download in advance of the publication , in order to drum up some publicity before the book went on sale .
I explained that I thought this would be a really bad idea .
Internet users have short attention spans .
The moment of consummation – the moment when a reader discovers your book online , starts to read it , and thinks , huh , I should buy a copy of this book – is very brief .
That 's because " I should buy a copy of this book " is inevitably followed by , " Woah , a youtube of a man putting a lemon in his nose ! " and the moment , as they say , is gone .
Secret files on UFO sightings have been made available for the first time by the Ministry of Defence .
The three snails are fitted with RFID chips Muriel , Austin and Cecil are snails for the electronic age .
The gastropods have been fitted with equipment to allow them to send e-mails on behalf of visitors to a website .
Instead of instantaneous communication , sent messages will travel at 0.03 mph ( 0.05 km / h ) and could take days , weeks or even months to arrive .
It is part of a " slow art " project called Real Snail Mail at Bournemouth University in the UK which will be showcased in Los Angeles in August .
" One thing technology promises us is speed , acceleration , more of everything in less time , " said Paul Smith , a visual artist working on the project .
" Culturally , we seem obsessed with immediacy .
Time is not to be taken but crammed to bursting point . "
He 's a super - powered snail - he 's doing really well
Vicky Isley
The researchers hope the project will encourage people to take their time and contemplate the technology and the work .
Each snail is fitted with a tiny capsule which holds a Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID ) chip .
RFID allows objects to communicate over short distances .
Users of the service send a message via the Real Snail Mail website which is routed to the tank at the speed of light to await collection by a snail " agent " .
As the three snails slowly amble around the tank , they occasionally come into range of an electronic reader , which attaches the e-mail message to the RFID chip .
The electronic messages are then physically carried around the tank by the snails until one of the gastropods passes close to a second reader .
It is then forwarded over the net in the usual way .
" It could be quite frustrating for some people , " Vicky Isley , one of the artists told BBC News .
" It 's completely subverting that normal system . "
So far , the three snails have managed to deliver 14 messages .
Users of the service will hope that Austin is on hand to collect their messages .
The Snail has made 10 of the deliveries so far with an average delivery time of 1.96 days .
" He 's a super - powered snail - he 's doing really well , " said Ms Isely .
" He 's really quite big - he 's always the one that gets to the food first . "
Unfortunately , Muriel is still languishing , waiting to make her first delivery .
The project will be on show at the computer graphics conference Siggraph in Los Angeles from 11 - 15 August .

Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said today that if he was president , he would bring down gasoline prices through sheer force of personality , by creating enough political good will with oil - producing nations that they would increase their supply of crude .
'' I would work with our friends in OPEC to convince them to open up the spigot , to increase the supply , '' Mr. Bush , the presumptive Republican candidate for president , told reporters here today .
'' Use the capital that my administration will earn , with the Kuwaitis or the Saudis , and convince them to open up the spigot . ''
Implicit in his comments was a criticism of the Clinton administration as failing to take advantage of the good will that the United States built with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia during the Persian Gulf war in 1991 .
Also implicit was that as the son of the president who built the coalition that drove the Iraqis out of Kuwait , Mr. Bush would be able to establish ties on a personal level that would persuade oil - producing nations that they owed the United States something in return .
'' Ours is a nation that helped Kuwait and the Saudis , and you 'd think we'd have the capital necessary to convince them to increase the crude supplies , '' he said .

LONDON ( AFP ) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Police said Wednesday they have warned an airport worker who reportedly made a crude remark about a colleague ’s breasts as a newly - installed security scanner took a full body X - ray of her .
Jo Margetson , 29 , walked into an X - ray machine at London ’s Heathrow Airport by mistake before the incident allegedly took place — and told The Sun newspaper she is now “ totally traumatised ” .

The reported incident , the first such complaint since the machines were introduced earlier this year , has highlighted privacy concerns about the use of full body scanners at British airports .
Heathrow and Manchester airports have been using them since an alleged bid to blow up a US - bound jet on Christmas Day was foiled , while the US and The Netherlands are among other countries where they are being installed .
When asked about the story , a spokesman for London ’s Metropolitan Police said : “ Police received an allegation regarding an incident that happened at Heathrow Terminal 5 on March 10 .
“ A first instance harassment warning has been issued to a 25 - year - old male . ”
Airports operator BAA , which runs Heathrow , added that it was investigating the allegations .

“ If these claims are found to be substantiated , we will take appropriate action , ” a spokesman added .
The Equality and Human Rights Commission has warned the government that the scanners could run counter to the right to privacy enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights .
“ When privacy - invading machines like these are installed at our airports , abuses like this are inevitable , ” said Alex Deane of campaign group Big Brother Watch .
I do n't mean an inkling that it 's false , or that you believe it to be so because you believe yours is true .
I mean , say , proof that it 's false .
Proof that , say , the founder lied and made up stuff , that none of it is true .
Or other things like that , things that you can show to someone .
Do you then tell someone who follows that religion ?
Would it be right to destroy their beliefs because of facts ?
Or should you just let them go on believing it ?
Is it better to let them keep their belief system , so that their life is n't shattered , even if it means they 'll likely spread the belief to others , such as their children ?
Is a happiness based on lies better than truth ?
My suspicion between the large schism between the two sides that seems apparent here is that there 's a more fundamental issue that is influencing peoples ' choices .
I believe it all comes down to whether someone places faith , or truth , as the most important for these situations .
People who feel faith is most important seem like they would not be likely to encourage telling someone if their religion is false .
That the act of having faith , even in something untrue , is somehow worthwhile on it's own .
The ones who think truth is more important seem to be completely on the side of divulging the information , so that someone may make a more informed choice .
There are , of course , a few responses rooted in practicality , and a few others questioning the basic question asked in this node .
Obviously , a mental exercise is n't going to yield anything valuable if someone does n't accept the basic assumptions .

Major donors concluding that Obama wants to cut off funds to outside groups , especially media 527s .
Obama :
Do n't fund independent groups
Senator Barack Obama ’s campaign is steering the candidate ’s wealthy supporters away from independent Democratic groups , calling into question what had been expected to be the groups ’ central role in this year ’s Democratic offensive against Senator John McCain .
Obama ’s national finance chairwoman , Chicago hotel mogul Penny Pritzker , told supporters at a national finance committee meeting in Indianapolis May 2 , and in other conversations , not to give money to the groups , people familiar with her comments said .
Advertisement
“ From the beginning of this race Obama has told supporters that if they want to help his effort , they should do so through his campaign , ” said Obama spokesman Bill Burton , who confirmed that Pritzker has told donors not to give to the groups .
“ And he means exactly what he says . ”
Most presidential candidates say they do n't encourage the outside groups , and donors are accustomed to taking those words with a grain of salt .
The candidates ' words are typically seen as mere legal defenses against allegations that the campaigns are illicitly coordinating with outside groups .
The donors have been considering entreaties from Progressive Media USA , run by conservative - journalist turned liberal media critic David Brock ; from former Clinton aide John Podesta ’s Fund for America ; and from America Votes , a group backed by billionaire George Soros that focuses on voter mobilization , among other efforts .
But in recent days , major donors have begun to conclude that Obama is serious in trying to cut off funds to the outside groups .
“ It ’s given donors pause , ” said one prominent Democratic donor of Pritzker ’s words .
Donors and Democratic activists have been quietly debating Obama ’s motives :
Is he simply interested in keeping his Democratic efforts within his campaign , which is so well funded he does n’t need outside help ?
Or is he , as some believe , cutting off funds to groups whose leaders — Brock and Podesta — some Obama aides view as too tightly linked to Clinton ?
In either case , Pritzker ’s words are the latest in Obama ’s remarkably swift and complete consolidation of Democratic Party power .
It ’s an unprecedented seizure of control that has built him , over the course of a year , the most powerful field organization and the largest financial network in American politics , leaving many existing structures — traditional party organizations in many states , the Clintons ’ long - nurtured national network — in the dust .
Just last summer , Matt Bai ’s widely accepted analysis identified the “ billionaires ” and the “ bloggers ” as the key , emergent players in the Democratic Party ’s infrastructure .
But Obama has marginalized both groups .
Pritzker ’s words are part of a move to keep Obama ’s grip on the sole important funnel of Democratic money this year .
And his campaign has largely ignored the existing network of liberal bloggers , and actively opposes their embrace of fierce partisanship .
“ Obama has created a number of significant infrastructure pieces through his campaign , displacing traditional groups the way he promised he would by signaling the end of the old politics of division and partisanship , ” the blogger Matt Stoller wrote recently of Obama ’s “ consolidation of the party , ” which he called “ stunning . ”
Many of the figures Obama has shut out have , sometimes grudgingly , embraced the sheer effectiveness of his organization , and his potential to create a lasting new Democratic majority .
The open question is whether Obama ’s movement is about something more than the candidate , and whether it will cohere after he wins or loses in November .
“ Will the Obama movement be a real movement that pushes its leader to keep his promises ? ” Micah Sifry wrote recently on the blog TechPresident .
“ Or will it be more of a personalized movement of followers attracted to a charismatic star ? ”
Obama ’s campaign has been remarkably effective so far this year at maintaining a coherent message , built around Obama ’s biography and his appeal for a new kind of politics .
Part of his success has been tight message discipline :
The campaign has been virtually leak - free , and the line of control from Obama to his chief strategist David Axelrod to campaign manager ( and Axelrod business partner ) David Plouffe is unchallenged .
Many involved in the independent efforts find it hard to quibble with that success , and may have second thoughts about continuing that work over Obama ’s explicit objection .
“ If he were to make a definitive statement , we ’d have to think hard about it , ” said one .
The campaign ’s opposition to the outside groups is , donors and activists said , being felt more sharply by the groups established to attack McCain through television advertising , as the lavishly funded Media Fund attacked Bush in 2004 .
Brock , the chairman of Progressive Media USA , declined to comment on Obama ’s stance .
Martin Frost , the president of America Votes , also suggested that the Obama campaign stance had had more impact on media groups than on ones focused on turnout .
“ We ’re continguing with our fundraising and things have been going well for us , ” he said .
“ You really need to ask someone who ’s dealing with the media aspect . ”
But Democrats who support the work of the media 527s say Obama ’s making a mistake .
Progressive Media USA has aired anti-McCain television ads and developed a website intended to be a hub for negative information about McCain .
“ Obama needs a bass line to the melody of his positive message , ” said a Democratic strategist who backs the group ’s aims .

According to the Indiana Secretary of State , the official totals were :
Hillary Clinton : 637,814 50.4 %
Barack Obama : 626,642 49.6 %
The difference : 11,152 less than 1 %
This difference , was almost surely caused by Rush Limbaugh and operation Chaos ( who at least according to ABC made up 7 % of Clinton 's voting base . )
So I think Obama 's claim that Rush won it for Hillary is accurate .
UPDATE : Just to be clear Obama did n't say in person that Rush helped Hillary win .
It was Axelrod .

I know this is shorter than the conventional length for diaries and I apologize ( although as a point of contrast I note that my last diary was on the very long side , so do n't expect this to be a trend ) .
So I 've added a bonus :
UPDATE 2 : My apologize .
Seems
I jumped the gun a bit to declare " final . "
The number above did n't include the last round of confirmed provisionals ( although the source said final , but ca n't believe all that you read ) .
So the numbers have changed slightly by about .3 % .
Mea culpa .
Hillary Clinton : 643,797 50.5 %
Barack Obama : 629,310 49.4 %
The difference : 14,487 1.1 %
BONUS : in order to add something substantive .
I want to suggest that we begin pre-framing expectations for West Virginia .
Hillary will win West Virginia by a significant margin , yet her surrogates are gaming expectations by saying things like " if she wins . "
This is silly business and I wonder if Obama might get some benefit by publicly stating that he expects to lose by 20 % or more .
Hopefully , the media will remember that Hillary is finished , but I fear her camp ( if they do n't concede soon ) will spin it as a comeback , Obama can't close the deal , white voters , blah blah .
We need to do everything possible to de-legitimate this concern WITHOUT asking Hillary to concede or being negative .
So maybe we need to remind friends and the press about Huckabee and other previous contests in which the candidate who had already lost the nomination managed to still win states .
Also , we need to phone bank like crazy for Obama to GOTV in West Virginia .
Anyway , just a small idea so that this diary would be longer .

Once upon a time , it was widely believed that one of the greatest sins the U.S. government or its temporary political masters could commit was to turn a propaganda machine loose on the American people .
Congress viewed this so seriously that every appropriations bill passed since 1951 has contained language that says no public money “ shall be used for publicity or propaganda purposes within the United States ” without the lawmakers ’ prior approval .
The Bush administration has been caught violating the propaganda ban before , notably in 2005 in the case of radio host Armstrong Williams , who was paid to endorse President Bush ’s No Child Left Behind law .
Particularly abhorrent to the U.S. Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) , which oversees compliance with the ban , is an agency ’s use of “ covert propaganda ” or “ covert attempts to mold opinion through the undisclosed use of third parties . ”
This is why alarm bells should be ringing all over Washington about The New York Times ’ disclosure that then - Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld encouraged a secret Pentagon program to care for and spoon - feed more than 50 retired senior military officers whom the administration deemed reliable friends who could be counted on “ to carry our water ” on the television and cable networks .
Feeding the military analysts “ key and valuable information ” in secret briefings by Pentagon and White House officials , the idea went , would make them the go - to guys for the networks and encourage the networks to “ weed out the less reliably friendly analysts . . . . ”
This 2005 memorandum , addressed to then Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Larry DiRita , added : “ This trusted core group will be more than willing to work closely with us because we are their bread and butter . ”
Asked about the case of Col. Bill Cowan , who says he was fired as a military analyst for Fox News and cut off from the briefings for criticizing the war effort , DiRita told Glenn Greenwald of Salon.com : “ I do n’t know anything .
I saw that in the story .
I ’ve heard other assertions to that effect .
It was certainly not the intent . ”
In a follow - up e-mail exchange between DiRita and Greenwald , Rumsfeld ’s former mouthpiece – now Bank of America ’s chief spokesman – elaborated on what he said he did n’t remember : “ I simply do n’t have any recollection of trying to restrict him ( Cowan ) or others from exposure to what was going on . ”
DiRita added : “ There are plenty of examples to the contrary – reaching out to people who specifically disagreed with us .
One example I recall is Joe Galloway – a persistent critic and apparently popular with military readers .
He came in and met Secretary Rumsfeld and we had other interactions . ”
Now that ’s a real knee - slapper :
Me as a poster boy for how Rumsfeld and DiRita “ reached out ” to their harshest critics even as they stroked and promoted and schemed to embed the old reliables to wax enthusiastic about a war that was going from bad to worse .
Let the record show that Rumsfelds ’ folks reached out to me on these few occasions :
In early summer of 2003 , half a dozen of us were invited to an off - the - record lunch with Rumsfeld in the Pentagon .
The defense secretary seemed to have a poor grasp of the reality on the ground in Iraq and was still declaring that we ’d do no nation - building there .
He saw no insurgency , only a handful of “ dead- enders ” .
In October 2005 , DiRita called to invite me to travel with Rumsfeld to the Middle East and Australia .
I declined because it conflicted with a long - booked graduation speech I was to give at Luke Air Force Base , Ariz .
to a class of new Air Force F - 16 fighter pilots that included my nephew .
DiRita was stunned that I would n’t drop a bunch of fighter pilots to be schmoozed by his boss .
In November 2005 , DiRita invited me to a “ one - on - one ” lunch with Rumsfeld at the Pentagon .
This one I accepted .
I arrived to find across the table Rumsfeld , the then - Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Marine Gen. Peter Pace ; Army Vice Chief of Staff Gen. Dick Cody ; Joint Staff Director Lt. Gen. Walter Sharp and DiRita .
We went at it hammer and tongs for an hour and a half over their conduct of the war and the errors that were costing the lives of American soldiers .
As I left , I told Rumsfeld that I ’d continue to point out those mistakes every week in my column .
In April 2006 , DiRita sent me an e-mail telling me that my most recent column was “ silly ” .
That column had discussed an expensive war game the Pentagon conducted about a U.S. attack on a thinly disguised country that obviously was Iran .
A retired Marine general , Paul Van Riper , had been the commander of the “ enemy ” forces , and he used unconventional tactics to destroy the U.S. Navy flotilla in the Persian Gulf , leaving thousands of sailors and Marines dead .
At that point , the commanders stopped the war game , reset everything and imposed new rules forbidding Van Riper from employing those tactics .
Van Riper walked out , furious , and requested an investigation .
DiRita complained in his e-mail that I was silly to blame Rumsfeld for this and for covering up the investigators ’ report .
After all , he wrote , Rumsfeld could n’t be expected to know retired generals several levels below him or to bear responsibility for such matters .
His complaint sparked an escalating e-mail war that most reckon DiRita lost .
The entire exchange was posted on the Internet and can still be found there .
So much for the Rumsfeld / DiRita outreach to their critics .
They were much too busy hand - feeding horse manure to their TV generals , who in turn were feeding the same product to the American public by the cubic yard .
There ’s little doubt that this program violated the laws against covert propaganda operations mounted against the American public by their own government .
But in this administration , there ’s no one left to enforce that law or any of the other laws the Bush operatives have been busy violating .
The real crime is that the scheme worked .
The television network bosses swallowed the bait , the hook , the line and the sinker , and they have yet to answer for it .
With the price of oil at $ 95 a barrel , economists estimate that U.S. households will spend an additional $ 90 billion on costlier gasoline .
Estimating our population at 300 million , that ’s an average of $ 300 per person .
Between my wife and I , that means we ’re giving up $ 600 of our economic pie to the recently increased cost of transportation , on average .
What would you do with $ 300 ?
You can do something .
You can minimize your use of oil , and when those price increases happen , you wo n’t be counted within the statistic ( except to the extent there ’s an oil premium in the food and products you buy ) .
While everyone else is further strapped to oil , you can do something else with the money .
But what ?
Put more money in the 401k ?
Eat more healthy food ?
Spend more time exercising ?
The great thing about our country is , we do n’t have to wait for the government to decide whether we ’ll be subject to the statistic .
There ’s a lot of finger pointing in the environmental movement .
Some of that is genuine , it ’s an attempt to cause change .
But some is n’t :
You made the gas - guzzling car , not me .
You built the over - sized home in suburbs , not me .
You made the highway too thin , not me .
Or is it :
You fill up the tank .
You bought the car .
You chose the house location .
You pay the gasoline bill .
I hate to be insensitive , but for all of us that ca n’t hack the increase in oil prices , does n’t it sound like a personal problem ?
Does n’t it sound like a $ 90 billion personal problem ?
This is from 1997 . 😉

But the devices ’ creators also argue that Japan ’s ideas about crime prevention are a product of deeper cultural differences .

The United States ' 43 million Latinos are the fastest - growing minority group in the country .
For Emilio San Pedro , travelling from coast to coast talking to fellow Latinos has also allowed him to reflect on his own identity .
Latino Amilcar Arroyo is concerned about harassment
Right from the start it felt like a perfect fit for me , an assignment that would take me across America , reporting on the lives of Latinos from all walks of life .
People from all over Latin America who have settled , legally or otherwise , in the United States .
I met Flor Crisostomo , an illegal immigrant with no official documents , who faces deportation from the US .
This woman in her late 20s has spent the last three months hiding from the immigration authorities in a small church in the heart of one of Chicago 's main Latino neighbourhoods .
Flor 's personal situation has turned her into an immigration rights activist of the highest order .
She has become the public face of the estimated 12 million undocumented or illegal immigrants living and working in the United States .
She tells me that if they want to take her , the authorities will have to drag her - a defenceless mother - of - three - out of the church .
Immigrant pride
The next day at my hotel in downtown Chicago , a Mexican waiter smiles when I mention to him that I met her .
They yell epithets at you as you 're walking down the street - things like ' take your boat and go back to your banana country !'
Amilcar Arroyo , US Latino
He tells me how proud she makes him feel to be Mexican , to be a Latino , and how unfairly immigrants like him are being treated by the US authorities .
After all , he says , repeating the phrase that has become the mantra of the pro-immigrant lobby , the immigrants like him are doing the jobs that American citizens simply do not want to do .
True or not , the fact is that it is nearly impossible to dine in a restaurant in Chicago - including the Thai restaurant near our hotel - and find a server , cashier or possibly even a chef , who is not Latino .
But there are many Americans , like those I met in the small mountain town of Hazleton in Pennsylvania - including some second and third - generation Latinos - who reject the idea that the illegal immigrants are doing the jobs no - one else wants .
Instead , they say that employers are behaving like bandits , taking advantage of the undocumented workers and paying them a pittance , demeaning the immigrants and regular Americans alike , who are , they say , willing to do the jobs , but not for rock - bottom wages .
Rising harassment
We travelled to the sleepy former mining town of Hazleton because it too has been thrust into the heart of the immigration debate .
Flor Crisostomo is an illegal immigrant and faces deportation
In 2006 , tired of what he saw as the lack of action on the part of the federal authorities in dealing with the issue of illegal immigration , the town 's mayor , Lou Barletta , decided to take matters into his own , and the town 's , hands .
He proposed - and the town council approved - a bye - law giving the local authorities extraordinary powers to crack down on illegal immigrants and those offering them employment and housing .
It was later suspended by a federal court , which deemed the measure unconstitutional .
However , a Latino of Peruvian descent , Amilcar Arroyo , whom I met during my brief visit to the town , is concerned .
He has lived in Hazleton for over two decades and is today an American citizen and the publisher of a small Spanish - language newspaper which serves the thousands of Hispanics who live in the area .
He tells me that despite having been overturned by a federal court , the former law has left an indelible stain and made life worse for the town 's Latinos - even for the legal residents and citizens like himself - who are the subject of harassment and taunting by some locals .
" They yell epithets at you as you 're walking down the street - things like ' Take your boat and go back to your banana country ! ' "
He says many Latinos fear that things could get even worse .
Hope for the future I discuss that concern at the end of my trip in Washington with Janet Murguia , President of the most powerful Latino pressure and advocacy group , the National Council of La Raza .
The once disjointed and far from united Latino community is finding its voice and defining its identity as a cohesive group
It is this anxiety over immigration - and what she says is the vilifying of Latinos in some quarters - that has been galvanising Hispanics in the US to vote in bigger numbers than ever , and to register to vote , in some cases for the very first time .
She points out that Latinos have been voting in huge numbers in the Democratic primaries and may play an even greater role , perhaps , in the upcoming presidential election .
The fact that the once - disjointed and far from united Latino community is finding its voice and defining its identity as a cohesive group , and has come such a long way over a relatively small period of time , fills me with hope for the future , despite the row over immigration and the feeling among many that they are still not accepted or that they do not fit in .
What sort of future could this be ?
Not perhaps one in which the US is overrun by Latinos , or in which Spanish becomes the main language , as some anti-immigrant activists have been predicting in their Doomsday scenario .
I can see a future in which the Flors , Amilcars , and yes , even the Emilios , can help define and enrich the American mosaic of tomorrow .

What are these ?
Hillary Rodham Clinton , stung last week by the defection of a prominent superdelegate , could lose the backing of more of these Democratic Party leaders and elected officials if she fails to make significant gains in the remaining month of presidential nominating contests , several California superdelegates said this weekend .
Two of the five superdelegates aligned with Clinton who spoke at the annual California Democratic Convention here said they would reconsider their support if rival Barack Obama maintained his lead in elected delegates and the popular vote after the last contests on June 3 .
While hardly reflecting a groundswell , the superdelegates ’ comments underscored the concerns among some of these officials about the drawn - out Democratic race .
It follows the embarrassing defection Clinton ’s campaign suffered Thursday when former Democratic National Committee Chairman Joe Andrew switched his support from her to Obama , and warned that the negative tone of the campaign was becoming a “ catastrophe ” that would help Republicans .
Christopher Stampolis of Santa Clara , a superdelegate who endorsed Clinton after the Iowa caucuses , said that he remained in the New York senator ’s camp but that his commitment expired with the end of the primaries .

“ When it ’s done , all of us , whether we ’re committed or not , we ’re going to take a look ” at the final eight contests , said Stampolis , who until recently worked in external relations for a Bay Area environmental firm .
“ Our job is to represent the constituents who trusted us to win the White House . ”
Garry Shay , a Los Angeles attorney , said that if Clinton remained about 150 pledged delegates behind Obama , the current estimated margin , he would have to “ reassess the entirety of the situation . ”
“ It does n’t mandate me switching , ” he said , “ but it does mandate me reconsidering . ”
Stampolis and Shay were among the superdelegates on the keynote panel for the annual gathering of leaders of California ’s Democratic clubs , which focus on grass - roots organizing .

The superdelegates said they were being lobbied by supporters of Clinton and Obama .
“ I must have 100 letters from Clinton people asking me to stay with her , and about 10 Obama ones telling me I have to change immediately , ” said Alice Huffman , president of the California State Conference of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People .
But Huffman said she intended to remain firmly behind Clinton .
“ I could change my mind , but I would n’t change my mind until Hillary changes her mind , ” Huffman said .
“ When I get in with someone , I stay till the end . ”
Neither of the Obama superdelegates at the convention -- Mary Ellen Early , an information systems specialist from Sherman Oaks , and Alicia Wang , an ESL instructor from San Francisco -- said they would consider switching sides unless Obama specifically released them .
Steven Ybarra , a Sacramento lawyer , and Robert Rankin , a retired Carson steelworker , were the only two uncommitted superdelegates at Saturday ’s gathering .

Rankin said he would stay uncommitted until the last Democratic vote was counted .
“ Eight states are left , millions of voters -- I really believe that their voices need to be heard , ” he said .
Ybarra , though , said he might remain uncommitted through the convention and not vote for either candidate .
Chairman of the voting rights committee of the national Democratic Party ’s Hispanic Caucus , he is angry that neither the party nor the two candidates have put together plans and a budget for recruiting and retaining Latino voters -- particularly Mexican Americans .
Ybarra said he believed the Democrats would have won the last two presidential elections if the party and the candidates had made similar outreach efforts to Latinos as they did to African Americans .

“ I ’m not about to take California , as a delegate , into another voting cycle without a commitment by the DNC , and by the candidate , about what they are going to do about the Mexican American voter across the United States , ” Ybarra said .
“ Otherwise , we ’re going to lose . ”

COLORADO SPRINGS , Colo. , April 28 , 2008 — Colorado College has denied student Chris Robinson ’s appeal of its finding that he and another student violated the school ’s “ violence ” policy for posting a flyer that parodied a flyer of the Feminist and Gender Studies program .
The school also has decided not to remove any letters about the case from the students ’ files until after graduation .
The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education ( FIRE ) is assisting Robinson in his case against the school .
“ First , Colorado College trampled over Chris Robinson ’s right to engage in an obvious parody , and now the school has further embarrassed itself by denying his appeal , ” FIRE President Greg Lukianoff said .
“ The judicial procedure was a joke : the same administrator who found Robinson guilty in the first place was the final judge of his appeal .
FIRE calls on Colorado College to remove this guilty finding once and for all from the students ’ records .
As long as they are deemed guilty for engaging in satire , the school ’s extensive promises of free expression are brazen misrepresentations . ”
In early 2008 , Colorado College ’s “ Feminist and Gender Studies Interns ” distributed a flyer called “ The Monthly Rag , ” which included a reference to “ male castration , ” an announcement about a lecture on “ feminist porn , ” and an explanation of “ packing ” ( pretending to have a phallus ) .
As a parody of “ The Monthly Rag , ” Robinson and a second student , who wishes to remain anonymous , distributed a flyer in February called “ The Monthly Bag ” under the pseudonym “ The Coalition of Some Dudes . ”
The flyer included references to “ tough guy wisdom , ” “ chainsaw etiquette , ” the shooting range of a sniper rifle , and a quotation about “ female violence and abuse ” of men from the website batteredmen.com .
Shortly thereafter , Colorado College President Richard F. Celeste sent out a campus - wide e-mail declaring that “ The Monthly Bag ” included “ threatening and demeaning content , which is categorically unacceptable in this community , ” and asking the “ Dudes ” to come forward .
When they did less than an hour later , they were subjected to a three - hour hearing and charged with “ bias ” and violating the college ’s values of respect and integrity .
FIRE wrote to Celeste on March 21 , 2008 , pointing out that any punishment would contradict Colorado College ’s own policies and advertised commitments to free expression , including a policy that states , “ On a campus that is free and open , no idea can be banned or forbidden .
No viewpoint or message may be deemed so hateful that it may not be expressed . ”
After the “ Dudes ” faced penalties including expulsion for three weeks , Vice President for Student Life / Dean of Students Mike Edmonds finally wrote to the “ Coalition of Some Dudes ” students on March 25 , stating that they had been found guilty of “ violating the student code of conduct policy on violence . ”
The punishments included having the finding of guilt placed in their student files and being required to hold a forum to “ discuss issues and questions raised ” by their parody .
Although Edmonds acknowledged that the intent of the publication was to satirize “ The Monthly Rag , ” he wrote that “ in the climate in which we find ourselves today , violence — or implied violence — of any kind cannot be tolerated on a college campus . ”
According to Edmonds , “ the juxtaposition of weaponry and sexuality ” in an anonymous parody made students subjectively feel threatened by chainsaws or rifles .
Robinson appealed Edmonds ’s decision , but the final judge of the appeal was Edmonds himself .
Robinson was notified on April 21 , in a letter dated April 11 , that his appeal had failed and that the finding would remain in his student file until he graduates .
Also on April 21 , the Director of FIRE ’s Individual Rights Defense Program , Adam Kissel , spoke on campus to some controversy .
Posters announcing his speech were found to have had the words “ Political Science Department ” scratched out from the line “ sponsored by the Political Science Department , ” although that department did invite Kissel to speak .
“ Colorado College should declare the students innocent immediately , ” Kissel said .
“ FIRE will continue to pursue this case until these students ’ records are completely cleared of any alleged wrongdoing .
President Celeste still has a chance to do justice in this case . ”

Tom Cruise Was The Original Voice Of Captain Planet
Like us on Facebook :
The current article you are reading does not reflect the views of the current editors and contributors of the new Ecorazzi
It ’s safe to say that Ted Turner ’s original eco-cartoon Captain Planet was way ahead of its time .
If it was released today , it might be criticized as something to take advantage of current awareness , but because it arrived in a decade of relative indifference towards environmentalism , it ’s a great reflection of Turner ’s green values and willingness to educate others on the topic .
Anyways , we ’ve had a lot of fun over the past few months speculating whether or not a live - action version of this cartoon will ever see the light of day .
We remain steadfast that something is / was in the works — especially since the information came from Ted Turner himself .
Whether or not anything actually ever comes from it is another matter entirely .
But all rumors aside , there are some fun “ Did You Know ? ” Captain Planet facts that we would love to share .
First off , and most bizarre , is the fact that Tom Cruise was the original voice of the blue - skinned superhero .
In fact , as early as December 1989 , Time Magazine lists the Days Of Thunder star as the lead for the “ cable - TV cartoon ” .
Apparently , Cruise pulled out and actor David Coburn then picked up the reins .
Perhaps this makes sense , as Cruise reportedly spent $ 1 million alone in 2006 to fuel his hungry fleet of cars , motorcycles , planes , and other gas - guzzlers .
But that did n’t necessarily faze the producers of the comic book based on the cartoon .
They appear to have paid homage to the star ’s Top Gun movie by illustrating three pilots chasing a large dragon formed from smog .
Their callsigns ?
Iceman , Maverick , and Goose .
To this day , we have no idea if any vocal record of Tom Cruise as Captain Planet exists .
Did you know there are a bunch of other celebrities that have lent their voices to the show ?
Click on the images below to take a look at each one and the awesome roles they played .
There are no campaign rallies or bumper stickers for him in Syria , no “ Yes We Can ” T - shirts on sale , but Obamamania has definitely infected the “ beating heart of Arab nationalism , ” as it once called itself .
During my recent visit to Damascus , Syrian officials and the political elite seemed captivated by Barack Obama , well before it was clear that the Democrats ’ charismatic young superstar would be the party ’s presidential nominee .
Partly , it ’s Obama ’s youth that makes him attractive to Syrians , roughly half of whom are under 18 and whose own president , Bashar Assad , is four years younger than Obama .
“ But it ’s not just Obama ’s age that we like , ” says Obaida Hamad , a 32 - year - old reporter for Syria Today , the country ’s only independent , English - language magazine .
“ Syrians think that as a man of color , Obama may understand the Muslim and Arab worlds better than Hillary Clinton or John McCain , ” he says .
“ And we are fed up with over a decade of American leadership in the hands of two families — Clinton and Bush .
For us , ” he says — diplomatically omitting the fact that President Assad , who has now ruled for eight years , succeeded his father , Hafez el - Assad , who ruled Syria with an iron fist for three decades —
“ Obama represents new blood . ”
“ America desperately needs a logo change , ” agrees Bouthaina Shaaban , Syria ’s Minister of Expatriates and President Assad ’s confidante .
An Obama Administration , she says , would change both the content and tone of American foreign policy .
“ The United States should not continue trying to impose its opinions on the world , ” she says .
“ Nor should you be so self - congratulatory . ”
Syria ’s enthusiasm for Obama , so widely shared among Muslim Arabs , is not surprising , given his endorsement of directly engaging states like Syria through creative diplomacy .
Obama has repeatedly said that the United States should not speak only to its friends , but also to its enemies — in most cases , without the onerous “ preconditions ” that the Bush administration has laid down and that Syrian officials reject as tantamount to preemptive surrender .
This prescription is most welcome in Syria , which despite its oil is a relatively poor nation of some 19 million people , squeezed by American - led economic sanctions and hemmed in politically between more powerful states .
Above all , Syria yearns to be taken seriously , or as Tony Badran , a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a critic of the country ’s leadership , puts it , a state that “ seeks to project regional influence well above its weight by appearing to keep all options open to balance contradictory policies , like allying itself with Iran and hosting terrorist groups while offering peace talks with its enemies . ”
At its core , Syria ’s Obama infatuation reflects its intense disdain for President Bush , another widely shared sentiment in Arab circles .
For the past three years , Washington has tried hard , if unsuccessfully , to isolate Damascus , citing what it claims are Syria ’s secret efforts to develop a nuclear capacity , its pernicious meddling in neighboring Lebanon , its help in sending foreign fighters and arms across its border into Iraq , and its support for militant Islamists throughout the region — for Hamas in Gaza , Islamic Jihad in the Israeli - occupied West Bank , Hezbollah in Lebanon , and Iran , whose interests often coincide with but are not identical to its own .
The U.S. had cooperated rather well with Syria on counterterrorism and other intelligence issues until the 2003 U.S. - led invasion of Iraq .
David Schenker , a former Pentagon official now at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and a skeptic about engagement with Damascus , says that even after Syria opposed Iraq ’s invasion , the Bush Administration sent at least five senior - level delegations between 2003 and 2005 to try to persuade President Assad to abandon his “ unhelpful behavior ” — to no avail .
But after former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri and 22 others died in a car bomb attack in Beirut in February 2005 , White House hardliners , who had long regarded Syria as an unofficial member of the administration ’s “ axis of evil ” — a regime that deserves international quarantine — gained the upper hand .
Media reports and many Lebanese blamed the assassination on Syria , and though Damascus denied responsibility , Washington withdrew its ambassador , a post that has remained vacant ever since .
Soon after Hariri ’s death , massive Lebanese anti-Syrian protests , coupled with international pressure , forced President Assad to withdraw Syrian forces from Lebanon .
American - led financial sanctions were then broadened .
A United Nations tribunal still investigating the assassination has already suggested , in an initial draft report , that Syrian intelligence agents may well have been involved .
Since Hariri ’s murder , White House hardliners have consistently beaten back efforts by some administration officials and outside analysts to reengage with Damascus , as Obama recommends .
Critics of U.S. policy argue that talks are the best means of prying Syria away from its longstanding alliance with Iran , and hence of blocking Teheran ’s efforts to become the region ’s dominant power .
The administration , however , has recently seen its isolation policy undermined by two stunning events , both involving American allies .
In April , Qatar brokered a deal to end the protracted political crisis in Lebanon that gives Iranian - and - Syrian - backed Hezbollah sufficient representation in Parliament to block any proposal it dislikes and gives Lebanon the president that Syria favors .
Shortly thereafter came news that Turkey would broker indirect peace talks between Syria and Israel .
Syria ’s acceptance of the Israeli initiative stunned many analysts in Damascus and Washington , since Israel had bombed an alleged North Korean–supplied nuclear facility in northern Syria last September and is believed to have killed Imad Mughniyyeh , Hezbollah ’s operations chief , in one of the most secure sectors of Damascus in February .
If the resolution of the Lebanon crisis showed the limits of America ’s ability to thwart Hezbollah in its power struggle with Lebanon ’s secular , pro-Western forces , the Israeli initiative effectively pulled the administration ’s isolationist rug out from under it .
While the Bush administration has offered lukewarm support for the Syrian - Israeli peace talks , both Obama and John McCain quickly said they supported the discussions , for which Israel had pressed .
Syrians now believe that the impending American presidential elections hold the promise of engagement not just with Israel , but with Washington — the real prize .
In an interview in April with the Qatari daily Al Watan , President Assad said that to move from indirect to direct talks with Israel , the United States would have to get involved .
“ Direct negotiations require a sponsor , which can only be the U.S. , ” the paper quoted Assad as saying .
“ [ The problem is that ] the current administration has no vision or desire for a peace process . ”
Underscoring the message , Imad Moustapha , Syria ’s ambassador to Washington , told the Wall Street Journal this weekend that Syria is “ genuine in its desire to have the best relationship with Washington . ”
At the moment , he told me , Syrian officials have no contacts with the Bush administration .
Ibrahim Hamidi , the well - connected Damascus bureau chief of the Arabic daily Al Hayat , says that in pursuing indirect talks with Israel now — despite the apparently imminent resignation of their primary sponsor , Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert — Damascus is “ putting the Syrian track on the agenda of the next American administration , ” whoever may lead it .
Damascus clearly favors Obama , but Ambassador Moustapha counsels caution .
Writing in the Forward , a pro-regime monthly , he described as “ wishful thinking ” the widespread Syrian view “ that the demise of the Republicans is inevitable . ”
McCain , he wrote , “ has a solid chance of winning the next election . ”
Syria ’s renewed interest in talking to Israel seems aimed at making it as difficult as possible for whoever emerges as the victor in November to ignore Damascus .

· Lord chief justice feels old style looked out of touch ·
Wigs will not be worn when civil cases are heard
The lord chief justice yesterday modelled the new bare - headed look which will prevail from October 1 when judges hearing civil and family cases in England and Wales consign their 300 - year - old horsehair headgear to history .
From the autumn , most judges will adopt a simple continental - style black gown designed by Betty Jackson .
The move has been pushed through by the lord chief justice , Lord Phillips , who has long believed that judges ' fusty headgear and antiquated garments should be consigned to the dressing - up box .
He and his recent predecessors have argued that the outdated apparel contributes to public attitudes that the judges are out of touch with ordinary life .
But he failed to convince judges hearing criminal cases , who claim that wigs add to the dignity of proceedings and confer an anonymity which stops villains recognising them out of court .
Wigs will continue to be worn by high court judges and circuit judges presiding over criminal cases .
High court judges , who have different sets of robes for winter and summer , will wear just one set of red robes for criminal cases , and the new civil gown for family and civil cases .
Circuit judges - the tier below the high court - will lose their wigs for civil cases but will retain their current gown and tippet rather than moving to the new robe .
Jackson , a former designer of the year , worked for free as the design consultant for the new gown , in consultation with a panel of judges .
The new robe has coloured bands to indicate seniority , with heads of the high court 's four divisions and appeal court judges wearing gold bands and high court judges wearing red .
Judges will no longer wear wing collars and bands for civil and family proceedings .
The new robes will incur a one - off cost of £ 450,000 but are expected to save £ 200,000 a year in kitting out judges .
When he decided to simplify judges ' garb , the lord chief justice expected barristers to follow suit .
But the profession has been fighting to retain its traditional wig and gown .
The Bar Council has twice consulted with its grassroots and has still not announced whether it intends to come into line with the judges .
The consultation has revealed a profound attachment by barristers to their wigs , with well over half wanting to keep their traditional dress for cases in
the House of Lords , court of appeal and high court .
" There is a strong belief in the need for dignified attire to be worn by advocates in the setting of the courtroom , " according to the consultation report .
Judges in Britain 's highest court , the House of Lords , wear no wigs and gowns but may adopt a simple black gown when it becomes the supreme court in October 2009 .
Successive lord chancellors consulted the public twice on possible reform of court dress since the early 1990s but took no action .
It was left to the lord chief justice , who took over as head of the judiciary in 2005 , to bring the judges at least part of the way into the 21st century .

The crew capsule replaces what was a cargo compartment on Jules Verne A model of a proposed European manned spaceship has gone on show at the Berlin Air Show .
The design , which has been produced by EADS Astrium , is based on the unmanned " Jules Verne " freighter recently sent to the International Space Station .
Astrium says a crewed version of the truck is a logical evolution , and could fly in the next decade if it received support from European governments .
Key states - Germany , France , and Italy - are said to be very interested .
The model unveiled at the International Aerospace Exhibition ( ILA ) in Berlin is one - for - one in scale .
The idea is to combine what is essentially the avionics and propulsion end of Jules Verne ( also known as the Automated Transfer Vehicle - ATV ) with a crew compartment taking the place of the current cargo section .
European dependence " From the outside , the overall shape is representative , " explained Frank Pohlemann , the vice - president for strategy and market development at EADS Astrium Space Transportation .
Astrium believes a crewed evolution of the ATV is a logical next step
Enlarge Image
" The interior is more PR - orientated .
We have three leather benches in there ; we have touch screens - we can show simulated flights on the monitors ; but of course the accessible volume is a lot larger than the real vehicle , which would have lots of equipment , a docking port , and these kinds of things . "
But if the interior of the model has a somewhat playful feel for ILA showgoers , Astrium says it is very serious about wanting to take its space freighter to a new level of capability .
At the moment , European Space Agency ( Esa ) astronauts must fly into orbit in a Russian Soyuz or an American shuttle .
The issue of an independent European crew transportation system is currently a hot topic and likely to be on the agenda when space ministers meet for their meeting in The Hague in November .
Two steps Astrium , which has funded the latest concept work itself , says the costs involved in developing its " ATV Evolution " would be very reasonable .
It proposes the work be done in two stages .
The first would be to give the freighter a means of returning non-human items to Earth safely - something it cannot do at present .
How the crewed ship would look
Enlarge Image
This would be much appreciated by Europe 's space partners who will have very limited means of returning materials - science results and failed components - from the International Space Station ( ISS ) once the US shuttles are retired in 2010 .
Astrium says this stage could be flying by 2013 and would cost " well below one billion euros " to achieve .
If ministers agreed , the re-entry freight capsule could then be upgraded to carry three astronauts in a second stage of development .
The maiden mission of a crewed capsule could come in perhaps 2017 .
Mr Pohlemann said the cost of achieving this objective would be " in the frame of a couple of billion " euros .
Ariane role
The two - stage approach would be a clear strategy that space ministers could follow and assess , the Astrium VP added .
" By having flights of the cargo system first , you can already contribute to the qualification of the later crew version , " he told BBC News .
JULES VERNE - ATV
The ship was produced by a consortium of European companies led by EADS Astrium The ATV is the first completely automated rendezvous and docking ship to go to the ISS
Once the US shuttle is retired , it will be the largest supply vessel going to the space station Astrium believes it to be a versatile vehicle that could be adapted for crew transportation
Mission Guide : Jules Verne
" For us , this is about opening up options .
Instead of diving into studies and spending the next five or six years with no concrete development , what we propose is to do something now and open up options . "
Astrium is buoyed by the success of Jules Verne , which is packed with sophisticated navigation , rendezvous and docking technologies ; and by its work done on the Columbus science module which was also despatched to the space station this year .
The pan-European company believes both vessels amply demonstrate just how far European competence in space technology has come in recent years ; and that a crewed ship is now the obvious direction in which to go .
It would need a rocket to take it into orbit and the Ariane 5 is considered to be the most suitable option by Astrium .
The rocket dominates the market for commercial satellite launches but was originally designed with human flights in mind .
" We believe you could take the existing Ariane - 5 lower - composite and outfit it with a series of sensors to tell the vehicle riding on top that something might be going wrong or everything is fine , " Mr Pohlemann said .
" We do n't have these sensors at the moment , but for the rest we think we can take the existing Ariane 5 . " ' Small step '
The ATV Evolution is not the only concept work being undertaken in this arena .
Astrium itself is part of a separate Esa - funded study that is looking at the possibility of developing a crew capability in tandem with the Russians .
Known as the Crew Space Transportation System ( CSTS ) , this project envisages a bigger , more capable ship than Russia 's existing Soyuz system .
However , this is almost certainly a more expensive option because it would require the use of an entirely new rocket .
Europe 's biggest space company describes its ATV Evolution study as " an important contribution to the political decision - making process " - and it is timely .
Esa boss Jean - Jacques Dordain has spoken frequently of his desire to see an independent system ; and the US space agency ( Nasa ) chief , Mike Griffin , has also urged Europe to build its own crew carrier .
Speaking in March at the time of the launch of Jules Verne , Mr Griffin said Europe needed only to take a " small step " to have that capability .

Agent in red wine found to keep hearts young
How , scientists wonder , do the French get away with a clean bill of heart health despite a diet loaded with saturated fats ?
The answer to the so - called " French paradox " may be found in red wine .
More specifically , it may reside in small doses of resveratrol , a natural constituent of grapes , pomegranates , red wine and other foods , according to a new study by an international team of researchers .
Writing this week ( June 3 ) in the online , open - access journal Public Library of Science
One , the researchers report that low doses of resveratrol in the diet of middle - aged mice has a widespread influence on the genetic levers of aging and may confer special protection on the heart .
Specifically , the researchers found that low doses of resveratrol mimic the effects of what is known as caloric restriction - diets with 20 - 30 percent fewer calories than a typical diet - that in numerous studies has been shown to extend lifespan and blunt the effects of aging .
" This brings down the dose of resveratrol toward the consumption reality mode , " says senior author Richard Weindruch , a University of Wisconsin - Madison professor of medicine and a researcher at the William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital .
" At the same time , it plugs into the biology of caloric restriction . "
Previous research has shown that resveratrol in high doses extends lifespan in invertebrates and prevents early mortality in mice given a high - fat diet .
The new study , conducted by researchers from academia and industry , extends those findings , showing that resveratrol in low doses and beginning in middle age can elicit many of the same benefits as a reduced - calorie diet .
" Resveratrol is active in much lower doses than previously thought and mimics a significant fraction of the profile of caloric restriction at the gene expression level , " says Tomas Prolla , a UW - Madison professor of genetics and a senior author of the new report .
The group explored the influence of the agent on heart , muscle and brain by looking for changes in gene expression in those tissues .
As animals age , gene expression in the different tissues of the body changes as genes are switched on and off .
In the new study - which compared the genetic crosstalk of animals on a restricted diet with those fed small doses of resveratrol - the similarities were remarkable , explains lead author Jamie Barger of Madison - based LifeGen Technologies .
In the heart , for example , there are at least 1,029 genes whose functions change with age , and the organ 's function is known to diminish with age .
In animals on a restricted diet , 90 percent of those heart genes experienced altered gene expression profiles , while low doses of resveratrol thwarted age - related change in 92 percent .
The new findings , say the study 's authors , were associated with prevention of the decline in heart function associated with aging .
In short , a glass of wine or food or supplements that contain even small doses of resveratrol are likely to represent " a robust intervention in the retardation of cardiac aging , " the authors note .
That finding may also explain the remarkable heart health of people who live in some regions of France where diets are soaked in saturated fats but the incidence of heart disease , a major cause of mortality in the United States , is low .
In France , meals are traditionally complemented with a glass of red wine .
The new resveratrol study is also important because it suggests that caloric restriction , which has been widely studied in animals from spiders to humans , and resveratrol may govern the same master genetic pathways related to aging .
" There must be a few master biochemical pathways activated in response to caloric restriction , which in turn activate many other pathways , " explains Prolla .
" And resveratrol seems to activate some of these master pathways as well . "
The new findings , according to Weindruch and Prolla , provide strong evidence that resveratrol can improve quality of life through its influence on the different parameters of aging such as cardiac function .
However , whether the agent can extend lifespan in ways similar to caloric restriction will require further study , according to the new report 's authors .

You may think someone over in Israel 's Fisher Institute for Air and Space Strategic Studies had been watching one too many episodes of The Jetsons , but no ... this is a real project .
It looks like an Israeli consortium , led by the Fisher Institute , is attempting to put together the world 's first unpiloted battlefield resupply and evacuation aircraft , dubbed " MedUAV . "
And as the strangely 1960s sci- fi concept drawing shows , it could take the form of a ducted - fan VTOL air car .
Advertisement
The landing - to - evacuation time could be as short as 45 seconds , which would be good news for battlefield casualties needing attention , and for medics who'd otherwise risk coming under fire when attending the conventional way .
The patient pod could even include sensors and a comms system so that doctors could interact with the patient mid-flight .
The Fisher institute is planning on achieving initial test - flights in just 24 months , which sounds like a pretty aggressive schedule , though the first model may start off as a fairly simple UAV .
The vehicle would have a 4 - person payload and fly up to 10,000 feet , managing speeds of 150 kts .
Does that sound like a safe operational envelope given what we know can happen to UAVs ?

A Streetsblog reader named Jessica sends along yet another story of the NYPD ’s failure to treat bike commuters as full - fledged citizens of the City of New York :
This evening around 8 pm I was biking home down 2nd Avenue in the bike lane .
I had a front light , back light , a bell , and was wearing a helmet .
At St. Marks Place I came to a red light and stopped .
When the light went green , I went straight , only to be struck by a minivan making a left hand turn , throwing me and my bicycle to the ground , and the minivan continuing to roll over my front wheel , then stop directly upon it — successfully crushing my fork and mutilating my front wheel .
They stopped , and after checking myself out to realize I was physically fine , I asked about being compensated for the damage .
In their eyes there was no damage .
Knowing its important to report such an accident so that its on official record and could possibly be used to better the infrastructure to prevent such accidents , I called the police .
At that moment the minivan driver became completely uncooperative and felt as though i was wasting her time .
The cops came , said they could issue no tickets because they did not see it with their own eyes , and informed me they could only take a report .
They then said , to receive a copy of the report , I have to go to the precinct and pay $ 10 .
The cops make it seem like I was wasting their time as well , and almost implying to the driver that she had nothing to worry about .

WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
The Magazine answers ...
Clinton would have chosen her words carefully Hillary Clinton says she was " misspeaking " when she incorrectly recalled her trip to Bosnia .
Is this a euphemism ?
After Donald Rumsfeld 's " unknown unknowns " , it 's time to untangle another piece of US politics - speak .
Or should that be misspeak ?
When Hillary Clinton corrected her description of a visit to Bosnia in 1996 , she made an interesting choice of words : " I did misspeak the other day . "
Her initial version of events was that her plane landed under fire and she had to duck and run to her vehicle .
But television footage shows her disembarking with a smile , waving to the crowd and strolling across the tarmac to greet a little girl who read her a poem .
THE ANSWER
Not necessarily .
While one meaning is to fail to tell the whole truth , ' misspeak ' can also mean to speak unclearly or misleadingly , without intent
Clinton 's tale falls flat The word " misspeak " has a long and varied history , says John Simpson , chief editor of the Oxford English Dictionary .
" It goes back to the Old English period before the Norman Conquest to mean to murmur or grumble .
" But it 's got quite a wide sense of meanings , to speak insultingly or improperly or to speak disparagingly or disrespectfully or to speak evil of .
Then in the mid to late Middle Ages , it was to pronounce incorrectly . "
Chaucer used it in the Miller 's Tale - " If that I mysspeke or seye " - as meaning to speak insultingly .
But nearly all these meanings are mostly obsolete , according to the OED .
The citations suggest that this ' misspeaking ' can be deliberate or unintentional
Fiona Douglas
The most common modern sense of " misspeak " is in the US , where it has developed two meanings since the late 19th Century - to speak unclearly or to fail to tell the whole truth , says Mr Simpson .
And it crossed the Atlantic in the mid 20th Century .
Fiona Douglas , a lecturer in English language at the University of Leeds , says the origins of the modern meanings go back to before 1393 , when poet John Gower penned Confessio Amantis .
" The modern senses all have to do with unclear speaking and incorrect or misleading communication .
" The citations suggest that this ' misspeaking ' can be deliberate or unintentional , conscious or unconscious - hence it's quite interesting to speculate exactly what Hillary Clinton 's use of the word actually meant . "
Bush gaffe US politicians have used it before to correct themselves .
How the OED defines it In 2004 , President George W Bush accidentally said : " They [ our enemies ] never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people - and neither do we . "
White House spokesman Scott McClellan responded by saying : " Even the most straightforward and plain - spoken people misspeak . "
There are also references by Ronald Reagan 's staff using it and recently John McCain admitted " misspeaking " after mistakenly saying Iran was arming al - Qaeda .
It 's no accident that politicians have grasped for this phrase , says Cormac McKeown , one of the editors of Collins English Dictionary .
They often do so when they do n't want to say they told a deliberate untruth .
" It can mean to fluff one 's lines , like an actor would , but it can also mean to speak erroneously or hastily without thinking , without giving it proper thought , so Clinton is relying on this ambiguity between the two meanings because then she can't really be proved wrong .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A regular part of the BBC News Magazine , Who , What , Why ?
aims to answer some of the questions behind the headlines " But it 's a stretch of the imagination that it was a slip of the tongue because it was quite a long and involved story that went on for about five minutes .
" So if pressed she might say she was referring to the second meaning but she 's hoping the first meaning carries through in people 's minds . "
Choosing this word is a terrible mistake , says lexicographer Tony Thorne .
Soundbite " She 's in danger of doing what Bill Clinton did in redefining sexual relations .
" She 's redefining telling the truth because ' misspeaking ' is a euphemism for not telling the truth .
It 's the language of bamboozling , which US politicians and the US military love and get away with . "
The word does fill a lexical gap , says Mr Thorne , because alternative ways of saying it are so long - winded , like " I made a mistake , I got it wrong " or " I used the wrong word " , but do n't expect to hear it in the streets any time soon .
" She 's chosen a short , sharp soundbite word but like ' known unknown ' it will probably only be used ironically or mockingly . "

What are these ?

Only in neocon America is an unrepentant war criminal allowed to walk around freely and hawk his book .
That war criminal is Douglas Feith , Iraq invasion and occupation architect with the blood of a million plug Iraqis on his hands .
Feith should be in the docket , not at the National Press Club .
At the event , reports Think Progress , Feith “ repeated his claim that the faulty intelligence regarding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was an ‘ error , ’ not a lie .
Additionally , he insisted that the U.S. had in fact found ‘ a serious WMD threat ’ in Iraq , ” a complete and utter lie offered by Feith to save his skin and salvage his place in history .
While the failure to find presumed stockpiles of dangerous weapons “ was catastrophic to our credibility , ” he said , it was not a result of government deception .
“ It was an honest error , not a lie , ” he said .
“ Even if you correct for that error , what we found in Iraq was a serious WMD threat . “
Au contraire , Spanky .
You knew damn well Iraq did not have WMD one , as the UN made sure to get rid of these back in the mid-1990s , never mind the people you worked for sold these to Saddam Hussein in the first place , mostly for the purpose of killing Iranians back in the 80s .
For now , you are allowed to hawk your lies , but in the final wash history will not be kind to you .
However , it is more the pity we have to wait that long .
Even the Pentagon ’s own inspector general found Feith ’s Office of Special Plans was nothing short of a lie factory .
It was determined there was absolutely no evidence Iraq had WMD , a conclusion backed up by the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency .
Feith and crew simply ignored this .
They made the absurd claim that Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden were buds , never mind the obvious fact they hated each other and said as much .
Post invasion debriefs of Hussein , Tariq Aziz , former Iraqi Intelligence Minister Mani al - Rashid , and supposed senior al - Qaeda operative Ibn al - Shaykh , among others , spelled out the obvious — Iraq had nothing to do with al - Qaeda .
But no mind .
Feith and his gaggle of criminals pushed this nonsense incessantly .
Feith had himself a full plate back in the day .
In addition to the OSP lie factory , he established the Office of Strategic Intelligence , which was closed down after creating a furor in Congress because of its purported aim of “ providing news items , possibly even false ones , to foreign media organizations as part of an effort to influence public sentiment and policy makers , ” that is to say it passed off lies , by way of fellow neocon David Wurmser , to people such as Judith Miller , the New York Times columnist and neocon operative in Eleana Benador ’s stable , connected at the hip with the American Enterprise Institute , a criminal racket .
But war crimes and the lies designed to facilitate them were apparently not enough .
He was questioned by the FBI in relation to the passing by one of his employees of confidential Pentagon documents to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , which in turn passed them to the Israeli Embassy .
Once upon a time , such treason was punished at the gallows , but that was before the country went insane .
Now such criminals are allowed to walk free and sell books while antiwar activists receive terms in prison , quite normal in a land where black is white , up is down , and war pigs get teaching gigs and lucrative speaking engagements .
It is worse , though .
Feith and his firm , Feith & Zell , in cahoots with the Israel - based Zell , Goldberg , & Co. , was allowed to create the Fandz International Law Group , a company unabashedly “ dealing with issues and opportunities relating to the recently ended war with Iraq … and is assisting regional construction and logistics firms to collaborate with contractors from the United States and other coalition countries in implementing infrastructure and other reconstruction projects in Iraq , ” in other words , profiting mightily off the misery of the Iraqi people , that is minus a million or so souls Feith is responsible for killing .
Feith ’s pernicious influence will not die , apparently .
Recall former presidential candidate Mike Huckabee insisting Iraq ’s fictional weapons were hidden like “ Easter eggs ” and moved to Jordan before the invasion .
He also called it an “ overreach ” to say that just because we did n’t find them means they did n’t exist — sort of like saying the tooth fairy exists , never mind nobody has actually ever encountered her .
Douglas Feith needs to be confronted at his book signings and public appearances .
But considering how neocons are protected by a bevy of goons — take as an example the mistreatment of We Are Change journalists at a recent Ollie North lie fest in Kentucky — it does not seem likely Feith will be confronted .
Recall one of Feith ’s partners in crime , David Frum , allowed to attack We Are Change activist Stewart Howe , assaulting him and grabbing at his camera , and you get an idea of the special status these criminals enjoy .
Once upon a time , before criminals hijacked the government , people of Feith ’s caliber were dealt a bit of frontier justice .
For lesser crimes , they were shellacked with tar and feathers and escorted out of town on a rail .
Horse thieves were taken to the nearest tree and hung high for far less egregious crimes .
Now ?
We love or war criminals .
And shower them with book contracts and teaching positions at Georgetown University .

Scientists aim to unlock deep - sea “ secrets ” of Earth ’s crust
RSS James Cook
Scientists from Durham University will use robots to explore the depths of the Atlantic Ocean to study the growth of underwater volcanoes that build the Earth ’s crust .
The Durham experts will lead an international team of 12 scientists aboard Britain ’s Royal Research Ship ( RRS ) James Cook which will set sail from Ponta Delgada , San Miguel , in the Azores , on Friday , May 23 .
During the five - week expedition they will use explorer robots to map individual volcanoes on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge tectonic plate boundary – which effectively runs down the centre of the Atlantic Ocean - almost two miles ( 3 km ) below the surface of the sea .
They will then use another robot , called ISIS , to collect rock samples from the volcanoes which will be dated using various techniques to shed more light on the timescales behind the growth of the Earth ’s crust and the related tectonic plates .
As tectonic plates – formations that make up the Earth ’s shell - are pulled apart by forces in the Earth , rocks deep down in the mantle are pulled up to fill the gap left behind .
As the rocks rise they start to melt and form thousands of volcanoes on the sea floor which eventually cluster into giant ridges .
The ridges along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge plate boundary are each about the size of the Malvern Hills and contain hundreds of individual volcanoes .
Principal investigator Professor Roger Searle , in the Department of Earth Sciences , at Durham University , said : “ The problem is that we do n’t know how fast these volcanoes form or if they all come from melting the same piece of mantle rock .
“ The ridges may form quickly , perhaps in just 10,000 years ( about the time since the end of the last Ice Age ) with hundreds of thousands of years inactivity before the next one forms , or they may take half - a- million years to form , the most recent having begun before the rise of modern humans .
“ Understanding the processes forming the crust is important , because the whole ocean floor , some 60 per cent of the Earth ’s surface , has been recycled and re-formed many times over the Earth ’s history . ”
Professor Searle ’s team will include scientists from the National Oceanography Centre , Southampton , the Open University , the University of Paris and several institutions in the USA .
They will date the volcanoes using radiometric dating ( which measures the radioactive decay of atoms ) and by measuring the changing strength of the Earth ’s magnetic field through time as recorded by the natural magnetism of the rocks .
Co-investigators on this project are Professors Jon Davidson and Yaoling Niu of Durham University ’s Earth Sciences Department , and Dr Bramley Murton of the National Oceanography Centre , Southampton .
The work is funded by a grant from the Natural Environment Research Council , which also owns and operates the RRS James Cook .
A cruise blog will be available at http://www.classroomatsea.net
This week I delivered the opening speech at the annual Spectrum 20 /20 conference that focused on the state of Canadian wireless marketplace .
As the title of this blog posts suggest , I believe that Canadian wireless is in a state of crisis , with limited competition and high data prices .
The talk and slides have been posted to Blip.tv and are embedded below .
Note that I also covered the issue this week in my technology law column ( Toronto Star version , Ottawa Citizen version , Vancouver Sun version , homepage version ) .
I begin by noting that last week 's announcement that the Apple iPhone will make its long awaited Canadian debut later this year generated considerable excitement .
While analysts focused on the bottom line impact for Rogers Wireless , it may be that the most important effects have already been felt in Canada since more than any industry statistics or speeches , the iPhone 's slow entry into Canada has crystallized the view that the Canadian wireless market is hopelessly behind the rest of the world with limited competition , higher prices , and less choice .
The year - long delay of the iPhone – Apple first launched the device last June in the United States followed by France , the United Kingdom , Germany , Ireland , and Austria – provided tangible evidence that the Canadian market desperately needs an injection of competition ( as the sole GSM provider , Rogers was the only carrier capable of supporting the iPhone ) and more competitive pricing ( Canadian data prices are far above the U.S. offer of unlimited data for US $ 20 per month ) .
In many ways , the iPhone saga merely confirmed what many Canadian consumers and businesses have known for some time .
Mobile data pricing in Canada is among the highest in the world , creating a significant barrier to the introduction of new mobile services and causing many consumers to carefully ration their mobile use for fear of being hit with a hefty bill at the end of the month .
The impact of uncompetitive pricing is felt beyond the consumer market .
Last month , the World Economic Forum pointed to problems in the wireless market as a key reason for Canada 's slipping global ranking for " network readiness " ( Canada has moved from 6th worldwide in 2005 to 13th today ) .
Canada ranked 75th in the number of mobile subscribers , trailing countries such as El Salvador , Kazahkstan , and Libya .
It also lagged behind countries such as the United Kingdom , Singapore , Italy , Sweden , and Norway on mobile pricing .
As the country falls further behind the competition , it is time to acknowledge that market forces alone will not solve the issue .
It therefore falls to policy makers to focus on the developing a marketplace framework that encourages greater competition and innovation .
The first step in that direction came last fall when Industry Minister Jim Prentice announced a set aside for new entrants in the forthcoming spectrum auction .
The auction , which runs over the next few weeks , is expected to pave the way for several new wireless competitors , who may join forces to create a fourth national carrier .
While the spectrum set - aside was a good first step , more is needed .
Prentice 's goal should be to create the world 's most flexible regulatory environment that encourages openness and interoperability .
The next round of spectrum auctions , which involves the coveted 700 MHz band , could include mandatory open access requirements that allow carriers , device manufacturers , and service providers to use Canada as the sandbox for mobile innovation .
Many companies are also beginning to focus on the potential of " white spaces , " small bits of spectrum that exist between television frequencies .
The U.S. Federal Communications Commission is currently considering a proposal to make the white space home to unlicensed uses , thereby encouraging further experimentation .
Assuming that potential frequency conflicts can be resolved , Canada should follow suit .
The emphasis on openness could also extend to telecommunications ownership where the current foreign ownership restrictions may artificially limit Canadian competition .
There remains concern about completely opening up the Canadian market to foreign ownership , however , that may be a price worth paying to address the current malaise .
Prentice could also encourage competition by removing the barriers that consumers face in moving between providers .
The introduction last year of wireless number portability , which allows consumers to retain their phone number when they change carriers , helps in this regard .
However , restrictive long - term contracts and government plans to introduce legislation that could prohibit consumers from unlocking their cell phones would represent a case of one step forward , two steps back .
Finally , the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission may want to take a closer look at the mobile marketplace .
The CRTC is committed to a de-regulatory approach and has for years largely left the mobile marketplace alone ( with the exception of undue preferences and unjust discrimination ) , yet the regulatory hole has not served Canadians well .
Canadian iPhone fans may finally get their coveted device , but it is going to take more than a great phone to fix what ails the Canadian mobile marketplace .

A blockbuster from Sam Stein at the Huffington Post ( remember it ’s the Huffington Post that broke Obama ’s “ bitter ” story as well ) :
During the past week , Sen. Hillary Clinton has presented herself as a working class populist , the politician in touch with small town sentiments , compared to the elitism of her opponent , Sen. Barack Obama .
But a telling anecdote from her husband ’s administration shows Hillary Clinton ’s attitudes about the “ lunch - bucket Democrats ” are not exactly pristine .
In January 1995 , as the Clintons were licking their wounds from the 1994 congressional elections , a debate emerged at a retreat at Camp David .
Should the administration make overtures to working class white southerners who had all but forsaken the Democratic Party ?
The then - first lady took a less than inclusive approach .
“ Screw ’em , ” she told her husband .
“ You do n’t owe them a thing , Bill .
They ’re doing nothing for you ; you do n’t have to do anything for them . ”
The statement — which author Benjamin Barber witnessed and wrote about in his book , “ The Truth of Power : Intellectual Affairs in the Clinton White House ” — was prompted by another speaker raising the difficulties of reaching “ Reagan Democrats . ”
It stands in stark contrast to the attitude the New York Democrat has recently taken on the campaign trail , in which she has presented herself as the one candidate who understands the working - class needs .
Rule 1 .
Who and sometimes that refer to people .
That and which refer to groups or things .
Examples :
Anya is the one who rescued the bird .
" The Man That Got Away " is a great song with a grammatical title .
Lokua is on the team that won first place .
She belongs to a great organization , which specializes in saving endangered species .
Rule 2a .
That introduces what is called an essential clause ( also known as a restrictive or defining clause ) .
Essential clauses add information that is vital to the point of the sentence .
Example : I do not trust products that claim " all natural ingredients " because this phrase can mean almost anything .
We would not know the type of products being discussed without the that clause .
Rule 2b .
Which introduces a nonessential clause ( also known as a nonrestrictive or nondefining clause ) , which adds supplementary information .
Example :
The product claiming " all natural ingredients , " which appeared in the Sunday newspaper , is on sale .
The product is already identified .
Therefore , which appeared in the Sunday newspaper is a nonessential clause containing additional , but not essential , information .
NOTE Essential clauses do not have commas introducing or surrounding them , whereas nonessential clauses are introduced or surrounded by commas .
Rule 3 .
If that has already appeared in a sentence , writers sometimes use which to introduce the next clause , whether it is essential or nonessential .
This is done to avoid awkward formations .
Example :
That which does n't kill you makes you stronger .
This sentence is far preferable to the ungainly but technically correct
That that does n't kill you makes you stronger .
In 1965 he was cast as Michelangelo in the film version of Irving Stone ’s novel “ The Agony and the Ecstasy . ” Directed by Carol Reed , the film pitted Mr. Heston ’s temperamental artist against Rex Harrison ’s testy Pope Julius II , who commissioned Michelangelo to create frescoes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel .
Mr. Heston ’s performance took a critical drubbing , but to audiences , the larger - than - life role seemed to be another perfect fit .
Mr. Heston once joked : “ I have played three presidents , three saints and two geniuses .
If that does n’t create an ego problem , nothing does . ”

Foray Into the Future
Mr. Heston was catapulted into the distant future in the 1968 science - fiction film “ Planet of the Apes , ” in which he played an astronaut marooned on a desolate planet and then enslaved by its rulers , a race of anthropomorphic apes .
The film was a hit .
He reprised the role two years later in the sequel , “ Beneath the Planet of the Apes . ”
It was all a long way from Evanston , Ill. , where John Charles Carter was born on Oct. 4 , 1923 , and from the small town of St. Helen , Mich. , where his family moved when he was a small boy and where his father ran a lumber mill .
He attended a one - room school and learned to fish and hunt and to savor the feeling of being self - reliant in the wild , where his shyness was no handicap .
When his parents divorced in the 1930s and his mother remarried  his stepfather ’s surname was Heston  the family moved back to the Chicago suburbs , this time Winnetka .
He joined the theater program at his new high school and went on to enroll at Northwestern University on a scholarship .
By that time , he was convinced he had found his life ’s work .
Mr. Heston also found a fellow drama student , Lydia Clarke , whom he married in 1944 , after spending two years in the Aleutian Islands as a radio - gunner with the Army Air Forces .
After his discharge , the Hestons moved to New York , failed to find work in the theater and , somewhat disenchanted but still determined , moved to North Carolina , where they spent less than a year working at the Thomas Wolfe memorial theater in Asheville .
When they returned to New York in 1947 , Mr. Heston got his first big break , landing the role of Caesar ’s lieutenant in a Broadway production of Shakespeare ’s “ Antony and Cleopatra ” staged by Guthrie McClintick and starring Katharine Cornell .
The production ran for seven months and proved to be the high point of Mr. Heston ’s New York stage career .
He appeared in a handful of other plays , most of them dismal failures .

6 days ago
( CNN ) -- During the week Ryan Samuel , 30 , is a married man working in the energy market in Richardson , Texas .
But on the weekends he lures men away from their homes , wives and children with beer , camaraderie , power tools and " The Ponderosa . "
" The Ponderosa " is a two - story cabin paid for almost entirely with beer .
Three years ago , Samuel , his cousin , his brother - in - law and a host of friends started building a cabin on some family land in Oklahoma .
They named it " The Ponderosa . "
By Samuel 's admission , it 's more like a shack .
It has no power , no plumbing , a leak in the roof and it 's already been set on fire once .
Struggling to find the allure ?
Samuel admits it 's not for everyone .
He 's never shown the place to his wife .
Every time he and his friends go to the cabin , they have to chase hornets , snakes and other varmints out of the building .
Once a cow died in the creek behind the cabin and it stank for weeks .
" You want to talk man caves , this place is a total cave , " said Samuel .
CNN.com and iReport.com got an overwhelming response when we asked readers to send in photos and stories of their man caves -- spaces that foster men's hobbies , decorating skills and technological needs .
Samuel caught our interest when he explained that almost all the building materials and labor used to create " The Ponderosa " were paid for in beer , so we had to give him a call to find out more .
It turns out building a cabin was n't entirely Samuel 's idea .
He and his cousin Jeff used to own a 1963 Winnebago camper they kept on their family 's land in Oklahoma .
One day Samuel got a call from Jeff asking if he wanted " the good news or the bad news . "
" The good news was , ' I 'm building a cabin where our camper is sitting right now , " said Samuel .
The bad news : Jeff sold the camper for spray - foam insulation .
By the time Samuel arrived to survey the situation , Jeff was already laying the floor .
Their adventures continued from there .
They got creative with construction techniques and building materials :
The one window in the cabin is n't actually framed in .
Samuel said he and his friends used a saws - all to cut an opening and then leaned the window onto the hole .
" I have no idea where that window came from , " he said .
Samuel 's cousin Jeff lucked into roofing materials driving down the road one day .
" My cousin was driving down the highway in Oklahoma .
He pulls over and there are 10 rolls of roofing paper on the side of the road , " Samuel said .
His cousin was driving a car that day instead of a truck , so he was only able to fit four of the rolls in the back , but it was more than they needed , he said .
" And right now there 's a tarp over [ the roof ] , because obviously we did n't do it right . "
The cabin's back yard got a facelift after a rainstorm : " We left a bunch of sacks of Quickcrete out on the porch , and they got rained on , " said Samuel .
" They turned into perfect blocks of concrete , " he said , which they used to build a fire pit .
For years Samuel , his relatives and his friends bartered for , borrowed or found the building necessities for their getaway cabin .
Samuel said his cousin knew a lot of people who could help them build or help them get building supplies .
" You get some guys who are married , maybe have children or not , and are looking for any excuse to get away from the house , and have access to or actually have the building materials ..
It 's not hard to talk someone into doing the manual labor , because they 're accomplishing something that they wanted to also .
They 're having a few beers with some buddies .
If they 're hammering some nails or screwing some screws at the same time , that 's fine too , " he said .
This was typical of user comments in reaction to the images and stories we received about man caves .
Many women wanted to know what was so terrible about the man cave - owners ' families that they had to retreat to a cave to get away from them .
Many men piped up in the comment section as well , explaining they felt their wives had reign over the entire rest of the house , and that men deserved at least one space to call their own .
So we asked Samuel what he thought .
" The whole point of it , it 's just guy time , " he said .
" There 's no rules , there 's no bathroom .
It 's just getting away .
...
Most of it is just relaxation and having a good time .
Nothing ever happens out there that can create any extra stress . "
" Half of it is about hanging out with guys , your buddies and the other half is being out where nobody can see you .
Nobody can find you .
You 're way out there -- there 's no city lights hiding the stars .
The time that you can spend out there getting away from it all , doing what you want to do , that 's the reason behind building the thing , " he said .
" When you leave on a Sunday evening and it 's time to go home , you can face all the things that you have to do for that next week .
But for the entire time you 're out there hanging loose , you have no deadlines , nothing else you have to do but just go hang out . "
Officials : Obama begins top secret VP search
Democratic officials say Barack Obama has begun a top - secret search for a running mate .
Democratic officials said Thursday the party 's likely nominee has asked former Fannie Mae CEO Jim Johnson to begin vetting potential vice presidential picks .
Johnson did the same job for Democratic nominees John Kerry in 2004 and Walter Mondale in 1984 .
The Democratic officials spoke on a condition of anonymity about a process that the campaign wants to keep quiet .
Vice presidential searches are usually closely held secrets , but Obama campaign officials say the effort is being handled by a particularly tight circle of advisers .
The campaign also does not want to discuss the effort because they are still engaged in a fading primary campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton .
Internet Thought Control Bill Under Fire
House Committee Dismisses Criticisms of
Internet Thought Control Bill - H.R. 1995
By Michael Collins
Washington , D.C .
Part 2 ( Part 1 )
On Monday , Dec. 17 , the House Committee on Homeland Security posted this document in response to the many criticisms of House Resolution 1955 , The Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007 .
Part 1 of this series examined the dangers that this bill posed to citizens and political groups using the Internet .
Based on the bill contents and the witnesses called to elaborate on the supposed problem of " homegrown terrorism , " it appears that House bill and the Senate look alike ( S.1959 ) pose a significant threat to political expression and free speech , particularly on the Internet ( see Thought Control on the Internet and this collection for more detail ) .
H.R. 1955 passed by a 404- 6 margin on Oct 23 , 2007 .
On Nov. 6 , 2007 , the Subcommittee on Intelligence , Information Sharing and Terrorism Risk Assessment held a one hour plus hearing .
Witnesses from " think tanks " elaborated on the need for the legislation .
( Full video ) Mark Weitzman was highly specific in portraying the Internet as a major source of violent radicalization .
He showed slides of Internet web sites ; he included some domestic political groups with very high visibility , and defined the threats as net - based communication and proselytizing .

Sen. Barak Obama ( D - IL ) wrote
The Independent and said
he has no position on S. 1959 ( the Senate equivalent of H.R .
1955 ) .
This followed The Independent 's story that
his emails to constituents indicated support for the bill .
There was a huge reaction to this hearing by U.S. political groups across the political spectrum .
The reaction was so strong that presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) revised his apparent position of support as indicated in emails to constituents .
In a recent email to The Independent the candidate 's staff said that " Senator Obama has not taken a position on S. 1959 .
Should the bill be considered by the Homeland Security Committee , he will carefully evaluate it , as he does with all pieces of legislation , "
Committee on Homeland Security Staff Issues Response
Rep .
Harman 's subcommittee hearings sparked the controversy surrounding this legislation .
Yet the main committee staff issued the three page response , not the subcommittee staff .
The use of the committee staff may indicate some serious damage control .
The Internet is not the third rail of U.S. politics but its heading in that direction .
On the first page of their response , the committee staff stated :
This legislation in no way restricts thought or speech .
Both of these are legal activities that should be encouraged by all segments of our society and are welcomed in our system of open debate and dialogue .
Radical thinking is not a crime and this legislation does not turn radical thinking into criminal behavior .
It 's good to know that free thought and speech are still legal .
However , there have been several extended periods in U.S. history where free thought and speech were seriously threatened .
The most recent is the period dominated by McCarthyism from the late 1940 's through the 1950's .
The Smith Act ( Alien Registration Act ) of 1940 has a 20 year jail term for anyone who " prints , publishes , edits , issues , circulates , sells , distributes , or publicly displays " information that would lead to the overthrow of the government .
The McCarran Internal Security
Act also enabled this period calling for " alien exclusion and deportation laws and allowing for the detention of dangerous , disloyal , or subversive persons in times of war or internal security emergency ... "
During this time , the House Un- American Activities Committee ( HUAC ) and Sen. Joseph McCarthy ( R - WI ) terrorized citizens by calling them as before congressional committees where they were accused of being disloyal to the United States .
Victims included people who merely attended a rally deemed subversive ; those who formerly sympathized with the left but were disillusioned ; active leftists ; and completely uninvolved citizens smeared through guilt by association .

More elites voice their opinions :
More than 200 economists , including four Nobel prize winners , signed a letter rejecting proposals by presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and John McCain to offer a summertime gas - tax holiday .
Columbia University economist Joseph Stiglitz , former Congressional Budget Office Director Alice Rivlin and 2007 Nobel winner Roger Myerson are among those who signed the letter calling proposals to temporarily lift the tax a bad idea .
Another is Richard Schmalensee of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , who was member of President George H.W. Bush ’s Council of Economic Advisers .

Evidence is stacking up to suggest that the alleged " suicide " of DC Madam Deborah Jeane Palfrey was in fact a calculated murder , as the manager of Palfrey ’s Florida Condo reveals that Palfrey was not suicidal when he spoke to her Monday and told him of her fears about a contract being out on her life .
The new testimony is backed up by at least four other recorded public statements on behalf of Palfrey attesting to the fact that she would never commit suicide and if she was found dead to immediately suspect murder .
Despite these on - the - record statements , the majority of the corporate media has ignored each one and instead given credence to the unverified claim of a professional conspiracy debunker who has been caught fabricating statements in the past .
The building manager of Park Lake Towers in Orlando , where Palfrey owned a condo , told WESH 2 news channel that he spoke to Palfrey on Monday as she was packing to leave for her mother ’s house and she did not seem upset or suicidal .
" Jean Palfrey was a class act .
She wore very good clothes .
She was well educated .
Her way out of this world certainly would not have been in an aluminum shed attached to a mobile home in Tarpon Springs , Florida , " said the manager , who did not want to be named .
The manager said that Palfrey had told him of her fears that a contract hit was out on her life .
" She insinuated that there is a contract out for her and I fully believe they succeeded , " he stated .
According to the manger , Palfrey left for her mother ’s house with some suitcases and a box .
" She had one white paper file box that she told me had some important paper with her and then she just kind of raised her eyebrows like you ’re supposed to think oh yeah , that ’s all the information that she had on her business in Washington , " her building manager said .
If Palfrey was planning to commit suicide just three days later then why did she leave with several suitcases and a box of files ?
According to an AP report , " Blanche Palfrey ( her mother ) had no sign that her daughter was suicidal , and there was no immediate indication that alcohol or drugs were involved , police Capt .
Jeffrey Young said , " .
On at least four previous occasions , both in the past and more recently , Palfrey publicly stated that she would never commit suicide .
Twice on The Alex Jones Show , the most recent example being less than two months ago , Palfrey made clear her intention never to kill herself ( Click here for MP3 ) .
" No I ’m not planning to commit suicide , " Palfrey told The Alex Jones Show on her last appearance in March , " I ’m planning on going into court and defending myself vigorously and exposing the government , " she said .
" Not to be concerned , I have no intention of letting anyone buy me off or make any kind of a deal with me …. and I ’m not planning to commit suicide either , " said Palfrey on a separate occasion .
Alex Jones also talked directly to Palfrey during show breaks and she re-stated her intention never to commit suicide and made it clear that if she was found dead to consider it murder .
GCN
Live radio board operators are also witnesses to these statements .
Though never confirmed directly , Palfrey strongly insinuated that both Dick Cheney and John McCain were possibly involved in the DC Madam scandal , and this could have been one of the primary reasons why she was murdered .
During a May 2007 interview with Carol Joynt , host of the Q&A Cafe interview series , during a discussion about the alleged suicide of Palfrey ’s former call girl Brandy Britton , Palfrey stated , " I do n’t want to be like her .
I do n’t want to end up like her . "
During another appearance on The Alex Jones Show , Palfrey said she thought it was possible that Britton ’s " suicide " was actually murder because none of Britton ’s loved ones considered her to be suicidal .
Palfrey is on record as warning that any " suicide " would just be a cover - story for murder as far back as 1991 .
" If taken into custody , my physical safety and most probably my very life would be jeopardized , " she wrote in August 1991 following an attempt to bring her to trial , " Rape , beating , maiming , disfigurement and more than likely murder disguised in the form of just another jailhouse accident or suicide would await me , " said Palfrey in a handwritten letter to the judge accusing the San Diego police vice squad of having a vendetta against her .
Despite these four separate examples of Palfrey stating – on the record – that she would not commit suicide – the corporate media , within hours of the announcement of her death , immediately afforded credence to the claim of a " friend , " investigative journalist Dan Moldea , who said Palfrey had told him of her intention to commit suicide .
Moldea has no tape , he has no other eyewitnesses , and he has been caught fabricating statements in the past , and yet the media took his words as gospel .
In addition , if Moldea was aware of Palfrey ’s intention to kill herself then why , if he was her " friend " as he claims , did n’t he try to stop her from doing so ?
The numerous examples of Palfrey stating that she would never commit suicide in addition to her condo manager and her own mother stating that she was not suicidal clearly provide justification for an exhaustive police and FBI investigation to be undertaken .
Despite these glaring factors , the police who discovered Palfrey ’s body immediately ruled that no foul play was involved and closed the book .
The knowledge that Palfrey had about members of Washington ’s elite being involved in and using her escort service for the purposes of hiring prostitutes would have been enough to end scores of careers and wreck the lives of countless influential power brokers .
This alone , allied with Palfrey ’s on the record statements , demand an immediate and thorough investigation in an attempt to bring to justice the murderers of Deborah Jeane Palfrey .

Consumers are being ripped off , deliberately confused and misled by the websites of leading airlines , a report for the European Commission has found .
A survey of 386 websites in 13 European countries discovered that just under a third were breaking the law , either by concealing charges or misleading the public with promotional offers that were not in fact obtainable .
The European Commission is taking enforcement action against 137 of the websites .
Ryanair , Austrian Airlines and the Finnish airline Blue 1 were among the offenders , according to Swedish and Norwegian authorities , while third parties such as tour operators and travel agents also came under fire .

In total the websites are administered by 80 companies , which have 12 months to demonstrate their compliance with trading regulations or face hefty fines and even closure .
Fifty - eight per cent of them discreetly added extra charges that were not included in advertisements , such as booking fees , " airport charges " , or fees relating to credit card payment , priority booking , luggage and fuel .
Forty - nine per cent of the illegal websites broke regulations relating to pre-checked boxes on booking forms which required consumers to specifically decline a service in order to avoid extra charges .
The other main problem was the lack of seats available at the fares seen on advertisements .
Meglena Kuneva , the EU's Consumer Commissioner , said that despite repeated warnings , many airlines had refused to improve their online operation .
" It is unacceptable that one in three consumers going to book a plane ticket online is being ripped off or misled and confused , " she said .
It 's been reported in both the Sun-Sentinel and Miami Herald unquestioningly as " anti-Semitic . "
The Broward Sheriff 's Office agrees and has gone as far as using subpoena power to investigate what it says may be a hate crime .
What is it ?
A Hitler mustache and the words " Nazi bitch . "
The offending material appeared on a political blog in Cooper City during the height of the election season in January .
A post on the blog pictured Mayor Debbie Eisinger with a square of scribble on her upper lip and the epithet included .
This , of course , is n't anti-Semitic on its face ( so to speak ) .
Think about it :
Whoever posted it was comparing Eisinger – who is known as a power - hungry politician in Cooper City – to the most reviled dictator of all time and certainly not in a favorable light .
If anything , it 's anti-Nazi .
Bloggers compare George W. Bush to Hitler quite a lot , and , while some might call it distasteful and wrong , I 've never heard it called anti-Semitic .
And I 've certainly never heard of any instance where it was investigated as a potential crime .
Except in Broward County , where deputies took the extreme measure of sending subpoenas out to Google and AT&T to uncover the owner of the blog , which was called " Save Cooper City " and is now defunct .
The blog 's owner , according to deputies , is Commissioner John Sims , who is now the subject of a recall petition organized by the mayor and her political backers .
Their cry : " Anti-Semitism ! "
My cry : " Anti-Americanism ! "
The pro-mayoral forces are led by former commissioner Elliot Kleiman and Eisinger 's campaign manager , Lori Green .
Also lurking in the background is big - time Broward lobbyist Judy Stern , a paid political consultant to Eisinger who is blamed , rightly or wrongly , for some of the more extreme tactics employed by Eisinger and Co .
And together they are trying to overturn a democratic election based on a spurious argument that Sims hates Jews .
It 's an emotional heart - tugger of an accusation that is sure to get pens to wagging on petition forms .
If you ever met Kleiman and Green , you would notice immediately that they seem to be perfectly nice and reasonable people .
But the blood sport of politics has obviously gotten under their skins .
They are holding meetings to encourage people to hound Sims at City Hall until he gives up and resigns , and they are distributing all kinds of personal information about the commissioner in an attempt to disgrace him further .
" To save him the embarrassment of being recalled , he can resign , " Kleiman told a group of citizens at a recall meeting last Tuesday .
" And I think we should remind him of that at commission meetings . "
This coming from a buttoned - down and bespectacled former professor whose main issue , prior to losing his election in March , was lowering the speed limit in Cooper City neighborhoods .
All indications are that he 's become obsessed with destroying John Sims .
And though Sims is certainly no saint and has likely brought a lot of this upon himself , no one deserves the underhanded beating he 's being given .
In addition to leading the recall drive , Kleiman has a personal website ( www.elliot.cc) that is all about Sims , all the time .
Ironically , it 's the only place in town where you can see the original post that compares the mayor to Hitler .
The recall group is also handing out information about a domestic battery charge filed against Sims back in 1991 , when he was going through a tough divorce and was accused by his ex-wife of pushing her and trying to pull the wedding ring off her finger .
Involved in that case was a psychological evaluation that basically found Sims has some psychological problems , including a penchant toward narcissism and an inability to deal with stress but that he did n't seem violent by nature .
The court documents , by the way , are actually recycled news .
Kleiman 's son , Scott , himself a former commissioner , trotted them out during Sims ' campaign last year , and it did n't keep the candidate from winning .
" I was n't even aware my son was going to present that to the commission , believe it or not , " says Elliot Kleiman of his son 's rather low political tactic .
" And I did n't want to distribute the stuff about his past .
But [ the recall committee ] elected to do so . "
The animosity between Sims and the members of the recall committee goes back to a CBS - 4 report in 2006 that included undercover footage of Kleiman , Eisinger , and other Cooper City officials drinking prior to commission meetings .
It was a sizable scandal that shamed Eisinger and may have led voters to oust Kleiman during the last election .
Kleiman blames
Sims as the source for the story , but both Sims and the reporter on the piece , Mike Kirsch , deny that .
Ed Wooley , a retired freight executive with an MBA from Harvard who lost his bid for election , says the real reason for the recall is simple : Eisinger wants to get rid of Sims so she can have the necessary four votes to decide who will be named city manager ( longtime city manager Chris Farrell recently retired ) .
" I do n't believe this is really about anti-Semitism at all — it 's all a red herring , " says Wooley , who has been active in Cooper City politics for the past decade .
" And they 've roped some people into believing it . "
The mayor 's campaign manager , Green , says it 's about the reference to Hitler .
" This is above and beyond criticism , this is referencing an atrocity in international history under the Hitler regime , " she says .
" This is on the same level as a noose or a cross burning . "
Green , who like Kleiman is Jewish , says the blog posting does n't constitute a hate crime — yet .
" Right now there is no legislation against Internet bullying or hate , " she says .
" But I absolutely think there should be . "
Obviously the blog posting is n't a crime ; it 's free speech if ever there was such a thing .
So why did the BSO investigate it ?
Well , that 's where this case gets very interesting .
After the blog posting appeared on January 12 , Green and the rest of the Eisinger camp were up in arms .
Green says she did n't speak with deputies about it but that someone from the campaign might have .
Bottom line :
There was nothing that could be done about the Hitler mustache .
Six days after the blog posting , a car owned by Green was vandalized in her driveway in the upscale and gated Embassy Lakes neighborhood .
Apparently someone had scratched a swastika into it with a rock .
No one can ever remember such a thing ever happening in Embassy Lakes before .
Green complained to deputies and told them about the " Nazi bitch " blog posting and gave them the Web address .
She also told deputies that she and Eisinger had " political enemies " who might be responsible .
That 's when Cooper City investigators turned to BSO 's sex crimes unit , which is adept at obtaining IP addresses , and subpoenaed the information from Google and AT&T .
It 's similar to a political case in Deerfield Beach where another blog ( Deerfield Beach Insider ) was exposed by deputies after comments were posted that were critical of the city and deemed to be threatening .
No arrest was made in that case , thankfully , and no arrest has been made in this one either .
The swastika also remains a mystery .
Some , including Sims and Wooley , say it was either a kids ' prank or that someone from Eisinger 's camp did it to get sympathy votes for the election .
Green emphatically denies that it was a campaign ploy , and there is certainly no evidence that it was one .
Sims , for his part , says he had nothing to do with the swastika or the blog , even though BSO claims it was started on his computer .
He says he has lawyers working on a lawsuit that he intends to file against Eisinger and other members of her camp .
" Judy Stern and Debbie Eisinger are masters at this kind of thing , " he says , adding that he thinks it 's all payback for the CBS - 4 piece .
" I look at the people they are tied to in this campaign against me and it scares the hell out of me .
The target on my back just keeps getting bigger and bigger .
" I 'm going after these people .
It 's pretty serious what they have done here .
We 're talking about civil conspiracy , defamation , you name it , it 's happened . "
His last word on the subject : " I 'm not going anywhere . "
Scientists who compared recorded Antarctic temperatures and snowfall accumulation to predictions by major computer models of global climate change offer both good and bad news .
The models ’ predictions covering the last 50 years broadly follow the actual observed temperatures and snowfall for the southernmost continent , although the observations are very variable .
That ’s the good news .
The bad news , however , is that a similar comparison that includes the entire last century is a poor match Projections of temperatures and snowfall ranged from 2.5 to five times what they actually were during that period .
The findings , reported last month in the journal Geophysical Research Letters , suggest that current computer models of the effects of global warming may not work as well for the remote Antarctic regions .
“ This does n’t say that global warming from a planetary perspective is wrong , ” argues David Bromwich , professor of geography at Ohio State .
“ It says nothing about the tropics or the subtropics !
“ It does imply that with the ocean north of Antarctica and the continent itself , there are some significant issues with the current climate models . ”
Bromwich ’s emphasis can be traced back to a preliminary report he gave a year ago at a major national science meeting .
He announced then that an apparent conflict existed between the models ’
Antarctic predictions and the actual recorded data .
People who deny climate change flocked to the report as evidence that the planet was n’t at risk , in spite of overwhelming evidence that it is .
“ I think the reaction to this new work may be pretty much what it was the last time , ” Bromwich said sadly .
In their latest work , Bromwich , Andrew Monaghan , formerly a researcher at Ohio State ’s Byrd Polar Research Center , and David Schneider from the National Center for Atmospheric Research , relied on two sets of data .
Monaghan has since joined the staff at NCAR .
One set came from observations of snowfall and temperature recorded from Antarctica since the International Geophysical Year a half - century ago .
The other consisted of temperature data derived from short ice cores recovered from the continent .
This information was compared to an average taken from five of the major climate change models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) for that period .
While there are 23 global climate models ( GCMs ) available , the average of these five provided the best combination for this research .
Most worrisome is the finding that the century - long data set shows temperatures that vary from 2.5 to five times higher than actually occurred , based on the data .
The models show a warming of the continent at the global rate , whereas the actual warming is much more muted .
Bromwich and his colleagues think they may know why the predictions vary so much from the records .
They ’re blaming the errors on water vapor in the atmosphere over the ice .
They suggest that long - wave radiation emitted by water vapor may be heating the ice surface and raising the temperature projected by the models .
“ The models predict the water vapor , ” Bromwich says , “ but we do n’t have anything to actually measure the amount of water vapor over the Antarctic continent .
“ Regarding water vapor over mainland Antarctica , the models just have to be wrong , ” he said .
Bromwich says that the Antarctic climate has not warmed like the rest of the globe due , in part , to the strengthening of winds around the continent .
That strengthening is driven by a combination of the Antarctic ozone hole in the stratosphere , greenhouse gas increases and internal climate variability across the continent , he says .
“ We do n’t know how any of these factors will evolve during the coming century and therefore , there is still considerable uncertainty as to how much warming will occur in Antarctica , ” he says .
“ Most people are convinced that the warming along the Antarctic Peninsula is due to human influences , but the question is how far south that warming will go , and what effect it will have , ” Bromwich says .
Key to this is that if melted , the ice stacked atop the Antarctic continent is enough to raise sea levels 200 feet worldwide .
“ That question of global sea level rise should be one that is relevant to almost everybody , ” he said .

• GoldenPalaceDotCom Silverman .
In 2005 , the Internet casino GoldenPalace.com paid $ 15,000 to name a baby after itself and got more than it paid for in media attention .
Sure most people condemned this sort of outrageous publicity stunt - some even calling it a form of child abuse - but the good news was that GoldenPalaceDotCom Silverman was born healthy at 7 pounds , 10 ounces on May 19 , 2005 .
Actually , baby Silverman was n't the only human in the world named after the casino :
In the same year , a 33 - year - old mother of five named Terri Ilagan auctioned off the right to her name on eBay , which the casino won for a mere $ 15,199 .
The re-branded Mrs. GoldenPalace.com said : " To my kids and to my husband , I will always be Terri .
My husband is real supportive .
He thinks it 's funny .
As long as they get to call me Mom , they do n't care .
They are already starting to tease me and call me Goldie . "

In 1991 , Elisabeth Hallin and Lasse Diding wanted to protest the naming law of Sweden , which states that the court can diapprove of names that " for some obvious reason are not suitable as a first name . "
They were fined 5,000 kronor ( about $ 680 at the time ) .
The parents claimed that the 43 - character name as " a pregnant , expressionistic development that we see as an artistic creation . "
The court did n't buy it and upheld the fine .
Then the parents tried to resubmit the name as " A " ( yes , one letter - also pronounced " albin " ) .
The court did n't buy that either , saying that one letter names are prohibited .
The baby finally went with " Albin Hallin " though in his passport his name was given as " Icke namngivet gossebarn " meaning " unnamed little boy . "

Rich - supersize
Sunday I learned that I am insensitive after I wrote a column arguing that families who earn as much as $ 200,000 to $ 250,000 are " rich . "
A San Francisco couple earning $ 205,000 informed me they " should n't be considered anything but working middle class . "
A $ 215,000 couple told me , " Families making $ 200,000 a year are not rich .
They 're not even close to rich . "
A San Francisco lawyer explained that a $ 200,000 salary cannot make one rich because a " a ' rich ' person does not need to work . "
Like Bruce Wayne .
I live in the Bay Area .
I know how expensive it is .
I also think a country that has supersize everything from popcorn to sport utility vehicles can add a new jumbo - scale item to the list - supersize rich .
Being simply rich is not enough .
Rich no longer means that you earn more than 93 percent of the people in your town - yes , even in Ess Eff , about 93 percent of households get by on less than $ 200,000 a year .
Nor does it mean you earn more than 97 percent of the rest of the country .
Rich now means Bill Gates .
Really .
Last year , the California Budget Project calculated the earnings which a two - worker family with two children must earn in the Bay Area to be middle class - that is , to make enough money to provide a safe home and " make ends meet without help from public programs . "
The magic number : $ 77,076 - less if the family does not have to buy its own health care or pay for child care .
So I called CBP's Jean Ross to ask her if she thinks $ 200,000 - plus makes a Bay Area family rich .
" I would certainly describe that as the nation 's highest income earners , " Ross answered .
But would she call it rich ?
She demurred .
Until finally I asked , is there anyone you would call rich ?
" Bill Gates , certainly . "
You would think that " rich " is a slur - goddess forbid people think you earn a lot of money .
Sure , they 're earning more than 97 percent of Americans , but they can not be rich because they own older cars , or they do n't travel abroad , or they only are saving for their kids ' college and retirement .
They see only what other people have and they do not have .
They do not see what they have , but others do not .
They apparently do not notice the people with whom they work every day who live on less .
They are not chastened by SFGate.com commenters who were appalled that anyone would complain that he could not buy a home or put aside any savings on a measly $ 200,000 - plus a year .
The purpose of Sunday 's column was to address the craven pledges made by Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama not to raise taxes on the middle class .
Clinton promised not to raise " a single tax on middle - class Americans , people making less than $ 250,000 a year . "
Obama made a similar pledge for incomes up to between $ 200,000 and $ 250,000 .
Both Democrats promise middle - class tax cuts , a list of new spending , an end to deficit spending and they even say they will address the pending entitlement crisis - but they will only raise income taxes on the top 3 percent of earners in America .
That gives top earners a motive to cry poor .
Another motive :
The nonpartisan Tax Foundation found that in 2005 , the top 1 percent of taxpayers paid 40 percent of federal income tax revenues ; the top 5 percent paid 60 percent of federal income taxes .
Now , if top earners want to argue that they pay so much that they should not have to shoulder all new spending , I am on board .
After all , if the Democrats ' programs are so important , they ought to be important enough that everyone pays for them .
But do not cry poor .
It looks bad to the other 97 percent .
International Space Station commander Peggy Whitson floats in weightlessness while posing for a photograph during her six - month Expedition 16 mission .
The American commander of the International Space Station ( ISS ) set a new U.S.spaceflight record Wednesday as her crewmate geared up for an extra - longbaseball pitch .
NASAastronaut Peggy Whitson , the station ? sfirst female commander , surpassed her 374th day in space to take the U.S. title for most cumulative time spent in orbit .
By the time she lands onSaturday with flight engineer Yuri Malenchenko and South Korean astronautSo - yeon
Yi , she ?ll increase her lead to 377 days in orbit over twospaceflights .
? Well thisis news to me that I ?m about to break that record tomorrow .
Of course it makesme happy , ?
Whitson toldreporters Tuesday , adding that she expected to work through the milestone .?
It ?ll be a day like any other , though .?
ForWhitson ?s fellow NASA crewmate Garrett Reisman , today includes an extra orbitalhighlight .
The devoted New York Yankees baseball fan will throw out the firstpitch via video during the team ?s showdown with the Boston Red Sox tonight .
? Flying inspace is really great , but throwing out the first pitch at a Yankees - Red Soxgame ?
I am really excited about it , ?
Reisman said Tuesday .
A native of Parsippany , N.J , Reisman launched to the ISS on March 11 aboard NASA ?s spaceshuttle Endeavour to join the Expedition 16 crew .
He carried dirt from the Yankees Stadium pitcher ?s mound , a Yankees banner and a hat autographed by theteam ?s principal owner George Steinbrenner to the station asmementos .
? I amreally honored to have this opportunity in such a historic season in the Housethat Ruth Built , and I would like to thank the Yankees for being so supportiveof our mission up here in space , ?
Reisman said in a statement .
?
From Earth 'sorbit , but still deep inside the Yankees Universe , let me say , ' GoYanks ! ' "
From hisperch aboard the station , 220 miles ( 354 km ) above Earth and flying at 17,500 mph ( 28,163 kph ) , Reisman said it was hard to pin down exactly where his pitch — which NASA has billed as the ultimate fastball at 5 miles per second — wouldpass over home plate .
? The bestthing about throwing a pitch up here is that it ?s impossible to bounce it , ? hesaid Tuesday .
A spacerecord revealed
Whitsontook the U.S. spaceflight record from NASA astronaut Mike Foale , who spent 373 days , 18 hours and 18 minutes in orbit during six career spaceflights thatincluded a tour as ISS commander during the Expedition 8 mission between 2003 and 2004 .
As theskipper of the station ? s Expedition 16 mission , Whitson is in the 190th day ofher flight and spent just over 185 days aboard the space station as anExpedition 5 flight engineer in 2002 .
She holds the world record for mostspacewalking time by a female astronaut and is now 20th on the world - wide list ofmost experienced spaceflyers .
At the topof the all - time spaceflight list is Russian cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev , asix - time spaceflyer who spent just over 803 days in space across two U.S.shuttle flights and four long - duration missions to the Space Station Mir and ISS .
Malenchenko , also a Russian cosmonaut , will move up to ninth in thecumulative spaceflight ranks with 515 total days when he lands with Whitson and Yi .
Whitson and Malenchenko are handing over control of the ISS over to Expedition 17 commanderSergei Volkov — a second - generation Russian cosmonaut — and flight engineerOleg Kononenko , who arrived at the station with Yi last week .
The twoExpedition 16 spaceflyers are due to land with Yi on the Central Asian steppesof Kazakhstan at about 4:27 a.m. EDT ( 0827 GMT ) on Saturday while Reismanremains aboard the station to join the Expedition 17 mission .
NASA will broadcast the undocking and landing of Yi and the station 's Expedition 16 crew live on NASA TV beginning Friday at 9:30 p.m. EDT ( 0130 April 19 GMT ) .

Now my replies to the critics .
I suppose I should n't bother , I suppose I should just let it go and focus on the love .
But I seem to be constitutionally incapable of letting unfair or inaccurate accusations just slide .
So here are my replies to some of the critical comments ' common themes .
Okay .
There is absolutely no way I can reply individually to everyone who commented on the Atheists and Anger post .
The size of this thing took me by surprise .
It 's still taking me by surprise .
So please accept my apologies for this mass reply .
First , I want to say to everyone who sent the love :
Thank you so much .
You have no idea .
I 've spent the last two days either bouncing off the walls with joy ... or sitting at my computer on the sofa with tears in my eyes .
I 'm sorry if that sounds sappy , but I 'm feeling sappy , so suck it up .
The fact that this piece touched so many people , inspired so many people ... that is huge .
That is why I became a writer .
That is the meaning of my life .
Thank you for letting me know .
And I 've learned a lesson about commenting on blogs .
I have a tendency to not bother commenting to a post when all I have to say is " Attaboy " or " You go , girl ! " or " Thank you . "
Especially when there are already dozens or hundreds of comments in a thread , and other people have already said what I was going to say .
But I 've read every single one of these comments , and I was touched by every " Attaboy " I read .
So now I know : Even if all I have to say is " Attaboy , " I should say it anyway .
You 're censoring / deleting my comments .
No , I 'm not .
The new , " improved " Typepad comment format is hard to navigate , and on behalf of Typepad I apologize for that -- but all the comments are there .
As of this writing , I have n't deleted a single comment in this thread .
Not one .
Read this more detailed explanation ; it has instructions on how to navigate the comments format .
( BTW : In the future , if you want to complain that a blogger is deleting your comments , you might want to provide an email address or a URL , or even email them off - blog , so they have the option of contacting you and letting you know if your " censored " comments are really just a technical glitch . )
Wow , you 're an angry person .
That 's bad .
Um ....
Actually , I 'm not a very angry person .
Not most of the time .
Generally speaking , I 'm a very happy person .
Ask anyone I know .
I 'm usually good - tempered , cheerful , optimistic , easy to please , and inclined to give people the benefit of the doubt unless they prove that they do n't deserve it .
My life is full of joy and pleasure : I 'm very conscious of how fortunate I am ; and I make sure to savor my life ... especially since I think it 's the only one I 've got .
And if you 'll read more of my writing than just this one blog post , you 'll see that .
Try this , or this , or this .
There are , however , things I 'm angry about .
And I think my anger over those things is valid .
I spent 4,650 words explaining why I think my anger is valid -- and why I think anger in general over injustice and mistreatment is not only valid but useful and necessary .
I 'm not going to explain it again here .
I basically wrote this piece because I got very , very tired of hearing believers ask atheists , " Why are you so angry ? " when the answer seemed perfectly obvious to me .
I wanted to answer that question once and for all , so I would n't have to answer it anymore .
( And from the response I 've gotten to the post -- the godless commenters who are saying things like , " I 'm bookmarking this page so I can point to it when people ask me why we 're so angry " -- I 'm apparently not the only one . )
But it 's not like I 'm running around smashing plates and going " Rrrr! Rrrr! Rrrr ! " all the time .
It is possible , even healthy , to be a generally happy and upbeat person , and still sometimes gets angry about things .
To assume that because I vented my anger in one blog post , I therefore must be spewing rage every second ... that 's a little bit silly , do n't you think ?
Your anger is just hurting yourself .
I must respectfully beg to differ .
Anger , when it 's directed at a real cause of mistreatment or injustice ( towards yourself or towards others ) is healthy , and it can be a useful , constructive motivator to change things .
Ask any therapist .
What hurts is repressing anger .
Anyway , see above re : me not being angry every second of every day .
Really , I 'm not .
Thank you for your concern , but it 's not necessary .
Your anger is just hurting your cause .
Again , I must respectfully beg to differ .
The whole second section of my post was about why I think anger is valuable and necessary in any social movement .
And I 've written at greater length on that point elsewhere .
And as commenters in the rant have pointed out , even the social movement leaders who generally get tagged as the non-angry , peaceful , " good cops " -- Martin Luther King , Gandhi -- were very angry indeed .
They just channeled their anger in constructive ways .
Which I think is a grand idea .
But acknowledging that anger and expressing it is an important part of that process .
Why did n't you write more about Muslims ?
Why did the post focus so much on Christianity ?
This is actually a fair question , and I 'm just sorry it got raised in such a troll -y way .
So I 'll answer it as if it had n't .
Short answer :
( a) I was trying to focus on things that I had some personal experience with .
I was writing emotionally , and the Christian theocracy is what I have a lot more personal experience with ... and thus a lot more personal anger about .
( b) I was trying to keep it ... well , not short , obviously , but less than novel - length .
My piece could easily have been 100 times longer than it was .
It barely scratched the surface .
I knew when I hit Send that I would be missing stuff , important stuff even ... but I had to cut if off somewhere .
But if I were writing the piece all over again now , I probably would include more references to non-Christian religious atrocities .
Because I am angry about those things .
I am angry about burqas , and clitoridectomies , and women being executed for adultery , and karma / reincarnation being used as a justification for the caste system , and the horribleness -- on both sides -- in Palestine , and the destruction of the ancient Buddha statues in Afghanistan by the Taliban , and the atheist blogger in Iran who commented in my rant that he could be executed for his blogging .
And more .
They just did n't happen to be in the 1 % of things that anger me about religion that made it into my post .
That was a mistake , and I acknowledge that .
All Christians / believers are n't like that .
It 's just a few bad apples .
You 're painting us all with the same brush .
Actually , I 'm not .
I was very , very careful in this post to say " I 'm angry at people who do ( X ) , " or , " I get angry when ( Y ) happens , " or , " I 'm angry about ( Z ) . "
I said that I was angry about specific aspects of religion , specific ways it plays out in the world , specific things people do because of their religion .
I never said that the things I was angry about were universal to all religious beliefs or religious believers .
Not once .
Read the piece carefully .
You 'll see .
But the stuff I 'm angry about is not a case of a few bad apples .
I 'm sorry , but that 's just flat - out wrong .
Do you really think that 55 % of Americans refusing to vote for an atheist is a few bad apples ?
A national public health and sex education policy that 's based on what does and does not make baby Jesus cry ?
The Catholic Church 's official policy of opposing condom distribution , in Africa and everywhere else ?
The fact that until the year I was born , it was the law in many states that atheists could n't vote or hold office or testify in court ?
Those are not bad apples .
That is widespread , systematic religious oppression .
The stuff I 'm angry about is n't universal , but it is not an exception .
It 's depressingly common .
Perhaps you missed the part of my rant that said , " I get angry when believers act as if these offenses are n't important , because ' Not all believers act like that .
I do n't act like that . ' "
The stuff in my rant may not be true for you and your church or enclave or whatever .
But it 's still important , still widespread , and still worth being angry about .
And I still think it 's messed - up to dismiss it as a trivial aspect of religion simply because it is n't universal .
All Christians / believers are n't like that .
That 's not the true faith .
You 're trying to piss me off now , are n't you ?
Did you read the part in my post about the whole " true faith " thing and how messed - up it is ?
Did you read the part about nobody having a pipeline to God , about how you have no more reason to think that you 're practicing religion the way God wants you to than anybody else does ?
Okay .
Deep breaths .
Calm blue ocean , calm blue ocean ...
Look .
The whole " Jesus was a cool guy who just gets misinterpreted by those organized religion fascists " thing is kind of ignoring the actual content of the Gospels .
If you believe that the Gospels are a more or less accurate representation of what Jesus said , then you have to acknowledge that Jesus said some pretty fucked - up things .
Including a whole lot of stuff about how people who did n't believe in him and follow him were going to burn in Hell for eternity .
And again :
You do n't have any more reason to think you have the true faith than any other believer does .
I 've written about this at greater length elsewhere , as it's a topic that particularly frosts my cookies .
You can quote chapter and verse , but so can the people whose interpretation of the faith you disagree with .
That 's sort of the nature of chapter and verse ; it can be used to support just about any interpretation you can come up with .
And besides , see above re :
Even if the way you practice religion is reasonably cool , the fact remains that there are widespread , systematic practices of religion that are n't so cool -- and the fact that you do n't agree with them does n't make them not religion .
How can you be so hateful ?
You 're speaking out against hatred ... and yet you 're so full of hate yourself .
I 'm not .
In this entire 4,650 - word rant , I used the word " hate " exactly three times ... and it was all in one paragraph .
It was the paragraph that said , " I 'm angry that children get taught by religion to hate and fear their bodies and their sexuality .
And I 'm especially angry that female children get taught by religion to hate and fear their femaleness , and that queer children get taught by religion to hate and fear their queerness . "
In the entire rant , the only times that I used the word " hate " was to speak out against it .
I never once in the entire post said that I hated anyone .
I said I was angry .
There 's an enormous difference .
People need religion .
It 's not going anywhere .
You 're crying for the moon .
That 's possible .
But I do n't think we have any way of knowing that yet .
Godlessness has only fairly recently become a remotely acceptable option in human society ( and in much of the world , it still is n't ) .
But we do have one experimental petri dish .
I offer as a counter example : Europe .
Many European nations are now more than half atheist / agnostic .
And those nations seem to do fine .
Better than countries with a high number of believers , in fact .
And while I think the cause and effect actually works the other way around ( greater social health leads to more godlessness , not the other way around ) , the fact that there are flourishing countries with a godless majority puts the kibosh on the whole " religion is a basic human need " theory .
These countries are n't perfect , they have their problems ; but no more than we do in the U.S. , and in many ways a whole lot less .
Besides , I think that the " We educated people do n't need religion , but the great unwashed hoi polloi do " trope is not only untrue , but classist and insulting .
Read this brilliant piece by Ebon Muse on Daylight Atheism about atheist janitors ... and be sure to read the comments from the atheist janitors themselves .
Why do you care what other people believe ?
Um ... I spent 4,650 words explaining why I care .
I care because people 's beliefs lead them to do harm to other people , and to themselves .
I care because far too many believers are n't living and letting live .
I care because the whole " faith trumps evidence " aspect of religion makes it uniquely resistant to self - correction ... and uniquely resistant to dissent .
Of course people are entitled to believe what they want .
It 's a right guaranteed in the Constitution , and it's a right that I treasure passionately .
But nowhere in the Constitution does it say that the right to believe what you want means that nobody should ever argue with you , or point out why they think you 're mistaken .
Somehow , the very good concept of religious tolerance got turned into the very bad concept that nobody should say anything critical of any religion , ever .
Yes , people have a right to not vote for atheists .
They also have a right to not vote for blacks and Jews .
Does that make what they 're doing okay ?
Does that mean that we should n't try to change their minds ?
Does that mean that we should n't be angry about it ?
If you 're so angry , what are you doing about it ?
Mostly , I 'm writing .
I 'm a writer .
That 's what I do .
And I do n't think that 's trivial .
If my writing , and other godless writing , can change people 's minds , or inspire people to speak out and come out of the closet , then that 's not trivial .
I do other things as well .
I donate money .
I write my Congresspeople .
I pay attention to these issues when I vote .
But I totally suck at joining and organizing and anything that involves interacting in person with more than six other people at a time .
I do n't even like parties unless I know half the people there .
I 'm a loner .
I 'm a rebel .
Do n't try to change me , baby .
So mostly , I 'm writing .
I 'm a writer .
That 's what I do .
Atheism is just another religion .
And you 're just as close - minded / faith - based as the believers you criticize .
No , it is n't .
And no , I 'm not .
It simply is n't the case that atheists are 100 % convinced beyond any shadow of a doubt that there is no God .
I 've never once met an atheist who thought that way .
Contrary to popular belief , atheism is n't a faith in the non-existence of God.
Atheism is ... well , it 's somewhat different for different people .
But for most atheists I know , it 's more or less the position that God is an extremely unlikely hypothesis , not supported by evidence or reason ; and that in the absence of any convincing evidence , it 's reasonable to discard it as a hypothesis .
It 's the position that the Christian / Judaic / Muslim God is about as probable as Zeus or Thor… and that if you 're a non-believer in those gods , it makes sense to be a non-believer in Jehovah / Yahweh / Allah , too .
And Buddha , and the Hindu gods , and the Wicca Goddess .
Just while we 're at it .
And it 's simply not the case that I do n't offer any reasons why I do n't believe in God , and that I just take my disbelief on faith .
I 've written extensively about the reasons I do n't believe in God , or a soul , or an afterlife .
You 're welcome to read them if you like ; they 're here , and here and here and here ( that 's a three - part piece ) , and here , and here , and here , and here , and here and here ( a two - parter ) .
And just generally sprinkled throughout my posts and comments on the blog .
As have other writers .
If you want a really good source of " why I think religion is a mistaken and harmful idea about the world " arguments , I suggest you visit the brilliant Ebon Musings website ( sibling site to the equally brilliant Daylight Atheism blog ) .
He has the most thorough , best - argued , most solidly supported collection of arguments against religion that I 've seen , and when people ask me why I do n't believe in God , half the time I just point them to his site .
But give us some good , hard evidence that we 're wrong , and we 'll change our minds .
( Please , though , for the love of all that is beautiful in this world , read Ebon Muse 's Theist 's Guide to Converting Atheists and How Not to Convert an Atheist before you do .
And please remember that Scripture and your personal experience do not count as evidence . )
In other words , I have given reasons why I do n't believe .
I just did n't do it in this post .
Again , I have to say :
If you 're basing your conclusions about my entire life philosophy on one ranty blog post , then is n't that just a little bit silly ?
You would n't be so angry if you just accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior .
Now you 're definitely trying to piss me off .
Okay .
First of all , see above re : me not being angry all the time .
And re : occasional anger being a healthy part of life .
Second :
Do you honestly think I 've never heard this before ?
Do you think that , in my 45 + years on this planet , and my 2 + years of being an atheist blogger , that nobody before has ever said to me , " Everything in your life would improve if you just accepted Jesus Christ as your person savior " ?
Yes , I 've read the Bible ( much of it , anyway ) .
I was a religion major in college , for goodness ' sake .
I 've considered the possibility that Jesus might be my personal savior .
And I 've rejected it .
Please .
Come up with something new .
And third ... do you really think there are no angry Christians in the world ?
I see angry Christians everywhere .
America is full of Christians who are full of anger -- hatred , even -- for homosexuals , feminists , liberals , sex educators , pornographers , and so on .
( In other words ... for me . )
Look at the comments in this blog post .
Look at the person who said I should n't be allowed to vote or serve on juries ; the people who said I was angry because I was a lesbo bulldyke ; the person who said they wished my mother had had an abortion and I should burn in hell .
Christianity is clearly no cure for anger .
Christianity often serves to fan anger 's flame .
Oh , and P.S. : I 'm not a man .
Hence the " being angry about not being able to marry my girlfriend " part .
I 'm just sayin ' , is all .
Tonight : a nice sex post .
I promise .
I wrote this damn rant to get it out of my system and move on , and instead it 's completely taken over my life .
It 's wacky .
As an entrepreneur , you may at times question your sanity : long hours , uncertain outcomes , energy drain on the rest of your life .
And yet you keep on going .
You have to .
The thrill of successfully launching a new endeavor , whether to make a living , a difference in the lives of people , an impact on the health of the planet , or all of the above is too great not to .
And yet , there may be times that nothing ’s coming to you .
You ’re either stuck for a new idea , or having doubts about or missing pieces to what you ’re currently working on .
In steps Springwise .
Springwise is hub for people to share ideas , and is smartly designed for rapid skimming , by category , keyword , and country .
Now , you may say , what ’s new about this ?
There are lots of business and entrepreneurial blogs and publications out there .
Fair enough .
Amsterdam based Springwise puts it well when they say ,
Springwise scans the globe for the most promising business ventures , ideas and concepts that are ready for regional or international adaptation , expansion , partnering , investments or cooperation .
We ferociously track more than 400 global offline and online business resources , as well as taking to the streets of world cities , digital cameras at hand .
They also enlist the eyes and minds of an additional 8000 Springspotters in 70 countries to keep an on the ground perspective on what ’s going on .
What does this look like ?
One idea that stuck out to me is the MyHab .
In the UK , where music festivals and rain are both abundant , they have created temporary shelter that is durable , waterproof , raised , and recyclable .
Rather then have to lug , set up , break down , clean ( or perhaps throw away ) a tent for the festival , you reserve one , similar to a hotel , and can have them visually customized .
Then when you ’re done , you leave , nothing more to do , while MyHab breaks them down and recycles them .
Now it might be said why do n’t they reuse them , but still , this is a step ahead towards reducing waste and increasing the quality of experience for festival goers .
Or you might say “ Hmm , I have an idea to improve upon this service .
I ’ll do it myself , modifying it for the US .
Or help consult with MyHab to further strengthen their offer . ”
The ideas here , no matter the category , seem skewed towards the sustainable and the social ventures .
But there are others that are nonetheless intriguing , like the pedestrian curtain .
Perhaps impractical , but definitely food for thought .

Mr Brown has always telephoned voters , says No 10 Gordon Brown routinely telephones voters at home to talk about Labour policy , Downing Street has confirmed .
The prime minister is understood to ask the No 10 switchboard to put him through to people who have written to him with questions or concerns .
A BBC News website reader has told how Mr Brown called him two months ago to talk about the Iraq war .
Wajid Rafique said the PM apologised on behalf of the government " for what had happened to the people of Iraq " .
' Not expecting reply ' Mr Rafique , 30 , from Nelson , Lancashire , said Mr Brown called him on a Saturday afternoon when he was " still in bed after a late night on Friday " .
The prime minister said he fully understood how I felt , and said he would give his full concentration on the withdrawal the British troops
Wajid Rafique
He said he had written to the prime minister 16 days earlier about the Iraq war but had not been expecting a reply .
" It was a female adviser who I first spoke to who told him she was calling regarding my correspondence to the prime minister , " said Mr Rafique .
" The woman said she was going to connect me to the prime minister .
A few seconds passed and the prime minister came on the phone . "
' On my side '
He said Mr Brown " talked through " the letter he had written and " apologised on behalf of the Labour government for what had happened to the people of Iraq " .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" The prime minister said he fully understood how I felt , and said he would give his full concentration on the withdrawal the British troops . "
After four minutes , Mr Brown brought the conversation with Mr Rafique to a close by saying " how nice it was nice speaking to me " .
" I believed what he said and felt like he was on my side , " added Mr Rafique , who says he is not a Labour voter .
' Keep in touch '
Politicians dating back to US President Jimmy Carter have personally telephoned voters but usually only at election time .
The PM takes a great interest in correspondence that comes in .
He likes to keep in touch with voters who take the trouble to contact him
Downing Street spokesman Mr Brown 's decision to man the phones emerged in trade magazine PR Week , which claimed it was part of a new campaign to " humanise " him in the eyes of voters .
But Number 10 insisted Mr Brown had always phoned voters to discuss Labour policy , even in his days as Chancellor .
" The PM takes a great interest in correspondence that comes in .
He likes to keep in touch with voters who take the trouble to contact him , " said a spokesman .
But according to PR Week , which has run a number of stories from " Downing Street insiders " in recent months , Mr Brown 's strategy chief Stephen Carter came up with the idea as part of a bid to spread " good word of mouth " .
A letter or e-mail would be chosen at random , a response prepared and then Mr Brown would call , the magazine quoted an insider as saying .
It claims the tactic backfired once when Mr Brown , a well - known early riser , called a member of the public at 6 am .
The recipient was , fortunately , a shift worker who happened to be up .
The story has been firmly denied by Downing Street .
Poll slump Former Home Secretary David Blunkett said he thought calling voters at home was good way to stay in touch with their concerns .
He told BBC News : " I would be quite pleased if I were a member of the public and prime minister was on the phone .
Not necessarily very early because I do n't warm to that - but actually listening to people and being able to respond . "
The revelation comes as a new poll suggests Labour 's popularity with voters is lower than during Michael Foot 's leadership in the early 1980s .
The YouGov poll for the Daily Telegraph puts Labour on 23 % - 24 points behind the Conservatives on 47 % .
The Liberal Democrats are on 18 points .

What are these ?
I found this fantastic book last weekend at Ariel :
Unable to read Japanese , any background to this publication remains mysterious .
There are however two URLs in the book that lead to a small amount of information -
One points to some kind of baseball field / publishing house ( ? ) the other to another publisher ’s site .
I think .
Anyway , this is not important , other than to repeat the words we find here :
“ What you see above is n’t a virtual - reality image created on a computer .
It ’s a ‘ Fotomo ’ â€ ” a three - dimensional object you can pick up and hold in your hand . ”
Fans of Pet Architecture - Atelier Bow Wow ’s study of Tokyo ’s vernacular architecture - will find instant gratification here .
It is essentially a do it yourself model making kit for that excellent piece of research .
There are street scenes , tiny buildings , crowded corners , a photomart , vending machines .
So , Sunday night in front of the telly was spent making up a couple of the scenes .
There are still a whole lot to make , so I might try to post more next week …
This link to the Japanese Amazon store will lead you to similar books in the series that you can buy .
At first glance , the prohibition planned at the soon - to - debut city pool seems to suit Kanab .
After all , this is the same southern Utah town that embraced the " natural - family resolution " with its conservative call for breadwinning husbands and homemaking wives to rear a " full quiver of children . "

Everex Cloudbook Max Asus is n’t the only company looking preparing to launch a second generation low - cost ultraportable .
While Asus is building on the success of the Eee PC 701 , you could argue that Everex is building on the failure of the Everex Cloudbook which has n’t gained the traction the Eee PC has .
But the Cloudbook Max does look like quite an improvement over the original Cloudbook , and might actually be worth considering .

A team led by MIT students this week successfully tested a prototype of what may be the most cost - efficient solar power system in the world — one team members believe has the potential to revolutionize global energy production .
The system consists of a 12 - foot - wide mirrored dish that team members have spent the last several weeks assembling .
The dish , made from a lightweight frame of thin , inexpensive aluminum tubing and strips of mirror , concentrates sunlight by a factor of 1,000 — creating heat so intense it could melt a bar of steel .
To demonstrate the system 's power , Spencer Ahrens , who just received his master 's in mechanical engineering from MIT , stood in a grassy field on the edge of the campus this week holding a long plank .
Slowly , he eased it into position in front of the dish .
Almost instantly there was a big puff of smoke , and flames erupted from the wood .
Success !
Video : David ChandlerBurning sticks is not what this dish is really for , of course .
Attached to the end of a 12 - foot - long aluminum tube rising from the center of the dish is a black - painted coil of tubing that has water running through it .
When the dish is pointing directly at the sun , the water in the coil flashes immediately into steam .
Someday soon , Ahrens hopes , the company he and his teammates have founded , called RawSolar , will produce such dishes by the thousands .
They could be set up in huge arrays to provide steam for industrial processing , or for heating or cooling buildings , as well as to hook up to steam turbines and generate electricity .
Once in mass production , such arrays should pay for themselves within a couple of years with the energy they produce .
" This is actually the most efficient solar collector in existence , and it was just completed , " says Doug Wood , an inventor based in Washington state who patented key parts of the dish 's design — the rights to which he has signed over to the student team .
Wood credits the students who built this dish , as an independent project that started in January , with making significant improvements to his original design to make it a practical and competitive energy producer .
" They really have simplified this and made it user - friendly , so anybody can build it , " he says .
One of the keys to making an inexpensive design was something Wood discovered by accident as he built a variety of solar dishes over the years : Smaller really is better .
Unlike many technologies where economies of scale dictate large sizes , a smaller dish requires so much less support structure that it ends up costing only a third as much , for a given collecting area .
MIT Sloan School of Management lecturer David Pelly , in whose class this project first took shape last fall , says that , " I 've looked for years at a variety of solar approaches , and this is the cheapest I 've seen .
And the key thing in scaling it globally is that all of the materials are inexpensive and accessible anywhere in the world .
" Pelly adds that " I 've looked all over for solar technology that could scale without subsidies .
Almost nothing I 've looked at has that potential .
This does .
" The team , led by Ahrens , also includes Micah Sze ( Sloan MBA '08 ) , UC Berkeley graduate and Broad Institute engineer Eva Markiewicz , Olin College student Matt Ritter and MIT materials science student Anna Bershteyn .
Various other students also helped out over the course of the semester .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. telephone companies that took part in President George W. Bush ’s warrantless domestic spying program could be shielded from billions of dollars in lawsuits under a electronic spy bill finalized on Thursday by congressional and White House negotiators .
A telephone is seen in an undated file photo .
REUTERS / Catherine Benson
Under the measure , federal courts would determine if the evidence supports protection of companies from civil liability .
They would be able to dismiss a suit if there is written certification that the White House asked a company to participate and assured it of the legality of the warrantless surveillance that Bush secretly began after the September 11 attacks .
With legal action pending against major telecommunications companies , House Republican Whip Roy Blunt said courts will make the call but predicted , “ The lawsuits will be dismissed . ”
The bill would provide the most sweeping overhaul of U.S. spy powers in decades .
In addition to court review of lawsuits , it would increase judicial and congressional oversight of U.S. intelligence activities and bolster protection of civil liberties -- but not as much as some advocates would like .
A vote on the bipartisan bill was set for Friday in the Democratic - led House of Representatives , which was expected to approve it overwhelmingly .
It would then be sent to the Democratic - led Senate , which is expected to give it final congressional approval next week and send it to Bush to sign into law .
“ It ’s a balanced bill , ” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , a California Democrat .
She did not say how she would vote , however .
“ I could argue it either way , ” she told reporters .
“ The bill meets the standards the president called for , ” said White House spokesman Tony Fratto .
“ We encourage members of both parties to pass it . ”
House Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer , a chief negotiator of the measure , said , “ This bipartisan bill balances the needs of our intelligence community with Americans ’ civil liberties , and provides critical new oversight and accountability .
But Sen. Christopher Dodd , a Connecticut Democrat , denounced the measure as “ deeply flawed . ”
“ The president should not be above the rule of law , nor should the telecommunications companies who supported his quest to spy on American citizens , ” Dodd said .
CRITICS ACCUSE BUSH
Critics charged Bush violated the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in authorizing warrantless surveillance after the September 11 attacks .
Bush maintains he had the wartime power to do it .
He put the program under FISA jurisdiction last year .
Terms remain secret .
The new bill would replace a temporary law that expired in February that expanded U.S. power to conduct surveillance of foreign targets without court approval .
Law - abiding
Americans were also swept up in surveillance , particularly if they came in contact with these targets .
About 40 civil lawsuits have been filed accusing AT&T Inc , Verizon Communications Inc and Sprint Nextel Corp of violating Americans ’ privacy rights .
Damages could total billions of dollars .
Some Democratic lawmakers along with civil liberties groups have opposed shielding phone companies from lawsuits , saying the courts should first determine what the companies did .
But Bush and others have argued that these companies should be thanked , not punished , for agreeing to help protect the United States .
The bill would amend FISA , which requires the government receive secret - court approval to conduct surveillance on foreign targets in the United States .
As part of any bill to update FISA , Bush had demanded retroactive immunity for phone companies .
The Senate agreed to provide such immunity , but House Democratic leaders refused to even bring the Senate bill up for a vote in their chamber , forcing a compromise .
“ Democrats obtained some concessions from the White House , but unfortunately the bill continues to allow unconstitutionally broad access to untold numbers of private international e-mails and phone calls of American residents and businesses , ” said Lisa Graves , deputy director of the Center for National Security Studies , a Washington watchdog group .

Is this what it is going to be like ?
When simple possession of a proscribed document will be enough to see you clapped in irons and whisked down to the local police station ?
About two weeks ago ( May 16 ) , Nottingham University campus was agog as police arrived to interview former student Hicham Yezza .
After some ten years ' study , first as undergraduate , then graduate , Hicham was a non-academic member of staff in one of the University departments .
His mistake was to agree to help Rizwaan Sabir , a friend in the Politics faculty , who needed a document downloaded from the web and printed off .
This was all part of legitimate study : the document itself was on the Politics Faculty reading list .
Unfortunately , the document in question also happened to be an al - Qaeda Training Manual .
Someone noticed .
They informed their superiors , who in turn referred the matter on upward .
Eventually , the issue reached the very top .
The Vice - Chancellor , Registrar and senior management of the University decided it was beyond them .
They owed a duty of care to all their students .
The implications behind the download were too large .
So they handed the matter over to the local Police .
Which is where we came in .
Rizwaan Sabir and Hicham Yezza were arrested .
Their homes were searched , laptops confiscated , friends interviewed .
They were subjected to six days of questioning - and then released .
Or at least , Sabir was released .
Hicham ’s story now takes a turn for the decidedly worse .
He is – he was – in the process of applying for indefinite leave to remain in the UK .
The focus of the inquiry shifted to the possibility that he had been less than truthful in his application to stay .
So he was re-arrested under the Immigration Act and moved directly to a detention centre .
From there , he is due to be deported back to Algeria this Sunday .
According to the Nottingham University Students ’ Union , the deportation was originally scheduled for mid-July , but it has been brought forward as an “ emergency ” .
As the Police appear not to have wished to charge Hicham with anything in connection with the original investigation , it is not clear what the emergency could be .
Unless he hears back from the Home Office , or is successful in being granted a judicial review of the decision today , Hicham will be sent back without having had the chance to argue his side of the matter in open court .
The story itself is staggering : from long - term settled resident , to deportee , within two weeks .
But there are some features that may be worth pondering .
The die was cast when the University authorities decided not to investigate , but instead to pass the matter on to the Police .
Was that the right decision ?
The only real grounds they had for suspecting anything to be amiss was the downloading of a book .
Of course , this very fact is now grounds for arrest .
Under s.58 of the Terrorism Act 2000 , a person commits an offence if they “ possesses a document or record containing information ” … “ of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism ” .
The apparent breadth of this formula was seriously narrowed in February of this year , when the Court of Appeal ruled that simple possession could not be enough for a conviction .
There had to be demonstrable intent to commit terrorist acts as well .
Nonetheless , the University authorities will argue – they have argued – that they had no right to take any other decision .
Many have disagreed .
The role of the police is equally interesting .
Supt Simon Nickless from Nottinghamshire Police claimed this operation was low - key , and the community 's response to it had been " calm and rational " .
In truly Orwellian style , he added : " Feedback is that people accept that this is the sort of operation that is necessary and reasonable for the welfare of communities . "
Nonetheless , there remain concerns , raised by supporters of Hicham , that the police focus was prompted very much by the ethnicity of the suspect .
Perhaps the last word should go to Alan Simpson , MP for Nottingham South .
He described the original arrest as a “ dreadful cock - up ” .
The subsequent deportation was a blatant attempt “ to try to justify the abuse of that power under the Terrorism Act .
If we allow this to be done in our name , in our silent collusion , we become the architects of our own totalitarianism .
We live in fear of speaking openly .
We live in fear of enquiring and researching openly ...
We live in fear of the quiet unannounced knock on the door and we live in fear of our own shallowness , in terms of the willingness to stand side - by - side with each other in order to defend the very basis of an open democracy that we claim that terrorism is a threat to . "
Update : The Home Office has cancelled removal directions to have Hicham Yezza deported on Sunday following an application in the High Court .
His solicitors will return to the High Court this afternoon to seek to have him released while his case is reconsidered .
David Smith , solicitor at Cartwright King , said : " We hope and trust that the Home Office will now release Mr Yezza and reconsider his case properly and in accordance with the law . " ®
DPS swamped after requests for handgun permits rise 39 %
Texas caught off guard as more seek handgun permits
Some point to anti-gun politics as applications rise 39 percent and swamp the state
AUSTIN — Demand for concealed handgun licenses has risen nearly 40 percent in Texas in a year , an increase being attributed to many factors , even presidential politics .
Though the exact cause may be unclear , what 's certain is that the spike in applications has caught the Department of Public Safety unprepared .
The state is taking a month longer than the 60 days allowed by law to process original applications and 80 days longer on renewals , which are supposed to be handled within 45 days .
" We 're trying really hard , but there have been delays because of the tremendous increase in applications , " said Tela Mange , a DPS spokeswoman .
She said the department is paying overtime and hiring temporary workers to reduce the backlog .
Mange said she does n't know why applications last month were 39 percent higher than they were in April 2007 .
But Ross Bransford , who trains 1,000
Texans a year to qualify for a concealed handgun license , said he believes the looming 2008 election is a big factor .
" People are not sure what 's going to happen after the election , " said Bransford , who owns Austin - based CHL - Texas.com .
" Both Democratic candidates are anti-gun in one fashion or another . "
He said Sen. Barack Obama , who is leading the race for the nomination , is a " friend of ( Democratic Senator ) Ted Kennedy , and that scares everybody to death . "
Other instructors mentioned an increased interest from young adults after last year 's Virginia Tech massacre and recent changes in Texas law about carrying concealed weapons .
In 2007 , lawmakers granted privacy to the 258,000 license holders by closing records that had been public since the concealed handgun law passed in 1995 .
They also extended the so - called " castle doctrine " defense to persons who use a gun to protect their vehicles , in addition to their homes .
45 minutes on hold
She said some have been put on hold for 45 minutes when they called DPS to inquire about their licenses .
" They are really quite alarmed and annoyed , " Tripp said .
" They sat on hold , and had gotten no answers . "
Last month , she took her group 's concerns to a meeting with DPS officials , Gov. Rick Perry 's legislative director Ken Armbrister and House Law Enforcement Chairman Joe Driver .
Driver , R - Garland , is demanding weekly reports from DPS on license applications .
During the week that ended Friday , DPS said it processed 1,043 original and renewal applications but received 1,871 requests .
" I was very surprised at how far behind they are , " Tripp said .
Renewal every 5 years
She said she can't understand why it is taking so long for renewals , because people with handgun licenses are continually checked against criminal databases and other records .
Licenses must be renewed every five years .
" If you find yourself subject to a protective order , someone will knock on your door and take your license , " she said .
Mange urged license applicants to use the DPS Web site to enter basic information required on the permit .
Tripp said her members who have used the Web site tell her it does not speed the process .
Tripp said there is no grace period for expired handgun licenses .
Everyone seeking a license , and certain renewals , must take classes that cover safety , state law and conflict resolution .
They must submit fingerprints , which DPS sends to the FBI for a background check , and a photo .
They must carry their license when they carry a concealed handgun .
There are some restrictions as to where concealed handguns can be carried in Texas .
Applicant 's suspicions
Ron Freeman , a CPA who lives in Wimberley , said he was asked twice to redo fingerprints that were taken at a local constable 's office .
He finally agreed to DPS ' suggestion that he use an electronic fingerprint device run by a private company .
" I have a feeling that the Department of Public Safety is using the process as a filter to keep people from even having a gun , " said Freeman , 60 , who moved to Texas from Arizona last year .
Marsha McCartney , who represents the North Texas Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence , said she was surprised to learn that so many more Texans are applying to carry guns .
However , McCartney said she is more concerned about an expected battle in the next legislative session over whether the law should be changed to allow college students to carry guns on campus .

SEO stands for search engine optimization : the process of increasing a website 's rank on all major search engines , leading to increased website traffic and sales conversion .
With more and more people using the Internet to find products , information , and services , it is vital for businesses to make their presence known on the Internet .
While Search Engine Marketing can be very easy to explain , it is a very complex and time consuming process to execute .
As a basic overview , the process starts by completing a website analysis and competition analysis so that unique coding based around a set of keyword phrases can be developed .
Finding the right keywords for specific industries or markets requires that they not only to be industry specific but also target consumers in " buying mode " .
The reason for this is to get a higher conversion from search traffic to sales traffic .
This is important because it increases a company 's ROI ( return on investment ) .
The next step in SEO Marketing is to integrate the coding into the website .
After this is accomplished , it is time to increase the website 's popularity .
This is done by creating links pointing to the website from other clean , quality websites .
This takes time , not only to make the links , but for the links to mature and make a difference in the eyes of the major search engines .
While this is going on , a company can utilize pay per click ( PPC ) advertising to get some quick traffic boosts .
Hiring an SEO Company can make all the difference in the world for a company as most business owners do n't have the time or experience to experiment with SEO enough to start making headway .
Organic SEO is all about creating natural traffic , better known as organic traffic .
Organic traffic is , by far , the best way to increase traffic and sales conversions long term .
This is the ultimate goal of all SEO Marketing campaigns , as it requires less money to advertise and it returns more sales than a PPC campaign could hope to produce .
With Organic SEO , having a user friendly , easy to navigate website is king .
This helps on two fronts .
First , it allows the visitor to easily browse the website with little confusion .
Second , it allows the search engine spiders to better crawl the website which can help the website 's rankings .
Good content is also a key factor .
Creating content that is attention grabbing and inspiring will keep a potential client longer on the website and in turn drive more sales .
What is Affordable SEO ?
Many SEO companies that claim to have really low prices may end up hurting a company 's reputation in the end .
Companies that charge far less than the competitive price point may not be paying their employees well , are outsourcing overseas , or may not even be in the United States at all .
While not being based in the United States is not bad in and of itself , when English is not their native language it requires due diligence to check for grammar , spelling , syntax , or culture errors .
On the other hand , SEO companies that are charging far above the competitive price point makes one wonder , what exactly are they spending their money on ?

Microsoft withdrawing its offer to buy Yahoo is a sufficiently large story to demonstrate the problem of redundant news content on the web .
Google News is currently tracking about 2,000 versions of this story .
To get a better sense of why it ’s a problem to have 2,000 stories about the SAME THING , I ’ve reproduced about ten percent of them below — just the headlines and ledes .
If you have the stomach to scroll through them all to see what else I have to say about it , check out the sources as you scroll :
UPDATE : The Google News example is reproduced here instead .
You ’re reading this in RSS or email a day after I posted it because this post was so large it broke my Feedburner feed .
Too much content breaks the web — there you have it .
Keep reading for my original argument .
If you ’ve made it this far , you may have noticed the absence of blogs from the sources .
So this is far from a representative sample of all of the websites that published a version of this news story .
Let ’s check out Techmeme , again reproduced in its entirety , because seeing is disbelieving :

We all know how this happened , of course .
All of the print publications , including non-niche pubs like the Washington Post , have to create a version of this story for their print publication , and then dump that story on the web .
All of the web - native tech sites , competing tooth and nail for page views , are all obligated to publish at least one if not multiple takes on this story .
Then there are all the sites that reproduced the wire version of the story .
If each site were , as in print , an island unto itself , this would make sense — if the news outlet did not cover the story then its readers might not know about it .
But seen as a whole on the web , which connects each and every one of these websites , and especially seen through the lens of an aggregator like Google News or Techmeme , this huge mass of content about the same story does n’t make much economic sense .
I am purposely choosing not to write about the story itself , finding it much more interesting to make this meta - observation , but if I had chosen to write about it , I could have reduced the economic value of every other version of the story .
Why ?
Because there is a zero sum game for attention on this story .
Even tech insiders will read a finite number of stories .
If I put my version in the mix , for each time mine gets read , someone else ’s does n’t .
So each version of the story reduces that marginal economic value of all the others .
Here ’s another way to look at it .
Imagine a Midwest city where a factory that is a major employer announces that it is shutting down .
Now imagine that instead of one local newspaper and one local TV station covering this story instead there are 100 newspapers and 50 TV stations .
Reporters from each of these outlets file their coverage of the story .
Newsstands in the local Walmart display all 100 newspapers , each with the factory closing story on the cover .
Anyone who turns on their TV station can flip channels at 6 pm and find the same story being reported , over and over again .
Yes , that ’s a silly example , but is it really all that different from what ’s happening on the web ?
Can you imagine a content economy five or ten years from now that supports 2,000 versions of the same story ?
Is it any surprise that the company that creates far and away the most economic value on the web produces NO ORIGINAL CONTENT ?
( Yes , that would be Google . )
Here ’s the takeaway for original content creators : BE ORIGINAL
That means when you consider publishing an original news item , be aware of the larger marketplace for that news .
If it ’s hugely competitive , consider allocating your limited reporting resources elsewhere , and instead find other ways to create value around the story , as the Seattle Times did :
Imagine how much more value local media brands , for example , might create if they did any one or more of the above rather than publish yet another commodity version of the story .
Practicing link journalism could leave more time for original reporting that ISN ’T being done by other news organizations .
( Of course , the Seattle Times still publishes a print edition , so they had to have their print coverage .
And Microsoft is a local story for them , so the original reporting is a rational allocation of resources . )
Here ’s the other takeaway : Do n’t add to the noise , help reduce it .
An engineer who works on Google News said during a presentation at the NewsTools conference that Google is studing whether the amount of news on the web is actually decreasing .
So while there ’s more content on the web , there may be less news .
Final takeaway : Do n’t contribute to the commodification of news on the web .
